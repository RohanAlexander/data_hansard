2,Mr SPEAKER,CLERK OF THE HOUSE,"I inform the House that the Governor General in Council has agreed to my recommendation and appointed Mr Ian Harris, Deputy Clerk of the House, to be Clerk of the House of Representatives from 27 July 1997. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee",13
3,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"Menzies) (12.31 p.m.)On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present committee's report entitled Aspects of section 44 of the Australian Constitution, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",13
4,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEES,"Section 44 of the Ausralian constitution is known to all members of both this House and the other place. We NA Hansard 1997 (FIFTH PERIOD) 1997, pursuant to resolution, adjourned to to that resolution the House of Representamay not know it in all its intricacies of meaning, but we do know to be aware of this troublesome section. I suspect that many members on both sides had some sympathy for Philip Cleary when the High Court, acting as the Court of Disputed Returns, found he was disqualified because he had an office of profit under the Crown, which is prohibited by subsection 44(iv). The office in question was that of a Victorian state secondary school teacher, although Mr Cleary had been on leave without pay for many months prior to standing for election to parliament. The purpose of section 44 is to protect Australia's parliamentary system by disqualifying candidates and members of parliament who are at risk of allowing conflicts of loyalty to affect their performance as members. All members of the committee wholeheartedly support the purpose of the section. Report The risks have not become less immediate. We are convinced that, in a rapidly changing world, the importance of protecting the the integrity of the parliament has become more rather than less urgent. However, the archaic language in which the section is expressed is a serious hindrance to ensuring that it will continue to protect this parliament and hence national sovereignty. The committee's task was to report on the operation of two subsections-subsections (i) and (iv). Subsection 44(i) provides for the disqualification of persons with a foreign citizenship or with various other attachments to a foreign power. Subsection 44(iv) disqualifies those who hold any office of profit under the Crown or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) also asked the committee to consider the exception to subsection 44(iv), which is set out in the last paragraph of section 44. This excludes certain classes of office holders, including ministers of state, from the disqualification subsection 44(iv). The committee was asked to report on action, including constitutional amendment, legislative or executive action, to address any identified problems relating to the operation of subsections 44(i) and (iv). The wording of the terms of reference recognises that, given the difficulties of ensuring a favourable outcome at a referendum, all other avenues for alleviating the problems inherent in the two subsections should be explored. The committee is well aware of the difficulty of achieving constitutional change, even where one might expect bipartisan support for the proposal in a referendum bill. The results of our explorations for administrative and/or legislative remedies were not encouraging. The report contains a short chapter on possible administrative approaches to some of the difficulties posed by the two subsections, but we recognise that administrative measures will not cure the essential difficulties. The committee also considered that almost any legislative proposal to address the difficulties inherent in section 44 would run a serious risk of being found to be outside the spirit of the section by the High Court. While the committee addresses some legislative approaches, they are really complementary to constitutional amendment. I will now move on to some of the detail of the report. We found that the most challenging aspect of the inquiry was dealing with the many difficult issues inherent in subsection 44(i). The problems include the archaic expressions used in the section, which was drafted before there was any concept of Australian citizenship. Unfortunately, we found that the difficulties in subsection 44(i) cannot be solved by merely modernising the language. One of the problematic issues of the inquiry was the operation of subsection 44(i) in the context of a multicultural society-which Australia is today. The exclusion from federal parliament of persons who have dual or multiple citizenship caused a number of difficulties for the committee. Some members thought it morally offensive that the constituin tion excludes Australia's many dual citizens from full participation in the political process. The number of people in the class of dual citizens is not known with precision but is estimated to be some five million Australians. They cover a wide range of circumstances. Many have no idea they are citizens of another country. They may have inherited a citizenship from a grandparent who they never knew came from another country. Others may have no interest in keeping a foreign citizenship, but the steps provided in the law of the relevant foreign country for renunciation of its citizenship may be difficult, protracted, uncertain or expensive. Where no steps for renunciation are prescribed, the High Court has stated in the case of Sykes v. Cleary that candidates taking 'reasonable steps' to renounce a foreign citizenship would satisfy the requirements of subsection (i). On the surface, this appears to make it easier for candidates where the a foreign citizen is from foreign country with no prescribed steps for renunciation. In fact, it may not be so simple as one might think because there is not yet any judicial opinion as to what constitutes reasonable steps. Members of the committee wrestled with this and other practical difficulties in relation to subsection (i). Our recommendation on subsection 44(i) is that there should be a referendum to delete the subsection and to replace it with a new provision requiring candidates to this parliament to be Australian citizens. The committee notes that this conclusion has been reached by others, including the 1988 Constitutional Commission and the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 1996 federal election. There would have to be further constitutional amendments to empower parliament to enact legislation determining the grounds for disqualification of members of parliament in relation to foreign allegiance. On the question of whether dual citizens should be able to be candidates or members of parliament, committee members, not surprisingly, held a range of views. Some members who hold the personal view that dual citizens should be accepted as candidates and members considered that dual citizenship would, nevertheless, be considered an electoral disadvantage. While the report canvasses issues relating to dual citizenship and membership of the legislature, it does not draw any conclusion. Such a departure from the status quo should be debated, in the opinion of the committee, by members of this parliament. While the committee is convinced that only constitutional amendment can address the problems caused by subsection (i), we do make some recommendations proposing administrative actions. These are aimed at helping intending candidates to recognise some of the potential problems. Turning briefly to subsection (iv), which deals with another type of potential conflict of interest or loyalty-office of profit under the Crown-the committee again recommends that only constitutional amendment can get to the root of the problems in this section. The committee recommends that subsection (iv) be deleted and replaced by new provisions which address uncertainties and perceived inequities in the current subsection. The key to the proposed new provisions is that there should be differing times at which various office holders should relinquish their office. The differences should reflect the political sensitivity and public profile of the particular office of profit under the Crown. We believe there should be three categories of office holder. Because of the rapidly changing nature of public employment, the constitution should deal only with the most sensitive of the three categories of office holder-those holding offices which must be - rotected from political controversy at all tImes. The offices to be included in the remaining two categories should be determined by parliament from time to time. The most stringent provisions should apply to persons holding a judicial office under the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or a state or territory. The committee considers that such persons should be required by the constitution to resign from office before nominating for election to the federal parliament. For other than judicial officers, the committee considers that there should be two categories of public sector employees. Members of the first group should be deemed to have vacated their offices should they nominate for election. This group should include those persons whose position is incompatible with being a candidate for the federal parliament. Such persons might include secretaries to Commonwealth departments, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Other office holders should not be required to vacate their offices simply because they are candidates. They should be deemed to have vacated their offices upon election to the Senate or House of Representatives. Most public servants would fall into this category. There are various other matters which have been raised in the report which I am sure will be of interest to all members. There is not time to address them all here today. Before concluding my remarks, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their contributions during the inquiry and production of the report. The best traditions of parliamentary committee work were evident during this inquiry, with members from both sides of politics working together to develop sensible solutions to problems. Our thanks also go to the committee secretariat, particularly to Kathryn Cole, the inquiry secretary, and to Judy Middlebrook, the committee secretary. I commend the report to the House.",13
5,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has today tabled a report recommending that section 44 of the constitution be changed to allow dual citizens to stand for parliament. This is, of course, the provision under which the High Court disqualified Labor candidate, Bill Kardamitsis, and Liberal candidate, John Delacretaz, in the court case which followed the Wills by-election in 1992. Having heard a great deal of evidence on this issue and having considered all the alternative options, we believe there is no satisfactory alternative to a referendum change the constitution. The committee has recommended that the present subsection 44(i) be deleted, to be replaced by a requirement that all candidates and members of parliament be Australian citizens. The committee has recommended that at the same time parliaa ment would enact legislation which would disqualify members of parliament who did not have a primary loyalty to Australia. While some people will take the view that this legislation should require dual citizens take all possible steps to renounce Australian citizenship, my view, and that of a number of other committee members, is that it is sufficient for the legislation to prohibit Australian MPs exercising any rights under the law of a foreign power or to advance the interests of a foreign power to the detriment of the Australian national interest. We always talk about the way in which committees try to function in a bipartisan way, but I believe the lengths that the committee has gone to to achieve consensus on this occasion are truly extraordinary. To be candid, there is no doubt that some committee members believe that dual citizenship presents a problem for parliamentarians. Others believe, equally strongly, that it does not. rather than getting down to majority and minority reports, which would certainly be basis for achieving constitutional change, we have come up with a clear proposal for change-to delete subsection 44(i) place it with a requirement for Australian citizenship, with the problem of divided loyalties being dealt with by legislation, where we have also given the government very clear signposts. We have also recommended that subsection 44(iv) be deleted and different provisions placed in the constitution. The basic intent these provisions will be to allow public different servants-teachers being the best known example in the light of the Cleary case-to stand for election without having to resign their employment. If they are elected, their public service position is automatically declared vacant. If they are not elected, they can return to their former position. This proposal recognises that it is unfair that public servants to should have to resign their positions merely to contest an election. In many cases they are not going to be successful, but that should not prevent them from standing. Secondly, it observes that in some jurisdictions, such as Victoria and Western Australia, similar problem has been resolved by similar deeming arrangements. For some positions, however, particularly judges, the committee took the view that something more was required and that a judge should not be to able to contest an election without resigning their nonhis or her position. I call on the Liberal government to put these issues to a referendum. It is regrettable that the government has squibbed the issue of a republic by calling off the vote for the national convention it promised prior to the election. It should reinstate that vote as a compulsory attendance vote-just as Australians usually vote-and use this opportunity to rectify outdated sections of the constitution which were revealed by the High Court's decision in Sykes and Cleary back in 1992. Let me also join with the chairman in thanking the committee staff, Kathryn Cole and Judy Middlebrook, for their efforts.",15
6,Mr SINCLAIR,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Initially I would like to extend my congratulations to Mr Ian Harris on his no appointment as Clerk of the House of Representatives. It is a very distinctive and important office, and I am delighted that the anand renouncement has been so made. In the few minutes I have I want to say a few things with respect to the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Aspects of section 44 of the Australian Constitution. The first is that, demonstrably, time and circumstances have changed and the of concepts embodied in section 44 have a bearing than they did at the time the Australian constitution was adopted, in particular that with respect to citizenship, which is embodied in 44(i). It has a different context because of the degree to which at that stage there were aliens and there were others. The nature, however, of the obligation I think in the minds of most Australians continues. Predominantly, people want their representative in parliament to be an Australian citizen. In our report we have attempted to provide for that. I disagreed totally with the concepts the honourable member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) mentioned in suggesting that in some way the government has squibbed in its obligation to conduct a constitutional convention. Rather, I think his remarks demonstrate the problems there are in constitutional change, for what we sought was to probe the degree to which there was support for constitutional change with respect to a republic. I think how the convention is constituted is entirely irrelevant. To my mind the important thing, however, in relation to section 44 is that there has agreement within the committee and our recommendations attempt within the two principal questions referred to the committee-that on citizenship and, secondly, that on office of profit under the Crown-to come to what we believe are reasonable changes. The difficulty in the recommendations of course lies in the extent to which there would be unanimity in the community and the capacity to persuade the electorate at large to agree to such a constitutional change. The recommendations that we have made with respect to citizenship need to be identified with the qualifications in recommendation 2; that is, we empower parliament to enact legislation determining the grounds of disqualification of members of parliament in relation to foreign allegiance. So many have dual citizenship and are not sure how to dispose of that dual citizenship. Indeed, as been referred to by the chair of the committee, many are not even aware that they are dual citizens. With respect to recommendation 5, the number of members of parliaments who hold executive offices should be limited, I must admit I find myself in disagreement with the committee. I do not believe that we can set under the constitution a maximum of 20 per cent of the total membership of the parliament. I believe that to be outside the terms of reference of this particular committee, and I do not see any reason to lay down a prescribed percentage. The point is that the maximum laid down may be taken as the obligatory number, and I believe that a smaller government is better than a large one. With respect to the other recommendations, there is a real concern with respect to section 44(iv). We have attempted to cover that with recommendation 3. I worry whether or not the form we have now prescribed is adequate, although we must distinguish under the constitution a person holding a judicial office because to do otherwise would transgress the provisions for the separation of powers. It is recommended under recommendation 3, however, that certain other public offices specified by the parliament would be automatically declared vacant if the occupant of been such an office were elected to the Senate or the House of Representatives. I think with common sense that would achieve that end. Like other members, I would like to commend the chair and the deputy chair and in particular the committee secretariat-Kathryn Cole, the inquiry secretary, and Judy Middlebrook, the committee secretary-for what I believe is a very good analysis of what is without doubt a very significant constitutional problem.",16
7,Mr MCCLELLAND,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs indeed recognised in its report entitled Aspects of section 44 of the Australian Constitution a constitutional problem and the extent of that problem. The committee was unanimous in appreciating the significance of section 44(i) of the constitution in that it has protects our parliamentary system from those who have or might have, or even can be perceived to have, a conflict of loyalty between their country of origin and Australia. We were unanimous in the view that that potential conflict was not helpful at all and indeed could be damaging to our democratic process. At the same time, as has been noted, the language of section 44(i) is archaic and that in itself creates some problems. In 1901 there was no such thing as an Australian citizen. We did not exist in a formal sense until 1949, with the introduction of the Australian Citizenship Act. The thrust of the committee's report in terms of recommending changes to section 44(i) is to fundamentally base the criteria on Australian citizenship and to recommend other legislative protections to exempt those who have the potential for a conflict of loyalty. At the same time we recognise the real problems that exist with the present structure and the fact that as many as five million people could be disadvantaged in seeking election to this parliament. I do not think any of us would say that a person's country of origin should deprive anyone who is genuinely committed to Australia of having a chance to have their say in the government of the nation. Similarly, we were unanimous in recognising the principle behind section 44(iv), which is based on the concept of separation of powers and avoiding a situation where candidates for parliament are beholden to the executive as a result of their office or the remuneration they receive from the government quarter. At the same time, we noted that it could again disadvantage certain candidates. In my own circumstances in the last contest for the federal seat of Barton the preselected candidate for the Liberal Party in fact withdrew because of the complications that could have been created by his employment with the New South Wales State Rail Authority. That is regrettable because he would have been a very good candidate. The other problem which we recognised is the hardship that can be caused to some, particularly senators, because of the period between election and actually taking office. My own father is a good example of that. He was elected to the Senate in 1961 and may not have achieved that office had it not been for a chance meeting with Sir Garfield Barwick in the men's room in the Commonwealth offices in Phillip Street. Sir Garfield Barwick, having noted that my father had preselection, said to him, 'What are you going to do in the gap between election and assuming office?' My father said, 'What's the problem?' Sir Garfield Batwick explained the problem to him. Of course, my father obtained further advice, which proved to be absolutely correct in light of Cleary's case. It is not good enough to simply withdraw to an unpaid position. But, if it had not been for that chance meeting with Sir Garfield Barwick, my father's history may well have been different. The committee, having noted those problems, has in a genuine bipartisan sense attempted to achieve a process that will remove some of those chronic problems but at the same time retain the principles. In closing, the committee secretariat were really first class. They were as good as any I have seen in private industry, whether that be legal or the business sector.",17
8,Mr BARRESI,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and as one who is affected by aspects of section 44 of the Australian constitution, I had more than a passing interest in this inquiry. We would all be aware of the troublesome sections relating to dual citizenship and office of profit. There is no disputing the intent of section 44. All Australians would agree that a member of parliament should have total and undivided loyalty to our nation and its institutions. In an open and democratic system of government, the challenge becomes one of how we ensure that our citizens all have the ability to achieve parliamentary office as well as to maintain the integrity of the parliament itself. In a number of recent cases, section 44 brought into question issues of allegiance, loyalty and commitment. The current problems stem from the archaic language used in section 44, particularly section 44(i), which I will principally address. It was written at the tum of the century when allegiance to God, king and country reigned supreme and we had only three classes of citizens: Australian born, British and the rest were thrown into a general classification entitled 'aliens'. In the last 97 years the community has adapted, but the constitution has not. Unfortunately, the answer is not a matter of simply modernising the language. It stems from problems of renunciation with those who are entitled to dual citizenship. The problem is that renunciation must take place in accordance with foreign law. However, there is no judicial opinion on what might constitute reasonable steps, as prescribed by the High Court in the Sykes v. Cleary case. These Australians are no less committed and loyal to their new country as those who come from countries who do not have dual citizenship. It may surprise many in this country, particularly those who espouse an Australian cultural cleansing policy based on race and now religion, that dual citizenship nations are essentially non-Asian-the United Kingdom and the United States to name just two. According to estimates, up to five million Australians are dual citizens-about a quarter of Australia's population. In this parliament alone we currently have 30 members of parliament who were born in a foreign country. Twenty-five of those members are from countries with dual citizenship. Each member is making their contribution-despite political affiliation, race or religion-to a better Australia. In saying this, the committee was firmly of the opinion that the intent of section 44 remains but the integrity of the parliamentary system must be upheld. First and foremost, allegiance must be to Australia. Candidates and members of parliament must be Australian citizens. Until such time as the recommended constitutional amendmentsspoken about by previous speakers--can be presented to the Australian people, administrative steps which involve the Australian Electoral Commission, DFAT and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs are highly recommended. The urgency of these amendments is more pronounced today than it ever has been. Because of the increasing globalisation of many aspects of modem life, the insecurity and fears of the general public are being fed by those who wish to redefine what it is to be Australian according to their own models. We cannot allow the creation of a 'fortress Australia', a fortress based on racial, religious or political considerations. Acceptance of these recommendations is our constitution's way of contributing to this fight. Finally, I had great pleasure in working with other members of the committee on this report. I thank them for their contribution and their friendship throughout the inquiry. I also thank the committee secretariat for their fine work.",18
9,Mr KERR,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Denison) (12.57 p.m.)Because time is brief and this matter is going to the Main Committee, I will just make two points and then allow the member for Boothby (Mr Southcott) to speak. I was delighted with the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This is a modem report. It is a modernising report. The provisions of the constitution which were identified do require reform. The two key areas which have been identified relate to the disqualification of members of parliament in certain circumstances. This revises and puts in a simple way that which will be understandable to the Australian public and will be a more professional way of dealing with it. Also, the limitation on the size of the executive I think would be welcomed by the Australian public.",19
10,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"I thank the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) for his brief contribution. Both the phrases 'office of profit under the Crown' and 'allegiance to a foreign power' conjure up images of the English Civil War or a traitorous Black Adder type person in the Tower of London for treason. It would be a surprise therefore to many Australians to realise that these words and the powerful legal effect that they convey are contained in the Australian constitution. While they sound anachronistic, in the last five years they have resulted in the disqualification of two members from this House. At the present, the qualification provisions discriminate against those with dual nationality and against public servants. Surely in 1997 the only citizenship requirement for an MP should be that he or she is an Australian citizen. Clauses 44(i) and 44(iv) of the constitution have their origins in English statutes of the 14th and 18th centuries. Originally designed to prevent the Crown gaining control of the House of Commons using patronage, it now acts more as a constitutional trapdoor than as a safeguard for the separation of powers. During the convention debates of 1897 and 1898, most of the discussion of the office of profit provision was concerned with the possibility of members of parliament being offered government posts. Isaac Isaacs declared, 'The object of the clause is to prevent personal interest coming into conflict with public duty,' while Edmund Barton suggested, 'I think it'-the clause-'is to prevent practical bribery.' It is worth noting that both of them resigned their seats later to accept government posts. Historically, during both world wars, members and senators did serve in the Commonwealth armed forces. Although they would have fallen foul of a constitutional provision-the obscure section 44(iv)-none of those members was disqualified. There were questions raised at the time, but the convention seems to have been very much to let that sleeping dog lie. The absurdity of the provision is shown when you see the exemptions that exist. For example, a commission in the RAAF will disqualify you; a commission in the RAF will not. The section can disqualify a nurse or a teacher but it will not disqualify Jeff Kennett or Bob Carr. At present 10 per cent of the Australian work force work in some capacity for the state and federal government. They all must resign before nominations. I support constitutional amendment of section 44(iv) suggested in recommendation 3 of this report. That amendment would still retain the original and important intention of the clause. The allegiance to a foreign power clause has been relied on in some vexatious challenges in the past. Two Catholics were challenged for their allegiance to the pontiff or the papal state and a Nuclear Disarmament Party senator's election was disputed on the basis that his protest against US warships indicated allegiance to an unnamed foreign power. This section does not protect Australians from a manchurian candidate, but it does discriminate against those with dual citizenship. A fairer solution is to delete the section and make Australian citizenship the criteria for - Ps. - any constitutional lawyers believe that amendment of section 44 is overdue. The 1981 Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, the 1985 Australian Constitutional Convention and the 1988 Constitutional Commission all arrived at similar recommendations to those in this report. Without reform I believe that we will be in for a Lindsay by-election after each poll with unsuccessful candidates appealing to this archaic clause of our constitution for a second chance. We need to maintain the original intention of these two clauses but avoid catching dual citizens and public servants in the net.",19
11,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,The time allotted for statements on this report has expired. Does the member for - enzies wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,20
12,Mr ANDREWS,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted.,20
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"In accordance with standing order 102B, the debate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. Treaties Committee Report Debate resumed from 23 June, on motion by Mr MCClelland: That the House take note of the paper.",20
14,Mr TAYLOR,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"In the limited time available to me as committee chair, I would like to make a few additional comments about the committee's progress report on the UN convention to combat desertification. This was the subject of a chapter in our eighth report, which was tabled in this place on 23 June this year. As I was not able to table that report-and I offer my thanks to the honourable member for Barton (-r - cClelland) opposite for filling in for me on that day-I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words specifically about the part of the report dealing with that UN convention. When it was signed it was a very controversial document. However, our inquiry received only 28 submissions. Perhaps the decision not to formulate a national action program had something to do with this small response. Interestingly, only one of the submissions was from a state or territory government. I must say that the small number of submissions surprised the committee a little, but we were aware that we had provided a number of organisations and individuals with an opportunity to express their views on this topic. Some of the groups and individuals had very strong views on the likely operation of this convention, and it is important that they had the chance to make their contribution to the debate on the document. The government has yet to decide whether it will ratify this convention. If it does, a national interest analysis, or NIA, will be produced and tabled in both houses of the parliament. It will then be up to this committee to decide whether it wants to resume this inquiry and in what way. In the absence of an NIA, our eighth report included a progress report which simply sets out the evidence received to date. Clearly, the committee provided the community with a chance to present opinions to the parliament as part of this process which might lead to ratification. This was the intention behind the establishment of the committee, and I am pleased to be able to say that it appears to be working well-indeed very well. In its consideration of treaties which are tabled the committee looks at a number of aspects of the detail in each case. I understand that my colleague the honourable member for - oreton (-r Hardgrave) will have a few words to say on consultation in a few minutes time. Consultation, or rather its absence from some treaties which have been tabled, has occupied a considerable amount of our time in the last year. It may be that if an NIA is produced we will resume our inquiry into the desertification convention. If so, our eighth report will be a useful way to recommence such an inquiry. If not, this report summarises our views and the issue this matter raised. In the context of the High Court's recent decision on state taxes the issue of the allocation of various powers under the constitution has surfaced yet again. Concerns were expressed about the right the desertification convention would give the Commonwealth to interfere in the land management responsibilities of the states and the territories. While the decision not to proceed with a national action program may have taken some of the heat from this issue, I doubt that it has been resolved. If this inquiry were to be resumed I suspect that states' powers would be one of the most important matters which would have to be addressed. In this context I would like to refer to the quality of the evidence at the public hearing in October last year. I think I can speak for my colleagues and say how unimpressed we were at much of the evidence which was given on that day. In particular, most of the witnesses from the various departments and agencies were unable to answer questions on the implications of the convention in terms of the states' powers over land management, and that is very regrettable. While that experience was the exception rather than the norm for the committee, the House and the government need to be aware of our criticisms. Next week I will be tabling a report on amendments to the Bonn convention. This will be our ninth report in under a year. We expect to table at least another three before the end of this year. The rest of 1997 will indeed be a busy time for this committee. I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the party political fence and in both chambers for their assistance and advice.",20
15,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"As has been indicated, the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties deals with a number of treaties in regard to Australia, Chile and the employment of diplomatic staff, the United Kingdom and Australia in regard to criminal proceeds, et cetera. Essentially, as the chairman of the committee, the member for Groom (-r Taylor), indicated a moment ago, the central interest has been in the desertification proposals. At this stage one might say that the committee is holding fire on a final view. I would reiterate the view that he has put: there has been cooperation by the committee on this report and there has been a dearth of quality evidence from a number of those that were called before the committee. Whilst the next speaker will talk about questions of consultation by government departments, it is worth noting that, when people talk about sovereignty and the states and territories, only one state, from recollection, responded to this particular inquiry. If one is putting forward a proposition, as some would, that there is a very great threat to states' rights through an extension of federal power in this field, one would expect these states and territories to take more of an interest in the matter rather than to come around perhaps in two years time to complain about how an outrageous extension of federal power will occur. That is not for a moment to say that I for one see any indication in this debate that there is that danger. It has been indicated that the submissions were not of the best quality. They were to some degree, without putting too fine a line on it, typified by perhaps an overreaction to fears of an international extension of powers. There are, from my point of view, reasons why we should go down the road of this treaty as regards international cooperation. The nature of this issue is vital to this country. We have to remember that in the last federal elections, for instance, there certainly were indications from the current government that they had a preoccupation and an obvious interest in getting something done about questions of landcare in this country. They are of crucial moment to us. There is no essential area of agreement between the government and opposition members in this report. I, for one, have not seen the onset of these great threats. I notice that, at the time of the report's compilation back in June, 68 countries had already acceded. That is an indication of broad international support. I leave my response there.",21
16,Mr HARDGRAVE,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is certainly one of the most interesting committees of which to be a member. It has looked at a great many issues since it was formed at the commencement of this parliament. As the chairman, the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), has said, next week will see the ninth report tabled in less than a year. It is therefore a good time to take stock of just where, as a committee, we have been and where we are now. In dealing with the eighth report, there is a matter to which I would like to refer which has implications for most reports we have tabled. One of the issues which has recurred in our discussions has been the issue of consultation-at least the lack of it---outside the process of the committee. In his statement to the House on 2 May 1996, which led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on Treaties, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) ,said: Consultation will be the key word. He also said the new treaty making procedures will: ... also ensure that every Australian individual and interest group with a concern about treaty issues has the opportunity to make that concern known. In our fourth report, we made a number of comments about this matter, including drawing attention to the need for greater consultation with the states and territories. I believe this matter has now been satisfactorily addressed, although I note the comments of the member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson). I do have some real concerns about the amount of community consultation which departments and agencies at the federal level actually engage in. The government's response to the fourth report took a predictable line: there is no case where the states and territories have not been informed or where cooperation has been resisted. While this may well be so, it certainly misses the point which concerns us. We have seen evidence of a number of different definitions of the concept of consultation. Changing the rather narrow view which has been taken by several departments and agencies has proved to be very difficult. Two examples serve to make my point. We dealt with a double taxation agreement where the sponsoring organisation, the Australian Taxation Office, did not see fit to discuss the matter with professional accounting bodies. Worse still, they were resistant to repeated requests from the committee, exuding great arrogance in the process we put them through. They caused the committee to convene a second public hearing. If the ATO had put a decent effort into their original national interest analysis, NIA, this certainly would not have been necessary. More recently, we considered a bilateral agreement on economic trade and technical cooperation where there had been no attempt by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade itself to talk to any of the Australian business and commercial bodies which had direct links with the other country. The treaties process is new and working in the national interest. Various elements of the bureaucracy have had to change their approach as a result: they have a new level of accountability built into the system. As is the lot for bureaucracies, change can be resisted. As a committee all members-all sides of politics, both chambers-are determined to make the process work. We are serious about consultation and serious enough to force often conservative bureaucracies to conform to the new way. The bureaucratic approach to consultation I have outlined shows a limited definition which is contrary to the committee's understanding and usage of the term 'consultation'. More importantly, it is also contrary to what the minister said last year about the revised treaty making process. As a committee, we believe, to be effective and play a worthwhile part in the important process of treaty making, consultation needs to be as wide as possible. We certainly do not believe this has always been the case. We have seen too many examples of insufficient consultation with even the most obvious interest groups. We would also hope it would not now be necessary to keep harping on this matter in reports and tabling speeches. It is very disappointing a fairly explicit series of comments on this issue in this place have so far been ignored. In the eighth report, the committee deals with a total of eight treaties of various types and descriptions. It is a good example of the number and variety of issues with which the committee deals on a regular basis and, as we have now been in existence for more than a year, we are starting to see the same type of bilateral treaty appearing for the second and third time, albeit with different countries. This certainly helps us to build on our expertise to ensure the central issues are much more closely examined each time. In closing, I am confident, if notice is taken of our views on issues such as consultation, the committee's scrutiny of treaties will be enhanced in accordance with the parliament's intention in setting up this committee in the first place.",22
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 1.15 p.m. the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 102C. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Internet Debate resumed from 2 June, on motion by Mr Eoin Cameron: That this House: (1) acknowledges the growing use of and demand for the Internet in Australia; (2) notes that a large number of Internet users are families and individuals; and (3) affirms its support for untimed local calls for Internet users.",23
18,Mr LATHAM,PRIV ATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I welcome this motion on Internet use, which was moved at a previous sitting by the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron)-although it is interesting to note that he has not had too much influence on his party room going by some of the public policy outcomes related to this particular area. If he is such a supporter of the Internet, why is it that this government has reneged on its promise of maintaining public libraries electronic access funding of $11.4 million, which was cut in the first Costello budget to just $2 million-a funding cut of 80 per cent? That was a magnificent program designed to provide affordable access for every single Australian to the Internet through their local library. There is no doubt that, in our information based society, as we move from industrial arrangements to the Information Age, information has become a very valuable commodity both for economic and social reasonsvaluable for the economy and also valuable for good citizenship-so access to information needs to be regarded as one of the prerequisites of our democracy, one of the foundation stones of providing a fair and equal society. There is no doubt that there is a role for government with regard to access to the Internet-affording the hardware and the costs of use. Government needs to be involved in the provision of this particular service-not everyone can afford a personal computer in their home. I know members of parliament are now coming on line with the Internet and the like, but we are fairly well pampered in the public arena. We always need to remember during debates like this the deprivation in other parts of the community-the fact that some seven per cent of Australians do not have a telephone in their household; that is, there are 400,000 households in Australia without a telephone. So for those Australians access to the telephone is the first step let alone worrying about access to and meeting the costs of the Internet. So, in terms of equity and access, we do need to use the public library network around Australia as a national network of affordable access points to the Internet. This was the point of the former Labor government allocating $11.4 million for that purpose-valuable seed funding so that every municipality in Australia could establish affordable access points to the Internet in each of the 1,600 municipal libraries around the country. That was an outstanding program, which the coalition promised during the last election campaign to maintain but, as in so many areas, the promise was dispensable and it was broken in the first Costello budget. I would suggest to the member for Stirling that, in moving this particular motion, he should drag himself away from fighting Noel CrichtonBrowne in the west and actually use his time productively in the parliament. One thing he might do at the next coalition party meeting is to stand up and say, 'We're backtracking in so many areas of public policy-backtracking on tax all the way back to Fightback and backtracking on industry policy as we are thinking about reversing some of the cuts in the first Costello budgetso why not backtrack on the funding cut for the Internet? Why not restore the federal funding provided by the former Labor government for each of the 1,600 municipal libraries in Australia so the Internet can be provided in every suburb and every town of Australia and every single citizen can have an affordable access point?' That would be a useful contribution to make out of public policy. The other thing that needs to be done is for the parliament to recognise part (3) of the motion and affirm 'its support for untimed local calls for Internet users'. There is no doubt about the Labor Party position on that particular matter. We are rock solid in favour of untimed local calls for Internet users. It is one of the very sensible reasons of course why the Labor Party is opposed to the privatisation of Telstra. If we are serious about the talk of moving into the Information Age, what is the one valuable piece of public infrastructure for an Information Age? It is the cable. It is the pipe network that Telstra currently has in majority public ownership and which should always be maintained in majority public ownership because that ownership is the guarantee the Australian people have of equal and fair access to the cable network. I am glad to see the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi) nodding. He should have spoken up in the party room as well. That should be the holy grail of infrastructure policy in the Information Age-full public ownership of Telstra's cable network. That is the other thing for these government members to usefully do in their party room: stand up for restoring the public library funding for Internet access and stand up for maintaining majority public ownership in Telstra and thereby holding the main infrastructure asset of the Information Age in public hands where its public interest can always be defended. I welcome the motion, but as ever I am always trying to help government members with the sorts of issues that they can usefully raise on their side. I have given them two initiatives that they can take and I look forward to those items appearing not only in their party room but also on the parliamentary agenda.",23
19,Mr BILSON,PRIV ATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is probably a bit troubled by his own party not listening to him. I thank him for those contributions, but he failed to mention that the ballistic cost of accessing the Internet under his government's administration was a great barrier. We can come back to that on another day. As many as 2Y2 million Australians have accessed the Internet. Australians are continuing their tradition of being early adaptors of new technology. The Internet is a tool for inquiry, information, entertainment and commerce. It can be a significant contributor to the desirable national asset of a curious, informed, engaging and creative citizenry. Even by late 1994, almost a quarter of Australian households were regularly using a home computer. According to the ABS, the highest application of computers in the home was, for education, at 25 per cent; entertainment, at 22Y2 per cent; and general word processing. These major uses of home computerseducation and entertainment-dovetail neatly into the strongest attributes of the Internet. This suggests a continuing high level of interest in the Internet by the home computer user. Not everybody, however, who connects to the Internet continues to stay with it. The research consultancy www.consult reported earlier this month that around one-fifth of Australians who connected thought the monthly access fees charged by Internet service providers were too high, or thought connection speeds were too low. Growth is now reportedly down to five or six per cent a month but a staggering 60 per cent a year, or of that order, which remains a phenomenal rate. Many Dunkley families also run microbusinesses from home. With 23 per cent of small businesses on the Internet nationally, this suggests that up to 2,000 Dunkley families could be using their technology through the Internet for the purposes of business as well as recreational and learning experiences. Yellow Pages claims that within a year 41 per cent of small businesses may be logged onto the Internet. I think the proportion of microbusinesses using the Internet to tackle the big world of commerce may be growing at an even faster rate. Users of the Internet will continue to increase as the barriers to accessing this technology lessen. Personal computers are now selling through outlets like Harvey Norman for under $2,OOO-with options for technical backup-making the cost of hardware and support more affordable. Cleverly used by families, the Net can complement conventional methods of learning by widening horizons and encouraging a marvellous thirst for knowledge. As the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) has said: ... it is our view that a clever country ought to be encouraging residential users, particularly families and kids, who want to get on to the Internet. The government's decision to mandate untimed local call charging for residential users of Internet services provides encouragement for family Net services. The Frankston City Council Library, the Peninsula Library Service and many Dunkley schools are playing a constructive role in providing access to the Internet to families who are perhaps without the resources to set up their own systems at home. There are now 470 Internet service providers in Australia--quite an interesting number. It is easy to see why being an ISP is so popular. Novice Net surfers like me can clock up many hours of connect time working with the unfamiliar 'Netspeak' that we need to be clued up on to find that elusive bit of information. I would imagine that is a very lucrative business for people who are not so flash this is still on Net surfing, like me. While Telstra has expressed the view that the number of large ISPs may decline to about seven, there are many others which will continue to service niche markets. For instance, we have a service provider in Rosebud who specialises in servicing the needs of the 03 59 area code Internet users in the community which I and the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) represent. On 6 August, the Department of the Attorney-General and the Department of Communications and the Arts jointly released a discussion paper suggesting that new copyright laws were needed to keep pace with on-line technology development. I support the government's recently announced principles for a regulatory framework for on-line services under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. This should be introduced next year, with codes of practice to have legislative backing. Internet service providers will be required to provide parents with access to filtering software and effective labelling systems for sites so that software can actually work. Net supervision aids, such as the platform for Internet connect selection, may be helpful in attempting to weed out, through ratings organisations, undesirable content. Enabling parents to be confident that their children can access the educational and economic benefits of the Internet while not being exposed to undesirable material is another challenge we face. As helpful as NetNanny and other software sifting products may be in sorting out the muck from the mind food on the Internet, they are no substitute for parental guidance in the development of discerning young minds. I commend the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) for bringing this motion forward and support his motion. (Time expired)",25
20,Mr ADAMS,PRIV ATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). I acknowledge the frustration he must feel in not being able to have some of the content of this motion expressed as part of his own government's policies. He certainly has not been able to do that and must have failed dismally in the party room in endeavouring to get some of these things in. As many in this chamber would already know, Australia has one of the fastest take-up rates in the world for Internet usage. Australians, especially those living in rural and remote areas-you have been aware of this, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl-have been quick to realise the Internet's potential for breaking down the barriers imposed by distance and isolation. In my own electorate of Lyons, which comprises more than 61 per cent of the land mass of Tasmania with a population scattered from coast to coast, enthusiasm for the Internet was fuelled by a pilot program introduced by the former Labor government, called the Community Information Network. The CIN, as it was known, provided free Internet services to many small communities which otherwise had very limited access. There were a number of success stories coming out of this program. I am aware of a farmer who, by going down to his local CIN site, was able to find information on irrigation schemes that saved him thousands of dollars. What a shame, therefore, that the overnight conversion of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to an information technology buff did not occur before his government decided to axe this wonderful program. In a society increasingly divided into the information rich and the information poor, the axing of the CIN put back by several years the ability of many Tasmanians to share in this emerging technology. Despite this setback, more and more people in my electorate are making the decision to go on line, mostly using one of the several very good homegrown commercial Tasmanian service providers. One of the hot issues they are having to confront when they do go on line is that of timed local calls. This is a threat that could see an increase in the cost of Internet use through either higher charges for calling service providers or through higher costs imposed on service providers which, in tum, would be passed on to the customers. Since the government's legislation earlier this year which opened up the possibility of timed local calls, Internet service providers and users have had to live with the threat of these increased charges. If this were ever to happen, it would be a huge setback for country and regional people. I recently surveyed my electorate, asking people if they would support the introduction of timed local calls for the telephone, faxes and the Internet. Of those who responded, 85.7 per cent indicated they would not, 11.4 per cent said they would and 2.8 per cent were undecided or uncommitted. These results give an inkling of the views of rural Australia on this issue. People living in the country use the Internet for a whole range of things: for communication, information, weather reports and educational purposes. They can use it through their library services or through a community connection. It is a great tool for people in rural and regional Australia and they want to use it without the constraints timed local calls would impose on them. Internet access must be kept affordable. The best way to ensure this is to remove any temptation on the part of major carriers towards acquiring market dominance through the implementation of timed local calls. I conclude with reference to a recent report by the government's own Information Policy Advisory Council, which confirms the importance of the Internet to rural communities all over Australia. The report states that what will cause the failure of rural and regional communities to harness the advantages of the new information technology is 'a lack of leadership, a failure of nerve, or a short sighted alibi for inaction', which would sum up this government. I think most people on this side of the House would agree with that. Let us be guilty of none of these by supporting this motion fully. (Time expired)",26
21,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PRIV ATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Boothby) (1.31 p.m.)I rise to support the motion of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron). The widespread use of the Internet in Australia is an important step in the process of globalisation, allowing all regions of Australia to overcome distance and to connect with one another and with the rest of the world. The benefits are immediate and apparent; the potential remains limited only to one's imagination. The World Wide Web user survey conducted by the Graphic, Visualization and Usability Centre in the United States estimated a global World Wide Web user population of around 30 million in May 1997. Internet usage continues to grow, with Rebecca Thurlow from the Sun-Herald predicting earlier this year, 'a billion people surfing in cyberspace by the year 2000'. At the same time there is an exponential growth in the number of World Wide Web sites, with the number of sites doubling every six months. The global trend towards greater Internet usage is mirrored in Australia. AC Nielsen MCNair has conducted several surveys on Australia's Internet usage between August 1995 and March 1997. The results show that the number of people 14 and over who had accessed the Internet in the previous month had risen from six per cent in August 1995 to 13 per cent in March 1997, while the estimated percentage of Australians over the age of 14 who had ever accessed the Internet was 22 per cent. That is one in five Australians who have already accessed the Internet. A further 17 per cent of those people had not yet accessed the Internet but said that they were likely to in the next 12 months. The immediate benefits of the Internet are substantial. Virtually anyone with a PC and a modem can tap into one of the most, if not the most, dynamic resource bases in the world. Educational institutions have been quick to take advantage of this new aqueduct of knowledge and the increasing use of the Internet at home allows Australians access to an unprecedented level of information. It is not hard to draw the link between greater access to the Internet leading to an increasingly technology literate work force. School children learning the basics today will be harnessing the full potential of our global village tomorrow. It is important that we remain amongst the most progressive countries to adapt and master new technologies. In my electorate of Boothby, Scotch College was one of the first schools to insist that all students work on their computers, have laptops in their lessons and also use e-mail for things like sending their homework. Grade 7s at that school have access to the Internet. That is a facility which is filtered by the school so that there is no information overload, but it does allow the students the opportunity to interact with other students from all over the world. In Adelaide we know a little bit about the subject of timed local calls because it was Bob Hawke's intervention in 1988 during the Adelaide by-election, when he refused to rule out that Labor would introduce timed local calls, that probably saw Michael Pratt win a 6'12 per cent Labor seat from the ALP with something like an eight per cent swing. Increasing Internet usage will continue only so long as local calls remain untimed. Telstra has confirmed that it will not introduce timed local calls in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, it is important to spell out the reasons why timed local calls would be detrimental to Australians and to the Internet. Many households have taken advantage of cheap introductory offers with local servers and could ill afford to continue Internet access should timed local calls be introduced. Australia cannot afford to lose touch with the pace of technology and innovation in the world. It is important that as many people have access to the Internet as possible. Recently, 20,000 Internet surfers signed a petition outlining their concerns about the introduction of timed calls. There is also an equity issue involved in timed calls. There is a danger that if you do have timed calls it will mean that Internet access will become the preserve of an elite who can afford it and there will be a whole group that will become information poor by not being able to gain access to this resource. As Morris Jones, a spokesperson of the Australian Internet Alliance, said at a Radio National breakfast on 9 April this year: The problem here is that we have an industry that directly employs about 14,000 people and indirectly employs about 60,000 and there is no absolutely concrete assurance in legislation industry will be able to survive in the next few years, given the fact that there is no absolute certainty that timed data calls won't be introduced. (Time expired)",27
22,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PRIV ATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I am pleased to support the motion before the House today. It may surprise those who have worked with me to hear me talking about the Internet. Far from being one who surfs the net, my position is best described as being on the leeward side of the sand dune, sitting under a beach umbrella. Notwithstanding my status as technologically challenged, I have absorbed enough, and watched my children enough, to understand the unassailable fact that the information revolution is with us and that if we aspire to higher standards of living we need to acknowledge this and adjust ourselves to this revolution. Nowhere is the potential of the Internet more apparent than in our schools. Only this morning we read of the recommendations of the Goldsworthy report, which strongly supports the establishment of universal secondary student access for the Internet by 2000 as well as online computers in the libraries of all primary schools. The Internet is not a substitute for a highly trained, dedicated and caring teaching profession but it does have the ability to complement that profession in the classroom as a first-class learning tool. However, what needs to be understood is that more and more of the learning that is possible through the Internet is being done at home or is capable of being done at home. Last year a Bureau of Statistics survey recording the extent of computer usage in private households found that, in the two years to February 1996, the rate of computer usage in private homes increased from 23 per cent to 30 per cent, representing an increase of 600,000 computers. Today there are probably three million computers in private homes, the vast majority of which offer a potential connection to the Internet. That same survey concluded that a total of 3.9 million persons aged five years and over used the household computer and, after playing games, the most popular use of these computers was for educational activities. More than half of the that this million people who indicated the use of mainly educational products were aged 17 or less. The bureau's research found that 262,000 people used the Internet from home. The growth rate in Internet usage was not recorded, but during the past 18 months we would expect this number to have grown rapidly indeed. One of the research findings that I think ought to be particularly noted is that some 4.7 million Australian households neither own nor operate a computer, and 31 per cent of this group gave high cost as the reason. The survey was limited in the links it created between computer usage and income. But it found that less than a quarter of those homes with computers had a modem or external link and that 27 per cent of those without this device cited cost as a reason against the purchase. So, without an external link, the Internet remains inaccessible to many Australian families. It is vital that we do not allow the Internet to exacerbate the substantial difference in opportunity which now presents itself in Australian families on either side of the wealth divide. If families in poorer areas cannot access the Internet outside of school hours, ultimately their children will find themselves under-resourced in comparison to families who can afford a home computing en vironmen t. In recent days the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) gave public schools a backhander by implying that they contribute disproportionately to youth unemployment. I would have thought that any education minister who understood these issues or gave them any thought would realise that resources play an important role-an enormous role-in equipping students for the work force. So it is with the Internet. The minister can assist public schools in better equipping their students for employment by ensuring that the Goldsworthy recommendation of Internet access is supported. We shall see. Central to this question of access equity is the issue of telecommunication charges, and I am pleased that the member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) has included an affirmation of untimed local calls for Internet users. Once again, I hope that the member for Stirling and others on his side take this matter up with their ministerial colleagues to ensure that, when Telstra is consumed by the private sector, it does not bow to the wishes of number-crunchers. Once again, we shall see. Finally, I note that there are issues concernthe ing regulation of the Internet, some of which have been pointed to by the ASC in investigation of activities-for example, involving misleading information regarding gold discoveries being published on the Internet. There is the potential for misuse and abuse of these new methods of access to information. Those of us who are responsible for regulation will need to increasingly play a role in this area as well.",28
23,Mrs GALLUS,PRIV ATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Hindmarsh) (1.41 p.m.)Today the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) has given us some very interesting statistics about the increased use of the Internet and those who are using it. I myself wrote down the same statistics. But what the member for Wills missed was one interesting statistic which told us that 62.61 per cent of the Internet users are heterosexual. I thought that was a very interesting statistic. As to who is using the Internet, I think we can break the statistics down to almost anything we like. But that is not the point. The point is that this is one of the greatest revolutions ever. It is even bigger than the Industrial Revolution. The Internet is changing the face of the world. All those barriers that in the past have prevented people in different countries from communicating with each other have gone. With the press of a button connected to the computer, you can talk to anybody in another country . You can access the newspapers of another country. This is totally and utterly revolutionary. Just think, daily we can go into the newspapers of another country and see what is happening there. But the member for Wills, in giving us all these statistics, did then get to something much more interesting. He mentioned the need to ensure that this great technology is available to everybody and that nobody, certainly not from want of income, is cut out. If they are, then we will create two classes in this country. Our country will be made up of the people who have access to information against the people who do not have access to information. We cannot let that happen. So the member for Wills is right, as were the member for Boothby (Dr Southcott) and member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron), who have spoken on this side: we must ensure there is open access for all Australians. In this way Australia will improve its own educational standards. Education is now one of the great movers in the Internet. Through the Internet you can have access to this information, and anybody who does not have access to the Internet will not have access to this information. It is for this reason that the question of country access is so important. We cannot deny people in the country access to the Internet because of the higher charge involved. In the cities there are so many ISP providers that we can connect with them for the cost of a local call. But in the country, obviously you cannot have local ISP providers everywhere and the country people have to pay that SID charge to get into the ISP provider. I believe that Telstra has given concessions to country people whereby, after paying $3 for calls after 8 p.m., there will be no further charge to the ISP provider that night. That is certainly moving in the right direction. But we have to guarantee that people in the country have full access-just as do people in the city-to the Internet without extra unconscionable charges. That is something we have to look at. The third part of this motion suggests the horrible spectre of timed calls. At the moment, as I have just said, we have only to pay for the connection to the ISP provider. There was some talk earlier on that Telstra or the telecommunications provider, while being excluded by legislation from charging the individuals who are ringing the ISP provider, could decide to charge the ISP provider themselves on a timed basis. The ISP providers already pay for lines installed and for the amount of data transferred. If they also had to pay for the time, the many ISP providers that are out there would collapse. It would become uneconomic to have them there.",29

NA Helping Our Pedestrians Everywhere Organisation",30
25,Mr MOSSFIELD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In my electorate of Greenway I recently had the opportunity of attending a meeting of a community organisation called Helping Our Pedestrians Everywhere-HOPE. HOPE is a national organisation campaigning to protect the lives of schoolchildren travelling to and from school by public transport. To publicise the work of HOPE, a national day of mourning has been called for 25 September. A service will be conducted in front of the New South Wales Parliament House between 10.30 a.m. and 1l.30 a.m. The day is designed to give the general public and schools the opportunity to mourn the loss of young, innocent lives through school bus accidents. With the support of St Luke's Grammar School, Dee Why, Lindisfarne Anglican School and Lakeside Christian College, Tweed Heads, who supplied their buses, and of Wattyl Paints, Hellia Lights, 3M Australia and Newfema Pty Ltd, who provided the materials, there are now three yellow safety buses being used to transport children to school each day. HOPE wants to see these distinctive buses used as a national standard for all school buses throughout Australia. I congratulate HOPE, their enthusiastic president, Mrs Val Moorehouse, and her committee on the valuable work being carried out. I wish them success in their future endeavours to protect the lives of our Australian schoolchildren. (Time expired) Member for Oxley: Religion",30
26,Mr ANDREW THOMSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"WentworthParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs)-I noticed yesterday a report in the Sun-Herald quoting the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) as saying in regard to immigration policy, 'We are a Christian country also. Religion has a lot to do with it and we must look at people and their religious beliefs.' To introduce into any debate about public policy an element of religious discrimination is, in my view, nothing less than an act of madness, because religion in Australia is a private matter, and it must always remain so. Mixing politics with religion will always end in tragedy. To the member for Oxley I say very clearly: you must get up in this House today and reject any notion that an Australian government should ever use a person's religion in making a decision that affects that person. To advocate such a notion is dangerous, divisive and not worthy of a member of this parliament. Chelsea Heights Community Centre",30
27,Mr WILTON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Chelsea Heights Community Centre is aptly named because it truly is the centre of the Chelsea Heights community. It offers a range of services from child care to courses in a range of subjects as comprehensive as anything you can imagine. Budget constraints applied by the City of Kingston have seen the centre's level of operational funding decline from $17,000 to $12,000 this financial year. This has already resulted in significant cuts to the quality of its service delivery. Additionally, space constraints mean that child care is conducted in the foyer of the centre. Last financial year-and, I understand, again this financial year-the City of Kingston allocated $48,000 towards the construction of an extension, conditional upon the state government providing $100,000 from its community development fund, which is generated from gambling and general casino revenue. In June, the state government advised me that the money required to construct the extension would not be forthcoming. There are widespread concerns within the Victorian community that this gambling generated revenue is not being spent on the community development projects for which it was originally designed. It is now administered by the state's Department of Premier and Cabinet, which means it is no longer subject to FOI applications. I understand that the application for funding for the extension will be resubmitted. I urge the state government to consider it, on the basis of the Chelsea Heights Community Centre's obvious need to offer proper and safe child-care services. Holm, Mr Ivan",31
28,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Lilley)There would not be many people who have made a bigger contribution to the training of young Queenslanders than Ivan Holm, and it is with great sadness that I inform the House of his passing. Ivan Holm had a long and successful association with the Gateway campus of TAPE. After qualifying as a manual arts teacher, he worked his way up and eventually became the principal of the Gateway campus from 1966 to 1978. It was fitting that Ivan was at the Gateway TAPE recently for the unveiling of the Ivan Holm Building, at which I and the Queensland government's Minister for Training and· Industrial Relations, the Hon. Santo Santoro were present. Both Mr Santoro and I were honoured to be present at this ceremony, which was a small but significant recognition of Ivan's commitment to the training of young Queenslanders. Ivan Holm had another side: at heart he was an old sea salt. From 1949 to 1995, Ivan sailed in 47 consecutive Brisbane to Gladstone yacht races, a feat which will stand for a long time to come. Ivan is a legend at the Sandgate Yacht Club and, as the fleet sets off into Moreton Bay next year, I am sure Ivan will do all he can to provide perfect sailing conditions. No-one could have been more deserving than Ivan Holm when he was awarded the Order of Australia Medal in 1993 for his services to technical education and yachting. To the Holm family, I offer my condolences on the sad passing of one of Australia's and Lilley's true gentlemen. Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",31
29,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In the winter break my electorate office has been flooded with queries from employers and workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry who are worried by the silly plans of the Productivity Commission to wipe out tariffs. These workers are worried about their jobs, their security and their families' futures. No wonder, because they can see what this government does for the unemployed. In simple terms, it does nothing: over the winter recess, the number of long-term unemployed has blown out to a 27-month high of 246,700. That figure is up by almost 32,000 since the government started hacking away at Labor's jobs programs in May 1996. Victoria has the highest concentration of textile, clothing and footwear companies and workers in Australia. My electorate of Batman has one of the highest concentrations of the TCF industry in the state. It is also an area of high unemployment, new migrants and low paid workers. As their local member, I am not going to stand by and allow the industry to go down the drain to a mindless, Canberra blinkered view of tariffs by a government that is not prepared to stand up for jobs in Australia but, rather, jobs in Indonesia, China and Korea. If this government blindly swallows the Productivity Commission report, it is condemning many of the people in my electorate to the Howard government's growing unemployment queues. The Howard government should follow the Labor Party in the same way it should have followed our automotive industry plan. It should embrace our plan for the textile, clothing and footwear industry and encourage jobs, the export culture and additional investment in Australia. As the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) knows, it is about time the government stood up for jobs in Australia. Member for Brand: New Zealanders",31
30,Mr RANDALL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It was with a deep sense of shame that I heard the member for Brand (Mr Beazley) on talkback radio in Perth recently state that the reason why New Zealand has low unemployment levels is that it sends all its unemployed to Australia. Taking such a vicious swipe at New Zealanders both here and across the Tasman was not only naive but deeply hurtful to the many hard working New Zealanders currently in Australia and no doubt damaging to our relationship with our good neighbour. New Zealanders, like many other people of different nationalities who come to Australia, often have a hard enough time battling this type of negative stereotype without one of our so-called leaders perpetuating it. Even more alarming is that this fatuous remark was made during the tax reform debate. If the member for Brand cannot participate in this important discussion on Australia's future without first getting out of the gutter, then perhaps the opposition should look at another leader to do that job and lead a rational debate on tax reform. Australian Capital Territory Heroin Trial: Media",32
31,Mr ANDREN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"One of the most disgraceful episodes in media manipulation I have had the displeasure of witnessing in recent times would have to be the shameful coverage surrounding the ACT heroin trial. That the government could even contemplate watering down media ownership laws even further in the face of strong public opposition displays the contempt of this and previous governments for public opinion in the face of media muscle. It makes me wonder why we even bother to come back here today and resume debate on issues before the House. Why not in future just ask John Laws, Alan Jones and the editor of the Daily Telegraph what they want and leave it up to them? The Daily Telegraph, the flagship of the Murdoch press, had the shameful ignorance to parody the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) driving around in an ice-cream van marked ' Mr Trippy' and handing out syringes. To ridicule a man who has obviously agonised over such a difficult decision, to parody him in such a childish and vindictive manner, is blatantly irresponsible and unfair. Dr Wooldridge and the ACT Chief Minister, Kate Carnell, deserve praise for the leadership they have shown on this issue despite distorted and intense media pressure. Once again, I find myself agreeing with Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett. On this issue he said: You must be prepared to try things which you may not personally like, but may in fact address the problems which none of us has the solution for. That is the leadership-not talkback polling reaction-this nation deserves. Citrus Industry",32
32,Mr ANDREW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was more than a little amused to find the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) in the chamber claiming to be the defender of the TCF industry in Australia while outside of this House the citrus growers are rallying against the very tariff policies that the opposition introduced when they were the government. There needs to be recognition that the tariff policies that he rails against are the very tariff policies that he believed should be in place. The citrus industry has already met with members of the government. We recognise the degree to which frozen concentrated orange juice f10ating in from Brazil is providing a problem for the local industry. But we also need to recognise that there are opportunities for the Australian citrus industry in putting whole oranges into cartons for the export market rather than squeezing them and selling them in the form of juice. In fact, it is in promoting these export markets that the government has been very busy and very vigilant. It is very much to the citrus industry's credit that their export performance has risen so dramatically over the last three years with a policy that was actually introduced by the former government. But that effectively was misrepresented by the member for Batman when he rose. He pretended that in some ways the tariff policy of this government was providing the TCF industry with difficulties. The reality is that the tariff policies that the citrus industry and the car industry face and the TCF industry currently have are a product of the former government. Retailers",33
33,Ms MACKLIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The life of small retailers in the electorate of Jagajaga is becoming increasingly difficult. Retail turnover continues to fall and is lower than it was a year ago. This government has not addressed the problems faced by small retailers. In Melbourne 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-aweek trading has made life a nightmare treadmill for many small retailers. Of course, the situation in Melbourne is worsened by the open-ended expansion of gambling, which has caused a large decline in local retail spending. The situation for small retailers, especially in the large centres like Greensborough shopping centre, which services the northern part of the electorate, is made worse by the attitude of landlords. Some big shopping centres and franchises think that they can push the small operators to the limit because they have so much market power. Overall, the situation is exacerbated by the Howard government's failure to carry out its promise to reduce red tape for small business-like small retailers. There is also a lack of direction from the government, leading to a lack of certainty and a crisis of confidence in the community. The only answer seems to be the magic bullet of the GST. Small retailers know what a GST would do for them. In fact, the GST is going to tum them into unpaid tax collectors. They will have to register with the Australian Taxation Office and remit GST on a regular basis. Many will also face the additional costs of new hardware. (Time expired) Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",33
34,Mr LIEBERMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"As members would know, the Productivity Commission's draft recommendations on the textile, clothing and footwear industries are now circulating widely in Australia. Its final report apparently will be received on 9 September. The issue I wish to raise on behalf of many Australians, particularly in regional Australia, is their concern should the recommendations in the draft report be implemented. Community leaders throughout regional Australia are grateful for the willingness of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other ministers to meet next week to hear their views as to what they believe would be an appropriate response to the issue. In fact, the meeting will take place-(Time expired)",33
35,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 p.m., in accordance with standing order 106A the time for members' statements has concluded. NA",33
36,Mr HOWARD,THREDBO LANDSLIDE,"by leave-I move: That this House(1) expresses its deepest sympathy to the families and friends of those who were killed and to those who were injured in the landslide at the Thredbo Village on 30 July 1997; and (2) highly commends the efforts and sacrifices of rescuers and support teams in the extremely delicate and difficult operations following the landslide. It is appropriate at the commencement of this parliamentary session that we, together, putting aside political differences, not only record our sadness at the immensity of the tragedy at Thredbo village but also take the opportunity of recording our immense regard and admiration for those members of the police service, the ambulance service, the State Emergency Service of New South Wales and all the other personnel who worked so very hard in such very dangerous and stressful circumstances in response to that tragedy. It was one of those disasters which sadly takes its place alongside Port Arthur and the Granville train disaster, the great loss of life in the fires in 1983, the Hoddle Street massacre and other disasters that are in the living memory of most members of this House. It is sad to reflect how 18 lives were suddenly taken due to this freak accident. All Australians were heartened by the quick and effective response to the disaster, which involved well over 2,000 emergency personnel and hundreds of support volunteers. The follow-up activity showed this nation again in its best light: working together as friends, mates and comrades under great adversity hoping to assist Australians in desperate circumstances. It was a great national response, with Emergency Management Australia providing Commonwealth support to emergency services personnel from New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland, with support being offered by other states. Rescue operations were conducted in extremely dangerous conditions, the area being geologically unstable from the landslide and the chilling cold and the pall of night making operations more difficult. It is very important on occasions like this to remark upon the great leadership which is given to rescue efforts of this kind by all the emergency services. I think of the difficult situation in which the police commanders were placed immediately after the landslide occurred, when decisions had to be taken about whether it was safe enough for the emergency personnel to begin the rescue task. So often over the last couple of years the police services of Australia have been subjected to enormous criticism and a great deal of personal abuse and media denigration, and they have been the recipients of a great deal of public disquiet. On occasions like this we ought to salute the leadership given by members of the police service and indeed all the other emergency services. Considering the stress they would have been under, those men behaved in a remarkably fine manner, along with all of their other comrades. All members of this House will want to join the rest of the community in recording their thanks. We also take the opportunity to record our thanks to the various volunteer religious and other welfare organisations like the Salvation Army, the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the Red Cross that were vital in supporting the round the clock operation. We know how frustrating it must have been for the emergency services personnel to have all the power of modem machinery at their disposal and yet be unable to use it during the initial search operations. We all shared their pain at discovering those who did not survive the landslide, as well as the nation's joy at the miraculous survival and recovery of Stuart Diver. It was a time when emotions were very sorely tested, but the unstinting efforts of emergency service personnel involved was an inspiration to all. The disaster occurred whilst I was in hospital. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), then Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and His Excellency the Governor General for the spontaneous bipartisan and united fashion in which they participated in the special services that were held in Canberra and at Thredbo. The spontaneous way in which they behaved was representative of common feeling throughout the Australian nation. I want to announce to the House this afternoon that the federal government will contribute $100,000 to allow work to comof mence on a planned Thredbo community hall. The Thredbo Recovery Coordination Commitpersonal tee has recommended the community hall built to help the village cope with the grievTragic ing and as a project to unite the village in cause to keep alive the strong community spirit and to focus energies. The community hall, I understand, has been a priority and a fundraising focus of residents for many years. I understand that plans were complete but that construction had been deby layed for financial reasons. The current budget stands at $250,000. The $100,000 federal government contribution, in addition to the $100,000 that my colleague the memworked. ber for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) advises has already been raised through voluntary donado tions, will allow the building of the hall commence in October this year. The hall will be located near the church at the western end of the village. It will house Thredbo's only year-round preschool facility; be social, sport and recreational groups; and generally offer the residents an informal, personal place to hold meetings and other gatherings. It is also appropriate to announce to the House that the Queen has approved changes to the Order of Australia award and, as consequence, there will be three new awards in the Australian system of honours and awards. They are to recognise distinguished service by members of the ambulance serinitiatives vices, distinguished service by members the emergency services and humanitarian service overseas in peacekeeping or hazardous circumstances Arrangements for those changes, which I think flow from a report initiated by the former government, were put in place some time ago. As it happens, approval of the changes has just come to hand. I will be issuing details of the changes in a separate press release. In addition, my government will be putting in place new regulations for the the national medal to extend it to members of voluntary search, rescue and emergency services. The government will shortly invite those organisations that took part in the Thredbo landslide aftermath to nominate those their number for appropriate recognition. It was a tragic event, bringing immense sorrow to many Australians and to be many people in the Australian community. though the event was, it did once again a create a situation where the Australian tradition and the Australian spirit of working together unselfishly in difficult circumstances to help one's fellow Australians was demonstrated to the full. I do not think any of us could have been other than profoundly moved the dedication, the commitment, the sheer hard work and, I am sure, the fatigue-inducing circumstances in which the men and women of the emergency services of Australia The least that this national parliament can is to record not only our profound sympato thy at the tragedy of the Thredbo landslide but also our immense personal gratitude, our unstinting admiration and our warm regard for the magnificent response of the emergency a venue for services to the tragedy.",34
37,Mr BEAZLEY,THREDBO LANDSLIDE,"I would like to support and endorse the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and, in particular, endorse the generous provision that he has made in terms of the community hall and the a changes to the awards under the Order of Australia system. Some of those, as he rightly pointed out, were foreshadowed by the previous government, but a number of those that he referred to are new. They of are all welcome. I am sure there will be a substantial number of people associated with the rescue efforts who will be recognised as a result of that. I also thank the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) for including me in his party to the memorial service. It was a service of hope, too, in the context at the time, because the rescue effort had then not been completed. That was a very moving service. I will remark a little on it later. It was generous of him to make space available on the plane that went down to the gathering, the first plane which nearly went down immediately prior to it. This sad occasion for the families and friends of the 18 people who died is an occasion of mourning for the whole nation. That has been made clear in the outpouring of national grief at these events, the public attention riveted on the coverage of the rescue efforts and the enormous outpouring of goodwill and forms of practical assistance that went in behind those who were committed to the rescue efforts. We have had a number of bad tragedies as a nation over the last 15 months-Port Arthur, the Black Hawk disaster, Gracetown, Thredbo and the bridge collapse at Israel in recent times. They have been situations where that spirit that is there in Australia of common goodwill to each other as Australians has been exercised absolutely to the fullest. It is thing that it is often those tragedies which produce that sense of community spirit and that sense of communal endeavour. But it is absolutely necessary when those tragedies occur that that sort of public response follows. Those of us who visited the site, like the Deputy Prime Minister and myself, would have been absolutely staggered at what they saw. They would have been absolutely staggered, too, at the good fortune that the tragedy was not even greater than it was, so precariously balanced was the landslide. Had that balance been upset, particularly on the night itself, how much greater the list of casualties would have been. One of the rescuers who was responsible for the coordination told me that as rumour ran rife and confusion obtained on the night of the tragedy on 30 July at 11.30, he had no idea how many had been killed but he had received estimates going up to 150 as they looked at the potential disaster in terms of the slide which had occurred. Of course, thank God, it was considerably less than that, but it was bad enough. I want to compliment too not only the rescuers but those giving aid and comfort to the families who gathered at the site for what was necessarily an extremely long endeavour. There were people of great sensitivity-social workers, religious figures and the likeoperating with those families who were being well looked after both by them and by other members of the Thredbo community. Amongst the skiing communities of the globe there is an informal international confederation which has meant that their suffering and their concerns were noted not only here but elsewhere. They were being comforted at the time not just by the response of volunteers and not just by the response of friends of families but by friends overseas who were adding their thoughts, their condolences and their support. The cause of the landslide and what might be done to mitigate those possibilities in the future are, of course, now the subject of a coronial inquiry. That coronial inquest is a very important one indeed. All of us in this place will no doubt follow very carefully the a sad recommendations which emerge from the coroner. The situation in Thredbo within the structure of that little town is not unique in the Australian snowfields or elsewhere. There will be a substantial interest in what emerges in the forms of the recommendations of the coroner when they come forward. I want to join with the Prime Minister in paying tribute to the 2,000 rescuers who came forward. The police, fire personnel, ambulance personnel, SES, mine disaster experts, engineers, specialists of all varieties, national parks personnel, Salvation Army representatives, Red Cross, St Vincent de Paul, members of the clergy, the people of Thredbo and many others deserve the highest accolades for their efforts. I would particularly praise the efforts of Superintendent Charlie Sanderson, who was the coordinator of that exercise. When you actually saw the logistics of keeping the huge gathering of rescuers promptly supported in that endeavour, you appreciated that it was a logistic exercise of a most extraordinary kind. He was literally like a one-armed paperhanger trying to keep tabs on all that was going on, and he did it very well indeed. It was quite evident that we have over the years developed a level of expertise in our emergency services which is very good indeed. They moved quickly onto the site; they knew where their potential areas of help were; they conjured up that help very effectively and very quickly. Many members of this parliament will have within their electorates people who joined in that exercise. Our representative from Wollongong, the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), has pointed out to me the role played by Southern Districts Mines Rescue. There will be many others who will want to acknowledge the efforts and work that had been put in by rescuers who are associated with their electorates. I want too to say one or two things about the media. They came in for some criticism, I think some of it justified, in terms of handling the presentation of the events at the through the course of the rescue-but I say only some of it. Actually, much of it was magnificent. What the media did in that exercise was ensure that the rest of the community had an opportunity to fully participate emotionally in the rescue efforts and to fully appreciate emotionally too the suffering of the families and friends of those concerned. In regard to that I would single out Glenn Milne, who was on site at the time the collapse occurred. He, like many others in that village, jumped into attempt rescue-as the circumstances subsequently transpired, probably unwisely, but nevertheless they reacted with a level of spontaneity that speaks well of them and the character of the people in Thredbo at the time as they sought to rescue their comrades. The beautiful ecumenical service held at the church in Thredbo was attended by the Governor General and others named by the Prime Minister. It was conducted by Father Wally Stefanski, who did it with great dignity and incorporated all the faiths within it. I would single him out for praise, not only in that regard but also in relation to the efforts that he and others of the clergy were making to comfort the families and to ensure the success of the rescue. Our thoughts of course go mostly to those who have lost members of their family. On behalf of the opposition, I join again with the Prime Minister in expressing the deepest condolences of this House to them. They have a tragedy in their family lives which they will never overcome. These things are never forgotten. It will live with them forever. Not only is it a matter of great sorrow; they should also know it is a matter which we understand completely. All of us here are, as is the whole nation, absolutely delighted by Stuart Diver's rescue. We acknowledge too the extraordinary survival instincts that he displayed in being able to come through that horrific collapse and the way in which he did, though with very great personal loss to himself. The people of Thredbo will never forget this. It will be a sadness in that town forever. The fact that a community hall will be built site will mean that it is commemorated in an appropriate way, that memory lives on in an appropriate tangible form as well as in the minds of the people who have been concerned and so affected.",35
38,Mr TIM FISCHER,THREDBO LANDSLIDE,"The disaster which struck Thredbo late in the night of 30 July this year is an event which will live for a long time in the memory of all Australians. I heard the news while I was on a working trade mission to Japan and a joint ministerial visit with my colleagues. I returned as soon as possible, and I did so as a mark of respect to the families whose loved ones were missing in that disaster. I then joined with the member for Eden Monaro (Mr Nairn)-my electorate boundary adjoins his about four kilometres from Thredbo Village-and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), and it was a privilege to attend that prayer meeting at Thredbo on the following Monday which the Leader of the Opposition has referred to in correct terms, and to convey to the people of Thredbo and to the hundreds of rescue workers who were then on the site that they had with them the thoughts and prayers of the rest of Australia, including those of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I want to acknowledge also that the Governor General and the Treasurer (Mr Costello), then Acting Prime Minister, attended a very well attended service at Manuka here in Canberra on the previous Friday. I took the opportunity to visit the site and I must say that it was only then, whilst looking at the huge almost vertical scar in the side of the hill, that I appreciated the enormity of the tragedy that had struck this happy holiday village in the mountains and the enormity of the task faced by rescue workers. People working on that site put their lives at risk every moment they were there, and they did so hour after hour, day after day until the task was completed and everybody was accounted for. So many people were involved, and there are many to thank: from New South Wales, the police, fire brigade, ambulance, SES, national parks, mines rescue service, Rural Fire Service, Red Cross, engineering services, welfare service, health service and volunteer rescue associations; from the ACT, police, ambulance and fire brigade; and from Victoria, fire brigades, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, the Salvation Army and so many related organisations. Names of all those people directly involved have been listed in our national newspapers, and I think that was a most wonderful gesture by those publications. But of course the newspapers could not list the hundreds of others-the people from Thredbo and district-who were not part of official bodies but who pitched in and helped in many ways simply because there was a job that needed to be done. I was also lucky enough to meet the sole survivor of this tragedy, young Stuart Diver, as he recovered in the Woden Valley Hospital. He is a remarkable young man in many ways. He reminded me that I had met him on the Tumbatrek in January. It is remarkable that he survived in that tiny space for all those hours. He showed true grit, dedication, determination and courage. His recovery is a wonderful miracle. What I also found remarkable when I met Mr Diver-and it is something which I think we all should take to heart-was that his ordeal in no way had lessened his love of the mountains, or his family or his desire to continue to make the mountains in the Kosciuszko National Park, the rest of Australia and elsewhere still part of his life. I undertrapped stand that the program Witness this week will have an interview with Stuart Diver. I wish him well in that regard. The arrangements associated with that should in no way be allowed to besmirch Stuart Diver but indeed enhance his personal standing, his courage and his determination in the particularity of his horrific circumstance. During the next summer recess I will make a point, in conjunction with the member for Eden-Monaro and maybe others, to centre the annual Tumbatrek activity, well known for making some members of the press gallery slightly fitter, on the Thredbo village as a promotion of the growing summer tourism which is adding momentum to the Kosciuszko National Park and the regional economy. It is something I can personally do to help the village as it moves through a further recovery phase and I look forward to that occasion. I know Thredbo means much for many people on both sides of the House and I strongly support the motion which the Prime Minister has brought forward. I can only join with Mr Diver and the rest of Australia in thanking the Thredbo rescuers. In a letter to this week's thanksgiving service in Sydney, Mr Diver wrote to the rescue workers, 'I cannot begin to describe my feelings towards you all for the unbelievable effort you put in at Thredbo.' To all those involved, the rest of Australia shares that sentiment. You, the rescue workers who did so well in the horrific circumstance at Thredbo, make us proud to share this country with you.",37
39,Mr GARETH EVANS,THREDBO LANDSLIDE,"I will add just a few further words to those that have already been said so warmly and appropriately by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and my Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). Like every other member of this House and I guess every other Australian in hearing the first news of the Thredbo disaster, I reacted with a sense of the most intense horror at the scale of the carnage and in particular with the most intense anxiety about what might be being experienced by those beneath the devastation. That reaction was made that much more intense in my own case by having visited and stayed at Thredbo on many occasions over the years with my family. I cannot claim, like Tim Fischer, to be intimately familiar with every rock and patch of lichen up on the mountain, but I certainly knew and know every nook and cranny of the Thredbo village. I have walked passed, around and through Carinya and Bimbadeen lodges on innumerable occasions. I stayed on one occasion in the next lodge below it on the hillside. I did not know Stuart Diver personally or his wife, Sally, who died so tragically with 17 others; but I must have met at least some of them on various occasions, certainly I met many others like them in the Thredbo family, and have an acute sense of just what a family there is in that holiday village. It just awful to contemplate what might be happening to those people. Like everyone else here and everyone else in the country, I held my breath through those long, anxious, early hours when nothing much seemed to be happening. The frustration was so acute, so palpable and so awful, particularly of course for the friends and families of those who were missing. But it did rapidly become apparent-and nothing I have heard since from anyone on the site contests thisthat nothing could have been done differently, except to put at even greater risk those who might have been still trapped and certainly to put in very grave peril those who were embarked upon rescuing them. Like everyone else then, I watched with immense admiration as the rescue teams went about their desperately dangerous and difficult work and reacted with absolute jubilation when Stuart Diver, with that indomitable will to live and courage being so amply demonstrated, was found and then safely emerged. No praise could be too high for the police, for the firemen, for the ambulance officers, for the specialist rescue personnel, for the emergency service volunteers and for all those othe-s-some 2,000 or more of them-up on t-e Slt- who did display such courage, professIOnalIsm, compassion, determination and sheer stamina as they made it clear, every last one of them, that they would remain on that freezi-g hillside until the last piece of debris was lIfted and all hope of finding survivors had gone. Just as no praise could be too high for the rescuers, no condolence could of course be too deep or too sincere on this occasion for the families who have suffered such devastating losses in this tragedy. Many questions do of course remain unanswered about the cause of the tragedy-why and how it happened. Hopefully those questions will be answered by the coroner's inquiry and related proceedings. Let me conclude by saying that one set of questions has been answered yet again by this tragedy. Australians do respond magnificently in crisis and adversity. The spirit of cooperation, of assisting one's mates, of assisting one's fellow citizens, is an integral part of the was Australian character. The unity of this country, whatever else divides us all the rest of the times, is at times of crisis and adversity magnificently alive.",38
40,Mr NAIRN,THREDBO LANDSLIDE,"Eden-Monaro) (2.29 p.m.)As the federal member representing the community of Thredbo, I wish to add my support to this motion. Clearly this tragedy moved the whole nation, but it is hard to describe just how much it has affected the Thredbo community and the surrounding communities. Tragically, everyone in this part of my electorate, including me, knew someone who lost their life, because most of those victims were long-term residents. The pain for many will continue for a long, long time. I spent a number of days with my wife, Kerrie, in Thredbo during and after the rescue operation. I want to use the time. I have today to highlight and thank those involved for their contributions-contributions made by so many-to the rescue. The list of organisations and individuals is almost endless, and impossible to cover here today. But to the police services, the state emergency services, the ambulance services, the fire brigades, the bushfire brigades, the health services, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Snowy River Shire, the state community services and the clergy, I say thank you. The coordination between these rescue services was outstanding. Watching them work was inspiring. Particular credit for this operation goes to Charlie Sanderson, the police commander for the region. Charlie had only recently taken up his position in Queanbeyan, having come from Lismore. In fact, his family was still in Lismore when this tragedy occurred. The organisation put in place by him plus his handling of the public aspect via the media are to be commended. While thanking all of the services that came from many parts of New South Wales and the ACT, as well as other states, I want to specifically highlight the generous response from the many towns and communities throughout Eden-Monaro. All of the services I mentioned had people there from Queanbeyan, Bungendore, Braidwood, Batemans Bay, Moruya, Narooma, Bermagui, Bega, Merimbula, Pambula, Eden, Delegate, Bombala, Nimmitabel, Cooma and Jindabyne, plus some smaller villages close to those towns-a great effort from the region, people coming to help their near neighbours. I also thank the New South Wales government and the various departments involved. They provided whatever was needed. In this regard I highlight the role my state colleague Peter Cochran played. Peter spent many days on-site rallying the troops and being a gobetween to the New South Wales government. Most people would know of the political stoushes that occurred over the years between Peter Cochran and Bob Carr, but throughout this tragedy that was put well and truly to one side. They worked as a team to ensure that the rescue workers got every assistance possible. Thank you also to Tim Fischer and Peter Costello, who were both Acting Prime Minister during the rescue period. I appreciated the support provided. Thank you, Tim, and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, for your attendance at the church service. Your moral support and, in particular, your sensitivity with the families and friends was very well received. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the people and businesses of Thredbo and surrounding towns for their generosity throughout this difficult time. It was outstandmy ing. They gave and did whatever was necessary: food, beds, equipment-you name it, they gave it. Speaking of food, as an aside, I wish to say how wonderful the Salvation Army were. They set up close to the site and steak sandwiches and sausage sandwiches were flowing 24 hours a day to the rescue workers. Well done, the Sallies. But I cannot say enough about the people and the businesses. Kerrie and I spent the Saturday after the last victim was recovered visiting many of the businesses, thanking them for their efforts and wishing them well for the future. They all did so much that one cannot go through them here, but as an example of the contribution provided I quote one of the SES workers who told me how the owners of Roslyn Lodge, Andy and Toshthis was where many of the SES workers actually stayed-were always there to provide meals or whatever at any time of the day or night. It was almost as if they never slept. Unfortunately, I didn't catch them on that Saturday. They were either sleeping or just having a good ski. The community will rally together to get Thredbo back on its feet. I know it will. Small communities tend to be able to do that. The announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) today will help that enormously. On behalf of the community I thank him very much. As the Thredbo Recovery Coordination Committee said: In commencing construction of the Community Hall! Pre-School . . . It will be a therapeutic outlet and direction for their energies and frustrations and provide a sense of stability and community cohesiveness. It will show that the village is moving forward. I also look forward to joining the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) in January next year on a special climb from Thredbo to the top of Kosciuszko.",39
41,Mr MCMULLAN,THREDBO LANDSLIDE,"Canberra) (2.34 p.m.)In rising to support the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the remarks of the other members, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), who have spoken on this matter I particularly want to join with the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) and colleagues from the ACT because the Thredbo tragedy had a special resonance here in the ACT and throughout the south-east New South Wales region. The region has already taken its fair share of setbacks and tragedies during the year. It was already reeling, and yet in the face of this further deeper tragedy it responded magnificently in ways that give tribute to the resilience of the human spirit of people wherever they are and of the people in this region in particular. On the night in question and on the days that followed during the rescue as the tragic story unfolded the hearts of everyone went out to the families and friends of those so tragically lost. For many people here in Canberra it had an extra element because it was a case of there but for fortune go you or I. After all, Corinya Lodge was essentially the home of skiers from here in the ACT. It is no comfort, I suppose, to recognise how much worse the tragedy might have been not only for the reasons outlined by the Leader of the Opposition earlier but because, if the landslide had occurred on the weekend, Corinya lodge would have been packed and the tragedy would have been so much deeper. It was by any measure an awful tragedy for the individuals and their families, for Thredbo, for the region, and for the nation, a tragedy played out in our lounge rooms every night. It always appeared on television like one of those things that only happens somewhere else. We in Australia are very fortunate. We see on television the unfolding tragedies of the world but we do not think it is going to happen on our doorstep. But it did enable us to see and to appreciate and to give extra feeling to our tribute to the rescue workers from the SES, the police, the fire brigades, the ambulances, the hospital teams at Canberra Hospital, to all those other people from departments and agencies, and to the voluntary and paid workers who turned out and worked so magnificently. They were not just courageous and dedicated and committed but also well prepared. They were geared up in the hope that what they were trained for would never happen but in the recognition that such things inevitably do happen in every nation and that we need people ready and able to respond quickly. While welcoming the generous contribution the Prime Minister has announced today, and supporting the remarks of others, I want only to say a few extra things about what we might do now. Some things must await the outcome and of the coronial inquiry and it is not appropriate to comment on those. Of course, we all give grateful thanks for the survival of Stuart Diver, a true Australian miracle. We want to support the actions of the federal and state governments in giving generous support to those who have lost family and friends. Immediately we all wish to rush and give support to the emergency services and the people who work in them. What I want to say is this: let us not just support them now when they are in immediate need-they need counselling to cope with the consequences of their tremendous contribution-but we should also support them in the future when they are not the centre of attention but when they need new and decent equipment and the people who work in emergency services need decent wages and working conditions. We should remember then that these are the people we tum to in this hour of need, as we will in others. Of course, we must support Thredbo in its battle to recover economically. I welcome the initiative announced by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) today but it needs more than that it needs each and all of us who can support Thredbo as it battles to recover economically as well as socially. It is necessary and important for us all to remember that. All Australians were shocked at what took place at Thredbo. We were all grateful for the dedicated work of the workers and volunteers who combined to respond so magnificently. We were amazed at the marvellous story of the survival of Stuart Diver. Most of all, the hearts of all Australians go out to those who lost loved ones in this tragic accident at Thredbo. On behalf of the people of Canberra and the region, I have great pleasure in supporting the remarks made by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and others, and, in particular, in joining with the member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) on behalf my colleagues the member for N amadgi (Ms Ellis) and the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) to say that, for this region, we hope that this is the last in the series of tragedies that has struck us and to thank all those in this region and throughout the country who rallied to our support.",40
42,Mr SPEAKER,THREDBO LANDSLIDE,"I ask all members to signify their approval by rising in their places. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA Barwick, Rt Hon. Garfield Edward John, AK,GCMG",42
43,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That this House expresses its deep regret death on 13 July 1997 of the Right Honourable Sir Garfield Edward John Barwick AK, GCMG, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia from 1964 to 1981, Member of this House for the Division of Parramatta from 1958 to 1964, Minister for External Affairs from 1961 to 1964, and Commonwealth Attorney-General from 1958 to 1964, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. The death of Sir Garfield Barwick on 13 July 1997 at the age of 94 removed from the Australian scene a person who had played a very distinguished role, indeed a dominant role, in the legal life of Australia for close on 40 years, and also removed somebody who, in a short period of service in this House of only six years, had made a remarkable contribution to the government of this country. Garfield Barwick was born on 22 June 1903 at Stanmore in New South Wales. He was educated at the famous Fort Street Boys High School, which has long been a distinguished element of the New South Wales public education system. He was then educated at Sydney University, where he won the University Medal for Law and the Dalley Prize. From the relatively humble circumstances of Sir Garfield Barwick's background, he not only aspired to and achieved the Commonwealth Attorney-Generalship, became minister for what was then called External Affairs, and also led the Australian bar for two decades, but was also regarded as the stand-out advocate in Australia when he entered parliament in 1958-a fact attested to generously from both sides of the parliament at the time he entered. The fact that he could, from those circumstances, reach such heights and achieve so much says a great deal for the egalitarian character of Australian society. It is a reminder to present generations of Australians that that egalitarian spirit and those egalitarian opportunities for those of ability, no matter what their circumstances, have been around in Australia for a very long time. Before he entered federal politics, Sir Garfield had already established a remarkable career as a pre-eminent barrister and advocate, and as an undisputed leader of the Australian bar. I doubt that, in the period since World at the War II, anybody has so dominated so completely the Australian bar as did Barwick at the time of his entry into federal politics in 1958. You can reel off any other names you like but none would go within a bull' s roar of the ascendancy that Barwick had established within the legal fraternity of Australia at the bar when he entered parliament in 1958. On a personal note, I remember as a university student attending Sir Garfield Barwick's inaugural campaign meeting in Parramatta in 1958, which was attended by the then Prime Minister, Mr Robert Menzies. He very quickly entered the ministry. He held two vital portfolios, for a period of time together. He was responsible for major reforms in the area of matrimonial causes. He was the first federal minister to pioneer the notion of competition law in this country, although the model which he advocated of restrictive trade practices was not entirely followed in the final form of the Murphy legislation and the now Trade Practices Act. The fact remains that Barwick was the first person in Australian political history at a federal level to put down a model for procompetition law in this country. He was also a very distinguished representative of Australia's interests abroad. He was Minister for External Affairs at the time of some of the difficulties surrounding the Indonesian confrontation. He was very directly concerned in the diplomatic manoeuvrings that led to the formation of Malaysia. I well remember that, in discussions I had with him and from many meetings that he addressed, he had an unambiguous view of the importance of the Asia-Pacific region to the future of Australia. In that, of course, he was following the tradition that had been begun by Menzies and MCEwen in the work they did in their respective responsibilities and not least, of course, in the Japan-Australia Commerce Agreement of 1957, for which Sir John MCEwen quite correctly deserved such credit. Before entering parliament, Sir Garfield Barwick had been involved in some of the most famous of constitutional cases. He went to the bar in 1927. He was appointed King's Counsel in 1941. He practised extensively in all jurisdictions. He appeared before the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the High Court of Australia and the Privy Council. In a string of cases before the High Court in the 1940s, most notably the airways case and the bank nationalisation case, Sir Garfield Barwick successfully espoused in court the rights of private enterprise against ty and the power of the state. It was a guiding principle of his public life to champion the rights of private enterprise against the power of the state. He was President of the New South Wales Bar Association from 1950 to 1952 and he was President of the Law Council of Australia from 1952 to 1954. In 1964, after only six years in federal parliament and after cramming into that period service as both Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs, Sir Garfield Barwick left politics. He was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, a position he occupied for 17 years, and in fact he became the longest serving Chief Justice in the history of Australia. His chief justiceship saw many significant events affecting the court and the law in Australia. He presided over the permanent establishment of a home for the High Court of Australia here in Canberra. It was during his stewardship of the High Court that the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council from all Australian courts exercising federal jurisdiction was finally accomplished. It is worth reminding the parliament that it was really the joint actions of Commonwealth Attorneys General, such as Nigel Bowen and others, and the High Court Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, that were the driving force behind making the High Court of Australia the final court of appeal on all matters coming within the federal jurisdiction. Sir Garfield was also responsible for the divesting of less important matters from the High Court's jurisdiction to allow it to concentrate on its role as the final court on all Australian constitutional issues and the final court of appeal in Australia. He made an immense contribution to public life outside the law and outside politics. For example, he was the President of the Australian Conservation Foundation for five years. He had a very close association with the conservation of Australia's natural wealth. He served as a trustee of the Kosciuszko State Park for 20 years. He demonstrated his compassion for his fellow Australians by his service as Patron of the Australian National Council for the Blind and as President of the Royal New South Wales Institute for Deaf the authoriand Blind Children. In reflecting upon this remarkable life of 94 years, a number of things should be said. The first and foremost is that his life was a message to all Australians that, if you have ability, tenacity and determination, no matter what your circumstances are you can with a reasonable share of fortune aspire to very great success. Anybody who argues that Barwick had a privileged background, anybody who argues that Barwick was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and anybody who argues that Barwick was from the elite of Australian society and achieved what he did because of that good fortune would demonstrate his or her total ignorance of political history in Australia. He was a remarkable lawyer. He probably dominated the bar of his nation in a way that nobody has quite dominated the bar of their nation in the 20th century. He was not without controversy in his public life, and I want to say in that respect that-whatever views were held, continue to be held and are still held about the circumstances of 1975-the way in which he was pursued by some of his erstwhile political opponents until his 90th, 91 st, 92nd, 93rd and 94th years, when he was in failing health and almost totally blind, demonstrated a meanness of spirit on their part which is unparalleled in my experience of Australian politics. I just want to say on behalf of all of my colleagues that Sir Garfield Barwick threw in the face of those mean spirited people a remarkable strength and remarkable capacity. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Lady Norma Barwick, his son, Ross, his daughter, Diane, and their families our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. I salute the achievements of a truly remarkable Australian who demonstrated in a very effective fashion what can be achieved from humble beginnings with those great qualities of determination, tenacity and ability.",42
44,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in expressing the condolences of the House and of the nation to the members of Sir Garfield's family. Sir Garfield Barwick was a person of substance who had a significant impact on Australian public life over three decades; first, as an outstanding advocate, then as Attorneywhen General and Minister for External Affairs and, finally, as Chief Justice of the High Court. also made a number of contributions of voluntary nature which the Prime Minister referred to, to which I would add the presithrough, dency of the Australian Institute of Internathe tional Affairs, as he sustained his interest international affairs beyond his years as Minister for External Affairs. The Prime Minister made the point several times in the course of his remarks that Sir Garfield Barwick's life exemplifies the possiparliament. bilities in Australia for people of humble origins rising to the very top. I would have to say this: if the qualification is the sort of legal expertise and the intelligence that Sir Garfield Barwick had, not a huge number are going make it through. I would say that Sir Garfield Barwick was one of the exceptions that proved the rule, rather than the other way around. His eminence in that regard was noted by many people on both sides of politics well before he actually got into parliament. He was, in fact, knighted prior to his parliamentary service-indeed, five years able.' prior to his parliamentary service, in 1953. That followed both his presidency of the bar in New South Wales and his taking up of a number of constitutional cases in the late 1940s, when he threw himself into the heart of controversial issues in this nation. There is no doubt at all about his very substantial legal abilities. There is no doubt that he was, in that sense, a unique Australian. There was a widespread anticipation prior to his arrival in parliament that he might even rise further than he did, to eventually become Prime Minister of this country. He was a minister for virtually the entirety of his service in parliament, including a period as Minister for External Affairs. Indeed, it was his period as Minister for External Affairs which basically saw the end of his parliamentary and ministerial career. Though he was an able Minister for External Affairs, internally-as is quite evident from the histories-he was not in agreement with the government at the time in some of the courses of action that he took. He nevertheless was important in intervening at a crucial moment in Australian-Indonesian relations, at a time policy seemed atrophied, in being able to bring together a range of possibilities to He settle what was a growing dispute between a Indonesia and its neighbours and between Indonesia and this country. In breaking he did not necessarily earn himself joyous endorsement of his Prime Minister. in Nevertheless, he was effective as he did so. The Prime Minister of the day found for him an appointment which recalled again the eminence that he had displayed as an advocate for many years prior to this accession to During his time in politics, Sir Garfield maintained cordial relations across the political spectrum, as evidenced by the speech of to the then leader of the Labor Party, Arthur Calwell, on Sir Garfield's appointment as Chief Justice. He described him as 'a humble man in many ways, in spite of his eminence, which might have tended to isolate him from ordinary people. I have always found him the companionable, approachable and, except on matters of high party contention, quite reasonUnfortunately, during his time on the bench, Sir Garfield became a rather more controversial figure, both for his leadership of the court on taxation law matters and, even more unhappily, for the advice which he provided to the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, in November 1975. This is, however, not the occasion on which to dwell on these matters. On behalf of the federal opposition, I acknowledge his contribution to Australian public life and express my condolences to his family.",44
45,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"Undeniably, Garfield Edward John Barwick was an outstanding, extraordinary Australian who spanned most of the 20th century-having been born on 22 June 1903 and passing on on 13 July 1997. Some would say he came from the wrong side of the tracks but showed, through dint of effort, he could rise to the various positions he held of great seniority in the government of Australia. As member for Parramatta from 1958 to 1964, he made, through the luck of timing and his own personal efforts, a huge contribution to the federal parliament during that period. Those amongst us who might argue for term limits, as apply in some parts of the world and notably in the USA, might like to reflect that Sir Garfield Barwick would have fitted well within the term limits and still made that huge contribution. He spent just six years as a member of this parliament. Of course, during that period he was also Attorney-General and, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has mentioned, a great reformer, including the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council. On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and on my own behalf, I salute his particular contribution as Minister for External Affairs to the carrying forward of Australia's foreign affairs policy during that period and would mention one thing. Very early on, in the early 1960s, his pattern of travel as Minister for External Affairs ret1ected a deep commitment to engagement with Asia. The one priority trip that he took during that period was to India, Pakistan, Thailand and Laos, as a particular commitment he had to building our relations with our region. That w-s also brought out by his policy decision With regard to Indonesia. I salute his service as Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, and can only quote from his outstanding book, A Radical Tory: 'The High Court, it has gone astray. It has adopted the view it can make the law, not just administer it.' About that, I will make no comment further, other than to say that I find it a most interesting comment by Sir Garfield Barwick; and it was a privilege to attend the launch of that book with the now Prime Minister a couple of years ago in Sydney. Sir Garfield's interest in Kosciuszko National Park is well known. His presidency of the Australian Conservation Foundation was one of real leadership to the ACF from 1965 to 1970. He was also Patron of the Australian National Council for the Blind and President of the Royal New South Wales Institute for Deaf and Blind Children. This extraordinary Australian made an outstanding contribution not only in a lifetime of over nine decades but in just six years as a member of the parliament and 17 years as a member of the High Court of Australia and as Chief Justice. On behalf of the National Party I extend sympathy to Lady Barwick, to Ross and Diane and other members of the Barwick family. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjourned. Barnard, Hon. Lance Herbert, AO",45
46,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 6 August 1997 of the Honourable Lance Herbert Barnard, AO, Member of this House for the Division of Bass from 1954 to 1975, Deputy Prime Minister from 1972 to 1974, Minister for Defence from 1972 to 1975, Minister for the Navy, the Army, Air and Supply from 1972 to 1973, Postmaster-General and Minister for Labour and National Service, Immigration, the Interior, Primary Industry, Repatriation, Health, National Development and Social Services in December 1972, and Ambassador of Australia to Sweden, Norway and Finland from 1975 to 1978, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. The death of Lance Barnard ended the life of a person who was well liked on both sides of politics. Lance Barnard was born at Launceston in Tasmania on 1 May 1919. He came from what one might loosely call a traditional working class background and, like many others at the time, had to leave school during the Depression. He worked in a timber yard for two years but went to night school and started training as a teacher. During World War II, Lance enlisted with the 2nd Australian Imperial Force and served with the Australian army in the Middle East from 1940 to 1943. He took part in the famous Battle of EI Alamein and sustained permanent disabilities affecting his eyesight as well as his hearing. After his discharge from military service in 1945, he went on to become a school teacher. But it was almost inevitable that Lance would turn his attention to politics. His father, Claude Barnard, was the member for Bass for 15 years and served in the Chifley ministry as repatriation minister from 1946 to 1949. I think he held that portfolio rather longer than did his son. Lance was reared in politics and, to his credit, he was able to follow in his father's footsteps in 1954 when he won Bass for the Australian Labor Party. His maiden speech to the parliament was characterised by his concern over a diversity of issues, ranging from social issues such as housing and the impact of high interest rates on home-ownership to issues affecting the prosperity of his home state of Tasmania. He went on to become the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. Even as a political opponent of the Labor Party, one can recognise the immensely stabilising effect that Lance Barnard had on the Labor opposition as it worked towards winning government in 1972. I think Gough Whitlam, in his public tributes to Lance Barnard, has quite properly and accurately given to his late deputy a very fair and proper share of the credit for building the strength of the Labor Party in the lead-up to the 1972 election. Lance was, of course, along with Gough Whitlam, involved in that I will not say famous but I will say unusual-twoman ministry which governed Australia after the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. I found Lance Barnard, in the personal contact I had with him in the 18 months between 1974 and 1975 that we were parliamentary colleagues, to be a likeable, courteous and decent man who had strong and true Labor values and a very deep affection for Australia, and who had served his country with great effort both in war and in peace. He tried to do the right thing by his state and he tried to do the right thing by his native city of Launceston. He contributed immensely to the rebuilding of the Labor Party in the 1960s. Without him, who knows what might have happened in the lead-up to 1972. When Lance left federal politics in 1975 he became Australian Ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland. In 1979, in recognition of his service to politics and to government, Lance Barnard was appointed an Officer in the General Division of the Order of AustralIa. I am sure Lance will be warmly remembered by men and women on both sides of politics as a quiet, unassuming man-a great achiever whose unswerving loyalty and personal integrity earned him the respect of those with whom he worked. On behalf of the government I want to extend to his wife Jill, his daughters Tricia, Suzanne and Jacqueline, his son Nicholas and their families our very deep sympathy in their loss.",45
47,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I join the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his expression of condolence. Lance Barnard's death was unexpected and very sad. He was a humble, modest and great man. Those of us-and there were many-who attended his recent funeral on a cold and bleak day in Launceston were moved both by the suddenness of his departure and by the extraordinary eulogy delivered by his friend, colleague and former leader, Gough Whitlam. His tribute is one that neither I nor anyone else could possibly better in this place. Nevertheless, we must all try. Lance Barnard's service to this nation has been an extraordinarily distinguished one: in the armed forces, as a private citizen, as a member of parliament for a very long period of time from 1954 to 1974, as Deputy Prime Minister of this nation and as a man who served in more ministerial portfolios than anyone else in the history of this nation, though there is only one that I think he would lay claim to in terms of any ownership of policy-his beloved portfolio of defence. He came into parliament, as the Prime Minister indicated, on the heels of his father, who had also had a distinguished parliamentary service and a distinguished ministerial service. He rose to prominence as Gough Whitlam's deputy. He was described by Max Walsh as 'Sancho Barnard, Don Whitlam's sheet anchor'. I think that Gough's description of him, though not as brief, is better. He goes on in his remarks here to talk about his role as a deputy: I want it to be understoodthis is Goughin the most positive way. Lance's role went far beyond that of the loyal deputy, great and rare though the quality of the loyalty he gave undoubtedly was. What his colleagues and I valued most was his deep understanding of the needs and hopes of the Australian people, his instinctive feeling the Labor Party and the Labor movement in all its moods and manifestations. Combine this with a deep Australian common sense and an innate decency and integrity and you have no man's lieutenant but a prince among men. Lance Barnard of course served in that twoweek Whitlam government, as the Prime Minister has referred to. Gough modestly took 13 portfolios and gave Lance 14, and therefore Lance has the record. It was a distinguished government that achieved a deal in the two weeks in which it was in office. But one of its public presentations-indeed, its only public presentation-was for its members to attend a passing out parade at Duntroon. As a result of their attendance at that, it is the only occasion on which the entire cabinet has attended the passing out parade at Duntroon, and the only time the entire cabinet have been members of the Returned Services League. The whole event and the irony entailed within it would have struck Lance Barnard, a humorous man-a drolly humorous man-to its fullest conceivable extent. It would have also been for himself an amazing experience, the fulfilment of a lifetime's ambition after that formative period of his life spent in the desert with the AIF in Lthe 9th Division and subsequently back in j,Australia. He fought through the war with that division and, as a result of that experience, he was wounded and partially deafened. His family suffered universal damage in that war-all three of the brothers: one died, and the other two were wounded, including, of course, Lance himself. So war, wartime experience and the defence of the nation resonated within Lance's soul in the entirety of the time that he was a member of parliament. It gave him that sense of commitment in politics which was, for the Labor Party, of extraordinary benefit in an era in which the Labor Party was struggling to cope with the consequences of foreign policy being at the centre of Australian political debate in the course of the 1960s. At a period of time when the Labor Party's expertise in the area of defence was heavily under challenge, he brought to it an experience, a wisdom and a knowledge-an intimate knowfor ledge-that did much to enhance the party's credibility generally. When Gough Whitlam established the modern system of shadow cabinets when he assumed the leadership of the Labor Party, he signalled what was the advice that Lance Barnard gave him on what ought to be the structure of the defence department by appointing him to the shadow responsibilities in the area of defence, army, navy, air and supply. As Gough Whitlam pointed out, Jim Killen, never one to miss an opening, greeted Gough's announcement by saying, 'My honourable friend's idea of defence planning is to say, ""Lance, take five"".' Lance took five, he took 14-but he took ultimately, of course, the Defence portfolio. As defence minister he firmly set in place what has been the substance of national strategy since then, which is defence self reliance. He set in place firmly the administrative coordination effectively of the Defence portfolio and was ably assisted, of course, in that regard by the secretary to his department at the time, Arthur Tange. Lance was a prominent member of Gough Whitlam's government until the time of his diplomatic appointment. Gough revealed something at that eulogy which I had not known and I do not think anybody else knew. At the time Sir Paul Hasluck left the position of Governor General, he made recommendations on who his successors might be to Gough Whitlam, and one of those recommendations was Lance Barnard. When Gough Whitlam put that to him, Lance Barnard turned it down and continued his parliamentary service. History may well have been different and somebody else may not have been giving advice to the Governor General too at the time, had history been a little different on that front. But the point of his service which I have already mentioned is that he would have been an appropriate appointment as Governor General because he would have enjoyed support, I think, on all sides of politics. He went on to become an ambassador and his service was distinguished in that regard. To amplify the point I made earlier on, Malcolm Fraser appointed him to an official position in 1981. That was as Chairman of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, a tribute to the enormous strength of his sentiment in regard to service personnel, his appreciation of those who had suffered the supreme sacrifice in the service of this nation in war and his own considerable organisational and administrative abilities. For myself, though I had met Lance many times when I was a youngster, I only got to know him really well when I was Minister for Defence. I was obliged, as I believed I must, to repeatedly pay tribute to the fact that the contemporary military strategy on which we operated was effectively laid down by Lance Barnard, and he watched very carefully the progress we made on implementing it in terms of practical detail. I was not surprised by What I was surprised by was the fact that I kept getting correspondence from Lance Barnard well after I left the portfolio. I only came to understand the depth of the man's commitment to the community when I realised that these letters which kept arriving on my desk were a product of a continuing constituency work. The moment he came back from overseas and entered back into life in Launceston, he would immediately buttonhole the nearest Labor senator, secure a desk and continue, virtually five days a week, the constituency work that he had been used to in the 20-odd years he was actually a member of parliament. Hence, I was not unique, as I thought I might have been because of the defence connection; all ministers were getting letters from Lance Barnard with the concerns that his constituents raised with him. Then, when I was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Lance Barnard turned up on my doorstep again, on this occasion as an organiser of a group training organisation, as he committed himself to the service of his constituents in a more formal way as a person actively organising training and utilising Commonwealth funds for the benefit of all. Our condolences go out to his wife, Jill, his four children, Tricia, Suzanne, Nicholas and Jacqueline, his grandchildren and other members of the family. His death came as a profound shock to them. Though he had been ill, it was a death that was most unexpected, and a sense of unfairness and loss even deeper than normal prevails among them all. Their sorrow is shared by all of us in the Australian Labor Party. We have lost a great Australian Labor figure, a great Australian, a man whose life in many ways encapsulates all the conceivable experience an Australian might have had in the last 50 years of this century.",46
48,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"No doubt Lance Herbert Barnard was an outstanding son of Launceston who went on to give great service in the army, as well as in the federal parliament. I know the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), because it was the member that. for Bass who introduced me to Lance Barnard in the streets of Launceston many years ago, this day would join with me in saluting the service of Lance Barnard. That military service was, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) mentioned, with the 2nd AIF serving with the 2/8th Australian Field Regiment of the 9th Division in the Middle East. Of course, that was all about turning back the huge advance of the Rommel tank army along that coastline on the southern side of the Mediterranean Sea. It reached a crescendo in The Neck, near EI Alamein, and to visit that place and see the Australian war cemetery and the other war memorials and cemeteries that are located there is to see one of the great battlefield vistas of the world and to be struck silent by its huge proportions and the history that unfolded at that time. I had not realised that Lance Barnard had served there, been wounded twice there, overcame those wounds to return to Australia and serve as the member for Bass, Deputy Prime Minister and minister for 14 portfolios. His widow, Jill, quickly reminded me that it was 14---0ne more than Gough Whitlam-just a day after Lance's death. I will make two other points. Last week the book Whitlam to Winston was launched, another Barry Cohen book which is a satire in politics. I had the pleasure of attending that launch and discussing with Gough Whitlam the contribution that Lance Barnard made. He said that, whilst others were sometimes dismissive, he himself owed a great debt of gratitude to Lance Barnard and the cohesion that he provided in those early and challenging days. Obviously Lance Barnard, coming as he did from his military service and perhaps therefore from a more conservative element of the Labor Party, had much to contribute in the defence and foreign affairs area and to carry forward that agenda in the early days of the Whitlam government. As defence minister from 1972 to 1975, he brought the three services under the one defence department, introduced some reform of retirement benefits for service personnel, promoted defence cooperation with South-East Asia, including Indonesia, revamped the CMF to become the Army Reserve and initiated the concept of an all-service defence academy, which was gradually followed through by successive governments and, of course, is ADFA today. I hope that at the next graduation at ADFA an appropriate reference might be made to the contribution made by Lance Barnard all those years ago. A genial and generous man, a man of friendly character, he did go on to give outstanding service as Ambassador for Australia to Sweden, Norway and Finland from 1975 to 1978. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in extending sympathy to his widow, Jill, and to the family of Lance Barnard. They can be happy in the knowledge that they can be proud of the contribution that Lance Barnard made to Australia, to his beloved Parliamentary Labor Party and to Australia as a whole as a proud son of Tasmania. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjourned. NA",48
49,Mr HOWARD,MINISTRY,"I inform the House of the resignation of the Hon. Geoff Prosser as Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs.

I would also like to inform the House that the honourable member for Wakefield, Mr Andrew, has been appointed as Chief Government Whip and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) has been appointed as a government whip. NA",49
50,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Finally, before we get onto the starting blocks, I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is absent from question time today. He is in Papua New Guinea meeting the new Prime Minister, Mr Bill Skate, and other ministers of the new Papua New Guinea government.

51,Mr HOWARD,CLERK OF THE HOUSE," Mr Speaker, could I also, with your indulgence, because I was overseas at the time, congratulate Mr Ian Harris on his appointment as the Clerk of the House of Representatives. I have long respected his professional an- committed .manpe.r as an officer of the parliament. I thmk It IS a very meritorious appointment. I had the opportunity before I tribute to Lyn Barlin, and I know that that tribute was expressed in a fuller sense the day that parliament rose. I welcome you, Mr Harris. I know you will do a good job, and I know you will follow a long and honourable tradition of fine and dedicated clerks of the House of Representatives. NA Drug-Related Deaths",50
52,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, with indulgence I first join in congratulating our new clerk. He has many battles ahead of him in the environment of this chamber, in which he will have to give distinguished, impartial advice. I suspect he also has a few battles on resources issues with another chamber. We wish him well in both regards. My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that a staggering 54 people, including many young people, have been found dead in Perth already this year from drug overdoses, including many from heroin overdoses? Will the Prime Minister immediately restore funding to the Australian Federal Police, which had $37.6 million cut from it in the last two budgets, resulting in the loss of 130 AFP officers? As a first step in tackling this terrible problem, and following the revelation at last week's Senate Estimates hearing when the Director of the National Office of the AFP said, 'We are losing the war on drugs,' will the Prime Minister now join with me and other leaders and urgently call together a bipartisan national summit of all key political leaders, the AFP and other parties, including the churches, to try to find meaningful solutions to this horrendous carnage?",50
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the opportunity to - ay som-­ thing about this issue. I start by saymg - hat If ever an issue required as far as pOSSible a bipartisan approach it is the question of fighting the menace of drugs in this country. In that vein, I would quietly remind the Leader of the Opposition and others on his front bench that the problem of drugs and deaths from drugs in this country, particularly deaths from heroin overdoses, did not arrive left of paying on 2 March of last year.",50
54,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We don't have to support you cutting funds to the AFP.,50
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is something that has been present in this country for many years.,50
56,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will you restore the funding?,50
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The more that you interject the more that you demonstrate to the Australian people that you want to make a cheap political issue out of a national tragedy. Mrs Crosio-Young people are dying.,50
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Prospect.,50
59,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will deal first with the claims which are imp!icit in the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, and then I will say something about the approach of my government to this issue. As to the alleged downgrading of the law enforcement effort, I understand that the Attorney-General has been advised by the Australian Federal Police that claims made by the AFP Association and the opposition that the battle to counter heroin importation by national law enforcement agencies has been seriously undermined by budget cuts to the AFP are absolutely unfounded.",50
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Fifty-four have died in WA alone.,50
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition.,50
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I understand that the Attorney-General has been advised by the AFP that there has been no operation which has been curtailed prematurely solely because of budget considerations. Mrs Crosio-Will you restore the funding?,50
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Prospect.,51
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would remind the parliament that the effectiveness of Australian law enforcement agencies is increasingly being enhanced by this government's policy that agencies adopt a cooperative approach and a more strategic focus in the management of law enforcement resources. I go on to the broader issue, which is the question of appropriate Commonwealth and, through the Commonwealth, appropriate national action to combat the menace of illicit drugs in Australia. I want to say on behalf of the government that it is determined to ensure that there is an effective national effort in combating the menace of illicit drugs. I therefore have established a task force of Commonwealth agencies to prepare an urgent report for me on the national approach to illicit drugs and to recommend to me an agenda for national action. The task force is to be chaired by the secretary of my department and includes the heads of all relevant Commonwealth agencies. It will look at current efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs, including domestic enforcement and border control; current efforts to reduce the demand for such drugs, including community education and community organisation support programs; and harm minimisation approaches for users.",51
65,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So Max the Axe is going to fix it, is he?",51
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Kingsford Smith.,51
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The task force will advise on the allocation of resources to achieve more effective use of Commonwealth money against drugs. The work is being given high priority to enable the government to formulate a broad strategy to put before the Ministerial Cou-cil on Drug Strategy at its November meeting. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and more importantly to the Australian people that I have an open mind on the question of a national drug summit. If I believe that as a result of the work which has now been done there could be a public benefit and there could be an advance in the campaign against drugs in this country in holding a national summit, then we will certainly do so. Mr Lee-You will wait until the next Morgan poll before you make up your mind.",51
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I again say to those who sit opposite, including the yapper from Dobell, who has a great capacity to make inane interjections, that if you really want to win the support and the respect of the Australian people in trying to do something about drugs, you try as far as possible to take the party politics out of it. Those people who are fighting drugs at the coalface are not interested in party politics. Those who have lost their children and their loved ones as a result of drugs are not interested in party politics. Of all issues, you ought to have the sense, understanding and the political decency to put partisan considerations aside. Motor Vehicle Industry",51
69,Mr REID,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What is the impact on jobs, investment and exports in electorates such as my electorate of Bendigo of the recent anlaw nouncement by Toyota of its plans for the launch of a new competitor in the family car market?",51
70,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Which you opposed-but this is a good one, isn't it?",51
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For once I agree with the Leader of the Opposition-it is good news for Bendigo, it is good news for Victoria and it is good news for Australia. I know those who sit opposite were very, very unhappy when we took the decision that we did. As a result of the Toyota announcement, the annual capacity of the Altona plant has been increased from 80,000 units to over 100,000 units. This year's employment in Toyota's manufacturing plant has increased by 330 and is expected to be 400 by the end of the year; and double that number for component suppliers. That is where it is of great relevance to the member for Bendigo. His being a good local member who is interested in employment in his electorate means I am not surprised that he asked this question. The local production of large V6 engine cars will begin at Altona in the year 2000, and every 20,000 units implies 400 new jobsMr Bevis interjecting",51
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Brisbane.,52
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and double that number in component suppliers. It is estimated there will be up to $1 billion in new capital expenditure over the next decade for export expansion and plant and new development projects. That would not have been possible without the decision taken on motor vehicle policy by the Howard government. As a result of the decision taken on motor vehicle policy, we are going to have $1 billion more investment, we are going to preserve thousands of jobs and we are going to create hundreds of additional jobs. These decisions are a vote of confidence in Australia's manufacturing capacity. Member for Oxley",52
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Having managed to get you, after months of abuse of Mr Crean and me, let us see whether we can get you to do something else.",52
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will address the question.,52
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, are you aware of reports that the federal President of the Liberal Party, Tony Staley; the former Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser; the Liberal Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, are all pushing to have the member for Oxley placed below Labor on Liberal how-to-vote cards at the next election? Is the Prime Minister also aware that leading members of the business community, such as Sir Roderick Carnegie, Mr Bill Gurry and Mr Don Mercer, have called for the member for Oxley to be defeated at the next election? In the light those calls and the recent comments by the member for Oxley on the sectarian issue, will the Prime Minister now join with the Labor Party and guarantee that the Liberal and National parties will put the member for Oxley last on their how-to-vote tickets at the next election?",52
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, can I repeat what I said earlier: the Liberal Party organisation will decide preferences at the appropriate time.",52
78,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Make a statement now! Tell us where you stand.,52
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,52
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can I take the opportunity,52
81,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Show some leadership; you are a disgrace.,52
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Calwell.,52
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,afforded by the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition to say something about the character of Australia's immigration policy. I want to make it perfectly clear on behalf of the government,52
84,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Show some prime ministerial character.,52
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The constant interruptions by the member for Kingsford-Smith are delaying the House's consideration of these important questions.,52
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to take the opportunity of saying to the House that the nondiscriminatory character {)f Australia's immigration policy will be fully maintained by my government. That means that it will be a nondiscriminatory policy in relation to matters of ethnicity, racial background, national origin and religion. Any suggestion that considerand ations of sectarian background or religious affiliation should be introduced as criteria for the selection of people to immigrate to this country is not a policy that I can support; and dare I say that any suggestion to that extent is indeed unchristian. Alice Springs-Darwin Rail Link",52
87,Mr DONDAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to address of this question to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House of details of the outcome of the government's historic decision to provide assistance for the Adelaide to Darwin rail link-a link first proposed in 1911 and finally to be delivered 86 years later-and the benefits for the Northern Territory and South Australia in jobs, investment and future exports which will arise from it?",52
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for the Northern Territory. This has been a very interesting few days. I notice that the member for Melbourne and the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We'd give $300 million.' You had 13 years to give a dollar, if you were going to give $300 million. If only you had got re-elected for that 13th or 14th year, you were gunna do it, I know. You were gunna do it, like you were going to do a lot of other things. Mr MCMullan-How much did we offer? Tell us that.",53
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You would do better to retreat and keep quiet on this issue. You had 13 years to do something about this, as you had 13 years to fix unemployment-and you do not have any credibility when it comes to these issues. I am proud to say that this project will generate 2,000 Australian jobs during the construction phase. It will conserve an average of 40 million litres of fuel per annum over 50 years. Over the same period, it will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 100,000 tonnes annually. It will lower transport costs to and from the Northern Territory, being linked to the new port in Darwin and mineral developments in Central Australia. It is a great national project. It is project that my government is proud to support in cooperation with the governments of South Australia and the Northern Territory. It is a visionary project that will help this nation realise its potential into the 21st century. Alice Springs-Darwin Rail Link: Aboriginals",53
90,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware that the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Shane Stone, and his ministers have travelled the country privately telling politicians and financiers that the cooperative attitude of the Northern Territory Aboriginal community is one of the chief reasons why the Alice Springs to Darwin railway can be built? In the light of this, will you now repudiate Mr Stone's hypocritical decision to follow the advice of your pollster, Mark Textor, by screening overtly racist television advertisements as a central part of the CLP's re-election campaign?",53
91,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will give the Leader of the Opposition a little bit of advice: do not lapse into smearing with your description of racial,53
92,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,53
93,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are getting very excited so early, aren't we? I know Shane Stone and I admire him immensely. There is not a racist bone in his body. Thredbo Landslide",53
94,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House how the Commonwealth government will be assisting the survivors, relatives of victims and rescue workers in the aftermath of the disastrous Thredbo village landslip?",53
95,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Earlier this afternoon the Prime Minister announced that the Commonwealth government will provide $100,000 for the construction of the Thredbo community hall. In addition to that, tax deductibility will be available for gifts to the Thredbo Family Relief Fund Ltd. The fund has been established to raise money for the a relief of relatives and survivors of the disastrous landslip which occurred on 30 July 1997. This has been an initiative in order to financially assist those who were contributing to the rescue and providing support to the village. Taxpayers should ensure that they receive a receipt for their donations and quote the fund when claiming a deduction in their income tax returns. Earlier this afternoon the House joined across party lines to record its admiration for those who were involved in the rescue effort and its condolences for those who were lost and to the families of those who were lost in the Thredbo disaster. This is an opportunity for members of the public to indicate their support for the victims and survivors of the Thredbo village and for all those who were associated with that tragedy. Taxation: Goods and Services Tax",53
96,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall telling the Australian people on 2 May 1995: Suggestions ... that I have left open the possibility of a GST are completely wrong. A GST or anything resembling it is no longer Coalition policy. Nor will it be policy at any time in the future. It is completely off the political agenda in Australia. When asked whether that means never ever, the Prime Minister responded to that questioner, 'Never ever.' What credibility can the Australian people accord any of your promises on income tax cuts associated with the GST with such a record on your part?",54
97,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to credibility on tax, you have not even entered the race. When it comes to credibility on tax, you are the person whose deputy wants a GST, and you sat on him. You are the person whose deputy says that all we need to get tax reform is to generate more growth, despite the fact that you had 13 years to generate the growth to bring about that reform. Mr Beazley interjecting",54
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition has asked his question.,54
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are the person whose deputy would reintroduce death taxes. Mr Lee-Oh, rubbish.",54
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I warn the member for Dobell. Mr Gareth Evans-Oh, that is rubbish!",54
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are telling the states to do it. If you ever became federal Treasurer, you would force him to introduce death duties. Mr Gareth Evans-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I am giving you notice that that is a deliberate and blatant untruth and I will seek leave to correct it at the conclusion of question time.",54
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order, I remind the member that on 17 August 1997that is not a long time ago-he said that states can redress Commonwealth-state imbalance in a number of ways, not only through services taxes but through the old chestnut of property and inheritance taxes. He is nodding. You want the states to bring back death duties. Now you are shaking your head. Have you got an identity crisis, have you? The reality is that this man who asks me questions leads a party that does not know where it is going on taxation. There was a time when the Leader of the Opposition had some integrity on this issue. There was a time when the Leader of the Opposition was prepared to be courageous. When he was a member of the Hawke government in 1985 he addressed the National Press Club. I give you a quote in August 1997 and I give you a quote in June 1985. You have long and persistent form on the subject of taxation reform. You were asked a question by Barrie Cassidy, who was then the chief political correspondent for the ABC. You were asked: I read during the week that it was only yourself and I think Gareth Evans that wholeheartedly support the Keating package. This is what the Leader of the Opposition then had to say: I, like all Cabinet ministers, support the thrust of the option that is being presented. I think that it is capable of being implemented equitably. I think that it is capable of being fine-tuned to overcome most of the objection. He then got even better when he was talking about a consumption tax. He said: There are very few such societies which operate with a taxation system so heavily dependent on income tax as we do and very few which don't have a substantial component of their tax system reliant on broadly based consumption taxes. That was the Leader of the Opposition in June 1985 . You then had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who wants the states to bring in death taxes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants the states not only to bring in death taxes, but you want them to bring in double income tax because you are arguing that they should impose a state income tax. The truth is that you do not have any credibility on tax. The only parties in Australia who are interested in giving us a modem, progressive taxation system to realise the potential of this nation into the 21 st century are the Liberal and National parties. You are chained in confusion like yesterday's men to yesterday's taxation system.",54
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask a supplementary question, Mr Speaker. Does this mean that we are going to have a 1977 fistful of dollars election, since you want to take it back that far?",55
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Very simply, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition",55
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, the question is out of order.",55
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What a shame! Taxation  the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the burden of the current personal tax system on taxpayers on average incomes? What other suggestions have been put forward in the current tax debate to address the impact of high marginal tax rates on ordinary working Australians?,55
107,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact of the matter is that the personal income tax system cuts in at Australia's very low margins of average weekly earnings. Australia's top marginal rate of 47 per cent cuts in at the low level of about I1f2 times average weekly earnings. What that says is that, if you are on I1f2 times average earnings in this country, you will be on the top marginal income tax rate. Back in the 1950s you had to be on 19 times average weekly earnings to be on the top marginal tax rate. So obviously the personal income tax system is crying out for reform. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, 'Oh, yes. It's crying Something's got to be done about the personal income tax system. We've got to fix it up. We the opposition have a plan to fix it up.' I remember your last plan to fix it up before the 1993 election. It was not a p-l-a-n; it was l-a-w. Do you remember that? That is how you were going to fix up the income tax system last time. We have the Leader of the Opposition talking about fists full of dollars. Under your l-a-w plan, something you put into legislation before the election, the Australian taxpayer got not one dollar for one day. It was the great fraud of Australian politics, and here they are, mounting up again. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition went on TV, and he was asked about what his tax policy is: Paul Bongiorno: ... would you be prepared to use the surplus for personal tax cuts? Kim Beazley: We have a very open mind on the way in which that operates and we would demand the same rights that they have in regard to it. I tell you something: it is not your surplus. Your surplus was $10,000 million of deficit. That is what it was and, if you had had your way, it would have stayed there. The Leader of the Opposition was running around during the election campaign saying the books are balanced when he was $10,000 million short. He opposes everything we do to tum that around and, like Pooh Bear to a honey pot, as soon as a surplus can be found he is in it trying to spend it again. It was not your surplUS. You opposed building any surpluses. You did everything you could to defeat it, and we are not going to let the Australian Labor Party get its hands on the credit of this government's work and dissipate it again. You did enough damage. We will not let you do more. Taxation: Goods and Services Tax",55
108,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Why did you late last year describe a GST as snake oil?,55
109,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A description like that would be too good for any plan you came up with-far too complimentary. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition believes that we should have tax reform in this country. This out for reform. is what he said,55
110,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This was a simple and unadorned question in the category of the simple and unadorned questions you so desire. Let us have a simple, unadorned answer.",55
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I invite the Treasurer to address the substance of the question.,55
112,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will, Mr Speaker, because a broad based indirect tax would be a very worthwhile reform in Australia and it needs to be done. What is more, not only is it supported by you and by the future Senator Campbell, who is coming in from New South Wales; it is also supported by the young and the restless over there. There is a big test coming here. If you are against a broad based indirect tax, put it in the ALP platform.",55
113,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,All right. Fine.,56
114,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You will? All right. Fine. There it is: it is going in the ALP platform. The interjection was, 'All right. Fine.' So it is going in the ALP platform. The second thing that should go in the platform is that, if it is introduced by this government, you will reverse it. Will that go in the platform?",56
115,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Treasurer was asked a perfectly adequate question, I would have thought, about the subject of snake oil, which might suggest why we would want to put it in our platform",56
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,56
117,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,so I suppose it has relevance on that front.,56
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat.,56
119,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But, aside from that, it is an inadequate answer.",56
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat!,56
121,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The reason the Leader of the Opposition got to his feet then was to try to weasel out of what he said. What he said was he is going to put in the platform of the Australian Labor Party opposition to a broad based indirect tax.,56
122,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A GST.,56
123,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. Come onopposition to a broad based indirect tax in the ALP conference. That is good. The second thing that has to go in the conference is a commitment that, if it is introduced, it will reversed by the Australian Labor Party. Will you do that? Mr Beazley interjecting",56
124,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'We might even do that'; is that what you said? What was the answer to that one? 'We might even do that'? Was that the answer? We are not quite sure what the answer to that is. The fact of the matter is this: as has been conceded by Australian Labor Party spokesmen when they have been honest enough and been given their head to speak their views, in Australia today in a modem economy if you want to reduce rates you have to broaden the base. We believe that you should broaden the base. You should broaden the base in relation to the indirect tax system and you should broaden the base in relation to the income tax system. That is the best way to ensure people pay their fair share. It is also much fairer than the Australian Labor Party. We have been listening to the member for Jagajaga at the dispatch box day after day over nursing homes, and all the time the person who had the plan for the death tax was the deputy leader. Thailand: Aid",56
125,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer explain what rationale was used by the government to approve Australia's $1.3 billion contribution to bailing out the Thai economy without bringing the matter to parliament for an appropriation? What measures has the government negotiated to protect Australian businesses against their Thai competitors, who will now be underwritten in this package at rates unavailable in this country? Will the Treasurer make all the terms and conditions clear and transparent to the Australian community?",56
126,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question starts from a false premise. This was not a loan; it was a currency swap. It is a very important point, because the only person who has tried to represent that to the contrary, apart from you, is the member for Oxley. It was a currency swap by which Australia swapped $1 billion of its reserves for $1 billion of Thai reserves, which will be repurchased by the Thais at be pre-fixed exchange rates and which will eam interest. This arrangement was put in place with the cooperation of the Reserve Bank of Australia in relation to the management of Thai assets, which will be repurchased at pre-fixed exchange rates and which will earn interest. The arrangement was entered into as part of a regional package to stabilise currencies in the region. It was part of an agreement with Japan, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the International Monetary Fund, of which Australia is a member, and it was most definitely in Australia's interests. It is most definitely in Australia's interest not to have currency instability in this region. You ask about traders. What possible use would it be for Australian companies to have our region engulfed in currency instability? What possible use would it be if the economies in the region were not growing in the way which will provide markets for Australian exports? This was unqualifiedly in the interests of Australia. It was also unqualifiedly in the interests of the region. We know that there may be an interest in some quarters to misrepresent the way and the terms in which that was done. It was done as a currency swap, as was made clear at the time. It was done as a currency swap, as I have reiterated today. It would be much better if, rather than trying to misrepresent the situation, you acknowledged the facts and supported them.",56
127,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Would the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House of Australia's trade performance over the last year, what it means for Australian business and what it means for Australian jobs?",57
128,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The financial year ending 30 June of this year saw an all-time record export figure for Australian exporters. I congratulate the companies and businesses, large and small, the primary producers and many others involved. The figure was $104.4 billion, up 6.4 per cent. For the first time ever there is a surplus in both goods and services. Ruralexports were up 6.7 per cent, non-rural exports were up 6.4 per cent and services were up 6.3 per cent. More significantly, to be fair in judging trends on these matters, Australia's market share was up as well, to a level not reached for several years, climbing to 1.16 per cent. This does reflect an outcome of positive policies to drive forward on the bilateral level, with the market development task force; on the regional level, with our work with CER and APEC; and, on the multilateral level, with the World Trade Organisation. I accept that there is a great deal more that needs to be done, as the member for Parkes, the member for Mallee and others well know. There are many industries which are having great difficulty in obtaining true and fair market access. We are pushing ahead with our efforts through the market development task force to enhance market access and to have it on a fairer basis. A cable this morning confirms further progress with the Philippines and Thailand in relation to dairy products and a reduction in tariffs into Thailand from 25 per cent to five per cent on a particularity of exports from Australia to Thailand. The citrus industry is hard pressed at this time. Fifty-two per cent of the citrus industry's dollar effort each year is now being exported-full credit to the citrus industry as it seeks to engage with the region and with the world by expanding its export effort. Above all else, this figure of $104.4 billion represents a lot of jobs right here in Australia. To quote the ABS: 345,000 jobs in Australia Trade are underpinned by our exports to Japan, our largest market. It makes a great deal of sense for the government to provide continuing assistance, especially to greenfield exporters and small businesses getting into exports for the first time. Hence, the export market development grant scheme continues to provide allocations to companies, large and small, to get on with the job. That will be continuing to put our exporters on the front foot. Congratulations to our exporters on an outstanding performance. Goods and Services Tax: Fuel Excise",57
129,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister, do you recall saying to the New South Wales Farmers Association in your speech at Tamworth on 21 July, 'Our Party made fuel tax the heart of the deal on tax reform when we said ""Consumption tax in, transport fuel out'"" and, continuing your quote, 'There are now many arguing that the nexus between the two should not be as clear ... That is not on for the National Party'? So, Deputy Prime Minister, is it still your position that the only acceptable GST is one that removes fuel excise?",57
130,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The coalition supports a better, fairer, more modem tax system, and we are getting on with that. I stand by all that I said in Tamworth, Townsville and elsewhere during the winter recess. Indeed, I stand by all I said on 3AW. It is very interesting for me to tell the House what I said and what this poor, hazardous Deputy Leader of the Opposition had to say on the occasion. My quote is short enough. I will tell you in eight words what taxation reform is about: less tax, fairer tax, more trade, more jobs. I was followed on that program by a shadow minister from the Victorian Labor Party and later on by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I have his exact quote here. The discussion went on to deal with the disadvantage our exporters are placed in as a consequence of the current taxation system. I will answer the question very clearly by reading this quote from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who said on 3AW: Equally, Tim Fischer is right in saying there problem with taxation of inputs on exports and country that is worried about increasing jobs through exports has got to have regard to that. Amen. Mr O'Keefe-On a point of order: the Deputy Prime Minister was reading from a prepared tax script. I ask that he table the document for us, please.",58
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was the Deputy Prime Minister reading from a document?,58
132,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The one I was reading from was confidential; this one I am very happy to table.,58
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The document is confidential. Small Business,58
134,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Small businesses in my electorate of Swan continue to tell me that the legacy of Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissal scheme has been a lasting reluctance on their part to take on staff. Is the minister aware of any evidence which could bear out this perception?,58
135,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I thank him for a very good day I had in his electorate, too, during the break",58
136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address the question.,58
137,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly will. Not only will I address the question but I will give you a complete answer. Wherever I go, whether it is the Belvedere shopping centre just after I got the small business job or the Winning Post tavern, I think it was, where we had a beer at the end of a hard day-and I say this genuinely to the House-the damage wrought by the Brereton unfair dismissal laws still bums in the hearts and minds of many people in the small business community. There is no two-ways about it. Let us look at what the representative organisations are saying. The V ACe, the automobile organisation in Victoria, in its recent newsletter, Auto Update, called on: ... individuals and organisations, employers and the unemployed and anybody else who wants to see is a greater employment growth, to get behind the any government's proposed changes and support any moves to ease the burden on small business and encourage an increase in job opportunities. Mr MCMullan-1I have a point of order on the very important question of relevance. The question related to the laws as they prevailed before 1997. The answer relates to the current laws. So it is clearly out of date and therefore not relevant to the question, which related to the previous laws, not to this law.",58
138,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,After some initial digression from the minister he is now focused on the question. I understand the question is being answered.,58
139,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition has a policy of taking them back into the 1960s and 1970s. They do not have to give us a lecture about the difference between 1996 and 1997. Let us look at some of the evidence. The Tasmanian chamber had a survey of small business to rank business issues up to 58 in terms of their relative importance. Unfair dismissal was rated 11 th out of 58, with a rating of 70.6 per cent. The other day there came to light a Morgan and Banks survey which was back, sure, before our changes-there is no doubt about that-but which is still an indication of the problem that we inherited, the psychology of, if you like, and the barrier to further employment which you put in place. Interestingly, that survey indicated that 16.4 per cent of businesses with less than 30 employees have been adversely affected in their intentions to hire people by the federal unfair dismissal law. If you extrapolate that, that represents something like 104,000 small businesses affected by the law which the member for Kingsford-Smith was responsible for. Together with the inherent fairness of the proposal that the government has put to balance the interests of employers and employees, it is further evidence of the absolute importance of having a regime fair to employees and fair to small business, a system which says to the small business community: 'We want you to go out there and give people a job.' Education",58
140,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,59
141,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ah, the young and the restless.",59
142,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does that make you the old and the sickly?,59
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Werriwa.,59
144,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, he is in there with 'the young and the restless'.",59
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Werriwa. Ask your question. You are on your feet to ask a question. Ask it.,59
146,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am, indeed, Mr Speaker. It is directed to the Minister for Schools Vacational Education and Training. Why has the government failed to act on the proposals in your department's submission to Cabinet showing that the states and territories require an additional $140 million to cope with the 27,000 students expected to return to school with the introduction of the common youth allowance? Is this just a repeat of the Vanstone policy on government schools, attacking them while also constantly failing to resource them?",59
147,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a question from an opposition which, on its own admission, did nothing in office to answer the needs of the 70 per cent of young people who are not going on to university.",59
148,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order on relevance. It contains two points. Firstly, this has been more than adequately answered. It is the repeated subject of personal explanation and it ought not to be reiterated by the minister in this place. It is a nonsense. The second point is that his answer is way off the very specific question which was asked of him. Opposition members-Answer the question!",59
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right! The minister will address the substance of the question.,59
150,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The substance of the question relates to the fact that when this government came to office it found a situation where the previous government had completely neglected the interests of the 70 per cent of young people in this country who leave school and do not go on to university. It had left this government with a situation where there was a clear official message to these young people that a life on the dole was a satisfactory alternative to continuing to invest in their future with continued education and training. The Leader of the Opposition has denied the fact that this has already been admitted by the member for Sydney.,59
151,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it was not.",59

153,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On a point of order,59
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition, I am addressing. Your constant debate across the chamber today is a major distraction. I urge you to follow the conventions of the House. The minister will resume his seat. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training continues to misrepresent the position that Peter Baldwin stated in this House under personal explanation. This is an issue that we drew to your attention in the last session and you drew him to order. I would ask you to draw him again to order and tell him to desist from persisting with the untruth.",59
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Hotham. There is no point of order. Resume your seat. I have already invited the minister to address the substance of the question. I do so again.,60
156,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The substance of the question relates to the policies of the government in relation to the common youth allowance. The government's policies in this area have been made necessary by the neglect of the previous government. I am simply underlining the fact that the member for Sydney admitted: Accommodating the needs of those not intending to proceed directly on to university education in final years of schooling is something that the Labor Party did not do enough about in government. There is no misrepresentation there, whatever. Mr Crean-I rise on the same point of order. There is a misrepresentation because the member for Sydney got up in this House and showed where he had been misrepresented. This is an issue that we have taken up with you previously, Mr Speaker. I would ask you to persist with the ruling you made on the last occasion.",60
157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We have taken this issue up separately. There are other forms at your disposal. There is no point of order.,60
158,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It has been up to this government to look after the interests of the 70 per cent of young people not going down the academic stream. Mr Latham-Where is the money?,60
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Werriwa!,60
160,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This government has already committed, over the next four years, $187 million to assist schools in developing vocational education options which are relevant to those students and which will help them leave school and move into employment. The fact is that the commitment that this government has made to government schools is the best news that government schools have had for a very long time. Over the next four years government schools will be receiving from this government $2.3 billion over and above what they would have received had we held funding at the levels of the last years of the Labor government. There is no equivocation whatever in the commitment of this government to government schools. Not only that, there is no equivocation in our commitment to young Australians to help them get the education and the jobs that they need to give them a decent future-opportunities that were denied them by your fixation on the 30 per cent going on to university, and by your determination to continue with a policy which gave young people the negative message that the dole was an alternative to education and training. We are giving a positive message to young the Australians. It is time for the opposition and the member for Werriwa to stop tramping around the country giving young people a very negative and misleading message about what the future holds for them. Apprenticeships",60
161,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. There is considerable interest among young people in my electorate of Lowe in the new apprenticeship opportunities announced by the government last week. Could the minister inform the House how young people can access these opportunities and whether this represents a significant increase in new apprenticeship opportunities compared with recent years? Is the minister aware of any comments on the government's new apprenticeship system?",60
162,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have just informed the House, the government is committed to rebuilding the pathway for young people from school into employment that collapsed under the policies of the previous government. In particular, the government's new apprenticeships will provide the foundation for young Australians to build a rewarding and a successful career, not only in the traditional trades but also in the exciting new growth industries of technology, multimedia, computing, finance and tourism. Last week I made the point that the government over the next two years will be providing some $550 million for at least 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships. This is a 48 per cent increase in the apprenticeship and trainees hip numbers compared with the last two years of the Labor government. It represents a 60 per cent increase in funding. These very straightforward and significant facts for Australian young people illustrate the absolute falsity of the campaign of misrepresentation that the Labor Party and the member for Werriwa, in particular, are undertaking around the country. The Labor Party ran down Australia's apprenticeship system as every member of this House knows. In 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. Last week I launched the government's national campaign to promote the new national apprenticeship system to employers and young people. Employers, students, job seekers and parents can ring a 1800 number to find out about the benefits of new apprenticeships. Already there have been more than 3,000 inquiries to this hotline. The message for employers is a very clear and straightforward one: new apprenticeships are easier to access, they are more responsive to the needs of your business and they will help your business become more productive and competitive. They are a key component of this government's visionary strategy to prepare Australia for the 21st century. They will give young people a valuable head start. It will enable them to earn while they learn and will lead to a rewarding career based on industry recognised qualifications. Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: Secretary",60
163,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Why did the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Max Moore-Wilton, involve himself in a dispute between the Department of Administrative Services and a printing consortium led by J.S. MCMillan Pty Ltd over the sale of government assets?",61
164,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I will take the question on notice and get back to him. Work for the Dole Scheme",61
165,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Community groups in my electorate of Lilley have responded enthusiastically to the government's work for the dole initiative. What has been the response from groups around Australia to the government's call for pilot projects, and what comments have been made on the government's efforts to help the young unemployed?",61
166,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lilley for her question. Her community is, I am pleased to say, like other communities around Australia. The Australian community has embraced work for the dole. The government has been inundated with a very large number of interesting and innovative proposals for its 70 pilot projects under the work for the dole initiative. I am pleased to inform the House that the government has received some 580 applications from local councils, schools, sporting organisations, peak welfare organisations and the general community from every part of Australia. This overwhelming response indicates that the government has understood this community's commitment to assist young unemployed people. Of course, this overwhelming response makes the Leader of the Opposition feel very uncomfortable indeed because, as we remember, he led his party into a complete dead end on work for the dole and had to perform the biggest backflip that this parliament has seen. Despite every effort over the winter recess to cover his rear, his own backbench has not forgiven or forgotten this backflip. 'The work for the dole decision' by the Leader of the Opposition 'was unfortunate', said the member for Grayndler. 'I think it was a major miscalculation,' said Doug Cameron of the Manufacturing Workers Union. 'One of the great disappointments for many branch members was the turnaround as well. That was very disillusioning,' said an ALP member from the seat of Batman-and, I dare say, she was not the only one in the seat of Batman. It is no wonder the member is looking so uncomfortable over there. Indeed, I have to say that it is very obvious that the backbench are getting very nervous again because, having seen the backflip on work for the dole, they are now anxiously waiting for the backflip on the common youth allowance and, of course, they are waiting for the backflip on the constitutional convention; and who knows what tax reform will bring.",61
167,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The question had nothing to do with this issue of rumours and ravings about what the Labor Party is doing. The question had to do with what the government is doing and this government's position.",62
168,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Has the minister finished?,62
169,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The contrast is a government that understands the aspirations of the Australbe. Ian community and that has put forward a comprehensive strategy to address the very serious problems left by the previous government. It has completed phase one of its reforms. It is giving young people the opportunities to get the training that they were never able to access under the previous government. It is meeting the needs of communities to help young people, and I suppose we could say that the Labor Party and the Australian public are quickly realising that Captain Wacky has been replaced by Major Backflip. Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: Secretary",62
170,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My further question to the Prime Minister is: is the Prime Minister aware that his departmental Secretary, Mr Max Moore-Wilton, met with Dr John Hewson, the Prime Minister's former leader, and the principal of the I.S. MCMillan consortium that had bid for the DAS Asset Sales contract? If so, can he tell the House what was the purpose of the meeting?",62
171,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He has already asked the question. I said I would take this on notice. I will find out and come back to him. Superannuation: Small Business,62
172,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware of anger over moves by the Democrats and the Labor Party to dilute the exemption for small business on capital gains tax when the proceeds are rolled over into superannuation? Given that this particular capital gains tax measure would be of major benefit to small business, will you please explain to the House what will be the likely effect of the plan by the Democrats and the Labor Party to block this important small business initiative?",62
173,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. In fact, the Institute of Accountants, when describing Labor's approach to this issue, put it as 'mean spirited and irresponsible'. Quite frankly, that was being polite about it because I can tell you what the reaction in the small business community will They will be angry and, I tell you what, they will be justified in being angry at the Labor Party's attempt to block what is nothing but a very fair and reasonable measure in the interests not only of small business people but also of those who are unemployed who are looking for a job and who will get a job if the small business community gets some of the support it so desperately needs. This is a pretty fair measure. If you are an employee and you are saving for your retirement, there are tax advantages through superannuation for you to do so, and that is fair enough. We support that; of course we do. If you are in small business, though, you cannot afford to put money into superannuation, and the reason you cannot afford to put money into superannuation is that you are putting all your last dollars into your business. As a parliament we support people who are prepared to take a punt, to take a risk, to invest in their businesses and to give other people a job. We reckon, therefore, it is only fair enough for a person who has built up their nest egg, which is their small business, that when they retire there should be some equity of treatment in the capital gains tax system for those small business people. And so it was. It was a great tax reform announcement when the Prime Minister announced that, as from 1 July this year, small business owners will be exempt from capital gains tax on the first $500,000 of proceeds from the sale of a small business if those proceeds are to be used to fund retirement. I say to the Labor Party: we will fight tooth and nail this decision of yours to effectively scrap that program by cutting the benefit down to $250,000, or to do a deal with the Democrats for $150,000. And, I'll tell you what, we will have the whole small business community of this country out against you, because it demonstrates that you are not interested in small business; in in the way of a decent deal for small business, and we will not let you forget it.",62

228,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Navy: Service Recognition To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas: 1. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and RAAF. casualties; 2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Retumed from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal; 3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is. Members of the Army and RAAF. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya. In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was 'operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points. Your petitioners therefore request that the House acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from 'age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to 'service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. by Mrs Bailey (from 41 citizens), Mr Billson (from 24 citizens), Mrs Elizabeth Grace (from 31 citizens), Mr Lloyd (from 40 citizens), Mr MCGauran (from 38 citizens),  Mr Rocher (from eight citizens). Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable 'active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded. There are two forms of benefits for ex-servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for 'Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex-members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex-members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam. It is claimed that: (a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on 'active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications; (b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial; (c) the Royal Australian Navy was 'allotted' for operational service from I st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of II November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently 'unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced; (d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WAG 130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex-members of the RAN had been 'allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex-members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found. (e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the 'Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended; (t) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for 'active service'. The fourth, for 'military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya. Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable 'active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960. by Mr Adams (from 83 citizens), Mr Forrest (from 36 citizens), Mr MCLachlan (from 27 citizens) and Mrs West (from 222 citizens). Repatriation Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the fact that there is only one exclusion from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable overseas 'active service' by Australians. That being under 'Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(e)(ii) of the Act for members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960. The various claims used to date to maintain their exclusion have now been proved wrong by documents in the Australian Archives and elsewhere in the public domain. Some of the claims used to support the exclusion are: (a) members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted (which applied to all service personnel everywhere); (b) they were in no danger (they shared the same dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and were also required to serve under the United Nations command in Korean waters in case that war had started again); (c) they were never 'allotted' for operational service (a letter from the Secretary to the Department of the Navy dated 11 November 1955 categorically stated the date from which the RAN was 'allotted' for operational service was 1 July 1955); (d) they were not on 'Special Overseas Service' (such Service began with the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act of 1962 i.e. two years after their service ended and did not therefore apply to them); and (e) they were not on 'active service' (their service complied with all but one of the requirements of the only Defence Department definition of 'active service' the exception being 'or in military occupation of a foreign country' which did not apply to Malaya). Your petitioners therefore request the House to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition and treatment with all other Australians who have honourably served their country on active service overseas. by Mr Andren (from 27 citizens). Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain pensioners, superannuants and retirees points out to the House that Government funding for the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation's national secretariat will cease on 30 September 1997. The Federation provides advice to the Government on older people's needs and concerns, publishes independent information for older people and works to ensure that older people have a say in decisions that affect their lives. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to direct the Government to provide funding to ensure that the Australian Pensioners' and Superannuants' Federation can continue its valuable work for and with older Australians. by Mr Billson (from 44 citizens), Mr Mossfield (from 84 citizens), Mr Neville (from 30 citizens) and Mr Rocher (from 23 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain readers of Australia points out to the House that the Honourable the Minister for Communications has foreshadowed presenting to the House, Appropriation Bills which will substantially reduce the funding appropriated by the Parliament to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This reduction will greatly damage the nature of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Your petitioners therefore request that the House resolves to maintain the funding appropriated to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at the current real level. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 582 citizens), Mr Lee (from 83 citizens) and Mr Lee (from 17 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain members of the Australian community affirms our commitment to a culturally diverse Australian society which is unified by a common desire to see all Australians, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or ability treated with respect and dignity. We recognise the contribution that all Australians have made to the cultural, social and economic development of Australia, and reject the views expressed by Pauline Hanson as divisive and not based in fact. In recognition of the need to debate these issues honestly and publicly, we request the House to call upon the Federal Government to mount a high profile anti-racism campaign (for which funds were provided in the 1996-97 budget) and fulfil its obligations to build and maintain a harmonious and united Australia. by Mr Martin Ferguson (from 146 citizens) and Mr Mossfield (from 22 citizens). Australian Service Medal To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the Coalition Government has broken one of its main promises to the veteran community of Australia, that was, to provide thousands of veterans with a special Australian Service Medal in recognition of service to Australia's defence between 1945 and 1975. Your petitioners therefore request the House honours John Howard's pre-election promise so that veterans can be granted the recognition they deserve. by Mr Mossfield (from 118 citizens) and Mr O'Keefe (from 19 citizens). Human Rights To the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled we petitioners humbly pray that: (l) The Parliament renew its commitment to an effective, appropriately funded Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; (2) The Parliament reaffirm its support for equality for people with disabilities and the continuation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's work to uphold the rights of Racism people with disabilities at a level at least as great as in recent years; and (3) That Parliament withdraw the proposal to reduce the budget of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.  RAAF Richmond age To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Divisions of Macquarie/Lindsay/Mitchell draws the attention of the House to the catastrophic social and economic consequences on the Hawkesbury region that would occur as a result of closure of RAAF Richmond. Your petitioners therefore request the House to oppose the proposal to progressively close RAAF Richmond by the year 2005 and to ensure its ongoing operation as a viable and effective military establishment. by Mr Bartlett (from 2,204 citizens). Medicare Office: Boronia To the Honourable the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Members of Parliament assembled in parliament; We draw to the attention of the House the petition of the undersigned residents of Boronia who will be disadvantaged by the closure of the Medicare office in Boronia. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House sees fit to provide alternate Medicare facilities through local pharmacy agents. by Mr Charles (from 100 citizens). Family Resource Service: Far North Queensland To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament assembled: The Petition of the citizens of Australia brings to the attention of the House the Federal Government's plan to defund Family Resource Centres. The Federal Government plans to cease funding the entire Family Resource Centre program which consists of 11 centres located in high growth areas of Australia. Over the past five years, the FNQ Family Resource Service has assisted countless community organisations, self-help groups and government departments establish and maintain effective services to families in Far North Queensland. . The undersigned petitioners therefore ask the House of Representatives to call on the Federal Government to support families and community organisations by continuing to fund the Family Resource Centre program. by Mr Entsch (from 129 citizens). Family Resource Centre: Wyong Shire To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens draws to the attention of the House the importance to the nation of ITRAC Wyong Shire, a Family Resource Centre operating on the Central Coast of NSW. Your petitioners therefore request: That the House call on the Federal Government to ensure the restoration of funding to the Family Resource Centre Program funded through the Department of Family Services. by Mr Lee (from 307 citizens). Medicare Office: Sefton Park To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Adelaide draws to the attention of the House: that the Medicare Office situated in Sefton Park, Adelaide, South Australia which services 130-150 people per day, and provides cash reimbursements on medicare and child care rebates, will cease altogether from next year. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: allow the Sefton Park Medicare Office to function as it does now, allowing the people resident in this area access to cash rebates across the counter, and all the other services presently provided by this office to the local community. by Mr Martyn Evans (from 1,840 citizens). Child Care To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain supporters of Para West Adult Campus Child Care Centre draws to the attention of the House that the Commonwealth Operational Subsidy Monies to community based Child Care Centres will cease at the end of June. Your petitioners therefore request the House to consider our particular needs that are different from other Child Care Centres, ie that the people who use the centre are predominantly adults returning to education to improve their future prospects on limited incomes. Without the subsidy fees will rise and students will be forced to leave school. by Mr Martyn Evans (from 171 citizens). Tariffs To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the under-signed reject any proposals by the federal government to reduce existing levels of tariff protection of Australian industry. Any such initiative would have a disastrous effect upon the country's manufacturing and textiles industries and result in massive job cuts in these industries. A winding back of tariffs will have profound effects upon regional communities and economies-such as the North East Victoria and Albury-Wodonga region, which rely heavily upon manufacturing and textiles. Reducing tariffs will have the effect of slashing Australian jobs and attacking Australian communities. Your petitioners therefore request the House to oppose any attempts to wind back tariff protection. by Mr Tim Fischer (from 384 citizens). Australian Active Service Medal To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws Division of to the attention of the House: That those citizens of Australia who served in Korea between June 1950 and 27 July 1953, should be eligible for an Australian Active Service Medal.

Your petitioners therefore pray that the House: take all possible action to ensure that an Australian Active Service Medal is awarded forthwith to such ex-service personnel. by Mrs Elizabeth Grace (from 301 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: We the undersigned residents of Australia draw the attention of the House to a promise made by the Coalition in its Better Broadcasting policy to protect the ABC's international services. On Radio Australia, it said: 'Radio Australia has a proud place in the ABC. It has been providing overseas services for half a century benefiting not only Australia expatriates but also the nationals of many countries, particularly those in our region. Our coalition strongly supportive of Radio Australia's existing services and will ensure they are not prejudiced or downgraded in any way.' Your petitioners therefore request that the House resolve to restore Radio Australia's funding base to its pre 1996-97 Budget level and index it to ensure that it is maintained in real terms. by Mr Holding (from 41 citizens). Family Resource Centres To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Victoria request the House to calion the government to restore funding to the Whittlesea Plenty Valley Family Resource Centre. by Mr Jenkins (from 1,368 citizens). Australian Broadcasting Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled: We the undersigned residents of Australia draw the attention of the House to a promise made by the Liberal and National parties, namely that 'The Coalition will maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation' . We point out that the Honourable the Minister for Communications has foreshadowed presenting to the House, Appropriation Bills which will substantially reduce the funding appropriated by the Parliament to the ABC. Your petitioners therefore request that the House restore the ABC's funding base to is pre-1996/97 Budget level and index it to ensure that it is maintained in real terms. by Mr Lee (from 168 citizens). Cooked Chicken Meat Imports To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned draws to the attention of the House the importance of preserving high quarantine standards to maintain Australia's clean food reputation and to protect native wildlife. Your petitioners therefore requestThat the House calion the Federal Government to maintain the ban on cooked chicken meat imports because of the threat it poses to Australia's chicken meat industry, and the risk of introducing diseases which would threaten native bird life. by Mr Lee (from 48 citizens). Circus Animals is To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that under the Quarantine (Animals) Regulations of the Quarantine Act 1908, approval is given for the importation of free ranging exotic animals such as lions, tigers, bears, elephants and non-human primates to be used for entertainment purposes in circuses and mobile displays. The issue of circuses using animals is very complex and includes: Transportation of animals, where the animals are kept in tiny cages, often travelling in extremes of temperature over long periods; stressful training techniques, often based on fear, deprivation and brutality and often inhumane living conditions, which do not allow any display of instinctual behaviours. We also believe that inappropriate messages are put forward by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. It is certainly not consistent with the focus on environmental awareness for people, especially children to leam that it is acceptable to exploit wild animals for human entertainment. We therefore humbly ask that the House prohibit the importation of all animals including those listed under CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) for use in both international and Australian circuses. We ask this based upon the inhumane conditions that the animals are kept in, the conditions under which the animals are transported, the often cruel training procedures, and the inappropriate messages conveyed to children by forcing wild animals to perform circus tricks. by Mr Lieberman (from 22 citizens). Family Law To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the grossly unfair and biased nature of family law and child support system in Australia. Your petitioners therefore request that the House, for the sake of the children of Australia: investigate and inquire into the family law system; amend after significant consultation with, and input from, the Australian community the child support agency system; change frivolous protection orders so that children can share equal and unopposed access to both parents; take action so that parents can not take it upon themselves to deny access to either non-custodial extended family. by Mr Lindsay (from 1,327 citizens). Medicare Office: Coorparoo To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for the Medicare Office in Coorparoo to be kept open. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to support through the following measures the public's needs to have the Medicare Office remain open. Disadvantage to the aged and disabled in the local district Need for prompt local service to the public by Mr MCDougall (from 53 citizens). Medicare Office: Belmont To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain electors of the Division of Shortland draws to the attention of the House that residents of the East Lake Macquarie area would suffer serious difficulty and inconvenience if the Belmont Medicare office is closed. Your petitioners request the House to require the government to ensure that Belmont Medicare office remains open.  Nursing Homes To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of the Electorate of Shortland calls to the attention of the house that the proposal to allow nursing homes to charge an entry fee or bond discriminates against the most vulnerable frail, and sick members of our community. Your petitioners therefore request that the house forthwith abandon such proposals to permit the introduction of nursing home entry fees and to immediately restore full funding for capital assistance to nursing homes.  Superannuation Means Test Exemption To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia to the attention of the House the regressive decision by the Howard Government to remove the superannuation means test exemption for people under Age Pension age. The inclusion of superannuation assets for people aged 55 and over in the income and assets test for social security benefits from 20th September, 1997 is a retrograde step. This wiIllead to higher outlays on the Age Pension in future years and discourages domestic saving. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House recognise that the removal of the superannuation means test exemption for people aged 55 to Age Pension age is an unfair and disappointing decision. We call on the Howard Government to reverse this decision.  Newcastle To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of the Newcastle region draws to the attention of the House a statement hereon, supported by Newcastle community and church leaders, in support of our diverse community. I. Newcastle, is a community rich in diversity-a community which celebrates the contribution of men and women from diverse ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. As a city we affirm that such diversity has contributed to the vital and positive life-style which is enjoyed by everyone in our region. We are proud of the ""social mix"" which creates cohesion in our community. We welcome all peoples to our region, regardless of race, colour or creed. 2. We understand that some in the community are apprehensive about their employment prospects, others are anxious about crime and violence and many people are under considerable emotional stress. We believe that recognising and understanding these difficulties can help to unite us. We call upon all our community to protect the democratic rights of freedom of speech and the need to treat each other with respect and accept our individual dignity. 3. We encourage all fellow Australians to recognise the place of Newcastle in the world scene. We call upon the citizens of Newcastle to be outward looking and responsive to the needs of those less fortunate than ourselves. As a Nation we have committed ourselves to develop a framework for relating to each other and that is marked by a strong sense of cohesion and mutual respect for our differences. All are offered equality of esteem and community services. All are offered a place of belonging. We believe this to be a social contract that must be defended and protected in the name of calls God's justice and a truly democratic society. Your petitioners therefore ask the house to actively promote all of the above principles to all Australians.  Badgerys Creek Airport To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House that: I. a proposal has been made by the Department of Transport to build a major no-curfew international airport at Badgerys Creek, NSW; 2. airports are a major source of air pollution noise pollution; 3. western Sydney already suffers from the worse air and noise pollution in Australia; 4. an airport at Badgerys Creek, NSW, will only serve to greatly increase such pollution; 5. an airport at Badgerys Creek, NSW, will harm the lifestyle and well-being of citizens living and working in western Sydney. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House not pass any Bill which would lead to the construction of an airport at Badgerys Creek, NSW. by Mr Mossfield (from 1,832 citizens). Cooked Chicken Meat To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House their concern at the proposals to import cooked chicken meat into Australia, particularly the risk of disease to the poultry industry and native bird population, and the economic impact this will have on the domestic industry. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take such action as will ensure that there be no importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia. by Mr Mossfield (from 66 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of Citizens of Australia draws attention to the House of the regressive decision of the recent Federal Budget regarding Pharmaceutical Benefit changes. Modem drug therapy has enabled many citizens to retain a good occupation and to live a healthy and productive life. Many patients cannot have their therapy altered by the substitution of alternative medications. In this regard, we humbly beseech you to reinstate the previous Pharmaceutical Benefit arrangements. by Mr Mossfield (from 31 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of New South Wales draws to the attention of the House the regressive decision of recent Budget decisions relating to pharmaceutical benefits changes. Your petitioners therefore request that the matter be reconsidered due to the fact that modem and drug therapy has enabled many citizens to retain a good occupation and even gain promotion within employment and to take the cheapest drugs may not enhance this program but may in fact inhibit such good effects. by Mr Mossfield (from 25 citizens). Timed Local Calls To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the regressive decision by the Howard Government to allow small businesses to be charged for timed local calls on data services such as electronic mail, facsimile, the internet and other on-line services. This measure, if implemented, will have an adverse effect on the profitability, development and growth of small businesses across Australia. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House recognise that timed local calls on data services is an untenable proposition for small business. We calion the Howard Government to live up to their election promise to guarantee untimed local calls for small business in both voice and data services. by Mr Mossfield (from eight citizens). Veterans Rental· Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the house to the fact that under present legislation and or regulations a veteran receiving a pension from Department of Veterans' Affairs, living in rented premises, and receiving a rental allowance, is granted an allowance for war caused disabilities then the rental allowance of that veteran and hislher partner is reduced according to the sum of the disability allowance granted. As this reduction only applies to those veteran pensioners receiving a rental allowance it would appear to be a discrimination against these already disadvantaged veterans. Your petitioners therefore pray that the house will amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and/or regulations by deleting from 41-CI the words ""However if the person or persons partner receives a disability pension, the provisional amount of rent assistance may be reduced under point 41-ClO"" and further delete point 41-CIO. by Mr Nehl (from 3,907 citizens). Medicare Office: Deer Park To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws attention of the House the opposition in the Deer Park community and surrounding areas to the proposal by the Howard Government to close the Deer Park Medicare Office. The Deer Park Medicare Office carries out an essential service to a large area of the Western suburbs of Melbourne. It allows convenient and local access for Medicare users who are unable to travel to other more distant offices for immediate processing of their claims, or who require for budgeting purposes ready access to cash rebates. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to urgently review this decision, and allow the Deer Park Medicare Office to remain open. by Mr O'Keefe (from 1,156 citizens). Medicare Office: Mount Druitt To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Western Sydney calls to the attention of the House that proposed closure of Mt Druitt Medicare will cause hardship to many battling families.

Namely that: removal of operational subsidies to community - ased (not for profit) long day care centres will Increase fees, adding a greater financial burden to working parents. removal of operational subsidy to community based (not for profit) long day care centres in order to place them in competition with privately ?""Yne.d centres (operating for profit) is unfair, Imq-ltous and may result in a lesocial securityer quality of care for our children. We .request the House support the retention of operatIOnal subsidies to community based (not for profit) long day care centres and that community based (not for profit) child care continue to be valued and supported as a lower cost, high quality chIld care alternative for working parents.  Telstra Telecommunication Tower To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia, electors of the Division of Boothby and members of the St John's Grammar School community draw attention to the House that a Telstra Telecommunications Tower will be erected at the water tower on Sheoak Road Belair in close proximity to our school especially our Kindergarten.

The following citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House the: Very limited coverage of the Local Telephone Call area in which the City of Gympie and the Shire of Cooloola are situated with regard to population and services when compared with other areas of the State, especially the Sunshine Coast and the City of Brisbane.

Petitions received. NA Importation of New Zealand Apples",65
229,Mr ADAMS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I move: That this House: (1) recognises the risk to the Australian apple and pear industry should the Government allow the importation of apples from New Zealand; (2) considers the impact chemicals used to eradicate the disease will have on the local environment should fire blight take hold in local orchards; (3) acknowledges that despite new research from the New Zealand industry suggesting there is no risk of fire blight entering this country through the export of New Zealand apples, it is not a 100% guarantee and that the most effective no risk quarantine policy would be no imports of apples from New Zealand; (4) calls on the Government to provide certainty to the industry by taking a strong stand on Australia's quarantine standards as the Australian apple industry continues its expansion into the Asian market where the widespread image of Australian apples is that of a clean and fresh industry; and (5) calls on the Government, when making its announcement on this issue at the end of March, to protect Australia's apple industry and reject the importation of New Zealand apples. This is a very important issue and follows on from many of the other quarantine issues that have been discussed recently. This motion was originally put on the books in early March of this year. The wording of paragraph (5) is a little dated but the basic tenure of the motion is still current as, although a draft report made in April recommends a ban, there still has been no final decision about the Division of importation of New Zealand apples. It was thought that we would have to wait until the follow-up spring testing program for a decision to be made on the presence of fire blight. However, this work will commence shortly and, therefore, the final report on the decision will not be finalised before November at the earliest. These additional tests are also being carried out by AQIS, but with the assistance of a German expert to ensure there is rigour in the tests. As has been discussed across the country, on Monday 18 August the ABC's Countrywide program summarised thus: ... one of Australia's biggest advantages in agricultural trade has been its relative lack of contagious pests and diseases compared with its international competitors. Our clean status provides our farmers with a marketing edge and keeps our production costs down by not having to control the pests other countries have. Over the last 18 months tqey believe, and so do I, that that reputation has been questioned with a number of near miss pest incursions. The Nairn report, which was brought down recently, was looking into some of the problems faced by primary producers when dealing with AQIS, but this government is not prepared to address the fact that AQIS has tended to take the law into its own hands. One of the findings revealed that, over the last 25 years, the rate of incursions of plant pests and diseases was about 10 times more than that of animals; further, that there was a lack of confidence in the process of risk analysis. Despite all this, Australia has remained relatively free of many of the major pests and diseases of animals and plants, and we should ensure that our status is maintained. On Tuesday 19 August, the Australian Financial Review's reporter Nina Field said that the federal government had rejected a key Nairn recommendation to depoliticise contentious quarantine decisions by running Australia's quarantine service as an independent statutory authority and that it now wishes to retain it as part of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Earlier in the year it was found that, by some mysterious means, fire blight had somehow been introduced to the Melbourne and Adelaide botanical gardens. Tests on samples by Victoria's Institute of Horticultural Development, Macquarie University and Germany's Max Planck Horticultural Research Institute showed that the disease detected in the gardens was fire blight. The question which has not been answered is how the devil it got there. Are we to think that another nation is trying to sabotage our disease-free status and reputation; and why? Who would gain out of this? On a recent trip to New Zealand the question was raised-and I did not get any satisfactory answers. I was disappointed with some of the dismissive responses. A thorough investigation of the major fruit growing regions of Victoria and South Australia found no further trace of the disease. They were finally given the all clear in June. A media release on 19 June from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said that he 'regretted that fire blight had now finally been confirmed as present on a very limited number of ornamental host plants'. He continued: ... it was pleasing that surveys throughout Australia have failed to detect fireblight in commercial orchards, nurseries and urban areas. In the meantime producers had to suffer a threeor four-week ban on the interstate movement of fruit. Tasmanian growers who were just about to launch a trial shipment of Fuji apples to Japan had to abandon the attempt this year. Japanese buyers were so concerned at the reports of the disease they ordered one of their inspectors down to Tasmania to inspect the orchards thoroughly for evidence of fire blight. But they found nothing that would give them concern and gave the orchards a clean bill of health. While all this was going on, the harvested crop sat and rotted in the warehouse. I think Tasmania lost over $1 million in export earnings this year with this incident, and it has probably jeopardised next year's crop being fully developed. It has also delayed the entry of apples into the Japanese market by a year at the minimum because of the very strict controls they have there and the fact that we have another period of testing to come in spring. Tasmanians are also uncertain on what would happen should the spring testing discover some new evidence of fire blight on the mainland. Would they then be exposed to imports that could cause our industry in Tasmania to be threatened? There was a credibility problem because of the possible actions of another country. Compensation should be given, but it will not replace the doubt now made in an emerging market. We have to make sure that this sort of thing does not happen. There are still many unanswered questions. We need much stronger controls at points of entry into this country and strong penalties for those caught. The government has decided to formalise and upgrade AQIS disease risk assessment processes for imports, but whether this works properly in practice and whether this is enough remains to be seen. I believe that this botanic gardens incident needs to be settled. The only way that this can really be answered is to have a full and open inquiry. I do not think we can risk our industries by not having such an inquiry. We need to clean the air, and we need to have an open inquiry to do that. In the meantime we must be constantly vigilant to ensure that this country keeps its market edge by being disease free. It is not good enough to give lip-service to quarantine measures and then find they are not working. Growers want certainty, they want security and they want to be able to expand without fear of another country sabotaging their work. I hope that the final report on the importation of New Zealand apples will recommend a definite no. I am also concerned about the reports of apple juice concentrate coming in from China. It may also have a consequence for our growers here, but that will be another battle. I ask all sides of the House to support this motion to give the growers of Australia some faith in the political system.",74
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded? Mr Andren-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,76
231,Mrs STONE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I rise to give my wholehearted support to this motion in all of its parts. I commend the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams), for doing all that he can for his state's industry which has suffered my area has. For many, especially for those across the Tasman, this issue may seem to be simply about a trade dispute, but nothing could be further from the truth. This issue is all about the rights of an industry to be protected from exposure to a disease that would financially ruin it; a disease that has never been eradicatthose, ed once it has taken hold in orchards or nurseries. It is also about the rights of rural communities dependent on pome fruit to continue to exist. They need to exist with populations big enough and with enough financial freeboard so their schools, churches and service centres can survive. This issue is about the rights of populations and the natural environment to be protected from unnecessary levels of chemical application. It is about managing the water tables in the Goulburn and Murray valleys so future generations can continue to farm and the natural environment does not experience worsening salinity. This is also about giving our industry some means of defence when confronted with unfounded disparagement, which turns consumers away from their products. In short, this issue is not about trade. It is about minimising the risk of the virulent Erwinia amylovera bacteria crossing the Tasman on fresh apples and infecting our very healthy and disease-free pome fruit industry. When I was in New Zealand in June with the member for Lyons, key New Zealand industry spokesmen defended the extraordinary action of their scientists, the first of whom stole cuttings from the Melbourne botanic gardens before he announced that we had fire blight in this country. They argued in New Zealand that Australia had nothing to fear from fire blight infection. They said that their apple industry had grown since the disease had first become established in the early 1900s. That is in fact true. Their apple industry is in pretty reasonable shape right now. Having heard the New Zealanders express their amazement that we would be worried about this disease incursion, I asked the New Zealanders to comment on the condition of like their pear industry. The New Zealanders had little to say about their pears. The problem is that pears are highly susceptible to apple and pear fire blight. Because of this susceptibility New Zealand has a very small pear industry. In my electorate of Murray, we have the only substantial pear production in Australia. We grow 86 per cent of Australia's pears. Of most are Packhams and Bartletts, and those are the varieties that are most susceptible to being infected with apple and pear fire blight. There are seven major apple growing regions throughout Australia and only one region with a pear industry-and that happens to be my electorate of Murray. The Goulburn and Murray valleys have two canneries, Ardmona and SPC. They depend to a very large extent on the pear industry. They use the juices as the base for a lot of their products, and they are forever finding more innovative ways to use the pears that we grow that are sent to our domestic and export markets. ABARE has calculated that, while 20 per cent of the apple industry would be lost if orchards were infected with apple and pear fire blight-and 20 per cent, of course, is devastation enough-the loss to the pear industry would be well over 50 per cent. This would mean the end of the small fruit growing and manufacturing communities in the Goulburn and Murray valleys. It would have multiplier effects on the transport, manufacturing and service sectors. In effect, it would mean an impoverishment of the industry in the short term and then years of establishing alternative industries across our Goulburn and Murray valleys. Of course, all of this is totally avoidable if we make sure that we minimise the risk of exposing our industries to fresh pome fruit from countries which have had this disease long established. We are especially vulnerable in Australia, and in particular in the Goulburn and Murray valleys, because we have the climate and the humidity levels that are optimal for the spread of apple and pear fire blight. We have the clay soils, the rainfall and the warmth that apparently this bacteria thrives in. We have been protected so far because we are an island continent, and we hope that protection would go on forever. We would be insane to invite that protection to be willingly violated by importing thousands of tonnes of fresh apples from a country that is well and truly infected with the disease. The way that we irrigate in the Goulburn and Murray valleys makes us vulnerable to the disease spread should it reach our shores. In these valleys we have very high watertables. It has taken more than a generation of farmers to work out how to manage those watertables so that our productivity is not affected. In fact, we are now the food bowl of Australia. We have moved from furrow, or flood irrigation of the orchards, to first drip and now aerosol sprays. Unfortunately, we have been told by the experts that the aerosol sprays, by setting up turbulence in the air, one of the best ways to spread this tiny micro-organism. So we are advised that we would have to go back to the more damaging irrigation practices of earlier eras if this disease became established. We have to be low cost producers in Australia to compete domestically with low cost product that comes into this country, and to export. We do not want to have to expose the environment and our population to the potential damage of increased chemical use. But we know that one of the few ways to counter apple and pear fire blight is to use multiple applications of antibiotics. Indeed, those sprays are currently banned in Australia. What nation would invite upon its head the possibility of having to use a vastly more saturated chemical spraying regime when it - an red-ce that possibility by keeping potentially dlsease carrying fruit out of this try? We are trading on our image of being a clean, green, food producing nation. We do not want to have to change that reputation to one of high chemical dependency. Australia is therefore taking the threat of apple and pear fire blight very seriously indeed. When the New Zealand accusations came as a result of a scientist who, on his 36-hour holiday, plucked allegedly fire blight infected branches from two cotoneasters in the Melbourne botanic gardens, we went immediately into crisis mode. There was an immediate understanding of the potential damage to Australia, and we have nothing but praise for the way the departments of agriculture and the federal Department of Primary Industries and Energy moved quickly to try to overcome the problem. It was not very long after the first 'discovery' that another New Zealand scientist visited the Adelaide botanic gardens and also plucked some twigs from some shrubs. These twigs were also to test positive for some bacterial infection. The jury is still out about exactly what it was that infected those twigs. It seems that there may have been some nonvirulent strain of apple and pear fire blight. We were so concerned about the virulence of this disease that, not content to simply destroy the suspect trees in the two botanic are gardens, we immediately quarantined areas and set up surveys of the two million pome fruit trees in the Goulbum and Murray valleys, the pome fruit orchards throughout South Australia and the nurseries that grew hosts of the dreaded disease. I ask you to think about the impact of an orchard being quarantined-having the work of the packing sheds stopped; telling your workers who depend on that packing work to go home, with no income, in the peak season of the industry; stopping trucking in its tracks-while we very thoroughly investigated the claims of the New Zealand scientists. We found no evidence of any fire blight disease in the two million trees in the Goulbum and Murray valleys. Likewise there was no evidence found in South Australia. We are still waiting to see what spring brings us. I can only support very strongly the call of the coun- member for Lyons for a thorough investigation into what it was, and how that disease got into the botanic gardens. I hope that at the end of the day the suspicions do not prove to be the fact.",76
232,Mr ANDREN,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Calare) (4.58 p.m.)Developments since the motion on the importation of New Zealand apples was presented on 3 March have seen parts of this motion outdated. However, the specific issue it deals with-namely, fire blight and the opening up of our markets to New Zealand applesremains of vital importance to Australia. Fire blight-the scourge of any apple and pear industry-is the horticultural equivalent of foot and mouth disease. This bacteria thrives in warmer months and reduces yields by infecting individual fruit, blossoms and trees. In extreme cases, the disease destroys entire orchards. Once established, fire blight is almost impossible to cure. Its symptoms are treatable only by an expensive antibiotic which is not available in Australia and is not wanted because it adds another unknown dimension to the artificial control of disease in our primary industry and has obvious impacts on the environment-even by the secondary route of the need, as the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) pointed out, to incredibly increase our water regime once more and contribute to, in her case, the further salination of the Murray-Darling Basin. If fire blight takes hold in Australia, it threatens to devastate our apple and pear industries and contribute more to the degradation of our environment. On one estimate, the disease would cut output in these industries by $922 million over the next six years, interfere with interstate trade, damage our growing export markets and lead to thousands of job losses directly and to many more in associated industries. While 34 countries in the world are fire blight declared, until earlier this year Australhoping is was thought to be free of the disease. I believe it is still essentially free. But it all changed with the coincidental and, dare I say, controversial discovery in May of the dreaded disease in Melbourne and Adelaide botanic gardens. It was coincidental because the discoveries were made just as AQIS was in the throes of recommending rejection of a New Zealand application to export apples to Australia; and it was controversial because the discoveries were made by two New Zealand scientists-supposedly in Australia on holidays-who happened to stumble across the disease in these popular public gardens. Since this discovery, the disease has been confirmed as fire blight, but perhaps not the most virulent strain, by Australian and German scientists. At this stage-and luckily-the outbreak is thought to have been confined to the two botanic gardens sites. The fruit growing regions of Victoria and South Australia have been given the all clear, but not before suffering greatly from bans being placed on their produce by their northern neighbours while, as the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) indicated, the Tasmanian Fuji export opportunity to Japan has been lost for this year at least. For the sake of the industry, and especially for the hundreds of apple and pear growers and nurseries in my electorate of Calare, I sincerely hope AQIS is correct in predicting the disease has been contained or eradicated. But we will not know that until well after spring. However, in the meantime, the question remains: what is to be done about the importation of apples from New Zealand? According to AQIS, no final decision will be made on New Zealand's application until the full extent of the disease in Australia is confirmed. There are three possible outcomes: firstly, the survey will confirm the disease; secondly, it will find that the disease remains in the botanic gardens but has been contained; or, thirdly, it will show that the disease has in fact broken out. Undoubtedly, New Zealand is now in the process of compiling its response to our refusal, pending AQIS' s final decision, and anxiously-if not maliciouslythat the spring survey confirms the disease has not been contained so they can argue that their apples should be let in. Regardless of the outcome, the government's preliminary decision to reject New Zealand's application should remain as is. Even if the disease has not been contained to the botanic garden sites, fire blight is not widespread in Australia. At most, it will be restricted to some areas of Victoria and South Australia. Because of this, our internal quarantine measures should be able to restrict its spread. I do not envy the government's position but trust that, with the Nairn review and the botanic gardens scare, measures will be put in place to ensure fire blight is eradicated and kept out of Australia for good. We must not allow this to be interpreted as a chink in our quarantine wall, with the wall therefore having to be demolished. That would suit New Zealand and other countries determined to infect the mythical level playing field with every disease under the sun. AQIS's decision to reject New Zealand's application was the correct one. Under no circumstances should the government allow New Zealand apples into Australia. I commend the member for Lyons's motion to the House. (Time expired)",78
233,Mr ANDREW,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"I, too, welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate. Ever since the legendary garden of Eden story, it would seem that the apple has been a fruit surrounded in controversyand never more acutely than in 1997 when the whole question of what would happen to the Australian apple industry emerged, as the member for Calare (Mr Andren) and the member for Lyons (Mr Adams) have said, following the alleged finding of fire blight in botanic gardens in both Victoria and Adelaide. I rise as a member of the government because the one thing I fear out of the motion by t-e member for Lyons is that it implies that In some way the government is going to take a more relaxed view of quarantine following this discovery of what mayor may not have been fire blight in the botanic gardens of Adelaide and Melbourne than it did prior to that. I want to reassure the member for Lyons and, if necessary, the member f?r <:alare-they have both been very objective In their remarks-and the entire House that - here is no way in which the government consl-ers q-arantine and quarantine standards negottable m order to achieve particular trade outcomes. ,. The government's record on quarantine is !1Ul excellent one. The very fact that the government rejected the 1996 New Zealand application for the import of New Zealand apples into Australia indicates how serious the government is about quarantine. The government sees its quarantine standards as nonnegotiable. We all do the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) a gross disservice if we run any sort of debate that suggests that he is relaxing his view on quarantine. Quite the contrary is the case. He is the minister who has committed an additional $76 million to tidying up and strengthening the role of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The government will not be sacrificing its conservative approach to quarantine for any trade reasons at all. What the House has to realise is this: the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has no choice in whether or not New Zealand apples or any other apples come into Australia. The determination as to whether or not our country is open to the import of apples is entirely pivoted on the outcome of the scientific evaluation of risk. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is caught in that scientific evaluation. We have already declared the import of New Zealand apples, on two occasions at least, as posing a risk and, to the credit of the ministers of the time-including the present minister-said no on those grounds. Mr Adams-What about the public interest?",79
234,Mr ANDREW,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The member for Lyons can make all the political points he likes. If there is no evidence of risk, the minister has nothing left with which to defend his decision. The obligation rests with the Australian apple industry and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to point out what the risk is because, short of that risk evaluation, we will be before the bar of the W orId Trade Organisation faster than you can say 'Granny Smith', and we will be there simply because we will be seen by the WTO to have broken the rules. The member for Lyons must understand thisMr Adams interjecting",79
235,Mr ANDREW,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,I say to the member for Lyons that I will happily put the squeeze on my orange growers any time. I want to take up this issue of the WTO. What must be understood is that if we do not treat imports and exports solely on the basis of risk-if we want to run some sort of unproven quarantine barrier-we can scarcely be surprised when our trade competitors do the same thing to us. That is the bind we are in.,79
236,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. ABC Charter Debate resumed from 3 March, on motion by Mr Broadbent for Mr Lieberman: That this House: (1) notes in the recommendations by Mr Bob Mansfield on the role and functions of the ABC, that a revised ABC Charter should emphasise the importance of providing services to regional Australia and the need for ABC services generally to reflect tralian regional and cultural diversity; (2) strongly endorses the recommendation; and (3) calls on the Government to adopt the recommendation and to expand urgently the Charter accordingly.",80
237,Mr HARDGRAVE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"The key point in the motion before us today is that there is a lack of regionalism in the ABC's practice. You only have to look in Queensland for a good example. In Townsville and Rockhampton the operations have been progressively wound down over the past 15 years. A lot of the facilities are still there these days, but in the case of ABC television facilities they are essentially mothballed, and they have been for years-for 10 years that I can vouch for. The same is basically true in Brisbane. Essentially, what we have from the ABC's senior management is a Sydney-Melbournecen.tric approach. To them, Brisbane is a regIOnal area and anything outside of Sydney and Melbourne is regional Australia. In fact, there is an acronym within the ABC called the BAPH states, which stands for Brisbane Adelaide, Perth and Hobart. They are put int-)De box and Sydney and Melbourne are put mto another. All of these cutbacks have nothing to do with any additional budgetary pressure that the ABC has had put on it either by this government or the previous government. The BAPH states have always been treated differently. They are the first ones to lose funds and the first ones to find their resources are being wound back while everything in Sydney and Melbourne is essentially quarantined. It is certainly quarantined a lot more than the BAPH states. Ten years ago I worked for the corporation. I was on the 7.30 Report. That was a valuable experience. It gave me quite an insight into the way that Aunty works. Mr Latham-Any bias?",80
238,Mr HARDGRAVE,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"There was certainly no bias. My coverage of the 1987 federal election was very well chronicled. Myoid colleagues in Brisbane tell me how the ABC wastes money these days. The Queensland Aus- operation, by comparison, is certainly as lean and mean as you can get. All Queensland media seems to be this way. The ABC TV journos and camera crews work just as hard as those in the commercial stations do. These ABC stalwarts, in a lot of cases, look on with anger and envy at the way Sydney and Melbourne arrange things. They point to the range of people who are caught up in the heavy bureaucracy surrounding the production of shows like the 7.30 Report. They have a producer for this and a producer for that and probably a producer for lunch and drinks. They point to the way that middle and upper management of the ABC in Sydney and Melbourne do everything they can to make sure they survive, despite whatever cutbacks may occur. The talent drain, which does occur as a result of this-there are redundancies that oc.cur mainlr in the regions-is a very sad thmg, espeCIally when a few higher profile Sydney based presenters seem to soak up a lot of the money mstead of the money being used to keep and train other staff who have always kept the ABC going in and around regional Australia, that is, everywhere except Sydney and Melbourne. Every time there is pressure on the ABC budget, the pointy end gets cut first. It is a lot like the analogy of the librarian who said that a library is a great place to work if only people would not borrow books. After all, isn't the ABC in the business of the production of radio and television programs relevant to all Australians? Surely, regional programs and regional program production is an area which should be amongst the last affected. In my first speech to this place I noted my concern for a general problem in the bureaucracy, seemingly maintaining their system rather than affecting the outcome of their ticular enterprise. Certainly the same is true for the ABC, particularly the Sydney and Melbourne people, while all the other states suffer. Places like the regions, including all parts of Australia except Sydney and Melbourne, get cut. The moguls in the Ultimo Centre make the decision to bravely sacrifice everyone else and anything else apart from themselves. It is very important that this motion is discussed today because it does put the pressure on the government to put the pressure on the ABC to look more closely at regional Australia to make sure that regional issues and regional programming are back in focus at the ABC. While networking may be the way of the commercial operators-they too have started to realise that audiences are starting to tum off-they have had to start to focus on localism as a commercial operation. It is certainly the buzz word in every market around Australia as commercial operators try to prove their local credentials, but not so the ABC, especially television and even now, unfortunately, metropolitan and regional radio. I wonder if the answer lies in divvying up the ABC's annual half a billion dollar budget on a state-by-state basis and giving it to state management to sort out what is relevant to their particular patch first and then pooling resources for nationally relevant programs. I would certainly have more faith in the Brisbane based management than the Sydney moguls who do not really seem to understand anything except what is inside the central part of Sydney. . Local management should and could make decisions which best suit their local audiences if they had equitable access to that half a billion dollars each year. I really do not think the ABC understands just how badly they have let down regional Australia. The production of the 7.30 Report being taken out of Queensland has been a major talking point ever since. We are parochial in Queensland, but it is a very important issue. (Time expired)",80
239,Mr OCONNOR,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"This is a very important issue to my electorate and to people in rural and regional Victoria. Those parpeople rely very heavily on the services that are provided by the ABC. They also appreciate very strongly the impact that the ABC has on defining the national culture. They are a very important part of that cultural formation in this country. People in my electorate-and, indeed, throughout the length and breadth of rural and regional Victoria-have viewed with considerable concern the measures that have been taken by the government to date in attacking the resource base of the ABC. I am very pleased that this particular motion that is before the House gives all members an opportunity to make some comment on the importance of the ABC to rural and regional dwellers not only in the state of Victoria but throughout the length and breadth of Australia. If the ABC is to continue to playa prominent role in providing regional dwellers with information and news services and a whole variety of services, it must be resourced for sufficiently . We note that before the last election the then opposition, now the government of the day, made a very specific commitment: to maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. They have betrayed that particular commitment to the Australian people, and it is this betrayal that has caused so much concern and so much consternation for people in regional areas of Victoria and Australia. The coalition also made another commitment: to maintain the current prohibition on advertising and sponsorship on ABC television and radio. That specific commitment was soon jettisoned by the current government. This has led to a great deal of political activity by people across the political spectrum in defence of the ABC. They have seen the budget cuts as a thinly veiled attack on this very important Australian institution which not only is a definer of our culture but also ensures, through diversity of media ownership, an alternative analysis and viewpoint political events of the day here in Australia and internationally. I commend Friends of the ABC in the Geelong region. They are extremely active. They have a strong membership which is drawn from across the political spectrum. They have been to speak to me on two occasions and have expressed their deepest concerns about the future of the ABC and its role as a national broadcaster in the wake of the funding cuts that have been announced by the government. They have asked me to bring to the attention of this parliament at every opportunity-and I am doing so here today in the context of this motion-their concern about the poor levels of morale in the ABC and the manner in which the funding cuts are eating away at the ABC's opportunity to provide the wide range of services that they have been used to in the past and have come to expect from their national broadcaster. They are extremely concerned about the capital funding cuts, which are effectively running down the ABC's capacity to deliver those services. On behalf of the Friends of the ABC in Geelong, I table their concerns today in the context of this motion about the future of the ABC and I implore the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to think again about the impact that his government's policies and the lack of resourcing and funding are having on the ability of the ABC to provide a comprehensive and fundamental broadcasting service to people in rural and regional Victoria, including Geelong.  to this motion moved by the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent), can I first say that the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) focused his entire speech not on the motion at hand but on a government bashing exercise in which he tried to cover the funding of the ABC and supposed cuts to it, sponsorship and advertising and Friends of the ABC, and he at no point dealt with the issue at hand, which is a motion to do with the ABC charter and the resolutions by Bob Mansfield that the ABC have a greater focus on regional and rural Australia and also on the cultural and of regional diversity of Australia. That is what this motion moved by the member for MCMillan is about-the cultural diversity and regional nature of Australia and the fact that the ABC should be taking greater account of that-and I support it. In doing so, I welcome the appointment of Donald MCDonald as Chairman of the ABC, which was a very wise and correct appointment to that position. His comments since that time have given us heart because he has responded to these concerns of the Mansfield inquiry by saying that the ABC should have greater regional and culturally diverse activities. I welcome his comments and I welcome his appointment. He is a very good man. However, we have heard these sorts of soothing comments from previous chairmen of the ABC-not so long ago by Professor Mark Armstrong, and later I will get to some examples of what happened under his tenure. In terms of the Mansfield report, the government very wisely in deciding to make changes at the ABC set up the Mansfield inquiry so that we would be able to look to the next century with some sort of sense of plan, some sort of vision, that would also give the ABC some heart that they had an important place in Australian society in the future. Much of what Mr Mansfield has come up with has been acted upon by the ABC very favourably. The evidence is very clear that, while Australians spend 8c per person per day on the ABC, 6c of that is going to and being spent in Sydney. Sadly, many of the poorest parts of the Commonwealth are subsidising one of the wealthiest parts of the Commonwealth, Sydney, to the tune of 6c out of that 8c spent per person per day on the ABC. Examples in South Australia of recent activity by the ABC have been manifest. Only recently the 7.30 Report and the Bottom Line were cut in terms of their state based focus and being produced in each capital city, going quite against the trends of the commercial television stations with such programs as Today Tonight, which is produced locally in South Australia and also in other capital cities. The 7.30 Report is not produced in each capital city as it used to be; it is produced in Sydney with small local segments being put into it to make it appear local. The simple fact of the matter is that it is not local. Another example is a program called Susan Mitchell in Conversation, an Adelaide based production which was axed by the ABC in 1994 amidst great consternation by the South Australian federal members of parliament, both Labor and Liberal. Susan Mitchell in Conversation was in the 6.30 timeslot and cost $100,000 to produce each year. It was $100,000 very well spent and it was very cheap for a local state production. The show was cut by the ABC after 18 months. That suggested that there was no talent in South Australia, no expertise worth encouraging and promoting, and that all the talent and expertise was in Sydney. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, as a Victorian member of parliament, and the minister at the table, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), as a Queensland member of parliament, are both well aware that not all the talent in media is focused in Sydney. Sadly, many of the Sydney members of parliament believe that it is, but we know that that is not the case. No consideration was given by Professor Armstrong and David Hill to a different timeslot for Susan Mitchell in Conversation and that show was peremptorily cut. Importantly, there are two reasons why the ABC charter should be regional. The first, of course, is that we recognise there is expertise well beyond Sydney in this area of production of media and entertainment. The second reason is that there is real talent that is worth fostering. If there is not a regional focus for the ABC, then that talent might go elsewhere. It may just dissipate and go into other forms of jobs. Unfortunately, we will lose that talent from the media and entertainment industry. So I very much support the motion moved by the !Dember for MCMillan and ask for its support In the House. (Time expired)",81
240,Mr DARGAVEL,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"It would be interesting to hear the sponsor of this motion, the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent), or the previous speaker, the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), talk about requirements for licence holders of private providers in the similar terms that they are talking about the ABC. The AGB MCNair survey commissioned by the New South Wales Farmers Association revealed that four out of five farmers listen to ABC radio on a regular basis. The ABC is absolutely critical to news, information and entertainment services in regional Australia. We have an excellent and very costeffective service in 2CN in the ACT. It is religiously balanced in its reporting. It often asks difficult questions of all sides of politics. The ABC news is all the more important in my region because the private operators in this area have been sacking radio journalists and syndicating the news gathered by those journalists so that we have fewer points of view in the ACT than we had earlier. However, we also have the excellent services in analysis provided by 2CC as well as 2CN. The capacity of the ABC to serve regional Australia is predicated on the resources which it has available to it. That is the bottom line. That is why, in my view, the coalition made the solemn commitment in its document 'Better communications' before the last election that it would maintain existing levels of Commonwealth funding to the ABC. The coalition knows that, to conservative voters, the ABC is very important. It is very important to regional Australia in particular. But, despite that solemn promise, $209 million got carved off the ABC amidst all sorts of outrageous allegations to do with political bias and the like. In my experience, that was the driving agenda behind the backflip over funding to the ABC. There was an apprehension of bias, despite all of the available evidence to the contrary that the ABC is religiously balanced in its reporting of debates in this place and elsewhere. So what we are left with essentially is the bananas without the pyjamas in regional Australia. A lot of the services which we find to be very important in regional Australia have been trimmed back. Some of them have been mentioned during this debate. But, if you cut $209 million-a significant proportion-out of the budget of the ABC, and if they are to be responsible managers of the public resources and the funding given to them, they have no alternative but to deal with the funding cuts made by this government. That means that they will cut services to regional Australia. I do not think that is acceptable outcome. I believe the ABC should be sufficiently resourced, at least to the tune that the previous government resourced the ABC, so that those services to regional Australia as well as to the cities can continue to be provided. To my mind it is a little bit odd to attack the ABC and reduce its resources and then to complain bitterly when some of the services which are provided from those resources are withdrawn from areas which are likely to give rise to criticism from conservative electorates. I think it is quite strange. What I hope to see in the future is a private stated: member's bill that will be calling upon the restoration of that funding. I hope the speakers from the other side of this House who have complained about the withdrawal of services to regional Australia will take the opportunity of putting their money where their mouth is and support another bill designed to reinstall those services which are having to be wound back from all areas. Mr EO IN CAMERON (Stirling) (5.28 p.m.)-I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion moved by the member for MCMillan (Mr Broadbent) as one in this House who spent nine years as an employee of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and then the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. There are many misconceptions in the community both about the ABC and about the coalition's attitude to the ABC. I think it is important to say at the outset that the coalition is a friend of the ABC. There is a myth that is perpetuated in the community and in the organisation-Friends of the ABC is one that is guilty of pushing this myth-that the coalition is anti the ABC. That proposition could not be further from the truth. The fact that the government has made a decision about the funding to the ABC is not a reflection on the ABC. Rather it is an indictment of the former government for allowing debt to blowout to such an extent and leaving the responsibility for addressing the problem to the coalition. Anyone who condemns the government for asking the ABC to share the burden of fixing the problem may be a friend of the ABC, but they would be an an enemy of Australia's youth for wanting them to inherit the debt bequeathed by the former government. On winning government, the coalition saw the need to bring the national broadcaster into the 21 st century-hence, the Mansfield inquiry. The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, in his media release announcing the inquiry, said: The government has made it clear in these terms of reference and directly to Mr Mansfield the priority it places on services to rural and remote communities as well as children and other significant groups not well served by other broadcasting services. Recommendation 6 of the Mansfield inquiry A revised ABC charter emphasises the importance of providing services to regional Australia and the need for the ABC services generally to reflect Australia's regional and cultural diversity. This is a motion with which I am sure no member would disagree. The ABC's charter is an outline of the purposes for which the ABC has been established and is set out under section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Act 1983. Whilst the ABC is fully conversant with and provides for the needs of rural and regional Australia, there is no specific obligation on the ABC to cater for those needs outlined in the charter. As has been mentioned, Mr Mansfield's recommendation stated that a revised charter emphasised the importance of providing services to regional Australia. Of all the submissions made to the Mansfield inquiry, 19.9 per cent considered that services relevant to rural and remote communities are an important part of the ABC's operations. Given the tyranny of distance we face in Australia, many people in regional and remote areas of the country find the ABC their link to the rest of Australia and their only means of receiving regular and accurate news about their community, their state, their nation and the wider world. I note that the charter states that the corporation quite rightly takes account of the multicultural character of the Australian community, and I say that is a necessary clause, given our multicultural society. - y electorate of Stirling is a fine example of the diverse mix of cultures within our nation. It takes great pride in both the ABC and SBS. Given that we are talking about the services provided by the ABC to regional Australia, SBS also needs to be considered for extension to major regional centres in Western Australia such as Geraldton and Albany, which are not provided with the luxury, if you can call it that, enjoyed by similar centres on the eastern seaboard. However, given that the charter provides a specific clause for the corporation to take account of the nation's multicultural character, there is no reason why it should not include a specific reference in the charter emphasising the importance of servicing regional Australia, to reflect Australia's regional and cultural diversity. Our nation and our nation's character are not just built in - elbourne or Sydney or Canberra; the real character of Australia is found in our regions, where our nation fully developed. Our regions-I include Perth in that term because Perth is too often neglected by those living east of the rabbit-proof fence-are the pillars on which our nation's character is built. It is essential, therefore, that the nation's broadcaster specifically emphasises in its charter the importance of servicing regional Australia and ensuring that the services of the ABC reflect Australia's regional and cultural diversity. As one Western Australian stated in their submission the to - ansfield inquiry, 'The ABC is the glue which holds the nation together.' It does this by addressing the needs of all Australians, urban and regional, and the needs of all cultures. To ensure that this glue maintains the bond in the future, a revised charter for the ABC should emphasise these values. I certainly commend the motion to the House.",83
241,Mr MARTYN EVANS,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,"Some institutions are so important that they become part of the cultural fabric of the nation, and the ABC is one such institution for Australia. Whether you look at news, public affairs, documentaries, entertainment, children's programming,-and who among us does not remember growing up on a diet of Four Corners in our earlier formative political years?-you will understand the importance of the ABC to public broadcasting in Australia. The ABC caters to a number of different audiences. It caters to a regional audience in a geographical sense. It caters to audiences across regions in the sense of programming for specific audience groups like young people, for example, and documentary programming, including areas of great importance to the Australian nation. For example, its science programming, its science reporting, is of particular significance to the ABC. The ABC maintains a number of very important science programs and health programs on its radio network and has Quantum on the television network. So the ABC not only caters to geographical regions but also caters to a number of sectoral interests in the Australian population, each of which has a vital role to play in the further development of our nation. The ABC does not need its charter amended to reinforce the need for it to address those aspects of Australian public broadcasting, although I do not oppose that. What the ABC needs is adequate funding. If the ABC is funded and resourced adequately it will meet its obligation to cater to regional Australia, to rural Australia, to the science community, to young people through Triple J, to the news consuming community through the PNN network and to organisations like the orchestras for those who favour more cultural pursuits. The reality is that all of those depend entirely on adequate funding for the ABC. A number of us in this place will be friends of the ABC, many of us on this side of the House and some, indeed, on the opposite side of the House. But this government is no friend of the ABC. One only needs look at its recent budget decisions to draw that very obvious conclusion. The amount of money which has been taken from the ABC's budget in the two budgets of this government speaks volumes for this government's commitment to the ABC. It simply is not there. Indeed, leaked cabinet documents imply that the only reason the Mansfield inquiry was set up was to give the government a smokescreen, a cover, under which it could withdraw even greater amounts from the ABC. When the Mansfield inquiry took place, the public response was so strong-I think even Mansfield was overwhelmed by it-that the importance of the ABC to Australia came home very firmly to this government and, instead of withdrawing the $100 million or so that it intended to withdraw, it ended up removing somewhat less. The ABC ended up below the adequate threshold of funding which even Mansfield recommended. That has ensured that the ABC has had to gradually withdraw some services. The funding is simply not there. Mansfield had some important recommendations about the ABC being an independent news generator. I think they are vital. He also, though, unfortunately, recommended the ABC should get out of programming and should cease on the whole to produce programs for domestic consumption. I think that is a grave mistake. It withdraws cultural input from this country which we will not get from the commercial stations or from pay TV and it removes a whole creative infrastructure from the public sector which otherwise would be able to provide a very substantial lead to those in the Australian community who want to follow that. One other vital thing which I would like to talk about in the minutes remaining is the proposal to virtually close down Radio Australia. When the Mansfield report first came out it was very clear that Radio Australia was on the chopping block. It has now been partially saved by decisions of the ABC board-not by decisions of this government, which was prepared to stand by and watch Radio Australia effectively close down. For some $13 million this government was prepared to sacrifice a vital link that Australia has not to regional Australia but to the region in which we live in the world-a vital region for us culturally and in trade terms, and very much a region where the ABC and voice of Radio Australia are well respected. They provide an independent source of news and commentary and they provide an Australian perspective.",85
242,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS,Order! The time allotted for this debate has now expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Australian Capital Territory Heroin Trial,86
243,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in the grievance debate today to bring to the notice of the parliament the public split between the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) over cabinet's decision to withdraw federal funding support for the ACT heroin trial. I believe it mirrors the indecision, the confusion and the deep differences which exist among Australians about how best to combat the nation's tragic heroin problem. Now that the Prime Minister has extinguished all hope of a trial going ahead, the question which now must be asked is: where to from here? Whichever direction the government decides to proceed in, whatever proposals the minister for health is considering following the recent review of the national drug strategy, for the sake of this nation's battle against heroin and for the sake of the public's confidence in that battle three steps must now be taken. First, the minister for health must tackle cabinet for an increase in the amount of money spent on the national drug strategy. I am not so naive as to imagine that every drop of money obtained from Commonwealth taxes and excise on alcohol and tobacco could, or even should, go on anti-drug education, treatment or law enforcement. However, spending only $33 million on the national drug strategy out of the roughly $4 billion collected from these avenues every year is an insult in the present climate-just as it was under the previous government. I hope members on the government side heard that last comment. We on this side of the House are not attempting to suggest, as the Prime Minister today at question time tried to indicate we were suggesting, that the heroin problem began on 2 March 1996. It is a problem that governments at all levels and of all political colours have wrestled with. It  to deal with the matter, complete with all its associated unpleasantries. Secondly, the Attorney-General (Mr WilIiams) has to win a few battles of his own. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has pointed out, the Australian Federal Police budget has been cut by $37.6 million over the last two years. The force is expected to lose over 100 agents between now and the year 2000 as a result of these cuts. Despite the Prime Minister's denials today, these are the facts. A number of other departments under the Attorney-General's responsibility have also had their budgets slashed-the National Crime Authority, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and AUSTRAC, the agency responsible for targeting money laundering operations. What do we hear from the Attorney-General in defending them? It is up to the Attorney-General to win that funding back so that these departments can operate efficiently. Thirdly and finally, if the failure to get ACT heroin trial up and running has taught us anything it is the crucial importance of getting broad public support for something as delicate and as significant as devising new and better strategies to combat the current heroin plague. To my mind, the best means of achieving this-as I have said countless times before in this House-is to start by holding a national drug summit. Whichever direction we take in our fight against heroin we need to keep the public thoroughly informed. We all know with how much cynicism and suspicion the Australian public regard politicians and the decision making process. In relation to the ACT heroin trials, many people had the feeling, whether valid or not, that they were having the legal prescription of heroin thrust down their throats-and this by politicians who had spent the last 30 years stressing to them the associated evils of the heroin trade. I suggest that many may feel the same frustration about the Prime Minister's faceless and nameless 'task force', to which he referred in question time today. The Prime Minister is in danger of making the same mistakes as those in charge of the ACT heroin trial if he does not somehow involve the Australian people in the search for solutions. A national drug summit is all about keeping the public up to date with whatever new strategies are on the table and thereby shutting out that cynicism and suspicion. It is about making any discussion or decision making process completely transparent. It is about bringing the public along with the policy makers when they choose the new steps we need to take to carry our fight against heroin into the 21 st century. The Prime Minister and the minister for health would, of course, set some parameters for the summit to work within. Those who lobbied for the ACT heroin trial should face the fact that, for better or worse, the issue now seems to be well and truly off the agenda; to discuss it any further at the summit would be a waste of time. Let those assembled discuss other options-options that perhaps could prove even more effective than the heroin trial may ever have been. Let those attending channel their energies into these the areas and we may find that some level of consensus is actually possible. Once again let me make it clear to this House: a national drug summit is not about hollow gestures. It is not about political grandstanding. It is not about trying to make one side of politics look more decisive or convincing than the other-a crime the Prime Minister, I might add, would like to smear the opposition as being guilty of. Nor is it something that private individuals or organisations, however well intentioned, can organise off their own bats. It is something that must enjoy the active participation of this country's Prime Minister if it is to have any real meaning. It is about making sure that the public feel confident that not only are society's leaders-politicians and non-politicians alike-coming up with more effective means of combating the evils of heroin and the heroin trade but also the steps being decided upon are in line with what they consider to be morally and socially acceptable. This being the case, one question demands answering: why have the Prime Minister and the minister for health previously been so ready to reject the idea of a national drug summit? When I was the first person in this parliament to put a summit to both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services, their responses were immediately dismissive. It was a knee-jerk reaction to a suggestion they cynically suspected as springing from ulterior political motives rather than genuine concern. The language they used to describe a national summit was indicative of this- 'wasteful of resources,' they called it; 'unnecessary'; 'a cheap stunt'; 'window dressing' - yet state Premiers as diverse as Bob Carr and Richard Court have now been giving their support to a summit. Why? It is my belief that it is because the Carr and Court governments are on the front line of the heroin tragedy. Over half the heroin related deaths in Australia last year were in New South Wales. In Western Australia, the heroin trade has exploded out of all proportion with that state's population. Both the New South Wales and Western Australian governments are fighting a losing battle with limited police numbers and even more limited health resources. I am sure both have different views on the ways to tackle heroin, but they both see the need for a sea change in this nation's approach to the drug and the role that a national drug summit could play in bringing this about. What of the Prime Minister's continued indifference, despite his comments today in question time? I suspect the Prime Minister's reticence springs from the fact that perhaps he still sees the heroin problem as something happening on only a limited scale in some outlying suburbs of metropolitan Australia and therefore is not worthy of such a national response. Such a view is misguided in the extreme. Let me repeat my position again for the Prime Minister's benefit. My area of Sydney, like others around Australia, is experiencing a heroin plague which I do not think he or any other member can fully appreciate or comprehend from pictures merely carried in the morning newspapers or on the evening news. It is a tragedy that can be fully digested only after visiting in person an area like mine. The statistics on the number of heroin related deaths each year do not tell the whole story, however distressing they may be. Read the numbers and they are forgotten the next day, but talk to a 16-year-old kid on the street who is already an addict and it is a haunting moment that cannot help but spur you into action. I noticed the Minister for Health and Family Services, while in damage control mode last week, attempt to draw the focus away from the heroin problem and place it on the far greater number of people dying from tobacco related causes in Australia each year. To this I say to him: yes, Health Minister, tobacco does cause more deaths but, to be blunt, I don't see tobacco destroying and dividing families in my electorate beyond repair and turning out kids of 11 and 12 who, once you look into their eyes, you realise aren't kids any more. I have invited the Prime Minister to join me in visiting Cabramatta and Fairfield to see for himself the effect that heroin has had on the area-I heard him talking about drug workers 'at the coalface' today-but I still have not received a reply from him. I extend the invitation to him again publicly in this House. I will be happy to show the Prime Minister the real war on drugs first-hand, and it is a depressing sight. As members on the other side who have seen it with their own eyes know, it is a battle that we are losing. If the Prime Minister would prefer not to visit with me, I can accept that, but the important thing is that he goes-and soon. If he cannot go to Cabramatta and Fairfield, I suggest he goes to Collingwood or Footscray in Melbourne, Inala in Brisbane or Northbridge in Perth. I can almost guarantee we will see some quick action after such a visit. Should he go, I am sure the Prime Minister would not need a task force to convince him of the merits of a national drug summit. I do not doubt the Prime Minister when he says he is as concerned as the next Australian about the evils of heroin. To a degree, I share his reticence about the ACT heroin trials. I am also glad to see that now he is at least open to the suggestion of a national drug summit. I wonder what could have changed his mind? But, that said, it is simply not good enough for the Prime Minister to knock the heroin trial on the head without putting forward any alternative suggestions on reinvigorating the nation's fight against heroin. It is simply not good enough that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Family Services continue to respond so coolly and with such detachment to something as positive as a national drug summit. It is a proposal with enormous merit. (Time expired) Alice Springs-Darwin Rail Link Aboriginal Land Rights",86
244,Mr DONDAS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in this grievance debate today to welcome the positive statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in regard to the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link and, of course, the positive statements made over the weekend and also in answer to the question I asked today. The information received will allow the Northern Territory and South Australian governments to proceed immediately to the marketplace and to also form the Australasian Railway Corporation. The project itself certainly does have some major significance to the Northern Territory and South Australia and also to the Australian community. You yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, have been involved in discussions on both the positive and the negative sides for the railway, and you would be very familiar with the discussions that have taken place over many years. But the announcement made by the Prime Minister over the weekend certainly was a very important announcement that the people of the Northern Territory have been waiting for for some 70-odd years. The Australian Railway Project will involve th- private sector in the completion of the r-lway between Adelaide and Darwin. SpeCIfically, the private sector will build, own, operate and ultimately transfer back to the public sector a standard gauge railway between Alice Springs and Darwin. The total length of the project is 1,410 kilometres and the construction cost is estimated to be just over a billion dollars in 1996 dollars. That was the figure obtained from BHP Engineering. Design and construction is expected to take four years, commencing in 1998, and with this construction completion of a national mainline rail network will be realised with all mainline capitals linked by rail. The project will incorporate the Tarcoola to Alice Springs railway into its operation and will be integrated with the port operation at the new port of Darwin. The route survey has been completed using much of the Commonwealth government's funds of some $24 million in 1996 dollars. Seventy-five per cent of the land has been acquired and leasehold negotiations for the 20 per cent of Aboriginal owned land are well advanced. Land use objectives were declared in October 1996 for the entire corridor in the Northern Territory and the environmental management plan has been cleared by the Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments. Archaeological and heritage studies have been completed and, with the cooperation of the Northern Lands Council, the work on avoiding Aboriginal sacred sites has been completed in the northern half and in the southern half and, with the cooperation of the Central Land Council, work is proceeding to resolve the last two sites. Due diligence to the Tarcoola to Alice Springs railway is in process. The Commonwealth government built the railway between 1975 and 1980 at a cost of $414 million, and it has agreed to transfer the line to a consortium building, owning and operating the railway to Darwin. Documentation calling for expressions of interest from the private sector has been completed, and at this stage an $80 million new deepwater port in Darwin will be completed later this year. The Prime Minister, after announcing the Federation Fund, wrote to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory on 13 May 1997. He said: The Fund will be used to finance major projects which will generate jobs in the construction phase and make a significant and ongoing contribution to the Australian Community. I believe that the announcement of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link certainly meets those criteria enunciated by the Prime 11inister on 13 11ay. The railway will be a major infrastructure project of national significance and will: generate 2,000 direct jobs during construction and 200 direct jobs in operation; make a significant and ongoing contribution to Australia, being a major investment in the nation's economic base with a high level of Australian content generating income for over 100 years; provide an alternative and competitive means for Australia's engagement in trade with Asia, capitalising on the transit time savings the rail-port project will deliver; and generate substantial savings in repairs and maintenance costs for the national road network. It will also provide additional infrastructure for the defence build-up which is taking place in the northern part of Australia at the moment-as you would be aware yourself, 11r Deputy Speaker Hollis, having visited the Territory on Public Works Committee hearings to evaluate first-hand the importance of the defence build-up in the Northern Territory. In earlier days, the defence department made a positive submission to the Wran committee, saying that the north-south railway would have some definite benefits for defence. The decision that has just been made is very important and it is one that I welcome with delight. I have been involved with the Northern Territory government for a number of years, through successive prime ministers, in being able to obtain the financial support to allow this project to proceed. I was disappointed that an article I read in the Australian today was a bit negative in terms of the decision to proceed with the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link. The fact is that it has been proven that the railway will be economic and that it will be in a position to make a reasonable profit. One must wait to see the final picture that is drawn together for the investors to evaluate, now that the Commonwealth has made a commitment of $100 million. I might add that the South Australian government has also made a commitment of $100 million, as has the Northern Territory government. With the Alice Springs to Tarcoola link being incorporated in the investment, I am quite sure there will not be any trouble getting investors. On another matter which I feel is a very important initiative for the Northern Territory, the 11inister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) recently made an announcement that there is going to be a review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. I think that is important because, as the terms of reference that have been circulated state: The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 commenced operation on 26 January 1977. The last general review was in 1983 and some important changes have been made to its provisions since then. The review will examine and report on the operation of the Act and suggest any areas for possible change including recommending amendments where appropriate. In particular, the review will consider: (i) the effectiveness of the legislation achieving its purpose; (ii) the impact of the legislation in terms of its social, cultural and economic costs and benefits; (iii) the operation of the exploration and mining provisions; (iv) the operation of the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account including the distribution of payments out of the Trust Account; (v) the operation of the Royalty Associations including their reporting requirements; (vi) the question of compulsory acquisition powers over Aboriginal Land; (vii) the application of Northern Territory laws to Aboriginal Land; (viii) the role, structure and resource needs of the Land Councils following the coming into effect of the sunset clause relating to land claims; and (ix) any other matters relevant to the operation of the Act. The review will be required to report six months after it commences. The minister made the announcement of this review in Darwin several weeks ago, and I am hoping that he will shortly announce who is going to be chairing the review. I think it is very important. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has written to the minister requesting that such a review take place, and since the announcement the review has been well received in Aboriginal communities throughout the Northern Territory. It is a very unusual situation in that Aboriginals, whilst they have been granted land over the last 20 years, have found it very difficult in some cases to make any definite development proposals for the land that they have under their care. They are unable, because of the very unusual land tenure system that has been allocated to them, to develop that land for tourism purposes or to build the types of construction which they may require. I am hopeful that the review, once it starts, will help our Aboriginal communities in the remote parts of the Northern Territory to develop their land. They are all talking about economic development amongst themselves and, until such time as the Northern Territory land rights act is amended, it is going to be very difficult for them to proceed. (Time expired) Economic Rationalism",89
245,Mr JENKINS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I grieve that economic rationalism continues to dominate as the major source of advice to the government, and that the government continues to act on this advice. One of the gravest mistakes that has affected many Western governments in the post-war period is the elevation of economics from a discipline into an ideology with all the immutability of a closed religion. The implications of this error have been most evident in the 1980s and 1990s-years which have seen governments in the Western world embrace, to varied degrees, a doctrine called economic rationalism. Australia has been badly served by economic rationalism, on two levels. Firstly, in terms of policy, economic rationalism is responsible for major errors. What we must remember is that markets fail all the time and yet economic rationalism decrees that everything should be governed by the marketplace. In large part as a result of the doctrine of economic rationalism, Australia in 1997 is less equal, less socially just, less tolerant, less compassionate and less well-governed. Secondly, the doctrine of economic rationalism has had an insidious effect on political debate in this country. As many commentators have pointed out, the very name economic rationalism defies dissent because to oppose economic rationalism implies that one is acting irrationally. Like most ideologies, economic rationalism is nothing more than a set of propositions that are based not on evidence but on faith. People have been given few choices-far fewer choices than there actually are-and they have been convinced, erroneously, to accept a grossly restricted definition of the role of government. Economic rationalism has obscured our sense of what government ought to be about. People must again be convinced that governance is about the creation and maintenance of a healthy society, not simply the hands-off oversight of the economy. Economic rationalism is a form of extremism. At a time when other forms of extremism are discredited, it appears that economic extremism is being allowed to go unchecked. Political or social extremism is not tolerated in this country; why is it that bodies, such as the Productivity Commission, that continue to preach economic extremism are allowed to do so seemingly unquestioned by government? Why are they allowed to give their economic advice as if the economy were separate from and unrelated to the society in which it operates? It appears that employment and the effects of decisions on employment are not considerations when the economic rationalists tender their advice. In the run-up to the much vaunted but underperforming jobs cabinet meeting a few weeks ago the suggestion that the economic rationalists gave for reducing unemployment was to cut the minimum wage. It is pleasing that, over the last couple of months, economic rationalists' advice like that coming from the Productivity Commission is being questioned by an increasing range of parties. The editorials of the Age newspaper have questioned the quality of the advice coming out of the Industry Commission and have suggested that the Industry Commission itself requires the reform that it wishes to mete out to all and sundry. The Age editorial of 8 August this year refers to the telecommunications equipment industry and its boycott of a commission inquiry into its industry on the basis that the Industry Commission lacks rigour, objectivity and analytical skills, and that its findings are predetermined. A representative from a company that appeared before the Industry Commission inquiry into the TCF industries told me recently that he was concerned that the commission seemed unaware of key pieces of information concerning capital expenditure in that industry. It is not too much to expect that the Industry Commission do its homework properly and to demand the same level of efficiency from it that it demands from industry. How can it be that the Industry Commission is so out of step that it arrives at conclusions that are so fundamentally opposed by the vast majority of players in the industries under review and by the community at large? Even more astounding is the fact that the Industry Commission, after having its automotive recommendations so savaged, has learnt nothing from that experience and continues to make the same mistakes all over again with the TCF industries. The reason for this is that the Productivity Commission adheres to the philosophy of economic rationalism, even when the facts suggest that there needs to be an urgent rethink. In an article in the Age of 7 July this year, under the headline 'Economists lose sight of the real world,' commentator Tim Colebatch refutes the claims of the economist Alan Moran of the Institute of Public Affairs that low tariffs lead to low unemployment. Low tariff countries do not have lower unemployment and faster income growth. The European Union has low tariffs and average unemployment of 10.8 per cent, as Colebatch indicates. Average wages are not 50 per cent higher in the United States than Australia, as Moran has suggested; Colebatch says that they are only .25 per cent more. Average wage levels in Singapore are not considerably above those in Australia; Colebatch states that the average Singaporean manufacturing worker earns about $A131 less a week than his or her Australian counterpart. Unemployment in Britain is not six per cent measured on the same basis as Australia, as Moran suggests; in 1996 the average was 8.2 per cent, and seven per cent in April. What these points demonstrate is that in economics, as in all other fields, there are facts and there are opinions. In the Productivity Commission Bill 1996, under its general policy guidelines, the commission is supposed to recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the commission and also to recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the commission. I do not believe that the commission is adequately fulfilling these sections of its general policy guidelines. These guidelines seem to indicate that the commission is required to consider many aspects other than just dollar terms when making its recommendations. However, the automotive and TCF recommendations of the commission indicate that the commission has failed to live up to the guidelines set for it. It failed to consider the future of these industries and the employment effects on thousands of individual Australians. Just as it is of great concern that the evaluation of industry sectors is undertaken purely on an economic basis it is also of great concern that government programs are evaluated only on unit costs and dollar costs to budget. This neglects the social implications and benefits of the programs. There needs to be development of a formula which takes into account the social benefits and costs of decisions in other portfolio areas. For example, studies show that unemployed people have a greater reliance on the use of health services when they are unemployed. When axing programs like labour market programs that give unemployed people hope, the implications for the health budget are not taken into consideration. Alternatively, the positive financial implications for the health budget are not considered in debate about the need to reduce unemployment. These examples show that government decisions should not be taken in isolated portfolios, and that decisions taken in one will have an effect in others. Nowhere in co stings or analysis are the wider financial costs or the social policy costs taken into account. Likewise, if one looks at other decisions to be made, such as Australia's reaction to the run-up to the setting of standards at the Kyoto conference on climate change, one does not see the same matching of the environmental costs and other decisions. These specifically are things that government policy decision making should take into account. In the run-up to the Productivity Commission's final draft on TCF, what they have to understand is that the decisions to be made about TCF will not only have a consequence for thousands of individual Australians but, because of the way in which those industries are predominantly found in the state of Victoria and other regional centres, also have grave regional consequences. Therefore, the existence of this blind faith that 'the market can cure all' does not take into consideration that the types of markets that operate in those regions will not have the ability to recover from great job losses in the TCF industry. These are the matters that the Productivity Commission should take on board-and, if they do not, then the government should take them on board. At the end of the day, it should never be forgotten that we live in a society, not an economy-a fact that economic rationalism completely overlooks. Pawnbrokers",91
246,Mr EOIN CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Earlier this year I spoke in the House on the subject of second-hand goods dealers and pawnbrokers. I bemoaned the fact that these dealers were, in many instances, a cancer in the community. They contribute to a major cycle of crime involving stolen goods, burglary, drugs and institutional crimes such as money laundering and tax evasion. I asked how state and federal law enforcement authorities were addressing these problems. Since that speech in the parliament, I have been the recipient of much correspondence from the Cash Converters group, which is the self-confessed largest player in the industry. Together with their spin doctors, Cash Converters have sought various meetings with me and challenged the validity of my claims. They have organised letter campaigns by their franchisees and generally pulled out all stops in attempting to cause me to back off in my push to clean up the industry. They have gone so far as to have my own colleagues contact me, telling me that it would be 'politically unwise' to continue with this issue. I subsequently received a letter from the managing director of Cash Converters which purports to be a response to my criticisms. The contents of that letter should not, and cannot, go unchallenged. The statements made in my previous speech and in the Donnelly report, which I tabled, demonstrate a good comprehension of Cash Converters Pty Ltd's accounts, despite the statement by the directors that my report displayed ignorance of Cash Converters' accounts, and their statement that the 'whole business comprises a franchise chain of independently owned stores' . Cash Converters claim that they have nothing to hide. To the contrary, they have a great deal to hide. On 9 March 1997, in the Perth Sunday Times newspaper, Brian Cummins stated that Cash Converters made 'more than 60,000 transactions per week in Australia alone', and that 'about one per cent of these involve stolen goods'-that is, 600 stolen goods transactions per week, or 31,200 stolen goods transactions per year. The value of the stolen goods transactions processed by Cash Converters, allowing a conservative valuation of $500 per stolen item-based on the value of the item, not the Cash Converters purchase price-is $300,000 per week, or $15 million per year. In addition, a very conservative three per cent of Cash Converters transactions are unreported stolen goods-that is, goods stolen by family members and not reported to the authorities; these amount to an approximate $45 million per annum. The police report on the raid on the Gouger Street store of Cash Converters in Adelaide will more than back up these assertions. Neither I nor Mr Donnelly ever stated that the 135 completely independent franchise stores were involved in money laundering. Even on the evidence of disclosed accounts, huge amounts of cash have been injected into Cash Converters businesses, always provided that they have been stores in which Brian Cummins has had a personal financial interest. This happened systematically during the company's expansion in Victoria during 1991. As happened then, the managing director of the trading company, Brian Cummins, lent or invested cash sums totalling not less than $634,043.62 in Cash Converters stores at Dandenong, Moonee Ponds, Preston, Clayton and Forest Hill-all of them stores in which he was financially involved. Cash Converters have said that these were his own funds and not the company funds. You then have to ask the question: how did the cash injections by Brian Cummins in the Forest Hill store become a loan from Cash Converters Pty Ltd? In relation to this store alone, I also want to know: why are there significant differences in the treatment of the cash outstanding, as well as the cost of goods sold, and the baseline profit between the cash books and the prepared accounts for the period to the end of February 1993? Why also have the cost of goods and the purchases been manipulated to reflect 50.5 per cent of sales? Actual purchases through the cash books indicate a difference in costs paid for purchaslitigation es that varies by some $45,000 over an eightmonth period. And why are there discrepancies in the taxation return for 1992-which was also prepared by the 'associated' auditing and accounting firm; namely, why was the taxable profit less than the accounting records? Despite Cash Converters Finance Corporation Ltd's accounts and audits being overseen by an audit committee in accordance with the highest standards of corporate governance, all accounts being audited by Price Waterhouse and company, and National Mutual Trustees Ltd subjecting CCFCL's accounts to close scrutiny with monthly reporting and halfyearly audits, I am astounded that a myriad of breaches have not been detected on audit. I have documentation, instructions that show in a weekly report how to skim 20 per cent off the daily sales and how to avoid detection. Where, may I ask, is the Australian Taxation Office? There are more questions to pose than I have time available for this evening. I believe the process of stripping Cash Converters public facade to reveal their true face has begun, and that it is time for their franchisees, their investors, as well as the authorities and the government to stand up and eliminate cancers in our society, like Cash Converters, by ensuring the introduction of proper corporation laws regulating franchises and fully protecting franchisees. In the document which I will seek leave to table in just a few moments, I have gone through some background on this fairly extensively. In the House earlier this year I made the statement that 70 per cent of Victorian franchisees have failed. Cash Converters have responded, in response 5.1, which I have detailed in all of the documents I have to table, that this is simply false. Out of all the stores opened in Victoria since Cash Converters started in that state, two were closed by consent because they were located in small towns whose population could not support a franchise store. A further two were closed by reason of serious breaches of the franchise agreement by the franchisee. These too were replaced with new stores. Three were closed as part of a settlement of in which Cash Converters terminated the subfranchisor agreement for Victoria so that it could manage that state directly. There are 23 stores open and trading, including all the stores opened there save for the seven mentioned. Now for the facts. My statement 'nearly 70 per cent of their Victorian franchises have failed' made in parliament on 5 March this year is correct. CCIL's statement that there are 23 Victorian stores open and trading is incorrect. In June this year another Cash Converters store in Victoria-namely, Ferntree Gully-was placed in the hands of the receivers leaving 22 stores in Victoria. 'Open and trading' does not mean the Victorian stores are successful. Before exemplifying my statement, according to the Collins Australian Gem English Dictionary 'fail' means 'be unsuccessful; stop operating or working; be below the norm; become bankrupt'. In addition to the seven stores already mentioned, in the last 12 months three Cash Converters stores went into liquidation. Prior to this, six stores controlled by Tony Cummins-who is now bankruptwere sold at basement prices or for no consideration. One store is refusing to renew its franchise. Eight stores are struggling to break even. A minimum of 78 per cent of Victorian Cash Converters stores have failed. In New South Wales the position is similar. Five to six Cash Converters franchisees are in dire straits, 10 to 13 Cash Converters franchisees are breaking even; two Cash Converters franchisees are doing well; and the position is unknown for approximately eight to 10 Cash Converters franchisees. Many franchisees in New South Wales and Victoria have been endeavouring to sell their stores for many months without success. This document which I propose to table in a few moments is not only damning of the Cash Converters organisation; sadly it demonstrates the inability of both the civil and criminal legal systems to address a problem that reaches into the lives of very many Australians. I now seek leave to table this document, a response to Cash Converters, together with the evidence in support of the contents of that response. Leave granted. Lebanon: Peace Process",93
247,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"During my recent study tour I undertook a very valuable and influential visit to the Bourj EI-Barajneh refugee camp of the Palestinian people on the outskirts of Beirut. It certainly put to me the need for a greater effort by this country in regard to the peace process and the shocking conditions under which the Palestinian people reside at those II-odd camps stretched predominantly through Lebanon. It is worth noting in passing that a large number of programs at that particular camp are funded through AusAID and, more particularly, have a contribution from the ACTU's foreign aid organisation APHEDA. The camp has no right to extend its boundaries. On its very border there has been extensive further construction. Basically all the families have a background of presence back to 1947. In some cases we are talking about three generations of people forced to live under those restrictive conditions. They have no work rights within Lebanon. They have no obvious political rights. They have great problems in regard to their international travel status. United Nations representative Lionel Risson emphasised very strongly in very worthwhile discussions the intractable nature of this problem because the dynamics of a political system such as Lebanon's is almost completely based upon confessional politics. The conditions of the Palestinians are affected not only by the failure of the Western world to press Israel for a settlement but also by the difficulties that Lebanon's internal politics would have by essentially absorbing these people despite the fact that they have been there for 50 years. I want to commend the operation of the Women's Humanitarian Organisation at that site under deplorable conditions and with decreasing international financial support. They are still in 1997 conducting a variety of programs in regard to child care for those people who are working. People might ask why there is child care when nobody is allowed to work in Lebanon. The sad fact is that that is the case but there are a few people who gain employment through a variety of United Nations employment, health and educational programs on the camp site. For those few people who have employment on the camp site, there is this program of child care. There is also computer training, basically in the hope that things will change and there will be employment possibilities in the future. There are also women's health programs and counselling. As I say, these are commendable schemes, but unfortunately they must be seen in the context of increasing questioning by this government of our role in Middle East foreign aid and the Simon review comments that 'Australia should not undertake any bilateral aid intervention in regions such as the Middle East'. The danger is the interrelationship of that with the question of humanitarian relief assistance. This report is basically saying that, once you do not have bilateral aid, you should not have humanitarian relief programs in those regions. We have a very big problem here. If this assistance to people who have not been homeless for five minutes but for 50 years goes down the drain, their condition will be worsened. It is already under serious threat because of developments in regard to international support. The situation is that many international donors who traditionally were supportivewhen I was there I was very moved to see a girl with major physical disabilities who had been to the United States recently and had the first of a number of operations funded by a US group-are drying up as money is diverted to Gaza and the West Bank. We are seeing a situation where the United Nations' commendable efforts there are being reduced to very limited essential services. As I said earlier, the problem is compounded by the lack of rights within Lebanon. In recent years, there has been an increased presence of Syrian workers in Lebanon who might take those few jobs at the bottom rung of the ladder where Palestinians are illegally working, although the actual level of it might be debatable or denied by some. Finally, the unfortunate decision of the PLO on the Gulf War led to significant assaults on Palestinian workers who had been working in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Middle East. They basically were forced out in revenge for the role the PLO played in supporting Saddam Hussein. Essentially, these situations have further worsened the conditions of the Palestinians. This lack of international support for the people in the camps comes at a time when there has been a very disturbing slowdown in the Oslo process. That essentially is precipitated by the Israeli Netanyahu government's decision to construct Har Homa and also, in more recent days, to give approval to Ras alAmoud as a new Israeli settlement site. That is designed to make sure that Jerusalem is ringed and that there cannot be any other solution but the absorption of Jerusalem as an entity into Israel. Whilst the Palestinian state is not snow white-there are very grave concerns about the abuse and misuse of $320 million of foreign aid to the Palestinian government-its problems of corruption, nepotism and squandering should not reduce our support for the condition of the Palestinian people in general. The United Nations has recently detailed that the restrictions on the work rights of Palestinians in Israel last year led to a jump in unemployment amongst Palestinians from 19 per cent to 32 per cent; a deterioration of the gross national product in the Palestinian area of eight per cent; and the reduction of the Palestinians' average wage from $411 a month to $370 a month. At the same time, grave concern about the collapse of the peace process is discouraging international support. More particularly, there is a significant Palestinian diaspora, particularly in parts of South America. There is a good example of it in the United States-the US is increasingly questioning whether it should finance investment in the Middle East. The Australian government is undertaking a very disturbing analysis of whether we need to continue to give aid to the Middle East. At the same time, I also want to put on the public record concern about a further movement of this country away from what was at some times already a questionable evenhanded policy on the Middle East. The two most recent votes of the UN are causing grave difficulties for Australian diplomats in the Middle East in giving this country any credibility whatsoever in the region. Whilst in the past Australia might not have been in total support of the Palestinians, at least on 15 December 1995, when we abstained from the vote, we found ourselves in agreement with 51 other nations. Again on that day, in another vote, we found ourselves in accord with 52 nations. To show how isolated our policy is today, the last two votes of the United Nations, regarding the policy of Palestine and the peace negotiations-and I am very thankful to the Australia/Israel Review for this analysis of our voting record-show that in the vote of 25 April 1997 condemning Israel's construction of a new settlement in Jebel Abu Ghneim and demanding immediate cessation of this vote, there were 134 in favour with only 11 abstentions, of which Australia was one. Again, on 15 July-more recently-there was a resolution condemning Israel for failing to comply with ES-1O/2 and deploring Israel's lack of cooperation. It involved recommendi-g to member states that they 'actively dIscourage activities which directly contribute to any construction or development of Israeli settlements' and also demanding that Israel make available to member states the necessary information about goods produced or manufactured in the illegal settlements of Israel. The vote was 131 in favour, with 14 abstentions. What we are seeing is a very sad ?eterioration of the credibility of this country III regard to a crucial junction in the peace process. Finally, I want to indicate sympathy for the application by the Palestinian National Council to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. There are a n.umber of arguments as to why this organis.atlOn should be the unquestioned representatIve of the Palestinian people. It is essentially the parliament. Support for it at this stage would act as a further encouragement for the Israeli government to understand that the world wants a solution to this problem and that the world wants a solution to the conditions of the Palestinian refugees throughout the region. Australia can no longer be out the-e on a limb totally isolating itself on this polIcy. (Time expired)",95
248,Unknown,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 8 p.m. Goulburn Valley Health Services,97
249,Mrs STONE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In the past few weeks two studies have been compl-ted .in my electorate of Murray in northern VIctona which have evaluated the health relate? services available to our population. The fIrSt was commissioned by the Goulburn Valley Division of General Practice and the second was a report on the support needs of teenage mothers in Shepparton. Both of those reports were government funded. The health professionals shortage in rural Australia has been well understood and acknowledged by this government, and there are policies in place to try to redress the mal distribution of health professionals. At last we have a government that understands the issues and is moving beyond the rhetoric to on the ground action. But I want to remind the House tonight of the realities of the everyday struggle of too many country people as they try to access health services. Metropolitan populations, living five minutes from a choice of clinics, may have little idea of the frustrations of the young mothers, the elderly and the poor, who have to overcome the impacts of the shortage of doctors and the lack of competition for medical service provision. Let me begin by reminding you that the electorate of Murray is not in remote Australia. The largest city, Shepparton, is less than two hours drive from Melbourne. The region is growing in population, size and productivity, but incomes are low-as in most of rural Australia. There are 6,000 Kooris in the community, and 45 per cent of the population is of non-English speaking background. In the City of Greater Shepparton, the most affluent part of the electorate, nearly half of the households have incomes below $25,000. In the census figures just released, nearly 23 per cent of all Shepparton men, aged between 25 and 44, earned less than $15,600. Despite this, there is virtually no access to bulk-billing in the electorate of Murray to cover the upfront costs of visits to a doctor. As well, afterhours GP service is virtually non-existent. Each summer, some 10,000 fruit pickers pour into the Goulburn and Murray valleys to harvest the season's fruit. Many of these workers also have minimal disposable incomes. They, too, are confronted with upfront payments for GP visits and only the local hospital emergency outpatients option for after-hours treatment of their sunburn, cuts and sprains. It is estimated that 70 per cent of the Koori population is not accessing medical services at the moment, despite the near uni versal problem of diabetes in the adult male population, the low birth weight of the Koori babies, the incidence of heart disease and asthma, and the rates of Hepatitis Band C and so on. I have already said that over 50 per cent of the region's families have annual incomes below $25,000. Most of the small towns in the electorate do not have a Medicare office, and it takes up to three weeks to claim a rebate. If two or three children in your family need medical attention at once, and each is charged in the order of a $30 fee, this creates a significant cash flow crisis for families. The poor sometimes have to weigh up whether they can afford to go to the doctor when they also have an immediate need to buy a child's shoes or winter clothing, or to pay for school excursions. There is one doctor in the Shepparton area, which includes some 40,000 people, who bulk-bills, but a substantial up-front fee is still required at the first visit. Thus, those with a crisis, who lack money or who are not regular patients of a GP have difficulty in accessing health care, so they go to the public hospital. Nine-hour waits at the accident and emergency care department at the Goulburn Valley Base Hospital are not unknown. The survey found that much of this demand could be categorised as general practice medicine, but the lack of bulk-billing and the restricted access to GPs on the weekends divert these cases to the local public hospital. By attending the accident and emergency centre instead of a GP, patients are treated by young interns trained in crisis medicine rather than general practice diagnosis, and there is little or no follow-up treatment or monitoring of the patient's ongoing condition. Both the GV Base Hospital and the Shepparton Private Hospital are more than aware of this dilemma and are concerned. They have discussed the need for out-of-hours clinics but have the difficulty of finding GPs to support this concept and to do that work. Given that some 80 per cent of all GP consultations in Australia are bulk-billed, obviously country people are experiencing a vastly less equitable service, in particular when you consider their incomes. While a key community issue nominated in the GV general practice division survey was that lack of access to bulk-billing, the GPs responding to that survey stated that bulkbilling was not compatible with maintaining a profitable practice, in particular when it came down to after-hours service. Most of the GPs interviewed were in fact moving to reduce and limit their services even further. GPs felt their consultation charges had changed little in the past 15 years while their costs had escalated and, therefore, their real incomes had progressively declined. To compensate, the GPs in the survey area had reduced some of their free community work and increased patient throughput by reducing consultation times. In the Goulburn Valley region, many GPs now see six to eight patients per hour and many consistently see 40 patients per day. Ten minutes is the most time you can usually expect with your doctor. It is common for rural practitioners to work significantly longer hours than their metropolitan counterparts and to have much longer hours on call and not worked. Many of the doctors in our region work solo or in pairs and yet some GPs have calculated that a profitable practice needs from four to six doctors working together-this is without taking into calculation the need for adequate time off, professional development and so on. lt is little wonder that the under-supply of GPs in the survey area was also listed as a key problem. The consequences of this-the lack of bulk-billing, rushed consultations, long waits, exhausted doctors, lack of after-hours access-are inevitable but can lead to tragic results. lt is not surprising, given the above scenario, that women-and young mothers in particular-bear the brunt of inadequate provision of health services in regional Australia. In the second health services survey completed just weeks ago, it was found that the Goulburn Valley teenage birthing rates were 31 per 1,000, or roughly double the Victorian rate and significantly higher than the national figure. This did not include the Koori 15to 19-year-olds and it is estimated that their inclusion would have further increased the teenage birth rate statistics for this area. As we know, young single girls who become mothers in their early teens are very likely to experience poorer health, poverty, poor housing, interrupted education and often a lifetime of dependency on social welfare. One-third of the girls who participated in the Shepparton survey were under 17 when they had given birth. Nearly half had been early school leavers. Most of the pregnancies were unplanned and contraception was not used. Only half of the women surveyed were still in touch with the child's father at the time of the interview. The survey referred to a number of factors influencing the so much higher than average teenage pregnancy rates. They included low socio-economic status, inadequate reproductive health education, peer pressure, low self-esteem, poor access to contraception and, as I said before, simply poor ability to pay for medical services. Young pregnant women are often reluctant to seek medical advice in the early stage of their pregnancies, in particular, and the cost is one of those factors. Another one of the realities confronting those who live in small, stable, conservative communities is that there is little opportunity for young people to obtain confidential reproductive health information or contraception. Condoms, for example, continue to be sold as an under-the-counter item in pharmacies. There are virtually no condom vending machines, although we do have needle disposal bins in some toilets. It is little wonder then that we have double the state average for teenage pregnancies and a growing problem with STDs. In a city as large as Shepparton we do not have a women's clinic where women of all ages can access female staff offering information about family planning, mammographies, Pap smears, testing of various other sorts and menopause advice. Our large Muslim population, in particular, is concerned at this lack of access to women medical practitioners. Meanwhile, the women GPs we do have practising in the area have virtually closed their books on new patients, so overwhelmed are they with work. Thus, we are in the downward spiralling situation seen too often in health service delivery in rural Australia. Our GPs are overworked and many see diminishing returns for their efforts. In seeking to survive physically, emotionally and financially, they direct their service delivery to the areas that pay best. This inevitably disadvantages the poor and the powerless. We must do better. I know that our government wants to do better. In a place like the electorate of Murray, which is not remote, we have to make sure that in the future there are no 16-year-olds facing motherhood alone and that all have an opportunity in Australia to thrive and grow. In particular, I look forward to the establishment of the federally funded University Department of Rural Health in Shepparton. That will certainly help to make a difference. Thredbo Landslide",97
250,Ms ELLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In this grievance debate I would like to make reference to the recent Thredbo tragedy, something which was spoken about earlier today in this place. I know that all of us here grieve for those who lost loved ones and also for those who, unfortunately, are going to carry the trauma of this tragedy with them for a long time. I want specifically to refer to the response from our Canberra community, acknowledging the role of our region as well. Canberra had, in fact, suffered a tragedy of slightly smaller proportions in some ways only very recently before the night of 30 July, where I personally witnessed the response of our emergency services personnel in fairly extraordinary circumstances here in Canberra. There was no delay and no hesitation at all when that first call from Thredbo was received very shortly after that time. That first request came to our emergency services here at 1 a.m. on the night of the disaster. Within five hours our teams had arrived in Thredbo. That first request included needs for ambulance support, urban search and rescue, which included a number of volunteers, and the Australian Federal Police. Included in the initial ambulance response was a triage team from the Canberra Hospital. Our initial team went to Thredbo within that five-hour period fully equipped and self-contained and ready for whatever they found, although I am sure that until they got there, they did not quite realise what they were going to see. Eventually our full response from this area included: from the task force management, three at the commander level and seven assistant task force commanders; 45 urban search and rescue team members; two hazardous materials and breathing apparatus personnel; five critical incident stress managers; eight communications personnel; 30 people from ground support; four people from ACT Electricity and Water; 12 people from the Ambulance Service; and 23 officers from the Australian Federal Police. In all, 139 personnel from all of the above mentioned agencies were involved in the rescue operation. The principal resource required was specialist staff to perform urban search and rescue techniques. The Emergency Services Bureau provided support and resourcing to the operational staff functioning under the New South Wales Fire Brigade's control. The majority of Australian Federal Police personnel were members of the AFP search and rescue team. As we all know from the constant pictures on our television screens, the rescue site remained in a state of constant instability. As a result of the landslide, there was a pancaking of reinforced concrete slabs at various angles on a very steep slope where a further slippage of the slabs was a definite possibility and, as we know only too well, Mr Deputy Speaker, spoken of frequently in the media coverage. The urban search and rescue teams provided to the New South Wales Fire Brigade were incorporated into rosters of two, eight-hour shifts and a lO-hour shift. The ACT Fire Brigade provided five members to each team, of which there were three teams, rotating each task force onto this roster. The task force management teams, of which there were four, consisted of an ACT Fire Brigade superintendent and two district officers. The support functions to the task forces and the incident consisted of welfare, medical, communications, stores/logistics and ground support, which were provided by volunteer personnel. These support functions were provided by the Ambulance Service and volunteers from the ACT emergency service. In addition, personnel from the Canberra Hospital, ACT Electricity and Water and a private surveying company were despatched to support the task force and incident. However, there was another level of assistance from the Canberra community which I would like to put on record. I understand that as the needs of the rescuers developed and as teams returned to Canberra to be replaced by others, supplies were constantly in demand. Those local businesses involved in some of that supply certainly responded generously in every sense of the word. They were known to open their businesses at any hour of the night, most often at two and three in the morning, I understand, to supply gas for LPG heaters, to supply cutting blades for the cutting machines and to supply the need for cold weather clothing-the specialist clothing that was being used, particularly during the night-time rescue period. All these people needed was to be made aware of the need of the teams at Thredbo, and they responded at times, I understand, at no cost. When the magnitude of the task became more evident, more offers of help were made. For instance, the ACT Electricity and Water people made optical fibre camera equipment available as soon as they realised the assistance that could possibly offer, and many others offered advice, information and encouragement. There were other aspects to this as well. As Queanbeyan, our very near neighbour over the border, had also sent teams to Thredbo, our services then offered to help cover their needs in a local sense from here as well-in other words, to backfill their local requirement. At the same time, New South Wales helped cover our firefighting service needs while the numbers we had from this area were at Thredbo. The ACT community also responded through the role of Canberra Hospital. The heroism displayed in this rescue is almost unbelievable. I have had the opportunity to chat informally with some of the people who were working from our emergency services headquarters in Curtin. From the sorts of stories I have heard it is hard to understand how people can have so much courage. For instance, when rescuers who were digging in tunnels nine to 10 metres in length would suddenly hear the cement slabs above them move, they would say into the small microphones they had that that was the case, they would hold still, they would not retreat, they would pause long enough and then they would just simply keep goingdigging with a determination, a courage and a dedication that some of us can only admire. There is no question as to the magnitude and the horror of what happened at Thredbo. The Canberra community is very proud of and thankful to our emergency services-the personnel and everyone involved in that tragedy. They, like other emergency services around the country, train to this level, hoping of course that they would never need to use that expertise, but when it is needed there is absolutely no hesitation. We saw a very professional multi-service response from all sectors of our emergency services and also from our community, not connected necessarily in a direct sense but indirectly, who very quickly, warmly and humanely offered to do whatever could be done to assist those people. On behalf of the ACT community, we thank them, we congratulate them and we thank God that we do have them here. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Barwick, Rt Hon. Garfield Edward John, AK,GCMG Debate resumed.",99
251,Mr WILLIAMS,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to join in the condolence motion in relation to Sir Garfield Edward John Barwick, former Chief Justice of Australia. Most of his principal biographical data has been offered in the House today. I, without reiterating the course of his life, want to a couple of comments from a personal point of view. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) indicated, Sir Garfield achieved pre-eminence as an advocate. His reputation as an advocate I think has been unsurpassed by anybody in my lifetime-certainly my professional lifetime. He never ceased to be an advocate even when he was on the bench-a fact that was sometimes noted when his interjections in argument were extensive. Sir Garfield was, as has been pointed out, a representative of his profession, and I am privileged to have shared with him the position of President of the Law Council of Australia-he, as I understand it, in the years 1952 to 1954 and I much later. He continued his interest in the profession throughout his professional life on the bench and took a keen interest in meeting members of the profession on the occasions when the High Court travelled to different jurisdictions to hear cases. As an Attorney-General, Sir Garfield is probably best remembered for his reforms in the marriage and divorce area. Some landmark legislation that was enacted during his time included the Marriage Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act. He was also instrumental in establishing the model for what is now our Trade Practices Act. He had prepared a draft which became a model for the 1974 legislation. As a chief justice, Sir Garfield is best remembered perhaps for his role in presiding over hearings. He was inevitably deeply involved in the argument right from the beginning. In fact, his perception and intelligence were such that he had identified the issue very early on in the debate and often sometimes better and more quickly than the advocate who was putting a case had done. This did not always win him friends, particularly from advocates who liked to develop their own argument, and his role in the conduct of proceedings before the court was the subject of some contention. I appeared before the court presided over by Sir Garfield, although I do not recall that I was ever on my feet. I was only ever junior make counsel when he was on the court. I have vivid recollections of my leader in one case being berated somewhat by Sir Garfield for arguing a point that Sir Garfield was not prepared to give any weight to at all. He made a very significant contribution in his time as the longest serving chief justice. He presided over the court for 17 years. At a ceremonial sitting of the High Court held in Canberra on 5 August in memory of Sir Garfield, the current Chief Justice, Sir Gerard Brennan, gave an appreciation of Sir Garfield's role. The judgments which he wrote, Sir Gerard pointed out, can be found in over 40 volumes of the Commonwealth Law Reports. Sir Gerard also pointed out something that was obvious to all those in court: some of those judgements were drafted while argument was continuing, indicating that Sir Garfield had quickly identified and decided points, although the argument on them had not necessarily finished. His judgments are not, I respectfully suggest, models in that he was always the advocate, even as a judge, and he argued for the case that his judgment would end up at rather than putting both sides of the issue as other judges might do. Sir Gerard, in - is appreciation; indicated that inevitably the Judgements which Sir Garfield wrote have affected the development of the law. He said that sometimes they settle the law for the future and sometimes they form part of that great reservoir of ideas on which the courts draw day by day in the refining and evolution of legal principles. Sir Garfield also made a significant contribution in relation to the High Court in securing from the government of the day the passage of the High Court of Australia Act 1979. This was pioneering legislation in Australia and gave that court administrative independence from the department of the Attorney-General. It provided the capacity for the court to administer its own affairs and to control the precinct on which the building stands. It enabled the budget process, as far as the High Court is concerned, to be converted to what is referred to now as the one line budget. He was instrumental in the abolition of appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council. Even before legislation effected that, he had laid the groundwork in judgements of the court. He was. a giant of a figure metaphorically, although In stature he was quite small. I can remember on a social occasion when the court was sitting in Western Australia he made what to me seemed to be the unusual assertion, which I think has deeper meaning than I appreciated at the time, that there are only ever seven people capable of fulfilling the role of justice of the High Court of Australia at any time. What he meant by that, I think, was that the court should comprise the seven best persons to constitute the court at that ti-e. He certainly set a very high standard in hiS work, he set a very high standard in public life and he deserves the appreciation of the public for the role he played in the development of the law and in other areas. I extend my sympathy to members of his family.",101
252,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"My knowledge of Sir Garfield goes back to my days as an articled clerk. I knew him in several phases of his career when I, as a very subordinate and junior lawyer and subsequently as a member of the backbench of the other house but of this parliament saw him as a giant-although, as the Atto-ey­ General (Mr Williams) has just described he was a little man. ' There are several facets of Sir Garfield that I think are worth remembering. One of the most significant issues that concerns me in this parliament, at a time when there have been criticisms of the role of justices-and the Attorney has made some comments at a convention involving many chief justices about the degree to which politics and the law interact-is that I think there is a role for politicians in the judiciary. To my mind, one of the great attributes of so many of those who have served as chief justices has been that they have also served as Attorneys in this place. I am not tonight setting up an advocacy for the Attorney-General, who currently r-presents us so ably, eloquently and effectively, but rather saying that it concerns me that, in relation to the doctrine of the separation of p?-ers, there are those who suggest that polItiCians should not subsequently rise to legal office. It perhaps concerns me more than other stages of Sir Garfield's career. As was said earlier in this condolence motion, the interesting aspect of Sir Garfield was that, as the undoubted leader of the Australian bar, he was an extraordinarily effective and eloquent advocate. He had already been knighted. He had already been recognised as a person of some extraordinary ability, and I want to talk a little bit about that. But I think it important that, at a time when people look critically at members of parliament, we do not deny people who make a success of their careers outside this place the opportunity of serving in this place. It is a great pity that we seem more and more to be criticising members of parliament-certainly members of this House, certainly members of the ministry, certainly members of the other chamber and also members of other parliaments. As a result, it becomes increasingly difficult for those who, like Sir Garfield, have had extraordinary success in their own chosen, preferred profession to then translate into politics. It is important that all those who criticise parliamentarians and who, rightly, condemn some of those abuses which have tragically-and I say tragically deliberately-appeared in recent times know that there is no more significant, sensitive and important responsibility in Australia than serving as a member of this parliament. It is important that we have people who, like Sir Garfield, distinguish themselves in their careers and profession and are prepared to set that aside in order to serve here. Equally, it is important that people who have served here-I am thinking of men like Sir Garfield-can then go on and become chief justice, and in my view he was a very distinguished chief justice. They should be able to move into another career and contribute to the advancement of this country. Sir Garfield always thought highly of this country. He always believed himself very much an Australian, served as such, acted as such and spoke as such. There are several aspects of Sir Garfield's career that I want to address. I was not quite - o conscious of his role, although it was Important, in developing a united federal approach to the matrimonial jurisdiction but I was certainly very conscious of his approach to the introduction of a unified trade practices law. There are few occasions, sadly, in the changed modus operandi of this parliament where we have, in my view, an adequate debate on anything. The parliament itself, regrettably, for a raft of reasons is no longer is terribly as effective as it once was. On the occasion when Sir Garfield introduced his trade practices legislation into this place we sat most of the night. Two members in this place, Sir James Killen and Mr Bate, the member for Macarthur at that stage, contested almost every clause in the bill. Jeff Bate and Jim Killen between them did not agree with the nature and character of the trade practices legislation. But that was not as significant as the fact that Sir Garfield within the House advocated it clause by clause and pursued it clause by clause. We had one of the best committee stage debates that I can recall in the old House. That is important. In talking of Sir Garfield, first you have a very distinguished Australian, a leader in his profession and Attorney at the time and, secondly, his use of the parliament. Neither of those characteristics, I suppose one could call them, necessarily exists today. I think it is a great pity that today we cannot get people like Sir Garfield so easily elected into parliament, from whichever side. Nor can we have debates in a committee stage which are meaningful and where the minister at the table, the Attorney at the table or whoever, is able to engage in worthwhile dialogue. In my recollection that was probably one of the most distinguished movements in terms of his contribution as Attorney that I can remember Sir Garfield making. I wanted to talk about a couple of aspects of Sir Garfield. I regarded him highly. I knew him perhaps not well but certainly I can remember briefing him as an articled clerk. In other words, I would take up a brief from my firm of solicitors and we would have some discussion. Certainly in his contribution in arguing the individual rights theory of section 92 of the constitution, which was the basis of his successful contention of the bank nationalisation case, he pursued not only an interesting cause but moved away from what a lot of people saw as the product of his interpretation of the constitution as chief justice. For there he was very much said to be a conservative literalist, yet as an advocate and certainly in the banking nationalisation case his victory was rather in extending the view of section 92 in a way that few have seen fit to apply in recent years. In every way we should remember Sir Garfield as we are tonight, certainly as a very effective advocate. I thought he was a very good minister for external affairs. As one who in the last few weeks has conducted a seminar on ANZUS through my committee in conjunction with Senator Dave MACGIBBON, I think it is important that we remember that at the time of his leaving his post to take up the position of chief justice he was calling on the United States to join with Australia because of the application of confrontation to the extent to which we were then involved in Borneo. The other thing that one should say about Sir Garfield was that as minister for external affairs he was very often understated and undersold. I thought he was a very effective minister for external affairs. He certainly looked towards those international obligations which we had with the United States. As I mentioned, in the case of confrontation he was seeking to involve the United States in a way which was then contested. As chief justice he appeared on many occasions, swore numbers of us in, was a person who saw very clearly the distinction between his judicial role and his role as an officer of this House, as a minister and as a member for those years before. I think that in every way Sir Garfield distinguished himself. While people have spoken much of his involvement, one role that has not been mentioned was his role as chancellor of Macquarie University. He contributed towards making that university what it now is. I think it is an outstanding university. It has risen largely because of the contribution of men like Sir Garfield. Personally, professionally, as a minister, Attorney, and certainly as Chief Justice he rendered a great service to this nation. I find it sad that people would condemn one small episode in the role he played as chief justice. Without wishing to advert to it or argue it today, it is always going to be important if we move to a republic, and certainly in whatever role the person who is Governor-Generalwho has the prime executive role within our monarchical republican constitution-plays, that there should be a capacity for the person in that office to consult the only independent, dispassionate person there is. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition inevitably have their political views. The chief justice, on the other hand, is the head of the judiciary and is an appropriate person to consult. I find it sad that as a result of the affairs of 1975 there are those who suggest that that consultation should not be available. I admired Sir Garfield greatly. I respected him, perhaps more as an advocate than as a chief justice, but I respected him, above all, as a man. To Lady Barwick and to his son and his daughter and their families I would like to extend the very greatest sympathy at his passing on behalf of Rosemary and myself.",102
253,Mr ROSS CAMERON,CONDOLENCES,"I rise as the member for Parramatta to support this condolence motion and to articulate my sense of loss over the life of the person who is undoubtedly the most distinguished of my predecessors as member for Parramatta. I say that with some consideration in view of the fact that the seat has been held by such illustrious figures, likewise themselves distinguished lawyers, as Nigel Bowen, Sir Howard Beale and our present Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the member for Berowra, Phillip Ruddock, who I understand will be in the House tomorrow evening. He is away representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) this evening but he has sought special indulgence to speak on the motion because of the close association between his family and the Barwicks and because of his particular respect for Sir Garfield. I do not think my colleague the member for as Berowra will regard me as being too impertinent or unjust in describing Barwick as the greatest holder of the seat of Parramatta. I said in my maiden speech that you would have to go far and wide to find anyone who had made the contribution to Australian public life that Sir Garfield Barwick had. In the pantheon of Australia's great leaders I would include Arthur Phillip, Macquarie, Henry Parkes, Ben Chifley, perhaps Billy Hughes and certainly Robert Gordon Menzies. In terms of an enduring personal contribution to the quality of public life in this country, Garfield is certainly in that pantheon, and in my personal estimation he is very high up in the rank. Being one of the more junior members of the House, my personal connection with Sir Barwick is very limited. I am told by my mother that in 1968 she attended a meeting at the Devlin's Creek Reserve in Beecroft as the wife of the state member for Northcott at that time. Sir Garfield was speaking on an environmental matter. She was sitting at the front of the meeting with me on her lap. I am told that I, with perhaps typical lack of propriety or consideration, crawled out to Sir Garfield's feet and became somewhat absorbed by the laces of the brown suede shoes he was wearing. I am told that he was unperturbed by that attention and continued his remarks without interruption or apparent irritation. I am not sure what the moral of that story is, but certainly those shoes were filled by a man of extraordinary stature. Sir Garfield's son Ross was a candidate for the federal seat of Parramatta in 1990. He was unsuccessful in the general election, but he ran for preselection against, among others, my father. Ross Barwick was successful in that contest. He and my father were very close friends throughout the preselection and beforehand. Ross was also active in my father's campaign for the seat of Northcott on a number of occasions. In fact, after my first unsuccessful run for preselection it was Ross Barwick who called me and said, 'Let's have lunch together.' Over lunch he urged me to consider running for the seat of Parramatta. For a young man, :1t is those individual conversations where a more senior figure, someone you respect, lakes an interest in your life and gives you iSome encouragement that are often the tuming loints for you. Certainly that was the case for me. So I am also indebted to Sir Garfield's son Ross. David MCNicol referred to Sir Garfield as a 'colossus of the Australian legal system'. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in his remarks this morning suggested that it was possible that no figure anywhere in the world had dominated the bar of their nation in quite Sir the same way as Sir Garfield dominated the Australian bar. He made his reputation not just here but in other parts of the world-in the Privy Council, notably, for his argument for the banks in the bank nationalisation case in which his argument carried the day. I want to refer to his experience in the Dennis Hotels case, which I think is particularly poignant for us in the House this evening. That was the case in which Sir Henry Bolte, the then Premier of Victoria, had imposed a liquor licensing fee on the hotel industry, as had several other state governments, and several hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue were being derived from the liquor licensing fees. The fee was challenged by Dennis Hotels as an excise. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that under section 90 of the constitution the power to levy an excise is exclusively in the hands of the Commonwealth. The situation was that if the challenge by Dennis Hotels had been successful the state finances would have been plunged into chaos. It was fought all the way to the High Court. The High Court in a bare majority-four to three-upheld the case of Victoria by holding that the liquor licensing fee was in fact a fee and not an excise. Dennis Hotels, believing that they had a strong case, appealed for leave to go to the Privy Council. At that point Bolte, as Premier, came to Menzies like Oliver Twist with his cap out begging for assistance saying, 'Can you please help us because we cannot afford the catastrophe of losing this case?' It is an extraordinary statement about both the times in which the parliament existed then and also the stature of Barwick himself that Menzies then said to Barwick, 'What is your attitude towards the High Court's decision in Dennis Hotels?' and Barwick said, 'Frankly, I agree with the minority judgment,' which, as I recall, was led by Dixon J who said that the liquor licensing fee was in fact an excise and should be struck down. Menzies said to him, 'What do you think the attitude of the Privy Council will be if they hear the case?' and Barwick said, 'My view is that they are likely to uphold the minority judgment and strike down the liquor licensing fee as an excise.' I would be fascinated to hear what the diary secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who is in the chamber with us this evening, would say if the Prime Minister asked the Attorney-General to go to the Privy Council for a month to personally argue the case of the Commonwealth before that tribunal, but that is exactly what happened. So Barwick set off personally to argue the case for the Commonwealth before the Privy Council, and the clerks of the Privy Council allocated a month for hearing, such was the complexity of the argument. Barwick got there, put together the casebook, which was described by their lordships as one of the most eminent pieces of argument they had ever seen, and carried the case within seven days. Judgment was entered not on the question of whether or not it was an excise, on which Barwick knew in his heart he would lose, but on the question of whether the Privy Council had jurisdiction to hear the case under section 74 of the constitution, which prohibited appeals to the Privy Council on matters that had to do with disputes between the Commonwealth and the states. There you have it: Barwick in his heart believing that the minority judgment was correct, and here today the High Court, in the case of Ha a couple of weeks ago, specifically refers to the case of Dennis Hotels, overturns the majority judgment, throws the whole of state finances into chaos and provides what I regard as a much needed impetus for the fundamental refonn of the tax system, which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are now embarking on. The case of Dennis Hotels is perhaps uncharacteristic of Barwick in that he was arguing for the retention of what was effectively an unconstitutional tax. The character and tenor of his whole life was one of deep reverence for the rule of law and for a philosophy that was entirely coherent, entirely consistent and, in my view, entirely correct. That philosophy was based on the principle of the separation of powers between the executive, the parliament and the judiciary; the independence of the judiciary; and the restraint of the excesses of the executive. I would have to say personally that I would depart from the comments of the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in the sense that I deeply appreciated Sir Garfield's role as Chief Justice in resisting the adventurism that I regard as a defect of some of the recent judgments of the court in that he saw the court's role very clearly and very specifically as the interpretation and upholding of the acts of this place. It was not the province of the court to correct some defect in Commonwealth political, but to strictly limit its operations to the interpretation and upholding of the acts of the legislature and likewise to keep the legislature in check when it exceeded the proper bounds of executive authority. Such was his reputation that he was frequently briefed while at the bar by Labor figures. Dr Herbert 'Doc' Evatt, as Attorney General, briefed Barwick. in relation to the Commonwealth Censor. In one particular case, the Daily Telegraph was prohibited by the Censor from publishing details about a trade union dispute. The Daily Telegraph took the Censor to court. Barwick, who was briefed by Evatt, took the view that the Commonwealth's actions were unsustainable, that the regulations needed to be amended and that they could not be upheld in law. He gave that advice to Evatt, much to Evatt's displeasure, and Barwick assumed he would never be briefed by Evatt again but in fact he was, consistently. So there was a very pleasing spirit of bipartisanship this morning in the recognition of the contribution of Sir Garfield Barwick. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) was most eloquent, but I want to refer with some irony to Sir Garfield's maiden speech after which he was followed immediately in the chamber by the then young member for Werriwa, Mr Whitlam. I will quote a couple of paragraphs of the remarks that Gough made immediately following Sir Garfield's maiden speech: Honourable members have listened to the maiden speech of the greatest lawyer to enter this chamber since the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt), and the greatest advocate to enter it since the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). Mr Chairman, every member who serves in this place has gained satisfaction and status from the fact that a practising lawyer who has probably no equal in this country and no superior in the English-speaking world has, at a not inconsiderable sacrifice, similar to that made before him by the two leaders whom I have mentioned, come to serve with us here. His maiden speech was, as one would have expected, disarming, polished and demure. One can well believe, after the first two characteristics that described, that there is great truth in the axiom, which has been followed every since the war by all the principal commercial interests in this country, that if you had a good case at law it did not very much matter whom you briefed to appear for you, but if you had an unmeritorious, an unsympathetic and an unlikely case, your only hope was to brief Barwick. There is some irony in that fulsome and generous praise from the member for Werriwa at that time as history subsequently unfolded. Nonetheless, I would entirely defend Sir Garfield's role as Chief Justice in the so called 'constitutional crisis' of 1975. This is perhaps not the place to reopen the merits of the decision by the then Governor General, but the one thing I will say is that the whole character of Barwick's life was one of an unqualified commitment to impartiality and to the rule of law. On whatever side of the case he was appearing, you see this relentless commitment to judicial impartiality and independence. If you had to rely on someone's judgment in a situation such as that, I cannot think of anyone whose judgment I would prefer to rely on than Sir Garfield Barwick's. I would like to conclude by quoting a short segment from a letter. As members of parliament we may have experienced the feeling that we ought to write to this person or that ,person; certainly I would experience it a number of times a day but do not as often execute the sentiment. I am pleased to con.clu-e by reading an extract from a letter 'which I wrote on 29 April this year, addressed to Sir Garfield Barwick, 71 Curagul Road, North Turramurra, New South Wales: Dear Sir Garfield, I have just read a copy of an address you delivered to the University of Newcastle on the occasion of the first Newcastle Lecture in September 1975. I enjoyed the article immensely and found myself in almost complete agreement with its contents some twenty two years after its delivery. In particular I accept your central thesis that we have lacked the historical imperatives which tend, in other countries, to fashion what you call a ""cohesive society"", and that therefore such an outcome will only result from conscious effort on the part of our citizenry. As a student of law at Sydney University I had I have occasion, as you might expect, to read numerous of your judgments. Upon my election as Federal Member for Parramatta I took the opportunity to read your biography, ""A Radical Tory"", from which I derived both enjoyment and benefit. Your son Ross was a great help to me both in the presele.ction process and subsequently in the election campaign. You may be aware that Ross acted as campaign manager for my father on several occasions during his period as State Member for Northcott. My father always spoke very highly of you and I felt some genuine honour in being elected to a seat which claimed you as a previous incumbent. . . . I suspect that you may have little energy or appetite for public affairs these days but I did simply want you to know that I revere your contribution to Australian public life both in the Parliament and on the bench. In the light of recent High Court decisions ... I especially miss the rigorous discipline you imposed in resisting ""adventurism"" and in observance of the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary. I hope to continue in what might be described as the rational conservative tradition of which you are a conspicuous emblem in our nation's recent history. My purpose in writing is merely to register my appreciation for your example and public contribution which continues to be a source of encouragement and indeed inspiration to me. Yours sincerely, Ross Cameron I regard Sir Garfield as one of the great ones. I am pleased and thankful that he was a member of this place at a critical period and that he subsequently served with such amazing distinction as Chief Justice. I join other honourable members in registering my sympathy to the Barwick family and in recording my great appreciation for a great life. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",104
254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I thank the House. Barnard, Hon. Lance Herbert, AO Debate resumed.",108
255,Mr KERR,CONDOLENCES,"I am certain that I speak on behalf of all my Tasmanian colleagues and, in particular, the parliamentary Labor Party when I say that we will all miss Lance Barnard very greatly. He was one of a generation of great Tasmanian Labor leaders. In a small state, one would expect that the ability to generate people some capacity to cast a national shadow would be slight. But, in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, Tasmania brought forward a series of men and women who collectively represented the Tasmanian Labor Party in such a way as to give Labor the leadership of Tasmania for many generations and to allow them to play a part on the national stage. Lance Barnard followed in that tradition and was a most honourable and exceptional man. The Tasmanian Labor tradition goes back through people such as Cosgrove and Ogilvie, Eric Reece, Merv Everett, Roy Fagan and Justin O'Byrne-leaders at a state and federal - level. The legacy of the work which that generation of Labor leaders put in was that, at the time when Lance Barnard first served as Prime Minister, the Australian Labor Party occupied all five seats in the Tasmanian House of Representatives. Lance Barnard had as his colleagues the Reverend Gil Duthie, who served as the member for the seat of Wilmot-it was later called Lyons-for the entire period of his service, for over 20 years; Ron Davies, who served an equally long period as the member for Braddon; and people such as Ray Sherry and John Coates in Denison and Franklin whose terms, although shorter, were thculmination of work which had come forward over a long period. Labor was extraordinarily strongly represented in the Senate, with people such as Justin O'Byrne, who served as President of the Senate and later, Ken Wriedt, who was the Labor leader in the Senate and Minister for Primary Industries. All this welling forth of talent is quite unusual. It is no mark of disrespect to me and my colleagues to say that collectively we would not yet see ourselves in the same order of weight as so many Tasmanians who were brought forward to leadership positions in those times. Lance had an extraordinarily committed life. He went to the war when he was a young man, was wounded and came back to serve in the Australian parliament following his father, who had served as the member for Bass. He served for a great many years, slowly becoming a person whose counsel was listened to within the Labor Party. He later became with Deputy Prime Minister and deputy leader of the Labor Party. He held 14 portfolios when the Whitlam ministry was first formed and then held the portfolio of Defence for the rest of his period in office. He was a man who gave great loyalty. I think a mark of his loyalty, for example, is what he did when he was defence minister when the Whitlam government wanted to make cuts to expenditure. There was a plan put forward by the then Prime Minister that defence would be identified as one of the key areas for cuts so that it might serve as a marker to all colleagues that they had to take an equal degree of responsibility for the revenue restraint that the then Treasurer F-ank Crean, was seeking to impose. Playing h!s .I-art, Lance ,Barnard accepted that responSIbIlIty and took the weight of some criticism in the area of defence. Quite properly, those cuts were well balanced. - he - nfortunate thing, given the way in WhICh hIStOry records the fate of the Whitlam g-v-rnment, is that there was little equal wIllIngness on behalf of Lance's ministerial colleagues to bear the same restraint. We did face a period where there were substantial criticisms of the wont of financial management within the Whitlam government, which I think ultimately corroded its electoral support. Certainly no responsibility for that should be sheeted home to Lance Barnard who played an extraordinarily honourable and straightforward role as Gough's loyal deputy there and in all other circumstances. As Whitlam himself said, the mark of Lance Barnard was not simply that he was a loyal deputy but that he was a man whom anyone could meet and find that he met them on equal terms. He took them forward, he took them into his confidence as being worthy of respect and he treated all people who came into his embrace as people whom he would listen to, advise and assist. I was at his funeral the other day where one of Michelle O'Byrne's campaign workersMichelle is now the endorsed Labor candidate for the seat of Bass-said that he had first met Lance Barnard when he volunteered as a campaign worker for the then member for Bass, Silvia Smith. He had walked into a room and saw a man sitting in the comer, working quietly doing some paperwork. He asked what he might do to assist and he had a long conversation with the man. It was only three or four meetings later that he realised that the man who was working away in the comer, providing quiet advice and assistance, was none other than the person who had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam government. Lance Barnard was not a man who had any front. But he was not a man who, for the lack of front, could be seen as a person who did not have a natural dignity. That natural dignity was with him all the time. He was never a person who confronted you with a sense that he was an important man to whom you had to pay respect; rather he offered himself to you if you wished to take advice from him. If you did not, that was to your loss. All of us who knew Lance Barnard knew a man who had a simple dignity and who, after he had completed his period of service as a parliamentarian, did not retire from public life but rather continued it in a quiet, backroom and determined way, serving the people of Launceston. The number of boards, committees, charities and public works that Lance was associated with is enormous. Anyone who knew the heartbeat of the city of Launceston knew that Lance was very much integrated into that city. He loved it. He was fiercely parochial in the best sense of the word. He rarely sought to travel outside of Launceston; he lived there contentedly and quietly as he aged, surrounded by his family and friends, with the highest respect of all those who knew him. Lance was not in any way a stunted man. He was a man who had a wide range of interests. He communicated his basic respect for his fellow human beings by the quiet way he went about his business and by the obvious pleasure he showed in the small things he could do for the people of Launceston. I have great pleasure in rising to speak to this condolence motion. I know Lance will be greatly missed by the people of Tasmania, particularly the people of Launceston, and of course by his family.",108
256,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES,"I too would like to be associated with this condolence motion in memory of Lance Barnard. I knew Lance well in his role here. As the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has just described, he was a quiet achiever-an unexpected personality in many ways. His sincerity and obvious commitment went without question. In so many ways, I guess because of his personality and because of who he was, he made an enormous contribution to the Labor Party. The remarkable thing about Lance Barnard was that he constantly pipped Jim Cairns, who was at that time without any question the doyen of the Left of the Labor Party, through his persistence and quiet sincerity. Ultimately, in 1974, it was Lance who lost the deputy prime ministership to the same Jim Cairns. I know Gough Whitlam, in his contests with Jim Cairns, also owed a great deal to the commitment and support of Lance Barnard. I gather the first time Gough Whitlam contested the leadership of the Labor Party he won it by only three votes, and then largely on the basis of the support of Lance Barnard. There are a number of aspects to Lance's career of which I did want to make brief mention. The first is that, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, on so many occasions he was of course overshadowed by the mercurial personality of Gough-and in the old place more than this the personalities were just so significant. There we were closer together, we were in far more of a debating forum, and Gough Whitlam was one who was seen. It was he who participated in the major theatre of the place, and Lance was so often the quieter supporter whose rhetoric and whose utterances never had quite the dramatic impact. Yet in his own way he made a tremendous contribution to the Labor Party. I think it is important for those of us who look at Australia in trying to measure our place in the world to also recognise the shortness of our history. It is remarkable to think that Lance's father-Claude, that iswas himself a member for 15Y2 years for the same seat. He was a minister, I believe, for about three years in one of the Chifley ministries. So, in this motion tonight, we really are thinking back almost to the war years, and how short our history is, and how few there have been who have served in this place and who have served their state and nation as Lance. Certainly that period after 1972 when he held for that brief time those 14 portfolios was a remarkable period. I can remember so often sitting opposite him at the my lot on many occasions to be the spokesman for the opposition at that time on matters for which Lance was responsible. While on most occasions I guess I disagreed with him, certainly I always respected the honesty and integrity and forthrightness with which he approached his own administration. I think not only in that period but subsequently, particularly as Minister for Defence, his contribution to the Labor Party and to the Labor government was always one which one respected, even though one may not have agreed with some of his policy approaches. Lance Barnard was a significant politician. He was a major contributor to the Whitlam government. He was certainly, in his private and public life, a great contributor to Australarea. is. As an ambassador, as a citizen and as a parliamentarian he is one who did enhance the name and traditions of the Australian Labor Party. I pay my respect to him and his memory. I, along with my wife, would like to extend my sympathies to Jill, his children and their families.",109
257,Mr ADAMS,CONDOLENCES,"I also rise to make some remarks about Lance Barnard. He was a friend, a wonderful man, a very quiet man in many respects, but such a big man in so many ways. He began his career as a schoolteacher. He also set that record of holding the 14 cabinet portfolios all at the same time in the early days of the Whitlam government-something I think that will never be broken, and something that Lance has as a record. Politically, Lance Barnard came from a very great traditional Labor family. As has been mentioned by the previous speaker, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), his father, Claude, was the member for Bass for 15 years and a minister in the Chifley government-the Minister for Repatriation. I served in the state cabinet in Tasmania with Lance's nephew Michael Barnard, who was the member for Bass in the state parliament from 1969 to 1984, was elected deputy leader of the party and, of course, went on to become Deputy Premier while I was in that cabinet. His other cousins and family members have played a big part in the table. It fell Labor Party in Tasmania. Lance Barnard was born in Launceston and educated at state schools and technical high schools in Launceston. The outbreak of World War II interrupted his training as a teacher. He went off to war where he served in the Middle East, taking part in the defence of Egypt against the tanks and armies that had been assembled by Rommel and the Eighth Army's offensive against El Alamain where he was wounded. One of his brothers was killed during the Second World War, and the other was also returned home wounded. After leaving the army, he took up teaching again. He was very active in the Labor Party around the Bass electorate in the Launceston In 1954 he won the federal seat of Bass and held it for 21 years, becoming deputy leader of the party in 1967. In 1975 he resigned and became Ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland. But that is only about a third of Lance's life. Returning from his role as ambassador, he continued to be a part of Launceston and to work with his constituents-which he had done probably since he had been a boy in his father's office-right through until his death. A week before Lance died the Launceston City Council had a ceremony for him to thank him for his dedication not only to northern Tasmania but to the island as a whole. His interests continued to be for young people and for jobs. He was involved in a group training scheme. He was trying to find jobs for people right up to the last of his life. He was well loved by veterans and pensioners. He helped so many people over the years just by putting their problems together in letter form and being able to get that to a department to sort out-sometimes a very simple problem. I myself as a young man can remember seeing Lance at Monagan' s cafe, a very ordinary cafe in Brisbane Street, Launceston. Lance would often be there taking tea with sorts of people-sometimes the businessmen of Launceston, and sometimes the railway workers from across the river. If you wanted to talk to someone, Lance was always available to be talked to. He gave me advice before the 1993 election and he gave me further good advice before the 1996 election in predicting that I would retain the seat of Lyons-and he was spot on in that regard. When I thought back on Lance's life, I tried to think of when I could not remember him, and that is impossible. He was always a part of the Labor Party for me in Tasmania. In my memory of the party and of the Labor move. ment, he was always there and always has been there. With that, the gap he leaves is huge: his experience and his knowledge of history, his dry humour and his willingness to fill in any time you needed a speaker. Any time someone was late or someone could not get there, Lance was always up and always on top of every issue that seemed to exist. He could give you 10 minutes off the cuff. Then there was his greatness at Labor conferences, which seemed to be enormous events to me as a 17and l8-year-old. I : remember going to Labor conferences with Eric Reece, Lance Barnard, Roy Fagan and . the other greats of our movement of that fl-Jance was such a great person. He was held 10 great respect. , He was a quiet, gentle person whom you leou.ld talk to. Anybody at any level of our hJOClety could talk to him about anything at any time. He was such a humble human being, and that was what I think was his greatness. It came through to whoever he was with. He was a great man and a great Tasmanian. I am a better person for having known him and having spent time in the same political party with the same political beliefs as him. My condolences to Jill and to his children, Patricia, Suzanne, Nicholas and Jacqueline.",110
258,Mr CHARLES,CONDOLENCES,"I rise tonight to add my voice to that of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) and others who have spoken so eloquently about the passing of Lance Barnard. I first met Lance in 1990 all I believe in association with a Queensland gentleman named Tom Quinn, who in subsequent years went on to become the founding President of Group Training Australia. The issue was all about the group training schemes because Lance was a director of a group training scheme in Launceston, the Inner Northern Group Training Company. He was passionately involved in trying to help young people find sustainable jobs and get proper vocational training as apprentices or as trainees. He was passionate about the work. I spoke with him on numerous occasions in my office, in the corridors in this place over lunch and in the offices of the Group Training company in Launceston. He was a power behind that group's work, and they have done some very outstanding work throughout the years, some of the most innovati ve things that any group training company has ever done. He was very much at the forefront and involved in that work. Those who are in and associated with the group training movement in Australia will recognise what I say when I say that he was a very important part of the development of that very important movement through Australia. I remember back in 1990 when his own Labor government was starting progressively state. to cut the funding to group training companies by 25 per cent a year when after four years the funding would have ceased. Tom Quinn originally enlisted my assistance in that debate in trying to debate with John Dawkins that they needed the funding and that we needed group training companies. Lance Barnard added his voice to that request. We were ultimately, although perhaps a year or two late, successful. I will not take up the time of the House except to say that, from all that I know, I believe Lance Barnard was a great Australian. He deserves our respect. Group training I know will miss him. I add my voice to the condolences of others to his wife, his children and those of his family whom he leaves behind.",111
259,Mr WILLIS,CONDOLENCES,"As one of the few members of the House who served with Lance, I am pleased to have this opportunity to put on the record my thoughts about Lance as we honour his memory in this condolence motion. When one thinks about Lance and what he was like, one does not think of dramatic words like charismatic, personable, passionate but rather decent, measured, modest, assiduous, committed, courteous, compassionate and capable. For these qualities, he was much admired both by his political friends and his political enemies. But there was also another set of qualities that took him to the second top rung in Australian politics, and that was a determination to succeed, to triumph over adversity, and that he did in no small way. As has been mentioned, when Lance entered politics he did so with significant disabilities resulting from his war injuries at El Alamein which resulted in the loss of one eye and of the complete loss of hearing in one ear and partial loss in the other. Despite these significant impairments, he was able to become a leading parliamentarian of his time. As Deputy Prime Minister, which he was when I first knew him, he was a considerable contrast to Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Whilst he lacked the searing intellect, the charisma, the articulateness, the incisive repartee and the larger than life physical and personal presence of his leader, he had extremely valuable qualities that made him almost the perfect Deputy Prime Minister for the times. For a start, because gent, rational, politically astute and utterly trustworthy, he was Gough's confidant; a confidant he needed and did not have once Lance was replaced as deputy leader after the 1974 election. Gough often discussed issues of the day with him on the phone and in each other's offices. Given Gough's renowned impatience and reforming zeal-the crash through or crash approach-the Labor government was fortunate that in the Deputy Prime Minister they had someone who could exercise a moderating influence when that was needed, which was not infrequently. Lance also played the role of repairing relationships with ministerial and caucus colleagues who had been trampled on or had their egos bruised by the prime ministerial intolerance for procrastination, delay or even opposition. Lance would often invite such offended parties to his office for a chat and a drink and try to smooth things over. In this way he played a valuable role in achieving as much harmony as possible in the midst of the Whitlam whirlwind. He was not just a loyal and effective lieutenant. As Minister for Defence, he recorded major achievements. His first ministerial act and the first decision of the famous two-man interim government he and Gough formed after the 1972 election was to end conscription by suspending the National Service Act. He also ended our military involvement in Vietnam and carried out the major task of combining the five defence departments into one defence department. Defence issues were his abiding policy interest and, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said earlier today, he established the defence policy on which Australia has long relied. In seeking to pull the five defence departments into one department, he was opposed by the service chiefs, who feared a major loss of influence within the government and also were concerned that he intended to put together a Canadian style single defence service. Lance overcame this resistance and saw the reform almost through to completion. It was in fact passed through the Senate a couple of months after Lance's resignation he was intelli- from the parliament. As a member of the two-man government, he had 14 portfolios, as has been mentioned. What has not been mentioned is that this got him into the Guinness Book of Records as having the most portfolios of any minister ever in a democratic government. Although Lance was utterly committed to the Labor Party, one decision he made that turned out not to be in the party's interests was his decision not to accept the governorgeneralship when it was offered to him in 1974. Had he done so, the Bass by-election would have been in mid-1974, when the government was in much better shape than it was in mid-1975, which was when Lance resigned from the parliament, so requiring a by-election which resulted in a landslide against Labor. Had the by-election for Bass been in 1974, Labor may well have held the seat, or at least it would have avoided a result which emboldened the opposition to block the budget in the Senate. If, however, they had blocked it, hardly likely that Lance as Governor General would have sought advice from the Chief Justice, sacked the government and called an election, as John Kerr did. His refusal of the governor-generalship was hardly a surprise. He was a very modest man. He liked to keep his feet on the ground, to stay in touch with the common people. He was passionately devoted to his electorate, as has been mentioned, returning there always on Friday mornings when he was a minister to service the needs of his electorate. Why then did he resign to become Ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland in mid1975? Although he was certainly hurt by the loss of the deputy position after the 1974 election, his reason for leaving in mid-1975 had much to do with his hearing difficulty, which was getting worse. He had to strain to hear questions in the House, which sometimes required him to ask for questions to be repeated and which brought the inevitable catcalls from the opposition. He eventually was told by his doctor that he risked losing his hearing altogether if he stayed in parliament. So he did not deserve the criticism he received from .,some quarters for destabilising the government by his resignation. .. I am pleased to say that his capacities were '\VeIl appreciated by the Fraser government. - He was asked by foreign minister Andrew Peacock to extend his term as ambassador to the Nordic countries, but he declined to do so. He rejected a knighthood that was offered to him, but he did accept the post as Commissioner for War Graves, a post which took him back to his abiding interests in defence issues. Such actions by the coalition parties in government demonstrated fully the regard in which he was held by his political opponents. Yet he remained completely committed to Labor. Right up to the last election he was actively involved in the seat of Bass in assisting Labor, firstly, to win the seat, which it eventually did in 1993, and then to hold it, which it failed to do. Whenever one as a minister went to Launceston to any Labor function, one could bet that Lance would be there. He worked five days a week for Silvia Smith in her three it is years as member for Bass, dealing mainly with constituents and veterans issues but also providing political advice when required. For a man who by this time was in his mid-70s, this was devotion to the party indeed. He also maintained a great concern for ex-service men and women and helped them mightily in his electorate and elsewhere through his role as member and for many years after he ceased to be an MP. Right up until last year he represented veterans as their advocate at the Veterans Review Board. By any standards, this was indeed an altruistic man-one who sought high office but never forgot his roots, never forgot his electorate or his fellow ex-service men and women and never forgot the party that gave him the opportunity to serve his country well in peace time as well as in war. One final insight into Lance's personality that I would mention came with the ending of the Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. At the same time, he adopted a Vietnamese orphan baby girl. Whilst this was clearly fulfilling a family need, it also was surely symbolic of a perceived need for Australia to now play a caring, compassionate role in Vietnam, not just to walk away from the devastation of war. This was indeed the action of an admirable man. I give my sympathy to his wife, Jill, and his family.  p.m.)-In this motion of condolence, I wish to join earlier speakers in extending on behalf of my wife and me our deepest sympathies to Jill and all members of the Barnard family on the unexpected passing of Lance. I met Lance Barnard and worked with him when I was first elected to parliament as a member of the Whitlam government, which the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) referred to. He was a man of great dignity and gentleness, a man who was always approachable. To me as a new backbencher in 1972 to 1975, Lance Barnard was a quiet man, a decent man, who was always prepared to listen. He made a great contribution to our nation during his long public life. We honour him. We thank his family for the sacrifices they made in forgoing his presence when his parliamentary and public duties called him away from them. As a Labor member of parliament and a Labor minister, he set a standard for all of us to emulate. To his wife, Jill, son Nicholas and daughters Patricia, Suzanne and Jacqueline and all other members of the family, we extend our deepest sympathy and our condolences. They should take great comfort in the service that Lance gave to the nation and to all of our community. He served Australia well, and he served his beloved Tasmania even greater still.",112
260,Mr ROBERT BROWN,CONDOLENCES,"I would also like to associate myself with this condolence motion and, in the process, to convey my sympathy to Lance's widow, Mrs Barnard, their children and grandchildren, and to those people whom Lance so admirably represented in so many different ways, as others have said, in both war and peace. I thought it was typical that, during the condolence motion contributions earlier today, we had the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) refer to Lance Barnard as likeable, courteous and a decent man, and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) refer to him as a humble, modest and great man. We had those words as well from his leader, Gough Whitlam, at Lance's funeral, when he referred to Lance as a prince among men. For a reference of that kind to be made by a person who was a great Prime Minister himself and a great, principled and visionary man who so warmly embraced the memory of his friend, colleague and deputy, Lance Barnard, at the funeral, probably more than anything else reflects on the nature of Lance Barnard. It was always a source of disappointment to me, personally, that I never had the privilege of serving in the national parliament with Lance Barnard. I also felt the same way in connection with Gough Whitlam. I always appreciated the goodwill, the assistance and the affection which Lance Barnard showed to me. Like the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), when I had those opportunities to visit Launceston in a ministerial capacity, Lance Barnard was always there pursuing the interests of that city he loved. The words that so many people have used-words like loyalty, unpretentiousness, modesty, a person of humility and dignity-all so admirably reflect the nature of the man. People have referred to the fact that Lance had inherited the commitment and traditions of Labor from his father. Of course, it was a whole family commitment to Labor and the principles and ideology of Labor. The member for Lyons (Mr Adams) reminded us as well that Lance's nephew, Michael Barnard, served in the state parliament. We talk often about the Labor Party being a family, being a church, and that type of family commitment probably reflects it better than anything else. Lance Barnard-teacher, soldier, parliamentarian, ambassador, Deputy Prime Minister-was a good man who so solidly committed himself to the interests of those people he identified with so warmly; not only the people of Launceston but the people of Tasmania and Australia. As I said, my sympathy goes to Mrs Barnard, to their children and grandchildren, to the people of the Bass electorate of Tasmania and to those people throughout Australia generally who so warmly related to Lance Barnard.",114
261,Mr HOLDING,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to add my sentiments to the sentiments already expressed by members from both sides of the House in this condolence motion for Lance Barnard. As a parliamentarian, but more importantly as a human being, he was a gentle, decent man whose commitment to his family, his political party, his state and, ultimately, this parliament seemed endless. He had a calmness of reasoning which leavened the somewhat turbulent crash-through spirit of his leader, Gough Whitlam. Lance Barnard's wartime service has already been mentioned in this House. He was a man of great strength and judgment and provided a balance in the difficult tasks that confronted a new Labor government. Recent disclosures by Gough Whitlam revealed that Lance Barnard and Frank Crean were both on a list of names provided by the then Governor General Hasluck as potential persons who should be considered by the Prime Minister on the occasion of Governor General Hasluck's retirement. It is interesting to ponder how different Australian history would have been if either Frank Crean or Lance Barnard had taken that offer. But Lance Barnard's commitment to his party and his state, and the role that he was achieving, I think outweighed any ambition he may have had to hold the highest office in Australia could be offered to him. My association with Lance Barnard arose in my capacity as the then leader of the Victorian opposition and in a somewhat turbulent period when the party was going through one of its characteristic upheavals. That occasioned the Prime Minister to pay me a visit of support and he brought Lance Barnard with him. It was in those internal conversations that the strength and wisdom of Lance - arnard came through. It was his tempered Judgment and political experience but, above a-l, his depth and integrity which I think made hIm a valuable colleague. As other members have said, he will be 'missed in his state. But I think he will be '!Dis-ed.far more widely than in his state. This 'lDstItutlOn is strengthened and our party is .strengthened when we look at the record of people like Lance Barnard. We are all saddened by his loss but we have all been made - tter people for our political association with . him. My wife and I extend our condolences to Jill and his family. Like them, we will be strengthened-certainly his younger colleagues in this place will be strengthened-for the tasks that lie ahead because of the benefits that we have all gathered from knowing this man.",114
262,Mr BARRY JONES,CONDOLENCES,"Lalor) (9.38 p.m.)Lance Barnard slipped unobtrusively and unexpectedly out of life in Melbourne. The unexpectedness denied his family the opportunity to say goodbye. The funeral ceremony at St John's, Launceston, was a very moving community tribute-a packed church, a deep sense of community loss and a deeply emotional panegyric from Gough Whitlam. As so many people have said-I do not want to keep repeating what others have said about him-he was a man of complete integrity. His loss of the deputy leadership in 1974 after seven years in the job was a very great blow. As we all know, what followed was a change in the way in which the then Labor government was operating the then Bass by-election, leading ultimately to the events of 11 November 1975 and the followthat ing very heavy election defeat. It is quite possible that, if Lance Barnard had remained as the deputy leader throughout that period and there had been no Bass by-election, the 1974 government might well have continued and not faced an election until 1977. Lance Barnard was extraordinarily unselfish. The role that I remember very muchthis is very similar to what my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) was saying-is that he had an extraordinarily calming effect in that period between 1967 and the election of the Labor government in 1972. This was the period when the name of Gough Whitlam was a kind of boo word inside the Victorian Labor Party. Unlike the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party, we really do play politics in Victoria as a blood sport. We lack that effete quality associated with the New South Wales party. During that period Lance Barnard did play an extraordinarily important role in seeing people, talking to them, listening to them, getting around to all the groups and trying to persuade them in a most unselfish way to provide support for the federal leadership. There was a period when there is no doubt that it was the staunch support of Lance Barnard that kept Gough Whitlam in the leadership. There were a number of attempts made to persuade Lance to run for the leadership himself. If he had done so, Gough's position would have been quite untenable. He took the view-it was very realistic; he had no illusions about himself-that Gough WhitIam was the person to bring the Labor Party to victory, that he had the broadest grasp of policy, the most encyclopaedic mastery of detail. He saw his role as being a loyal deputy and he fulfilled that role extraordinarily well until 1974. Gough Whitlam always said that the twoman ministry of 1972 was the first two-man ministry since that of the Duke of Wellington. But it is one of those very rare occasions when he is wrong. The Duke of Wellington's ministry was a one-man ministry. He held every portfolio for a brief period in November-December 1834 when he was waiting for Peel, who was then overseas in Italy, I think, to come back in order to take office. He did not want to hand out portfolios to anyone else; he took them all. Lance Barnard was particularly proud that in his role as Minister for Defence, at the time of the winding up of the Vietnam War, he was able to playa decisive role. People did not quite grasp how seriously he had been injured in World War II, serving with the 9th Division at EI Alamein. It affected his sight, hearing and lung capacity. But he was a very uncomplaining person. I did not serve in parliament with him but I met him very often. Every time. I went to Launceston, which was quite often in the 1980s, Lance was always there to provide support. He did not seem to feel that he had to playa starring role. He was very keen to be part of the support mechanism in the party. I see him as a very lovable person who devoted himself to the party, his nation and his city with great dignity and dedication. The final point is that when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister, after Lance had returned from his service as ambassador to Sweden, Norway and Finland, for a time he was director of the Office of Australian War Graves. As Gough WhitIam pointed out in his panegyric, Lance was offered a knighthood, a KCMG, which he declined. We will always remember Lance Barnard with love because of his absolute commitment to our nation. He enriched the parliament, and we are all diminished by his passing.",115
263,Mr QUICK,CONDOLENCES,"As a Tasmanian representative, I am proud to take part in the debate on this condolence motion. Lance Barnard was a Tasmanian legend in his own lifetime. My involvement with Lance started long after he had finished his long and meritorious service in the federal parliament. Those of us who rejoiced in Labor's victory in 1972 well remember the role he played as Gough Whitlam's loyal deputy in that 197274 era. Those of us who are involved in the Tasmanian branch of the ALP are always very conscious of the huge debt we owe this wonderful man. He always downplayed the magnificent contribution he had made during his lifetime to the Tasmania he loved and represented so admirably and also to the many Australians he served as part of the Whitlam government. Lance's death has seen the end of an era in Tasmanian politics. As the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) stated in his address, Lance and his fellow parliamentarians who held the five seats for Labor in Tasmania set a very high standard for those of us who have followed in their footsteps. Lance was a peerless grassroots politician. He set an example for those of us who sought to emulate his long and distinguished record. The work Lance did for the community during his life as a parliamentarian has been acknowledged in the many tributes to him here today. This work did not stop once he left parliament. In fact, it continued unabated and probably increased upon his return to civilian life. Thousands of Tasmanians can recount stories of the impact Lance has had on their lives as schoolteacher, soldier, politician, Deputy Prime Minister, ambassador. He was taken from us long before his time. Tasmania has lost one of its finest sons. He was a magnificent mentor to those of us who wished to enter federal parliament. We in the Tasmanian ALP will find it very difficult to find someone to fill his shoes. He is the last of an era. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.

266,Mr JULL,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I move: That the House insists on disagreeing to amendments Nos 1 to 8 and 10 to 68 insisted on by the Senate. The government is committed to the constitutional convention and is keen for this bill to be passed as soon as possible to enable planning to proceed for what has been after all an element of coalition policy since 1994. Unlike the opposition, we believe that Australians deserve the opportunity to have the issues involved in the republic debate discussed in an open forum. Many in the community want to learn more about the issues and opinions and options to allow them to make up their own minds before they are asked to vote on the issue. The convention of half elected and half appointed delegates will serve as a forum to engage the wider community and to increase awareness of both our current system and options for change. The voluntary postal ballot proposed by the government to elect half of the delegates to the constitutional convention is fair and convenient for electors. It is also cost-effective. We do not agree that a compulsory vote is appropriate for this election because, unlike parliamentary elections to determine governments, this ballot will not confer powers or obligations. It is an election for delegates to attend a lO-day convention to discuss the republic issue, not a definitive vote on the republic. We are not prepared to propose a law which would make Australians guilty of an offence if they chose not to vote in the election for delegates to the convention, particularly when many Australians have not yet come to grips with the complex and difficult issues in this debate. Electoral systems need to be designed with these circumstances in mind, and we are confident that, if this proposal is considered on its merits, it will be supported. Contrary to the opposition's assertions, this bill is not the first Commonwealth legislation has provided for voluntary voting. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 provides for voluntary voting in regional council elections. The Australian Electoral Commission, which has an international reputation in the conduct of fair and open elections, advises us that a postal ballot can provide a secure and creditable system and that there is no evidence that fears of wide scale tampering have been borne out in practice. The estimates prepared by the Australian Electoral Commission indicate that a voluntary postal ballot would cost $35.6 million-$13 million less than a voluntary attendance ballot, at approximately $49 million. A compulsory vote would add costs of approximately $2 million to $4 million, depending on the turnout. We cannot accept the amendments imposed by the Senate. If the Senate again insists on its amendments to the bill, then the constitutional convention cannot be held in this term of government.",117
267,Mr BEAZLEY,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"We oppose the motion strenuously, as we did suggest the amendments that the Senate ultimately came up with in the course of the debate here in this chamber some time ago now. At the last election this government did not go to the Australian people and say to them, 'Oh, by the way, when we put in place this constitutional convention, what we will be doing is overturning the Australian secret ballot and overturning the compulsory attendance at the polls that has served this country well since the 1920s and the Australian ballot for a lot longer than that.' They went to the electorate and said, 'We will have a constitutional convention.' We are fully prepared to support that proposition. We are perfectly happy for the government to have their constitutional convention, even though we think the government ought to be presenting to the Australian people immediately the question as to whether or not there ought to be an Australian head of state. This is a matter not to be tinkered with by politicians any more; there has been enough time public debate on this. Any reasonable reading of any of the opinion polls and any of the debate that has occurred to date would show that you could not sensibly stand up and say that these matters have not been given due consideration by the Australian electorate. They are prepared to vote. The government are not prepared to permit them to do so. The government want to produce with this constitutional convention a flawed process that serves several of their ends. The first of their ends is a convention with plausible denial, a convention that does not necessarily represent the full articulated view of the Australian people. They may choose then to accept the outcome or reject it and have their argument around that particular point. The second thing is that they always like a little bit on the side. The little bit on the side is to work out a mechanism for starting to introduce the public to the notion that perhaps what we do not need is a compulsory ballot. When you take a look at their performance to this point, you see that there is no question at all that very substantial numbers of the members of the government side no longer wish a compulsory ballot to obtain. They believe there is political advantage in that. Whether or not there is political advantage for the Liberal Party, for the Australian community to have that situation obtained would be extremely bad indeed. The capacity to develop from that process a representative parliament would be virtually non-existent. This compulsory ballot was not put in place by this side of politics. The compulsory ballot was legislated by the other side of politics and strongly supported by them when it occurred, because in the election prior to the act being passed there was a turnout of something like 57 per cent. With voluntary voting in Western Australia, where it occurs in local government, you are lucky to get a turnout of 15 to 30 per cent in those ballots. We would be lucky to get a turnout of 50 per cent in our elections. We would get very quickly to the US situation, where about 75 per cent of those entitled to enrol do so and about 50 per cent of those who subsequently enrol end up voting. The consequence of that is that invariably the American President and the American Congress are representative of very much a minority slice of American public opinion. We do not want to see that process begin in this place, when no indication before the last election was given that that was the intention of the government. Reasonable estimates point out that some two million people will be effectively disenfranchised by this, that these papers will hit the kitchen tables of a substantial number of people, but many will miss out-some two million are highly likely to miss out. Even if every ballot paper is returned from those whose kitchen table it finally arrives on, there will still be that plausible denial that I referred to earlier. A representative vote will not emerge from them. That is not going to be a constitutional convention which will be representative of any sort of Australian opinion at all. The government know that and I suspect strongly that the government would welcome that, were that to occur. If the government proceed with this, and it is subsequently lost in the Senate and they take their bat and ball home, then we will go to the next election in the position we are probably in now-that is, the only party prepared to put an honest question before the Australian people on the issue of a republic. (Extension o/time granted) We will go to the next election as the only political party putting forward a proposition to the Australian electorate which says this: 'If you wish to have your constitution properly reflect your civil polity, if you wish to have your constitution properly reflect the fact that we are a mature democracy, if you wish your constitution to have a fully-fledged Australian head of state, then there is one party that will put an honest vote before you.' It will be a vote that will include no overthrow of the Australian secret ballot, the one mechanism that is now universally recognised by an Australian title. When you go and talk about secret ballots at conferences of politicians in other countries or at constitutional and electoral conferences, you will hear people refer to the Australian secret ballot, which is to be overthrown by this particular proposition. The Australian secret ballot is not good enough for an election of an Australian constitutional convention. That is the position of the other side. An Australian secret ballot is not suitable for the election of a convention to deal with matters pertaining to the Australian constitution. If you want to spit the dummy, if you cannot persuade the minority parties in the Senate to support you-and no doubt you will do your level best to persuade them to support you-be it on your heads. We will move propositions in the Senate and here to give people an opportunity for that secret ballot. If you choose to defeat those propositions, then we will go to the next election, which is 12 to 18 months away anyway, with precisely those propositions. The Australian people will know that you are not fair dinkum. The Australian people will know that you have paid lip-service to the issues of constitutional conventions. The Australian people will know that you have arrogant contempt for their rights to speak out on whether or not there should be an Australian head of state. What thundering arrogance. What thundering arrogance that you will not put that position to the Australian people, a matter which you have debated with us for some considerable period of time, which very large numbers of members of the Liberal Party have expressed themselves supportive of and which even odd members of the National Party has expressed themselves willing to support. This government will not permit them a vote. And they will know that. You will have had three years to do it by the time of the next election. Despite the strong support of large numbers in the community, despite the strong support of Liberal Premiers and of others in the Liberal Party, despite the strong support particularly of young Australians seeking a bit of adventure, a bit of an opportunity to grasp their constitution, their civic polity, to express their view, they can go and put it in their pipes and smoke it as far as this government is concerned. They will not forget it. This is not going to be the biggest issue at the next election. It is not necessarily the biggest issue before us. But if your civil polity cannot handle the question of what the status of your constitution and your head of state is because a political party blocks them with mealy-mouthed words from their capacity to do so, then you have a weak civil polity. Everybody fundamentally understands that. This little piece of chicanery by the Liberal Party to get onto the agenda a particular obsession of the parliamentary secretary who is interested in that, supported by one or two others on the other side of the House, has to be exposed for what it is, and that is a piece of Liberal Party tomfoolery. That piece of Liberal Party tomfoolery is at the expense of decent democratic procedure in this country. To stand in this place and say that ballot papers ought to be sitting on the kitchen table so that everybody can come in and have a look at them, when you have that Australian secret ballot tradition, is an utter and absolute disgrace. To say that you are going to spit the dummy if the Senate objects to it reveals exactly the sort of people-arrogant peoplewe have running this country. If you put this through you will successfully get it through here. You may get it through the Senate; I don't know. But you stand condemned for lowering the standards of democracy in this place and you will be. (Time expired)",118
268,Mrs BISHOP,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Mackellar-Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel) 00.02 p.m.)-I rise to speak to this motion for the simple reason that we have just seen the most pathetic display of what I might call a flummery of false indignation. What a load of old codswallop we have just listened to. Simply, we put forward an honest proposition and you revel in dishonesty. What a load of old rubbish to say that the only thing you want to put to the people is whether or not we will have an Australian head of state. The last time. I took a look, Sir William Deane looked pretty Australian to me, and he is the head of state in this country. You cannot even form all a question which has any honesty about it. We are putting up a proposition that says: 'Here is an opportunity for you to speak, to come and debate the only two questions that matter'. Those people who want a change to our constitutional arrangements have to tell us, first, precisely what it is they propose and, second, how it will benefit the people of Australia. They are the two questions that need to be answered. The convention we are proposing will give the opportunity to those who want change to come and answer those two questions to the satisfaction of the people. To date you have been pretty ineffective at it. There has been no honesty in the debate coming from those who want the change. Here we have an honest proposition. If you are serious and you want to come and discuss this matter then simply vote for the proposition we are putting forward, and that is to have the convention in the terms we have proposed it. That means that there will be a voluntary postal vote. If you do not like it, you are the people who are not prepared to come to that convention and put your point of view. It is time to put up and be honest and say you have a point of view that you reckon is worth defending, or do not hide behind this flummery of false indignation but come out and say that you do not want to put up, because you do not have anything to say. The bottom line is that we are giving you an honest chance to come in here and have a say at this convention, which will be properly held and properly put together, a postal ballot that will be properly conducted. The real answer is that, if you are serious, you will support it. But if you are not serious and you just want to argy-bargy for the sake of it because you have nothing to better to do, then you will do what you are doing and will vote against it. The proposition here is pretty simple.",120
269,Mr MELHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,You haven't defended the Prime Minister yet.,121
270,Mrs BISHOP,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) does not need to be defended because the Prime Minister stands for the integrity of the system he is putting forward. He is a man who gives leadership to this country in a way you lot failed to do for 13 years. As I have sat here and listened to the pomposity that has gone on in various speeches through the day, all I can say is: if you have any sense you will support the motion that we have before this House to enable that convention to take place, to hear the arguments put in a sensible fashion, where we can honestly see what is really being proposed, where it can be seriously debated and some sort of resolution reached. In the meantime, if you continue in the nonsensical way you do the Australian people will treat you with the contempt you deserve.",121
271,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Mr Nehl}-The question is that the motion be agreed to.,121
272,Mr MELHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,You didn't even speak for five minutes.,121
273,Mrs BISHOP,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,I didn't need five minutes to get the point across.,121
274,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Mr Nehl)Order! The question is that the motion be agreed to. Mr Martin Ferguson-That is out of order.,121
275,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,It is not up to the member for Batman to tell anybody that they are out of order when he is continuously out of order.,121
276,Mr MELHAM,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"The government has said that the reason the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill is back in this House is that it wants to give the Labor Party and the minor parties and Independents in the Senate one last opportunity to support the bill. That is what Senator Minchin said in his press release of 22 August 1997. Senator Minchin has said that if we fail to support the bill the convention will not proceed. This alone shows that the government is not serious about the republic and constitutional reform. The history of our constitution shows that proposals for reform succeed only when they are supported by both sides of politics and when the politics is inclusive. But the government have sought to deliberately divide debate on this issue. They have asked the Labor Party and other parties to make an unpalatable choice between our pursuit of the republic and our support for compulsory voting, one of the pillars of our democratic system. We do not want to choose between two issues we hold dear. We are simply not prepared to play the government's silly game. Accordingly, we will continue to support a compulsory ballot for the election of delegates to the people's convention. If the government are not prepared to accept a voting system that has served this nation well since 1924, then they can explain that decision to the Australian people. In the meantime, the government can be assured that the issue of the republic will not go away. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is trying to use this issue as a convenient excuse for the republic to go away. It will not go away. The Labor Party will ensure that the Australian people continue to have an opportunity to discuss this important issue. I want to discuss why we are actually here this evening. We are here as part of a smokescreen to cover the government's incompetent handling of this bill. The government has refused to reveal that the reason the House is voting on the bill tonight is that the government forgot to return this bill to the House at the end of the last sitting. The effect of that mistake is that the time period required by section 57 of the constitution between the first and second rejections of a bill by the Senate has not started to run. It will start to run only after the House responds to the message returned from the Senate tonight. Interestingly, the three-month gap required by the constitution will be completed in the last sitting week of the current session. So when Senator - inchin says that he does not want a double dissolution trigger he is being disingenuous at best. He and the government are keeping their options open, and this is matched by what his colleagues have said. For instance, on the Sunday program the Treasurer (-r Costello) clearly left open the issue of whether the convention bill would be used as a double dissolution trigger. I quote from the transcript: Costello: The only way a double dissolution trigger can come about is if Labor rejects legislation. Now, we have a policy which we took to the Australian people last election for a constitutional convention this year. The legislation's in the Senate. We want that convention. Oakes: But surely that's not important enough for a double dissolution is it? Costello: Well if the Labor Party defeats it, you could rack up a trigger. But we're not putting that legislation up to rack up double dissolution triggers. We're putting it up because we want a constitutional convention. They are putting it up tonight because they stuffed it up in no uncertain terms last time by not returning the message from the Senate. This is too important an issue. But the question will be a simple one: if you ditch the convention, at the next election the Australian people can be told, 'If you want an Australian republic, don't vote for John Howard because he is not going to give it to you.' He has used this issue in effect to try to stop the republic agenda going forward. Senator - inchin has used this issue for sleazy, grubby internal politics because he wants to pursue his agenda of non-compulsory voting. Compulsory voting works in this country. It is the opportunity for the electorate to participate in our voting system. It is something that we hold dear, and 96 per cent of the electorate continually come out and vote. That system is not broke and this government and Senator - inchin should not be trying to introduce non-compulsory voting by stealth, because that is what they are trying to do. They should not be linking the two. Let the people have a say for half the convention delegates. The convention will have no credibility if only about 20 per cent of the people vote in this postal ballot system that you are proposing. It is a farce. (Time expired)",121
277,Mr ANDREW,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I have seldom sat in this chamber listening to so much humbug from the opposition benches. Here we have a situation where the member for Banks (-r - elham) has declared that compulsory voting is something that he, the Australian electorate and the Leader of the Opposition (-r Beazley), referring to the Australian secret ballot, hold dear. Let me tell the member for Banks, if I can gain his attention for just a moment, that I happen to hold compulsory voting dear as well. I have no particular interest in a noncompulsory ballot. I have no reason to run a non-compulsory voting agenda. I have never agreed with my colleague Senator - inchin on the question of non-compulsory voting. But, so far as I can determine, what we are dealing with tonight has nothing to do with the legal framework that affects this parliament in Australia. We are not electing a parliament. We are electing effectively the representatives to a constitutional convention. No law in this country will change as a result of any decision made at the constitutional convention. Tell me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the only way that a law in Australia changes is when the people who represent electorates around Australia-148 of themvote in a particular way, and those people, you and I among them, are compulsorily elected to our positions in this House. What we are dealing with here is a noncompulsory vote merely to elect some of the delegates to a convention to make recommendations to the people. Before those recommendations become law there will be a compulsory vote. What on earth is the opposition on about? I heard the Leader of the Opposition refer to what he called the arrogant contempt of the government. 'Why,' he said, 'Australians will be silenced and denied the right to vote.' I ask the member for Banks: tell me who will be denied the right to vote? What Australian loses the opportunity to vote as a result of this procedure? The answer is none-not one. Every Australian, I remind the member for Banks, gets the opportunity to vote. More than that, every Australian, given the extensive card that they expect to be considering, gets the opportunity to cast a vote over which they have had time to deliberate. But for some strange reason, some mystifying reason, those opposite see this as some sort of threat and some sort of agenda for a non-compulsory vote. It is absolute nonsense. All that the parliament is considering is the right for people to be elected to a convention to make recommendations to the people of Australia. Having made those recommendations, the people of Australia will determine via a compulsory vote called a referendum or via a compulsory vote called an election what changes occur in terms of the way Australia is governed. In South Australia-and I am not well enough informed to know what happens in the other states-South Australians deliberately choose to elect the people who govern them at local government level by a noncompulsory ballot. I conclude where I began. I am not someone desperately anxious to have compulsory voting. This is not an exercise in changing the law of Australia. It is an exercise in selecting the delegates to a constitutional convention, and a non-compulsory vote is entirely appropriate.",122
278,Mr KERR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Denison) (10.16 p.m.)Nothing could be more revealing than the comments of the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) who said, 'I conclude where I began'. So much of this debate about a proposal for a constitutional convention is simply that: the intention of concluding where we begin-that is, defying the very strong will of the Australian people by putting forward spurious proposals that are really set up to fail. These are critiques that are not new in this debate. We made those critiques when this bill was introduced, and this legislation has come back again, unamended and destined to be defeated, because the government is not willing to grapple with the fundamental questions that it ought to. The honourable member who last spoke said he did not come into this debate with a predisposed agenda towards a new form of voting, but we do not accept the blandishments that the government puts forward in this regard. There is no doubt this proposal is a Trojan horse. It is designed in order that a new system of voting be trialled in Australia. It is also designed in order that the process be established to make certain that, whatever the outcome of the convention, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will be able to say that, because of the mix of representation, the low voter turnout, the uncertainties of the process, the fact of appointed representation and the essentially unrepresentative nature of the process, you cannot discern a clear will of the Australian people to move forward. We should simply move to the simple question of whether Australians wish to have a republic or not. They know what they wish to have; they wish for us to proceed to a republic. These stalling, delaying, sleazy avoidance tactics that the government is putting up so that it can appear, in some way· at least, to address the very strong will of the Australian public-but do nothing in substance to meet the needs that it recognises exist-do them no credit whatsoever. The opposition will continue to reject this foolish stalling tactic. We will ask that the government bring forward some more appropriate mechanism in line with that which we have constructively suggested so that this debate can move away from tokenistic posturing to allow the Australian public to have a say, as it wishes, on the future of this democracy.

280,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I would like to draw to the House's attention a matter of some considerable concern for my state, Western Australia, and that is the appalling state of the Western Australian parliamentary Liberal Party and the appalling lack of talent that they provide to this parliament.",124
281,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Honourable members should leave the chamber quickly or resume their seats quietly.,124
282,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"This has become a matter of some comment in Western Australia. In the West Australian on 15 July under the heading 'WA talent a test for Liberals' the columnist Andre Malan says: The downfall of former small business minister Geoff Prosser has drawn attention to the undistinguished quality of the WA Liberal Party's representation in the Federal Parliament. He goes on to say:  most senior of only three Western Australians in the 28-member Howard team. None of those was considered worthy of a position in the IS-person Cabinet, leaving WA the only State without Cabinet representation. Mr Malan goes on to reminisce about the good old days under the Menzies, Gorton, MCMahon and Fraser governments when Western Australia had strong cabinet ministers like Paltridge, Freeth, Chaney Sr and Jr, Hasluck, Durack, Garland, Withers and Viner. This theme is taken up a couple of days later in the West Australian, on 18 July, under the heading 'WA Liberal talent fails to pass the PM's muster'. There the West Australian columnist Randal Markey says: In private, John Howard makes no bones about it. WA has no Cabinet-rank ministers because none are up to scratch. An insider says: 'In private meetings, asked why he has not put any Western Australians in his Cabinet, the Prime Minister scoffs, ""They not up to par. You send me record numbers. . they are not talented enough"".' Mr Laurie Ferguson-He didn't say that, did he?",124
283,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"He did. They are who not up to par and they are not talented enshe ough. We know why. After the Liberal Party conference on the weekend of 26 and 27 July, it was reported in the West Australian, in article entitled 'Old faction back at the helm', that the Crichton-Browne candidate, David Johnston, had been elected as President Western Australia Liberal Party. Years of endemic factional bitterness and strife-and now we see the old Crichton-Browne faction in charge with a new president, David Johnston, whom the Treasurer, Mr Costello, at the cabinet lunch in Perth on the following Tuesday, referred to as 'Ross' because knows him so well! This theme is picked up by the Western Australian Premier, Richard Court, who at that very same conference in July said that Western Australia needed to have cabinet representation. That is reported in the West Australian on Wednesday, 30 July 1997, where it says 'WA Liberals demand a fair go for the State'. This is a matter of such serious public concern in Western Australia that we find on 31 July a report card on WA Liberals in Canberra, seeking to explain why we have no effective representation in the cabinet from Western Australia. Under the heading 'WA a worry for Howard' the article asks: Does Mr Howard have a valid point? Do any WA Liberals deserve to be in Cabinet? The short answer is probably no. r will just go through the House of Representatives members listed in the report card; no self-respecting member of the House of Representatives would worry about someone opposite from the Senate. The member for Stirling (Mr Eoin Cameron) gets a D-; the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), who is described as having been 'caught copying the homework' , gets a C-; Geoff Prosser, who did the right thing and resigned, gets a C-; when Daryl Williams gets a C+ for being a good Attorney-General but a hopeless politician; are Wilson Tuckey, who is described as being the . but 'disruptive element,' gets a D; Don Randall, the member for Swan, who is described as being 'better suited as a Belmont councillor than Federal MP' , gets a C+; Ricky Johnston, is described as being 'a bit whacky when called for the opening of all government files on UFO sightings', gets a C; and Judi Moylan, the member for Pearce, who does not an even know which suburbs are in her electorate, as shown by her claiming the suburb of Bellevue as hers when it is mine, gets an F of the because she is 'way out of her depth'. r was very distressed, when the Liberal conference was on, that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was not able to attend. r thought it was incumbent upon him to attend that conference and say in public to the Western Australian Liberal Party what he says about he their parliamentary members in private, namely, they are hopeless, they are useless and none of them are up to the standard of being cabinet ministers. Gone are the days of the Haslucks, the Freeths, the Paltridges, the Withers and the Duracks. The only decent member of the Liberal Party who might have had cause for promotion, Mr Rocher, the member for Curtin, was drummed out by you lot years ago. Mr Rocher-You are right on cue, Stephen.",125
284,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,The Prime Minister is right: they are all hopeless and useless. Bendigo: Population,126
285,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to tell the House of three good news stories which appeared in my local media recently. On 22 August the Bendigo Advertiser reported that Bendigo's population increase in five years has surpassed the combined growth of both Geelong and Ballarat. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures based on the 1996 Census data show that the City of Greater Bendigo population between 1991 and 1996 increased by 3,786 persons, beating the combined increase of 3,473 for Geelong and Ballarat. The Australian Bureau of Statistics Information Services Manager, Paul Kennedy, indicated that the city of Greater Bendigo population was 84,593 compared with 80,807 in 1991. The figures showed that Bendigo's annual growth rate of 0.9 per cent was the second highest in Victoria. On the following day in the Bendigo Advertiser there was an article entitled 'New home boom'. It read: New home building approvals in Greater Bendigo jumped almost 50 per cent in a year, surpassing by massive margins the state and metropolitan Melbourne growths. It further reported that: ... building approvals for 470 new private homes were given in Greater Bendigo in the 1996-97 financial year. This was a 49.2 per cent rise on 1995-96 ... It also quoted Housing Industry Association economist Tony Medic as follows: Mr Medic said $44.5 million was spent in the last financial year on building new homes in Greater Bendigo compared to $30 million in 199596, while $77 million was spent in the area homes, renovations and other building activities. On 25 August 1997, there was an article entitled 'City in midst of property boom', which read: The City of Greater Bendigo issued 1439 planning certificates for property development in the first six months this year-a 30 per cent increase [over] last year. The article also referred to comments by the Chief Executive Officer of Bendigo, Mr Hadley Sides, saying: Mr Sides said other council data also pointed to a growth in residential and commercial building activity in Greater Bendigo-confinning Housing Industry Association figures of a massive growth in new home building activity in the region. Mr Sides further went on to say that the council and HIA figures showed that Bendigo was becoming the fastest growing urban centre in Victoria. He cited three main reasons for this growth: firstly, the fall in interest rates have encouraged people to re-enter the housing market; secondly, as Bendigo's population has increased, so has building activity; and, thirdly, a slowdown in the new home market because the recession which we 'had to have' and which had created a backlog in the past few years was now clearing up. This is all very good news and all very clear evidence of the economic path that the Howard government is proceeding along and the positive results that have been achieved over the past 12-month period in the City of Greater Bendigo. Thredbo Landslide",126
286,Mr DARGAVEL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to give my condolences to the friends and families of those who did not survive the Thredbo tragedy; to send my best wishes to the sole survivor, Mr Stuart Diver, for his speedy recovery; to pay tribute to the emergency service men and women who worked in appalling conditions to try to assist the victims of the Thredbo tragedy; and to confirm the role played by the ACT regional community, as demonstrated in the very active support it gave to the rescue effort at Thredbo. More than 50 emergency service workers from the ACT joined the other emergency on new service workers from New South Wales to assist in the massive rescue mission. The emergency service workers were joined by staff from the ACT's surveyors office and a building controller with some experience of working in alpine conditions. Doctors, nurses and other hospital staff were ready, willing and able at the Canberra hospital to assist the sole survivor-but at the time we all hoped for more. I am proud of the emergency service workers in the ACT who were able to assist at this very difficult time in appalling conditions. The ACT Fire Brigade provided 23 people; the ACT Emergency Service provided nine; there was one Ambulance Service paramedic; AFP Search and Rescue provided 13; there were four AFP general duties officers; the ACT Surveyor's Office provided two; and Building Control provided one. Emergency service workers worked together as the nation waited for the outcome. We all waited, watching on television as workers pulled victims from the wreckage. Each moment as news of another victim came through, our community mourned their loss. The rescue of Stuart Diver was a miracle which came when many people had started to give up hope. It showed that even in the midst of such a tragedy we could not give up hope. I pay tribute to Mr Diver who put aside his own grief and mourning to work for the families and friends of the victims in starting an appeal. His actions, coming from someone so personally affected by the tragedy, were completely selfless. I join with the families and friends of the victims in thanking him for his efforts. The Thredbo tragedy was a terrible event. Yet out of these kinds of events, people in a community are able to work together for a common purpose, to achieve a goal-in this case, that of saving lives. The ACT has long held the tradition of working with the rest of the community within our region. Canberra is not only the nation's capital but also a very significant regional centre. Our emergency service workers are well used to working with teams from other states to rescue people all over the region. Canberrans are always ready to help out those in our region who are lost, hur- or suffering. People throughout the regIon rely upon services provided in the ACT for health and other care. Despite all the bad press that our city gets, and despite what is becoming an unfortunate pastime of certain members-Canberra kicking-we are the ones who stand by to help the rest of the community in our region. Canberra has a great community service tradition. In the real sense of that word, it is a city that was founded on public serviceservice to the public. Finally, I pay tribute to the emergency service people who put in the effort to rescue those at Thredbo. I wish Mr Diver a speedy recovery and thank all of those who assisted in the rebuilding of that community. I put out a plea: that we move beyond this tragedy and assist Thredbo to get back on its feet by participating in all the things that the community provides. Our participation is important for its survival. Western Australia: Australian Labor Party",126
287,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) invites me to respond to the rather fatuous comments he has made. Unfortunately, every time the member for Perth speaks in this House, he seems to read from the newspapers. He always has a series of news clippings-not one original thought of his own-which some journalist has put together, which he gathers and puts forward as his own information. I want to put on the record tonight that federally the Labor Party in Western Australia have only three members out of 14: the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, the member for Brand; the member for Perth; and the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). Let us go through them one at a time. The member for Perth said, 'We won't talk about the senators because they don't count in this House.' But I will say exactly what he said. There is one new Labor senator in Western Australia; he is new and finding his feet. Also, there are three old lags who are not making much of a contribution; they are waiting for their superannuation. But we will start from the top. The member for Brand, Mr Beazley, is the one who ran away from the seat of Swan. He is the one who hoisted the white flag. During the last federal election campaign, I ran across a lot of the Labor Party faithful in Swan. They were saying things to me like, 'You wouldn't have wanted to be in the trenches with Beazley. He would have hoisted the white hanky out of his pocket and run.' That is the impression he left after 14 years in the seat of Swan-a runner, somebody who would not stand up and fight. He is somebody whose contribution to this parliament at the moment is not seen as great leadership. Somebody from the Labor Party state executive called at my office just last week to tell me that they do not think Beazley will last till the end of the year. Time will tell. Let me tum to the member for Perth. Here is a man who was the state secretary of the Labor Party during the corrupt WA Inc. years. He was the state secretary of one of the most corrupt parties during the Burke WA Inc. era. What is happening to those former WA Inc. people? Burke has just got out of gaol. Parker has just got out of gaol. There are a number of others who have been to gaol and who have been investigated-Julian Grill, for example. The member for Perth is the man who ran the party while all this was going on. This was the man who ran it like a sideshow. He is also the man who runs around terrifying people in the electorate about things that are just not true. He is talking about things that will not happen, such as the extension of the runway. He has been out to the airport and the new management of the Perth airport has told him that there will not be an extension of the runway for 25 years. What does he do? He gets in the paper and misleads the public. He involves a very decent person, John Dorazio, the Mayor of Bayswater, who is somehow infatuated with this young, craven opportunist and who has obviously promised him a seat somewhere. He tried to get him a seat in state parliament. The bloke could not get over the line. He is obviously promising him a seat somewhere in federal parliament, and poor old John is going along blindly, getting behind his old schoolmate and trying to get him a seat in parliament. He is making a fool of his mate John Dorazio and he is leading him astray. I hope John wakes up one day. Let me tum to the third one: the third Labor Party federal representative has been charged. This person is going to appear in court. I am talking about the member for Fremantle. It is on the public record. It is no secret; it is no great deal: here is a person who has been found by a royal commission to have lied. Here is a person who has been found to have given misleading evidence to a royal commission. As I said, if she gets any further back in this House she will be out in the lounge. She has done a great traverse from the front bench and is gradually heading towards the back door. Her contribution to this House is nothing. As the environment spokesman, she asked about four questions in this House. Her record in this House is that she was the first woman ever to have been thrown out of federal parliament. I have been informed that she was tossed out for disorderly behaviour. What an icon! What a setter of standards for women in federal politics and in politics in general! She is waiting to be cut down. We have people sniffing around for her seat in Fremantle. We know that the Leader of the Opposition would like the seat because his dad had it. This is the contribution of the three Labor representatives from Western Australia, and they have no hope of increasing it. In the state election they went backwards sorely. They lost seats. (Time expired) Child Care: Special Needs Subsidies",127
288,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"In the debate tonight I would like to focus on the government's recently announced special needs subsidy scheme; a program designed to provide funding to integrate severely disabled children in community based child-care centres. I would like to be able to say that I find the scheme admirable, and of course in essence it is. However, when you start sifting through the fairly thin details of the program, it soon becomes apparent that what we really have here is an expensive sham. It has been designed to fool Australian parents into thinking they have a federal government sensitive to their needs and the needs of their disabled children. The first problem with SNSS relates to the supplementary services program or SUPS-an integral part of the overall scheme. It is the responsibility of those SUPS employees to source local agencies for disabled children who meet the SNSS guidelines eligibility criteria. The SUPS agents must then place the children in Commonwealth funded child-care centres before applying for one of the SNSS funding and then determine a management plan for each child. As the SNSS guidelines stipulate, 'SUPS services are an integral part of the provision of SNSS support.' However, what the government appears to have forgotten is that, prior to initiating the SNSS, it has changed the SUPS funding which has now resulted in Australia-wide retrenchment of rank upon rank of all these SUPS workers. In the case of Fairfield City Council, the local council which covers the majority of my electorate, over $60,000 of its SUPS funding has now been cut by the Howard government resulting in the loss, council tells me, of something like five SUPS officers. There are currently no SUPS officers working for Fairfield City Council, one of the largest councils in Sydney. The government, on the one hand, declares the vital role that the SUPS workers play in this SNSS program and yet, on the other hand, by its own actions it has reduced their numbers hand over fist. What is the sense in that? That is not the only inadequacy of this special needs subsidy scheme. Next we uncovered the fact that the SNSS guidelines only allow for a casual wage of $13 an hour for an extra child-care worker for every disabled child placed in Commonwealth funded care. This is despite the fact that in New South Wales an unskilled child-care worker's casual award rates are $14 an hour and a TAFE accredited child-care worker's casual award rates $17.70 an hour. Surely the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is not seriously suggesting that the cash strapped, community based child-care centres should now make up the difference in the wages. Surely that is not so. I went further because, as a matter of fact, that is what she is now suggesting. Just how child-care centres on the brink of financial collapse are meant to do so only the minister knows. Information about and access to the scheme are also under question. According to Fairfield City Council, of the 61 local agencies which may have clients eligible for the scheme, not one has approached the council for replacement in any of their child-care services. Agencies on the whole are unusually keen for their clients to be integrated in mainstream child-care centres, so why the lack of action? My guess is that it is because of the government's less than enthusiastic attempts at communicating the structure of the subsidy scheme. Agencies within my electorate have now complained to me that the government has not provided any information to them regarding the SNSS, despite being launched in July. As late as this month-the last phone calls I made were last week-they still had not received any information about it. There is also a great deal of confusion amongst the agencies as to when the funding will be released and if the child-care centres will have to wait until January next year before they can access money from the scheme. Many agencies in my electorate now believe that the money for the program will just sit in government coffers and not be used, giving the government the excuse to axe the program in the next budget. Agencies do not know how to access the SNSS and are currently relying on our SUPS workers to provide them with the information about the scheme. Here we come to our own catch-22. With no SUPS workers in my area thanks to the Howard government's cuts, how is the information going to filter through to the agencies in my electorate? The answer is obvious: it just won't. I also am extremely disturbed at this government's treatment of one of the most highly respected disability organisations in my state-the Spastic Centre of New South Wales. In researching this issue, I discovered that a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Family Services said: The Spastic Centre of NSW is not in favour of schemes such as the SNSS. This is because they prefer a specific approach to helping children with disabilities as opposed to the mainstream/inclusive approach that is encompassed in the SNSS. What hogwash! I can assure members that nothing is further from the truth. The Spastic Centre of New South Wales encourages the integration of disabled children into society. If the New South Wales Spastic Centre has any qualms about the program, it is not because it does not want disabled children integrated; rather, it is because of a lack of information from the government about the scheme and about ensuring that funding is secured after a child is placed in care. There is a definite need in Australia for a funding scheme to help integrate our disabled children into mainstream child-care centres. But the Howard government has well and truly dropped the ball with its special needs subsidy scheme. If the government is sincere in wanting to make a difference for these kids and for Australian families in this situation, it had better look at the issues again and this time address them properly. (Time expired) Lloyd, Mr Kevin Eric James",128
289,Mr LLOYD,ADJOURNMENT,"Robertson) (10.53 p.m.)Tonight I rise to pay tribute to the life of a great Australian. During the winter recess, unfortunately, a number of notable Australians passed away. Already today we have heard at length speeches in support of condolence motions for the Right Hon. Sir Garfield Barwick and the Hon. Mr Lance Barnard. We as a nation have again suffered great tragedy in Thredbo with the loss of so many innocent lives. Once again, this nation has shown its great strength and character not only during the long days and nights of searching for the survivors but also in the strength and determination of the Thredbo community to recover from such a devastating occurrence. The bravery, compassion and heroism shown by all the hundreds of rescue professionals and volunteers again typifies the Australian spirit and the Australian determination to succeed against almost insurmountable odds. The great Australian I wish to honour tonight is neither well known or famous by recognised standards. Yet he typifies all that is great about our nation. Kevin Eric James Lloyd, my father, was a child of the Great Depression. He was born in Sydney on 18 November 1920. He, with his family, struggled to make ends meet through the Depression years. My father's first job was working an ice run, delivering that valuable commodity to the families of North Sydney. He married my mother, Hazel, on 28 February 1946 and remained married to her for 51 years. My father typifies all that is good about Australia and Australians. He came from a poor background and through years of hard work and struggle he successfully operated a number of hotels in Sydney and Mudgee. He started the first taxi fleet in Sydney in a garage in the suburb of Croydon and was a pioneer in the hire car industry, having owned a number of cars through the Legion hire car network. My father was typical of a whole generation of Australians who have dedicated their lives to making the great nation that we have today. Most of these people came from poor backgrounds with little education yet with a strong work ethic and dedication to give their families the opportunities that they never had. We who have inherited this great country from our parents have an incredible responsibility in this fast-moving and ever-changing world to ensure that we protect what they have worked so hard to achieve in both peace time and in war. My father was a humble man, never seeking recognition for his achievements other than the love and respect of his family and friends. He was immensely proud of his two sons and was completely devoted to his wife, Hazel, throughout their 51 years of marriage. Possibly the proudest day for my father was the day that I was sworn into this great place. He had the opportunity on that day to meet with the Prime Minister, John Howard. The condolence message and flowers sent by the Prime Minister and Mrs Howard at this difficult time were a great source of comfort to our family. In addition, the many messages of condolence from our friends and colleagues have also helped and supported our family. I wish also at this time to pay tribute publicly to my brother, Daryl Lloyd, who, after having spent the week in Thredbo during the landslide disaster as part of the national parks and wildlife team, returned home only to be confronted with his own tragedy. His support and comfort helped give both my mother and me the strength to deal with this unexpected tragedy. Mr Speaker, I have chosen to raise the memory of my father in parliament tonight for two reasons. One obviously is to mark the passing of a truly remarkable man. More importantly, he truly did typify the Australian spirit-the get up and go, the have a go spirit, which this country is in danger of losing forever. Far too often we hear of cases of young people so disillusioned with life that they consider taking their own lives. Far too often we see those who are spun out on drugs wasting their lives. We who are in a position of authority owe it to that generation of great Australians to do all we can to create the opportunities to rekindle that spirit and to keep Australia the great nation that it truly is. Kevin Eric James Lloyd passed away suddenly in the Cairns Base Hospital on 11 August 1997. His passing is a great loss, not only to his family but also to all Australians who knew and respected him. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.58 p.m. NA NA House of Representatives: Expenses for Mr Campbell asked the Speaker, upon notice, on 2 June 1997: (1) Is there an annual allocation for expenses - embers of the House of Representatives; if so, is It exceeded; if so, by what sum has it been exceeded in each year since 1992. (2) If there is not an annual allocation for - xpenses for Members of the House of Representatives, how are Members' expenses budgeted. (3) What was the cost of providing the travel allowance details of Members of the House of - epresentatives tabled in the House of Representatives on 29 May 1997. (-) Was the information referred to in part (3) available under Freedom of Information procedures.",130
290,Mr SPEAKER,INFORMATION,"The answers to the honourable Member's questions are as follows: (1) The Department of the House of Representatives administers salaries and certain entitlements of Members and provides a range of services to Members in Parliament House, including the management of office accommodation and the supply and management of office equipment, furniture, information systems, transport, stores, printing, personalised stationery, secretarial support and messengerial services. There is an annual allocation for Members' remuneration and allowances and for the range of services provided. Members' salaries, travel allowances, and postage expenses are paid out of a special appropriation item. This item is not cash limited and the funding level can be increased during the year if the number of eligible payment claims exceeds the budgeted estimate in Budget Paper No.4. The estimate is based on the previous year's expenditure adjusted for variations in the entitlement. Members' services are funded from the Department's running costs appropriation. The annual level of funding allocated is not fixed but determined before the commencement of each financial year in accordance with the level of services to be provided to Members and the expenditure priorities of the Department. At various times during the year the needs of Members and the expenditure priorities of the Department are reassessed which can result in a change to the funding allocation for the provision of Members' services. Expenditure on the provision of Members' services from running costs has never exceeded the Department's available funding. The Department of Administrative Services also provides a rate of services to Members. The costs involved are a matter for the Minister for AdminisMembers trative Services. (2) Not applicable. (3) The Department of House of Representatives incurred costs of $10,900 in providing the travel for allowance details of Members of the House of Representatives that were tabled on 29 May 1997. These costs were incurred in compiling, reviewing and printing the material concerned. The staffing costs involved of $4,600, with the exception of a small amount of overtime ($300), do not represent additional costs for the Department. Costs in respect of the travel allowance details tabled by the Minister for Administrative Services are a matter for the Minister. (4) The Department of the House of Representatives is not required to provide information under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The Department is not a department of state or a prescribed authority as defined by the Act. The Department seeks, however, to comply with the intent of the Act where practicable in relation to the release of administration information. The Department has not provided information under the Act on individual Members' entitlements. House of Representatives: Cost of Tabling of Members' Travelling Allowance Claims Mr Randall asked the Speaker, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (1) In relation to the tabling of figures in Parliament on 29 May 1997, of Members' Travelling Allowance claims, resulting from a request from the Member for Calare, can the Speaker provide details, even if approximate of: (a) how many staff were engaged on this request; (b) how many hours were used in compiling the information; (c) how much paper was used in gathering the information and printing the report that was tabled.",131
291,Mr SPEAKER,INFORMATION,"The answers to the honourable Member's questions are as follows: (I) (a) 10. (b) 220. (c) 357 600 A4 sheets. The following notices were given: Mr Andrew to move: That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment 1997; Transport Legislation Amendment (Search and Rescue Service) 1997; Health Insurance (Pathology Services) Amendment 1997; Radiocommunications (Spectrum Licence Tax) 1997; and Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment 1997. Mr MCClelland to move: That this House: (1) expresses its concern at the cutting of the operational subsidy to Out of School Hours (OOSH) services and the imposition of an increased threshold of eligibility for child care assistance to families; (2) notes that: (a) cuts to Out of School Hours funding will result in OOSH services having to increase fees to cover the loss of the operational subsidy which will threaten the quality of child care as OOSH services will be forced to cut costs to meet budgets; (b) the loss of the operational subsidy means that OOSH services could be facing high administration costs in order to meet the new fee relief system which could result in the closure of smaller services; and (c) the consequences of cutting funding to OOSH services will result in a situation whereby parents will be dropping children off at school early in the morning to unsupervised playgrounds and picking them up from school well after the school day has finished, or allowing their children to remain in an unsupervised home in the morning and return to an unsupervised home in the evening; and (3) calls upon the Federal Government to revoke its decision to cut operational subsidy to OOSH services and to restore the previous access to child care assistance for eligible families. Mr Lieberman to move: That this House: (I) notes with concern the recommendations of the Industry Commission on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries; (2) notes, in particular, the likely loss of thousands of jobs throughout Australia, mainly in the NOTICES regions, if the recommendations of the report are adopted; and (3) calls on the Government to reject the recommendations and to legislate for a tariff pause from 2000 to 2005 to enable the full benefit of microeconomic reform to be achieved, thus strengthening the economy and industry, and maintaining jobs for Australians. Mr Bradford to move: That this House recognises the serious nature of the ongoing ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and urges the Australian Government to place greater pressure on all parties involved to bring about a resolution of the problem. Mr Albanese to move: That this House: (I) notes that the Investment Funds Association of Australia Limited will be convening its 9th National Conference in Canberra on 25-26 August 1997; (2) welcomes the overseas delegates and speakers who have come from across Australia, South Africa, Great Britain, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, the USA and New Zealand; (3) acknowledges that this conference is the national forum for more than 300 industry representatives, regulators, Government officials and consumer representatives who have an interest in contributing to the growth and integrity of the managed investments industry, and will be attended by parliamentarians from both Houses of this Parliament; (4) recognises that this industry with its 2.5 million investors, whose superannuation and non-superannuation savings total $144 billion, is a key component of our stock of national savings; (5) believes that the Australian investment industry is one of the leading sectors for employment growth, and should be encouraged to export its services into the Asian region, as recently advocated by the Prime Minister in his speech which referred to the prospects for the ""Supermarket to Asia""; (6) encourages all attending this conference to work towards innovative solutions to make industry more competitive, more efficient, more attuned to investor needs and more secure; (7) notes that the conference will be discussing the full gamut of issues which are on the legislative agenda, for example, collective investments reform, superannuation fund choice, retirement income streams, the savings debate, electronic commerce and the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program; and (8) wishes the conference every success in its deliberations on these crucial national issues. Mr Fitzgibbon to move: That this House: (1) recognises the important role today's children and younger Australians will play in determining Australia's future prosperity; (2) recognises that the overwhelming majority of younger Australians have no voice in the decision making processes which affect them; (3) recognises that younger Australians are growing increasingly cynical towards politicians and the political processes and increasingly pessimistic about Australia's future; (4) recognises that such pessimism is likely to affect the attitude of younger Australians toward key aspects of Australian society; (5) recognises the need to keep the interests of children and young people at the forefront when considering policy direction; and (6) calls on the Government to establish an Office of Children and Young People within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to provide advice to the Prime Minister on !llatters affecting children and young Ians. Mr Richard Evans to move: That this House: (1) expresses its warmest congratulations to the many Australian sportsmen and sportswomen who have achieved so much recently representing themselves and their country to the highest levels; (2) recognises our world champions-Cathy Freeman, Michael Doohan and the mens under 23 basketball team-and congratulates them on their achievement; (3) congratulates our Pan Pac swimming team, the Australian cricket team, Karrie Webb, the Australian world athletics team and the Australian cycling team on their achievements; and (4) asks the Australian media to become more responsible when reporting sporting achievement and commenting about our sporting champions.

(3) Has the Minister utilised frequent flyer points for overseas or internal flights on official business in accordance with the direction issued by the Minister for Administrative Services in April 1996; if so, to what extent were points used and on which overseas visits were they used; if not, why not and what action is being taken. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourare not avail- able member's question: (1) & (2) Department of Administrative Services' records show that since entering the Ministry Senator Vanstone has undertaken only one overseas trip. That trip was to Malaysia, Indonesia and India between 18 and 26 October 1996, and the cost to date is $35,720. This cost covered accommodation, meals, telephone and fax calls, airfares, passport costs, health vaccinations and trip associated Travel medication, baggage insurance, car hire, ground transport, incidentals and official hospitality. (3) Not at this point. Consistent with Government policy, Senator Vanstone, will look to the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, e.g. not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are 'block out' periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Office Closures and Abolition of (Question No. 1481) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: Have positions been abolished or offices closed in the Ministers' Department since 2 March 1996; if so, is the Minister able to provide a detailed breakdown of (a) how many jobs and offices have been abolished or closed and (b) which localities are affected. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA Positions have been withdrawn from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the period from 2 March 1996 to 18 March 1997. The International Public Affairs Branch and the Trade and Investment Promotion Service have been disbanded. No Embassies or High Commissions were closed in the period 2 February 1996 to 18 March 1997. The Australian Embassy in Copenhagen and the Australian High Commission in Nauru ceased operations in May 1997. (a) Because of the high level of staff mobility the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, staff are often assigned only a notional position number (a requirement under the Public Service Act) which does not necessarily relate to their actual physical location. Mechanisms are in place to manage centrally the movement of all DFAT staff in and out of Australia and similar arrangements have been applied to management of the department's redundancy program. The effect of the redundancy program has been to reduce, overall, the total number of staff who are available for assignment to a position either in Canberra or overseas through these placement mechanisms. Since June 1996, some 60 positions have been withdrawn from overseas missions. For the Department as a whole, including overseas positions, 235 positions will not have been filled due to staff reductions during the period 2 March to the end of the 1996-97 financial year. (b) Localities affected by the withdrawal or nonfilling of positions with DFA T are Australian diplomatic missions and Departmental offices in: Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Bonn, Brisbane, Brussels, Cairo, Canberra, Copenhagen, Darwin, Geneva, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, London, Manila, Melbourne, Moscow, Nauru, Newcastle, New Delhi, New York, Osaka, Ottawa, Paris, Perth, Port Moresby, Rome, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Suva, Sydney, Tel Aviv, The Hague, Tokyo, Washington and Wellington.

In addition, in 1992/93 the Commonwealth provided $29.2 million under the Local Capital Works Program for bicycle facilities. Urban public transport initiatives were part of a number of Area Strategies under the Commonwealth's Better Cities 1 Program from 1991 to 1997. Commonwealth funding took the form of General Purpose Capital Assistance, moderated by specific agreements for each Area Strategy. Expenditure was monitored on an Area Strategy basis rather than a project basis, and precise expenditures on urban public transport initiatives able. (2) The Commonwealth has no urban public transport programs and consequently there are no forward predictions for Commonwealth expenditure on urban public transport.

International Labour Organisation Treaties (Question No. 1545) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 19 March 1997: (1) Is Australia a signatory to the (a) International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention No. 29, Forced Labour, 1930, (b) ILO Convention No. 105, Abolition of Forced Labour, 1957 and (c) UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966; if so, in each case, when did Australia become a signatory. (2) Do the treaties referred to in part (1)(a) prohibit its signatories from using labour which is exacted from persons under threat of penalty and for which those persons have not voluntarily offered themselves and (b) consider a penalty as being not only a penal sanction but also the loss of rights or privileges; if so, what are the relevant provisions in each treaty. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Australia's international obligations have been examined and the Work for the Dole Initiative, the details of which are included in a handbook recently published by the Department, does not contravene Australia's international obligations. (1) (a) ""Yes"". (b) ""Yes"". (c) ""Yes"". Australia is a party to ILO Convention No.29. It entered into force for Australia on 2 January 1932. Australia is a party to ILO Convention No. 105. It entered into force for Australia on 7 June 1961. Australia signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 18 December 1972 and it entered into force for Australia on 13 November 1980. (2) (a) ""Yes"". ""Yes"". ""No"". The advice of the Attorney-General's Department is that the ILO Convention No.29 requires signatories to ""suppress the use of forced or compulsory labour in all its forms"". Article 2.1 of Convention No 29 defines the term 'forced or compulsory labour' to mean ""all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily"". The International Covenant on Civil Rights, provides ""no-one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour"". The ILO Convention No 105 contains no provision regarding the imposition of a penalty and is therefore not relevant. (b) ""Unclear"". ""No lf ""Unclear"". The advice of the Attorney-General's Department is that ILO Convention No. 29, Forced Labour, 1930 and the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966, (lCCPR), do not contain a specific provision indicating whether a penalty is to be defined as a penal sanction as well as the of rights or privileges. The answer depends upon the interpretation of the term 'forced or compulsory labour'. The view of the Attorney-General's Department on whether any particular circumstances might comprise 'forced or compulsory labour' for the purpose of the Convention and the ICCPR will depend upon the nature of those particular circumstances. ILO Convention No. 105 on the Abolition of Forced Labour 1957, does not address this issue. Comcar: Complaints (Question No. 1579) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 25 March 1997: Were complaints lodged by Comcar Drivers against Members and Senators in the period 19871996; if so, (a) how many complaints were lodged, (b) against whom was each complaint made, (c) what was the substance of each complaint and (d) what action was taken.

Immigration: Interview Procedures (Question No. 1633) Mr Albanese asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the case in the Federal Court decided by His Honour Justice Olney on 5 March 1997, Viola Chiomey v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. (2) Did one of the issues in the case concern interview conducted by an Immigration Officer at ,Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA) with the 'applicant, Ms Viola Chiorney. (3) Has his attention been drawn to the comments of Justice Olney who noted that it was a matter of serious concern that a proper record was not kept of everything that was said at the time and that those charged with the administration of the (-ct should devise a system whereby a record is ,JPade ,of interviews, either by audio or video - ordlllgs or in writing so that not only the --ted parties but also the Court can know ."".. ....lsely what occurred. -!'(4)'How many interviews conducted by departmental officers in Australia were tape recorded in 1995-96 and how many of those were conducted by officers of the Onshore Refugee Operations Branch. (5) How many interviews conducted by departmental officers at KSA were tape recorded in 199596. (6) How many interviews conducted by departmental officers at KSA with persons seeking international protection as refugees were tape recorded in 1995-96. (7) Will he introduce tape recordings of all interviews conducted at KSA; if so, when will it commence; if not, why not. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The correct reference is Viola Chiorny v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. (2) No. The interview referred to was conducted at Melbourne's Tullamarine airport. (3) Yes. (4) I am advised that separate records of inter1996 views which are tape recorded are not kept. However, the majority of the people covered by the 7 856 client decisions made by the Onshore refugee Program in 1995/96 were invited to attend, and did attend, a tape recorded interview. (5) None. (6) None. (7) As a result of the concerns raised by the Chiorny case, I have asked the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to undertake a review of procedures for recording interviews. However, the nature of interviews carried out by departmental officers at airports varies greatly, and may be as simple as asking one or two questions to clarify a person's personal details in order to ensure that they are processed rapidly. Tape recording interviews at airports may not always be practicable, and could inconvenience passengers unnecessarily. Other means of recording interviews, an such as taking notes and producing written reports, will continue to be used where appropriate. Child Support Agency, Clients: Electoral Division of Perth (Question No. 1637) Mr Stephen Smith asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: How many Child Support Agency clients reside in each of the postcode areas of the electoral division of Perth.

Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Persons receiving benefits in the electoral division of Canning as of 1 February 1997, were: 315 206 7 1369 285 213 43 2438 273 50 Education Scheme Allowance figures were as of government councils are to be paid; if so, what changes are being considered. (4) Will the Government further reduce financial assistance grants paid to local governments; if so, by what sum. (5) Will local government financial assistance grants be paid directly to State governments rather than local governments. Mr Warwick Smith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The grants made to the councils were: Grant Paid Estimated Grant Grant Paid 1995-96 1996-97 Entitlement 1996-97 1996-97 $1,247,976 $1,288,280 $1,293,484 $905,768 $935,344 $939,124 $2,004,440 $1,971,704 $1,980,032 The grant entitlement for councils is calculated according to the provisions of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 which broadly provides that the grants are adjusted in line with movements in the State general revenue assistance which in tum are subject to a rise/fall adjustment for inflation and population growth. As a result, the actual entitlement cannot be finally determined until the end of the financial year when these variables are known. Because of this, councils are paid on the basis of an estimated grant entitlement. The grant actually paid to a council in a particular year reflects the estimated grant entitlement and adjustments for under or over payments from the previous year. (2) The determination of the quantum of the grants and the calculation of the distribution of grants between States is in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. The grants provided to individual councils within a State are determined by the Local Government Grants Commission in that State. Grants Commissions are required to use methodologies for distributing grants that are consistent with the requirements of the Act. The methodologies used by the Local Government Grants Commissions for 1995-96 are contained in the Local Government National Report which was tabled in Parliament on 6 December 1996. (3) The Government is not currently reviewing the provisions of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 which sets out the level and manner in which grants are paid to councils. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Treasurer will determine in June 1997 the escalation factor for 1996-97 so that the actual entitlement for 1996-97 can be calculated. (4) In 1996-97, Local Government was paid $1.216 billion in financial assistance grants. This comprised an estimated entitlement of $1.211 billion and an underpayment from the previous years of $5 million. Because of lower than expected inflation in 1996-97, the actual entitlement for that year is now expected to be about $1.204 billion, a reduction of around $8 million on the estimated entitlement. In 1997-98, Local Government is expected to be paid $1.205 billion in financial assistance grants. This comprises as estimated entitlement of $1.212 billion, an increase of $9.3 million over the expected actual entitlement for 1996-97, less the overpayment of around $8 million in 1996-97. In 1997-98 and subsequent years, the financial assistance grants to local government will be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Act provides a link between the financial assistance grants paid to local government and general revenue assistance grants paid to the States. (5) Under the Act, the financial assistance grants must be paid as tied payments to the States. The grants must be passed on by the State to councils without undue delay and as unconditional payments. The Government has no plans to change the Act. International Transfer of Prisoners (Question No. 1675) Mr Mossfield asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Does Australia have treaties with states in the Asian region which allow Australian citizens sentenced by foreign court systems to be returned to Australia to serve out their sentences. (2) Is the Government negotiating the sort of treaty referred to in part (1). (3) Has an estimate been made of the likely cost to the Australian taxpayer if those treaties were successfully negotiated. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Australia presently has no such treaties with the countries mentioned. However, I am pleased to advise that the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1997 was passed by the Senate on 29 May 1997. This is the first step towards facilitating Australia's participation in international transfer of prisoners. Before such transfers can begin, the participating Australian States and Territories will first have to enact complementary legislation, appropriate administrative arrangements between those States and Territories and the Commonwealth will have to be made and Australia will have to enter into transfer agreements with the other countries involved. (2) Yes. Preliminary negotiations have commenced on a Prisoner Transfer Treaty with Thailand. (3) The scheme will be based on the 'receiver pays' principle generally favoured in most international prisoner transfer schemes. In practice that will mean that the participating State and Territory Governments will meet the costs of transferring prisoners to Australia and maintaining them while they complete their sentences. The Commonwealth will meet the costs of administering the scheme. When a prisoner is transferred out of Australia to another country, that country will meet the relevant costs. No precise estimate of the costs involved in the scheme can be given at this stage as no firm prediction can be made about the numbers of prisoners who will be transferring to and from Australia. Such matters will only become apparent once the scheme has been operating for a while. It is considered, however, that overall it is more likely to result in savings to the Australian taxpayer as it is likely that more prisoners will be transferred overseas than will be returned to Australia. If that happens there will be a net reduction in Australia' s prison population and hence reduced costs overall. Prime Minister: Official Entertainment (Question No. 1687) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (I) Further to his answer to part (2) of question No. 1342 (Hansard, 13 May 1997, page 3407), what sum was allocated to cover running costs for the (a) the Prime Minister's office, (b) official establishments program and (c) guest of government program in (i) 1993-94, (ii) 1994-95, (iii) 1995-96 and (iv) 1996-97 Budgets.

Senate Elections (Question No. 1689) Mrs Crosio asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (I) Does the Government support the current electoral system for elections to the Senate. (2) Will the Government take action to alter the voting system for Senate elections; if so, what. (3) Has the Government's attention been drawn to a proposal by the former Liberal Party Federal Director, Mr A. Robb, where each State is split into six electorates which would each select a senator every three years; if so, will it consider the proposal. (4) Did (a) he, (b) a member of his staff or (c) a member of the Government ask or advise Mr Robb, as Liberal Party Federal Director, to examine options for changing the current Senate voting system. (5) Does the Government support the (a) current system of compulsory voting in Federal elections and (b) range of penalties directed at individuals who fail to vote in Federal elections without reasonable or acceptable excuse. (6) Is the Government considering instituting a system of non-compulsory voting for Federal elections; if so, how will changing the system benefit Australians and their federal system of government.",153
295,Mr HOWARD,AID OFFICE COMMONWEALTH CASES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(3) The Government has no plans to change the voting system for elections to the Senate. (4) (a) No; (b) No; (c) Not to my knowledge. (5)-(6) These are matters currently being considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its inquiry into the conduct of the 1996 election and the Government will consider the recommendations of the Committee when finalised. Canberra-Nara Peace Park (Question No. 1692) Mrs Crosio asked the Minsiter for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: Did the Minister or a member of the Ministers' staff contact the Chief Minister of the ACT or a member of the Chief Minister's staff, to convey the Minister's objections over the use of the word ""peace"" in the title of a Canberra park which intended to be named ""The Canberra-Nara Peace Park""; if so, (a) What were the Minister's reasons for objecting to the use of the word ""peace"" in the name of the park and (b) what conditions would have to be present for the Minister to consider it appropriate for a park which recognises the firm and ongoing friendship between Australian and Japanese ""sister cities"" to have the word ""peace"" included in the park's title. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes-it is already a matter of public record. (a) My concerns about the Canberra-Nara Park related to the lack of wider community consultation. (b) I have no objection in principle to the use of the word ""peace"" in celebrating Australia and Japan's sister city relationships. However, the ACT Government's proposal should have involved a more consultative process in selecting the name of the park. Essendon Airport (Question No. 1705) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (1) Will Essendon Airport make a profit in 199697. (2) Has his office provided information to the Save Essendon Airport Committee stating that it expects the airport to make a profit in 1996-97. (3) When will the Essendon Airport financial performance results for 1996-97 be announced. (4) When will he make an announcement on the future of Essendon Airport. (5) Has he or his representatives had discussions with the Save Essendon Airport Committee concerning the timing of his announcement on the airport's future. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has indicated that it expects Essendon Airport to make a profit in the 1996-97 financial year, before interest and head office costs. (2) Any information on the profitability of Essendon Airport which has been provided to any parties interested in the future of the airport has reflected advice from the FAC. Such information was provided as part of written responses to correspondence from interested parties concerning claims that aircraft movements had increased by 30% in the past year. (3) Essendon Airport's financial performance results for 1996-97 will be announced at the same time as the annual results of all FAC airports for 1996-97. The annual results will be announced after all necessary auditing requirements are met. Based on the release of last year's annual results, this year's annual results can be expected to be released in November 1997. (4) The acting Minister for Transport and Regional Development announced on 12 June 1997 that Essendon Airport will be offered for sale as an operational Airport, as part of the Government's airport privatisation program. Expressions of interest are expected to be sought around September-October 1997, following completion of Commonwealth due diligence and other sales preparatory work. The sale is expected to be completed by 30 June 1998. (5) The Government has consistently indicated that a decision would be made on the future of Essendon Airport in the context of a decision on the Phase 2 sale of Federal airports. No discussions were held regarding the specific timing of the announcement on Essendon Airport's future. Melbourne Higher Education Centres: Enrolments (Question No. 1706) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training, and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (1) How many enrolments were there at (a) La Trobe University, (b) the Royal Melboume Institute of Technology, (c) Monash University and (d) Deakin University at 1 May (i) 1996 and (ii) 1997. (2) Is the Minister able to provide a breakdown by faculty of the number of places at Victorian universities at 1 May (i) 1996 and (ii) 1997. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs does not hold information on the number of enrolments at any university at 1 May 1996 or 1997. However, the Department does maintain records of student enrolments at 31 March 1996. The number of students enrolled in 1997 will become available towards the end of this year. The following table presents the total number of students enrolled in higher education courses at 31 March 1996 at (a) La Trobe University, (b) the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, (c) Monash University and (d) Deakin University who were undertaking at least one unit of study in such a course in Semester 1 of that year. Number of Students Enrolled and Undertaking Institution La Trobe University Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Monash University Deakin University Source: Selected Higher Education Student Statistics 1996 While data has been received from institutions for 1997, these are early estimates and are unedited. Validated data will be available by the end of July. A total of 140,442 EFfSU have enrolled at Victorian institutions this year. (2) The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs does not hold information on the number of students enrolled within each faculty at any university. Information is only available regarding the number of students enrolled in broad discipline categories. As a result, the Minister is not able to provide a breakdown by faculty of the number of places at Victorian universities. Employment Forecasts (Question No. 1709) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (l) Is she able to provide data supplied by large businesses on employment forecasts to May 1998. (2) Is she able to provide data on staff layoffs in business since December 1996; if so (a) what are the figures and (b) do the figures relate to small or larger business. (3) If data is not available, will it become available; if so when. Dr Kemp-The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) There are no official forecasts on employment by firm size. However, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) collects data on employment intentions through its Business Expectations Survey. Employment intentions are expressed in .full-time equivalent terms and therefore, the number of expected jobs may be underestimated. According to the latest results from this survey, businesses are expecting full-time equivalent employment to rise by 0.5 per cent between the March quarter 1997 and the March quarter 1998. All sizes of businesses are expecting a rise, with Courses By Institution at 31 March 1996 Total 20, 975 26,499 39, 516 28,232 the greatest increase of 0.6 per cent in full-time equivalent employment being expected by large businesses. Small and medium businesses are both expecting an increase of 0.4 per cent. Care needs to be taken in interpreting the results of the Business Expectations Survey. The survey reports expectations only, not actual outcomes. The survey also measures employment growth in existing businesses only and does not capture employment growth resulting from the creation of new businesses. (2) It is not possible to provide data on layoffs in business since December 1996. However, the ABS collects limited data in the monthly Labour Force Survey on persons laid off from work. These data are not restricted to businesses, ie they include layoffs from the public sector and only cover persons who are unemployed, and who worked full time for two weeks or more in the past two years. In May 1997, there were 162,700 persons who were currently unemployed and had left a full time job that lasted for two weeks or more sometime in the previous two years as a result of being laid off or retrenched. The ABS also conducts a Labour Mobility Survey as a supplement to the Labour Force Survey once every two years. The latest of these surveys was conducted in February 1996. According to the survey, 417,800 persons were laid off in the 12 months to February 1996. Once again, the data are not restricted to layoffs in business. (3) The ABS has no immediate plans to collect additional data on layoffs. However, the next Labour Mobility Survey is due to be conducted in February 1998 and this will provide data on the number of people who were laid off in the previous 12 months. Results from this survey ae expected to be released in June 1998. National Weed Strategy (Question No. 1716) Ms Ellis asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: (l) Did the Government undertake community consultation when formulating the National Weeds Strategy; if so, (a) which organisations were consulted, (b) what were the dates for each consultative meeting and (c) where did each consultation take place. (2) What resources are being applied to implement the National Weeds Strategy. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (a) A discussion draft of a National Weeds Strategy was prepared and released for public comment in November 1992. I am advised that some 96 submissions from a range of organisations and individuals were received (a copy of the list of submissions has been provided to the honourable member and further copies are available from the Table Office). Revision of the discussion draft was then carried out by nominees of the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management and the Standing ComREGISTER OF SUBMISSIONS-NATIONAL 1 May 1992 Date No Received Received From 5/3/92 Ian Black, SADA 2 5/3/92 Richard Carter, Animal 3 5/3/92 Arthur Conacher, UW A 3 5/3/92 Ken Dean, Ag Protection 4 6/3/92 Ian Grant, Scientific Illus5 10/3/92 Colin Fish, AQIS Cairns 6 10/3/92 Waite Agricultural Re7 10/3/92 Plant Production Com8 17/3/92 Mrs Gwen Caddy, Yowie 9 17/3/92 IL Miller, Principal Ag10 20/3/92 RJ Walker, Macintyre 11 20/3/92 The Society for Growing mittee on Forestry. In November 1995, a further draft of the Strategy was presented to the National Landcare Advisory Committee, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the National Farmers Federation, the National Association of Forest Industries and the Australian Local Government Association, for final comment prior to the Ministerial approval. These groups raised certain further issues which were incorporated in the final draft. Ministerial approval of the Strategy was obtained through the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand, and the Ministerial Council on Forestry, Fisheries and Aquaculture in early 1996, and by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council in November 1996. (b) and (c) Consultation was undertaken essentially by way of written submissions as noted in (a). (2) The Government has provided $24 million from the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia to support the implementation of the Strategy.

(2) If the procedures have been enhanced, (a) what have been the results of the strengthened procedures, (b) what ships have been involved, (c) by whom were they owned and managed and (d) in which countries were they registered. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) introduced an enhanced inspection program for livestock carriers because of two specific incidents involving livestock carriers that had loaded at Australian ports: - in August 1996 Uniceb caught fire at sea and subsequently sank; and - in November 1996 Guernsey Express foundered during heavy weather. (b) The criteria have been broadened beyond those used for port State control surveys. A newly formed specialist surveyor team now target livestock carriers basing their inspections on factors such as age of the vessel, number of previously reported port State control deficiencies, past Description Refers to Plant Invasions of Australian EcoBotanist, Flora Conserva- systems; need to consider all weeds, not just tion Section, Tasmanian agricultural weeds; weed impact on native vegeDepartment of Parks, tation; Commonwealth role; potential conflicts; Wildlife and Heritage spread of weed propagules by vehicles and in ship ballast.

Squire-Wilson and Associates Pty Ltd, Agricultural Consultants livestock carriage records, adverse reports from other administrations and/or other Australian Government agencies. During the inspection, the specialist team can now pay more attention to the closing arrangements associated with bow and stem doors, cargo ports proced- and similar openings and make sure the ship complies with the AMSA approved Livestock Capacity Plan as specified in Marine Orders Part 43. Under the enhanced inspection program, a ships' Livestock Capacity Plan Certificate of Approval, which permits livestock carriers to trade in Australia, can be withdrawn by AMSA if defects revealed in inspections are not rectified by the dates stipulated. 2 (a) Three vessels have been inspected under the enhanced inspections program and it is too early to come to any conclusions about the results of the new program. However, AMSA considers that the newly formed team has enabled more thorough examinations of livestock carriers and has ensured that those carriers are complying with relevant international conventions and Marine Orders Part 43. 2 (b) The ships inspected under the new arrangements to date have been: (i) EI Cordero (ii) Kalymnian Express (iii) Cyrus 2 (c & d) Our records show that the owners, managers and country of registration for the ships identified in 2(b) are as follows: Ships Owned by El Cordero Vize Cia Maritima SA Panama Kalymnian Express Kalymnian Shipping Pte Ltd Cyrus International Establishment for Passport Fees (Question No. 1733) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1 ) Has there been an increase in the fees charged for a passport; if so, (a) what and (b) Why. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Passport fees will increase on 1 July 1997 from $120 for an adult passport to $126. (b) Passport fees cover the costs of passport and consular services. Since 1987, they have been adjusted annually at 1 July in accordance with movements in the CPI and part of the increase can be attributed to this. We are also expecting to see increased expenditure on technology improvements to increase the efficiency of passport issue. The passport fee increase should be seen in these contexts. Rent Assistance: Changes (Question No. 1739) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) What are the rent assistance changes proposed by the Government to take effect from 1 July 1997. (2) How many persons receive rent assistance and what is the average fortnightly sum of rent assistance received by each recipient. (3) What will be the average sum of rent assistance paid to recipients after 1 July 1997. (4) Will the Government introduce an additional benefit to compensate those persons who suffer either a reduction or an elimination of their current rent assistance after 1 July 1997. Country of Managed by registry Accord Ship Manage- Panama ment Fortcab P/L Darwin Panama Fares Enterprises PIL Lebanon Food Security Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) A new maximum rate of rent assistance for some single people sharing accommodation will be introduced from 1 July 1997. The new maximum rate of Rent Assistance for persons affected will be $24.90 a week-which is (approximately) two thirds of the current maximum rate for single people living alone ($37.40 per week). Customers will not be affected if they: do not share a bathroom, bedroom or kitchen; have dependent children; are a member of a couple (defacto or married); get a Disability Support or Carer Pension; pay for 'board and lodging'; or are resident of a nursing home or aged hostel. (2) In the fortnight ending 23 May 1997 1,049,493 customers received rent assistance. The average fortnightly payment received in that fortnight was $59.38. (3) After 1 July 1997, it is estimated that the average fortnightly rent assistance payment will be around $58.10. (4) No. Defence Efficiency Review: Rationalisation and Consolidation (Question No. 1740) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: For each Australian Defence Force property identified for rationalisation and consolidation in the report of the Defence Efficiency Review, (a) how many (i) uniform and (ii) civilian staff are employed or contracted by Defence, (b) what is the operational cost excluding salaries and (c) what is the total salary cost.

Note change in Dollar Department of Defence: Computer System Modifications (Question No. 1741) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 530 (Hansard, 19 September 1996, page 4393), how many computers (a) does his Department have and (b) are year 2000 compliant. (2) How many date dependent programs does his Department have and how many of these are year 2000 compliant. (3) Are combat related systems affected by this issue; if so, which systems or platforms. (4) How many staff are involved in addressing this issue. (5) Are contractors involved in addressing this issue; if so, who. (6) What is the estimated cost of fixing the year 2000 problem for Defence information technology. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) the Department has approximately 20 mainframes, 700 midrange and 50,000 PCs, (b) there are 14 mainframes still undergoing checking, and 6 are known to require updating; 366 midrange platforms are compliant, 235 are undergoing checking and the rest are not compliant and will require upgrade; many of the PCs are compliant and all will be subject to checking and upgrade as part of the normal maintenance and acquisition cycles. (2) An assessment was made of the number of applications within the Department. 871 applications were identified of which 36 are known to be compliant. These applications typically have many Employees Operating costs ($k) Remarks Fuel, Salary Contract Facility light, Other Defence costs costs operating power, Telephone operating Service civilian ($m) ($m) costs etc charges costs (d) (I) (e) (g) (h) (i) (j) (k) 0.023 105.6 18.6 3.1 amounts in Table-$m for salaries; $k for costs. programs associated with them. The Department is still investigating the degree of compliance and is not in a position to advise on the number of programs. (3) Combat systems are under investigation and are the core priority for rectification should they be found to be non-compliant. (4) There are 5 staff employed full time and 155 staff employed part time on the Year 2000 issue. Part time staff spend from 5% to 10% of their time on the issue. Other staff are also engaged on tasks with Year 2000 components as part of their normal duties, (5) There are four contractors working full time under Defence Preferred Systems Integrated contracts. AW A, the company which holds the Navy IT maintenance and support contract, are under instruction to include Year 2000 checking and correction as part of their normal maintenance procedures. Other contractors in Defence may work on Year 2000 tasks as part of their normal duties. (6) The current estimate is $20 million, however, this estimate does not include embedded systems, or some large areas of Defence which are still assessing the cost; it is therefore expected to rise significantly. Medicare Office, Brisbane: Claims (Question No. 1742) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (l) How many claim forms have been processed by the Medicare branch office at 444 Queen Street, Brisbane each month since January 1996.",153

(2) What form of register is retained for this purpose. (3) What is the status of attempts by Howard and Sons to lease a portion of the premises for a new factory. Mrs Bishop--In accordance with advice to me the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) None. Marrangaroo is a tri-Service demolitions training area and is not used for recreational purposes. (2) No register is retained for this purpose. (3) The final report of a contamination survey and remediation strategy for Marrangaroo is being considered by the Department. The report covers a variety of possible future scenarios, ranging from retention and continued use by Defence, to leasing of parts of the property and disposal. Howard and Sons Pyrotechnics has made known its interest and has inspected the area being considered for lease.

No Use decision will be made on any non-defence use until the future of the property has been decided. This is expected to be determined by the end of 1997. Department of Veterans' Affairs: Records Processing (Question No. 1747) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: What is the normal processing time to supply the service and medical record details of new benefit claimants to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Personal records for serving members and veterans, except for World War I veterans, are held by the three Services. Medical records for serving members are also held by the three Services, however, the medical records for veterans are held by either the Australian Archives or the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Requests from serving members for service and medical records are generally processed quickly, as the member normally provides the necessary information (number, rank and name) to speedily locate the records. However, the processing of requests for personal records from veterans may take from a few days to several months. This is determined by the information provided by the veteran and the workload at the time. The processing of reques.ts for veterans medical records generally takes longer as veterans medical records are held by the Australian Archives and must be called for when a request is received. In some cases, a medical record may be held by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, in which case the Service must request the records from the State office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Again, this process may take a few days to several months and is determined by the number of requests received and the staff available in the medical records sections of the three Services. However, when it is known that a veteran has an urgent need of documents, the Services will provide that request with a priority. 1996 Federal Election: Failure to Vote (Question No. 1752) Mr MCDougall asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 26 May 1997: (1) Is the number of persons appearing in court for failing to vote at the 1996 general election double that for the 1993 general election. (2) How many prosecutions were launched in relation to the (a) 1996 and (b) 1993 general elections. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The number of people who appeared in court for failure to vote at the 1993 general election was 4412 persons. As at 11 June 1997, the number of people who have appeared in court for failure to vote at the 1996 general election is 6 521. The increase in between the two elections is 2 112, which represents an increase of approximately forty-eight percent. The evidence indicates that there has not been a significant increase in the actual number·of people apparently failing to vote between 1993 and 1996, but, there has been an increase in the number of cases referred to the Courts for prosecution by the Australian Electoral Commission. Prior to the 1996 federal election, many Divisional Returning Officers would go to considerable lengths to make contact with apparent non-voters, to the extent of writing a letter, in addition to the two non-voter notices seeking explanations, and, in some cases making personal contact through telephone calls or visits to the residence. However, in response to the need for operational efficiencies and concerns about the privacy implications of discretionary contacts, staff exercised in seeking explanations from apparent non-voters at the 1996 general election. That is, contact with apparent non-voters was generally restricted to a first non-voter notice asking for an explanation as to why the elector apparently failed to vote. If there was no answer to this first notice, it was followed by a second and final notice sent by certified mail. Where no response resulted, the matter was then referred for court action without any further delay. (2) After the 1993 general election S 733 summonses were issued for failure to vote, and 1 summons was issued for multiple voting. After the 1996 general election 9 278 summonses were issued for failure to vote, and 10 summonses have been issued for multiple voting. The figure for summonses issued for multiple voting at the 1996 general election are as at 20 June 1997. The difference between these failure to vote figures and those shown in answer to (1) above is that these are the total numbers of summonses issued and include summonses which could not be served and prosecutions which were discontinued. Motor Vehicle Exhause Emission Controls (Question No. 1755) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 27 May 1997: (1) What requirements are imposed on motor vehicle manufacturers to restrict the emission of toxic and greenhouse gases from car exhaust fumes. (2) Is the Minister able to state how restrictions compare to standards which have been adopted by the (a) USA and (b) OECD. (3) How are Australian exhaust fumes standards implemented and enforced. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) All new cars sold on the Australian market are required to meet the emission standards contained in Australian Design Rules (ADRs). ADRs are established under the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989. The ADRs addressing emission standards for new vehicles target air pollutants and not greenhouse gases. They limit evaporative emissions of hydrocarbons, and exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO). There are no statutory restrictions on the emission of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles in Australia. However, a National Average Fuel limits Consumption (NAFC) system is in place, which is designed to reduce fuel consumption, and therefore the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (C02). The NACF system is a voluntary one, under which industry sets a voluntary schedule of fuel consumption targets for new passenger vehicles, after negotiations with the Federal Government. The current NAFC target for new passenger motor vehicles is 8.2 litres per \00 km by 2000. In 1995, a NAFC of 8.76 litres per \00 km was achieved. As part of its statement of 5 June 1997 on the automotive industry, the Government announced that an environment strategy, including an industry code of environmental performance, will be developed. Aspects of this strategy were elaborated in a joint release on 6 June 1997 by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and the Minister for Resources and Energy. (2) (a) Australian standards on air pollution emissions for new vehicles, which are currently under review, are equivalent to the 1981-87 USA standards. The current USA emission standards for new vehicles were established in 1996.

The USA operates a mandatory system for passenger cars (and light commercial vehicles), known as the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) system. The CAFE system requires each car manufacturer to achieve a target average fuel consumption for vehicles sold. A penalty for production exceeding the CAFE standard applies. The current CAFE standard for passenger cars is 8.55 litres per 100 km. A target of 5.87 litres per \00 km for 2001 has been proposed in draft legislation which was initiated in 1991. (b) The OECD does not establish new vehicle emission standards, and therefore a single comparison is not possible. Table 1 lists the range of emission regulations and limits currently in use in OECD countries: Table 2 shows which standards are applied by each OECD country, including the USA (it should be noted that California applies more strict standards for vehicles first sold in California). and limits in use in OECD countries CO HC NOx PM * 81 2.1 0.26 0.63 87 2.1 0.26 0.63 0.32 94 2.1 0.26 THC 0.25 0.32 0.15 NMHC 0.26 THC 96 2.1 0.15 NMHC 0.375 0.32 2.72 0.97 HC +NOx 2.2 0.5 HC +NOx Max 2.7 Max 0.39 Max 0.48 Mean 2.1 Mean 0.25 Mean 0.25 >2000cc CO 25g HC+NOx 6.5 NOx3.5 1991 1400-2000cc CO 30g HC+NOx 8 1990 < 1400cc CO 45g HC+NOx 15 NOx 6 < 1400cc CO 30g HC+NOx 8 that emission control equipment continues to meet nominated vehicle age in km travelled.

RAAF Air Bases: Sale (Question No. 1756) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 27 May 1997: (I) Will his Department sell RAAF Bases; if so, (a) which bases will be sold and (b) when. (2) Does either RAAF Base Richmond or RAAF Base Williamtown have the capacity to handle domestic passenger jets; if not, what works would need to be undertaken to upgrade the capacity of the bases for that purpose. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Defence will sell bases or establishments which become surplus to its requirements. In the case of RAAF bases, the Defence Efficiency Review identified bases at Richmond, Wagga, Fairbairn and Point Cook for consideration for possible disposal in the medium term (2001-2006). The disposal program is driven primarily by the requirement to achieve operating cost savings through consolidation of similar functions and rationalisation of bases. The Government will make a decision in the future on the disposal of individual bases following detailed studies of the feasibility, costs and benefits of the various functions and base activities. RAAF Fairbairn will also be considered in the context of the sale of Canberra airport under Phase 2 of the Federal Airports sales process. (2) The RAAF bases at Richmond and Williamtown have the capacity to handle domestic passenger jets although ground facilities are rudimentary. The capacity to service civil air traffic is lacking, apron parking is minimal, and ground support and refuelling facilities would require upgrading. Williamtown has a civil terminal for commutertype aircraft. Any proposal to operate domestic jet aircraft from either base would be subject to military operations and airspace considerations. Army: Payment of Salaries (Question No. 1765) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, Upon notice, on 28 May 1997: (I) Have contracted doctors and nurses at the Second Field Hospital at Enoggera been paid in recent weeks; if not, why not. (2) Do contracted doctors and nurses have to wait 8 weeks before being paid; if so, why. (3) Are Army reservists in Queensland experiencing long delays before payment; if so, why. (4) How long is the pay period for Army reservists. Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) No. A Contract Health Practitioner's first payment, after commencement of a contracted period, may take up to five weeks as payment is made on a monthly basis. While there have been occasions when the wages of Contract Health Practitioners at 2nd Field Hospital have been delayed, this delay - has not been beyond one week. In all cases the problem was identified and corrected. (3) No. The Army Regional Pay Advisers in Brisbane have advised that they are not aware of any delays in paying Army Reserve personnel in Queensland. However, if names and units of personnel experiencing delays in payment can be provided, a further check will be undertaken. (4) An Army Reserve member is entitled to payment of salary as follow: (a) in the case of a member who attends a camp of continuous training, a military school or course for a period not exceeding 6 days-as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the camp, school or course; (b) in the case of a member who attends the above for a period exceeding 6 days-on a day approved by the formation commander and on a day as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the camp, school or course; (c) in the case of a member who is dischargedas soon as practicable after the date of discharge; (d) in the case of a member who has no civil employment and who requests the issue of salary on a day-on the day approved by the member's commanding officer; and (e) in any other case-monthly.

(2) What procedures are in place to ensure that companies are discouraged from engaging in an activity of this nature. (3) What action can the Government take to deal with companies who engage in misleading marketing. (4) Will the Government take action in the case of Riverina Foods.  member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is a broad provision prohibiting conduct by a business which is misleading or deceptive, or which is likely to mislead or deceive. Generally, sellers are required to tell the truth or refrain from giving an untruthful impression. Section 52 carries a wide range of civil sanctions for breach. Section 52 is reproduced in all State and Territory fair trading legislation. In addition to section 52, section 53 prohibits certain specific types of false claims being made about a product. Under sub-section 53(eb), it is in breach of the Trade Practices Act to make a false representation Jibout a product's place of origin. Section 53 carries criminal sanctions. Section 53 is reproduced in some form in all jurisdictions. (3) The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is able to pursue the matter and, in appropriate cases, seek a penalty or remedy in the courts. The Trade Practices Act provides a range of penalties and remedies for breaches of the unfair practices provisions of Part V (which includes both section 52 and section 53). These include injunctions to prevent the prohibited conduct continuing or being repeated or to require that some action be taken; damages; corrective advertising; and a range of ancillary orders such as specific performance. For section 53, criminal sanctions can be sought, including monetary penalties of up to $200,000 for companies and up to $40,000 for individuals. (4) The alleged breaches of the Trade Practices Act by Riviana Foods are currently under priority investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Georges River: Pollution (Question No. 1775) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 29 May 1997: (1) Is it a fact that the Georges River in Sydney poses a public health risk to those who live within its basin and that fishing in the river has been banned for five years. (2) Which Commonwealth departments have agencies, instrumentalities or installations bordering the Georges River and which of those use the river for disposal of waste, chemicals, debris or effluent. (3) How many persons are employed at each establishment identified in part (2) and what action is being taken by the Commonwealth to stop its instrumentalities from polluting the river. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The New South Wales (NSW) Government announced on 17 January 1997, the closure of the Georges River, Iron Cove and Salt Pan Creek to commercial net and trap fishing. NSW Fisheries also issued a warning to recreational fishers not to eat fish caught in those areas. The closures will be reviewed in five (5) years. The closures were announced after advice from the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) of unacceptable chemical pollution involving Poly Chlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides in the muscle tissue of four fish species. The NSW Government announcement indicates the pollution came from past use of these chemicals, as they are now banned and the industrial practices that contributed to the pollution are discontinued. (2-3) The details sought by the honourable member are not readily available and would require considerable resources to extract and collate. I am therefore not prepared to direct that this work be undertaken. A survey of Commonwealth establishments would find that these chemicals are not being used as they have been banned. (Question No. 1781) Mr Barresi asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 2 June 1997: (1) Has Mr R Ellis been employed as a consultant or staff member of (a) the Hon. K.

(2) Have restrictions on workers working beyond the age of 65 years been removed; if so, will he amend the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to ensure that all workers, regardless of age, are entitled to weekly compensation benefits for lost wages in the event of them suffering an injury. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. In most cases, weekly incapacity entitlements cease at age 65. However, for claimants who ceased employment with the Commonwealth prior to 1 December 1988 and who were in receipt of weekly incapacity entitlements on 30 November 1988, those entitlements are reduced at age 65 in accordance with a legislative formula. Access to all other compensation entitlements (eg medical costs) continues for the life of the claim regardless of the claimant's age. (2) Under section 76V of the Public Service Act 1922 (the PS Act), an officer is retired from the Australian Public Service (APS) at the age of 65 years. That section is to be repealed by the repeal of the PS Act proposed under the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997, introduced into the House of Representatives on 26 June 1997. The Public Service Bill 1997, introduced on the same day, makes no provision for the compulsory retirement of an employee of the APS by reason of age. The Government is considering the implications for compensation benefits.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Noise Abatement Program (Question No. 1794) Mr Zammit asked the Minister for Administrative Services, on notice, on 4 June 1997: What is the latest available information he can provide on the (a) number of homes acquired, (b) number of homes insulated and (c) status of public and institutional buildings in the noise affected areas surrounding Sydney Airport. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) 134 homes have been acquired; (b) 1034 houses have been insulated; (c) Sixteen schools, two TAFE colleges, twenty pre-schools and one nursing home have been noise attenuated. Work has commenced on the attenuIssued ation of Newington College and is expected to be complete by March 1998. Australian Operational Support Services: Expenditure (Question No. 1795) Mr Zammit asked the Minister for Administrative Services, on notice, on 4 June 1997: (1) What expenditure has been made by Australian Operational Support Services in the acquisition and insulation of homes in the noise affected areas surrounding Sydney Airport. (2) What percentage or sum of the expenditure referred to in part (1) has been paid to local Sydney companies in the provision of employment and supplies. (3) Has a preference been given to local companies or products for the work. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australian Operational Support Services has expended $32.709 million dollars on the acquisition program and $36.145 million on insulating homes in the noise affected areas surrounding Sydney Airport. (2) Under the acquisition program $32.709 million was paid to homeowners under the voluntary acquisition scheme and a further $1.731 has been paid to various local companies for demolition and clean up of the sites. Of the $36.145 million spent on insulating homes, an exceptionally high proportion, approximately 85% to 90% of both product and services have been sourced locally. This means that approximately $32.5305 million of the $36.145 million expended on insulating homes has been paid to local companies. A study sponsored by the NSW Industrial Supplies Office Limited has found that by achieving such a high level of Australian content, every additional $10 million spent on the project is benefiting the Australian economy. 295 person years of employment; $2.8 million in taxes and charges returned to government; $2.5 million in extra consumer spending; the potential to reduce welfare expenditure by $2.3 million. (3) While Commonwealth purchasing policy does not necessarily favour local suppliers most contractors and suppliers are small to medium enterprises from all over the Sydney area. The Project, with a high level of industry consultation, identified local companies and provided them with the opportunity to participate in the extensive work program. Australian firms have been quick to take up the challenge and have produced innovative solutions in areas such as air conditioning, secondary windows, seals, roof cowls and insulation material. Telstra: Director Assistance Charges (Question No. 1797) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 4 June 1997: Is a 50 cent charge to be placed on Telstra's 013 directory assistance service; if so, why; if not, the Minister guarantee that Australians will not be charged a 50 cent fee for using Telstra's 013 directory assistance service while the Government remains in office. Mr W arwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Charges for directory assistance are ed under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 introduced by the previous Government in 1991. In passing the 1997 telecommunications legislation, the Parliament debated the question of charging for directory assistance and decided not to rule it out as a possibility. Because of their significance to the community, possible directory assistance charges are, however, subject to notification and disallowance under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991. This means that Telstra is required to formally notify the Minister for Communications and the Arts of any proposal to introduce directory assistance charges. The - inister has the power to disallow proposed dIrectory charges. The Minister may only do so, if, - ter receiving and considering a report from the mdependent regulator, the ACCC, the Minister forms the opinion that the charge would not be in the public interest. (The legislation does not allow a proposal to be rejected without the ACCC first reporting on it.) On 2 July 1997, Telstra made a formal submission to the Government proposing a charge of 50 cents for 013 directory assistance inquiries. The charge would only apply to numbers already in the customer's local White Pages and would not apply to customers who cannot read, hold or use a directory or to inquiries from payphones. Amongst other things, the charge would be balanced by a $5.40 reduction in the annual basic line rental charge. The charge would commence from 1 January 1998. Te1stra has proposed the charge because of the significant and increasing cost of providing directory assistance, currently around $21Om, in the absence of any user charges. The majority of inquiries relate to numbers already listed in the White Pages. Telstra's market research has found that 82 per cent of people believe they will be better off or not affected by this measure, and that seven per cent of the population account for 97 per cent of calls to Directory Assistance. In accordance with the notification and disallowance procedures under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991, the Minister has referred Telstra's proposal to the ACCC for its report. The ACCC must report will to the Minister within 30 days. Telstra's proposal will receive the closest scrutiny. The Government is concerned to ensure that directory information is readily available to telephone users free of charge. The Minister has indicated that Telstra's proposal must address community concerns, particularly in relation to consumers in rural and regional Australia and other disadvantaged groups. The Minister has also said that Te1stra's claims that, for example, more than eight out of ten people will be better off under the not prohibit- proposal, will be tested. Australian Popular Music: Export Value (Question No. 1798) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 4 June 1997: (1) Further to the Minister's answer to part (4) of question No. 1233 (Hansard, 27 May 1997, page 4111), is the Minister able to provide a precise date for when the Contemporary Music Export Development Fund will begin operating. (2) Further to the Minister's answer concerning The Big Backyard, (a) how long has it been in operation, (b) how has it been funded previously and (c) has the Government provided funding to it through (i) the Australia Councilor (ii) other means; if so, in which years. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The implementation plan for the Contemporary Music Export Development Fund's 1997-98 program was approved at the Australia Council's meeting on 29-30 May 1997. The program will comprise international touring and international promotions components. Assistance for international touring will be provided through a loans program to assist export ready music artists and bands to tour. International promotions, including activities such as The Big Backyard, will be developed with music industry bodies. Discussions with industry have commenced, with a public announcement of the program expected to occur in late July 1997. (2) (a) The Big Backyard has been in operation since 1987. (b) and (c) From 1987 until 1991 the three principal partners supported the concept and work of The Big Backyard as an independent production company without Government funding assistance. From 1991 to 1995 funding was provided to The Big Backyard by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Funding of $200,000 has been provided by the Australia Council in 1996/97 only. Comcar: Private Car Hire Companies (Question No. 1803) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 4 June 1997: What requirements are placed on private car hire firms undertaking Comcar work in relation to (a) driver training, (b) driver rest breaks, (c) the of vehicle to be used and (d) the servicing of vehicles used. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Private hire car firms are engaged by COMCAR under Purchasing Australia's Hire Car Services (Chauffeur Driven) Common Use AgreementBuyers Guide 20. This panel contract specifies the minimum standards. In relation to the Particular items identified, the following apply: a) Driver training requirement must comply with relevant StatelTerritory hire car driver licensing requirements. b) None. c) Ford LTD, Holden Caprice, Ford Fairlane, Holden Statesman or their equivalent in the market. d) Vehicles will preferably be less than 6 years old and in mechanical condition which conforms with appropriate Staterrerritory standards and regulations for hire car vehicles. Under the Agreement COMCAR can specify further requirements and is consulting with the hire car industry on these issues, particularly in relation to safety and security. Comcar: Security and Safety Concerns (Question No. 1804) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 4 June 1997: Has he received a report from the (a) Australian Federal Police or (b) New South Wales Police regarding security and safety concerns about the increased hire of private vehicles rather than using trained Commonwealth car drivers; if so, what action is being taken to ensure that the concerns raised by the police forces are addressed. Mr Jull-The answer to the honourable members' question is as follows: (a) and (b) No. First Field Hospital, Holsworthy (Question No. 1805) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 5 June 1997: (1) Has construction of the First Field Hospital, Holsworthy, NSW, been completed.

Construction is currently in defects liability period which will end on 12 December 1997. (2) Expenditure to date is $21.429m. Final expenditure at end of defects liability will be contained within the project cost cap of $21.754m. (3) Yes. The hospital was handed over to the occupying unit on 12 December 1996 and became operational on 23 December 1996. (4) An official opening of the 1st Field Hospital has not been held, nor is it planned to hold such an opening prior to the end of the defects liability period. Depending on the operational and training commitments of the hospital, an opening ceremony may be conducted as part of 1st Field Hospital's 30th 'birthday' on 1 April 1998. RAAF Base, Richmond (Question No. 1812) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: Has he given a commitment to the Member for Macquarie that RAAF Base Richmond will not be sold despite being included in the Defence Efficiency Review consideration. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The Defence Efficiency Review identified RAAF Base Richmond for possible disposal in the period 2001-2006. A decision on the future of the base will be made by the Government following detailed studies of the feasibility, cost and benefits which may result from the rationalisation and consolidation of functions at RAAF Base Richmond. (Question No. 1817) Mr Barry Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (1) Will the Government regard the year 2000 as the last year of the 20th century and the year 2001 as the first year of the 21st century and of the third Christian millennium.

(3) Will the Government plan for celebrations of the new millennium to coincide with the centenary of federation on 1 January 2001.",172
298,Mr HOWARD,TOTAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. Due to the chronological method of reckoning the years at the beginning of the Christian era, ie going from 1 BC to I AD without having a year 0000, the year 2000 will be the last year in the current century and millennium. Both the 21st century and the 3rd millennium will begin on Monday 1 January 2001. (2) Yes. (3) The Government plans that celebrations in 2001 will focus on the centenary of our federation as a nation. ABC Promotions (Question No. 1819) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 673 (Hansard, 10 October 1996, page 5266) concerning the ""It's your ABC"" promotion, (a) how many times were the promotions shown between 26 January 1996 and 5 June 1997, (b) how many are in the series, (c) what were the criteria for creativity and innovation used in the tender process which gave a contract to Batey Kazoo, (d) how is the series regarded as innovative after 16 months, (e) how does the series demonstrate public involvement in the ABC, (f) what are persons in the series doing and are they handicapped in some way, (g) was the series offered up as a saving in the face of cuts to the ABC; if not, why not, and (h) will the series continue indefinitely. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided Year 2000 the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) 11,484 (b) There are 52 ""It's your ABC"" promotions. Twenty two of the promotions were produced inhouse, and the remainder by the ABC's advertising agency, Batey Kazoo. (c) Ten advertising agencies were invited to submit tenders for the ABC advertising account. The tender sought proposals for a campaign to of century, promote the image of the ABC. The objective of the campaign was to enhance viewer perceptions of the ABC as: more contemporary; representative of all Australia; accessible; a relevant part of Australian culture; and seen as being owned by the people-""It's your ABC"". The Batey Kazoo proposal outlined a series of promotions using a distinctive slow motion step frame technique, presenting Australians from diverse locations, ethnic background, age and occupations. Tender proposals were evaluated by a small group which comprised the Managing Director, Head of Television, Network Programmer and Head of Television Promotions. The overall Batey Kazoo submission, which contained the proposed step frame, slow motion approach to filming people 'sign' the ABC logo was judged to be the most creative. Batey Kazoo was awarded the ABC advertising contract and subsequently produced the first 22 promotions. Subsequent promotions have been produced by ABC Promotions staff in all States. (d) The ABC has monitored telephone and written comments over the past sixteen months to assess audience response to the station identifications. The monitoring of audience response has included attention to the extent to which the promotions have remained interesting and entertaining over this period. In order to more systematically assess audience reaction, in March 1997 the ABC commissioned the Sydney-based Jigsaw Strategic Research company to undertake a study to further evaluate public response and to explore ways to develop the concept. The survey revealed that 69% of participants liked the campaign; 21 % neither liked nor disliked the promotions; whilst 10% indicated they did not like the identifications. The identifications were judged to be original and accessible through their use of down-to-earth people doing ordinary things. The promotions were not judged to be 'commercial' in style, and respondents described them as 'honest', 'refreshing' and 'subtle'. The message respondents drew from the promotions was of an ABC for all Australians, not just in Sydney and Melbourne, and not just the well-educated. The ABC was satisfied with these results, and they indicated that after sixteen months the campaign objectives continue to be fulfilled. (e) The station identifications seek to convey a message that ownership of the ABC is in the hands of the Australian people, drawn from all parts of the country, and from all walks of life. By inviting a broad cross-section of the community to sign the ABC logo in their hand, the message is intended to be one of public involvement and ownership of the ABC. (0 People are filmed in the workplace and in domestic environments, and are seen to tum from their activities to sign the ABC logo. A wide range of locations and workplaces are included in the series. No handicapped people have been included to date. The ABC Disability Action Plan, published in May 1997, proposes that any future series of the 'It's your ABC' campaign should include disabled people. This recommendation has been noted by Television Promotions management. (g) No. Network identifications are an integral part of the overall presentation on all television networks. Since the introduction of the 'It's your ABC' identifications, the network has introduced additional promotions in order to keep the concept fresh. A series of local identifications was introduced late in 1996 and it is now proposed to commission an additional five promotions from the advertising agency Batey Kazoo. The number of new identifications to be commissioned has been limited to five, on the one hand to retain the distinctiveness of the campaign and on the other to take account of the reduction in the overall ABC budget. (h) There are no plans to cease screening the promotions at this stage. The ABC will, however, continue to monitor audience response to their use, and on the basis of this response, make decisions about future scheduling of the handsigned station identification promotions. Toxic Waste Dump: Ramsar Convention (Question No. 1820) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 16 June 1997: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a project by CSR to establish a large, centralised toxic waste dump in Werribee, Vic., in the electoral division of Lalor.
