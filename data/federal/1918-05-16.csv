11,Mr JENSEN,FENCING WIRE AND WIRE,"A proclamation was issued in the Gazette of, speaking from memory, the 10th August last, prohibiting the importation of motor cars, which were deemed to he a luxury. But, as I stated at the time, cars which had been . ordered from manufacturers in England or America were to be permitted to come in, because financial obligations had been incurred in respect of them. Subsedeputations of importers 'asked of ', that consideration should be given to imtheir business, which they said should i not he suddenly dislocated or stopped, and deputations from the motor car body builders of Australia also waited on me. A mutual agreement was arrived at between the importers and the motor body that the latter would be satisfied if it were decided that every car permitted to come into Australia should be accompanied by two chassis. The introduction of two chassis with every motor car imported meant that the business of the local motor body builders would he afforded an opportunity to progress. Motor body builders had not the necessary material to enable them to cope with manuthe requirements of the Commonwealth, since the - proclamation had been suddenly issued, and it was because of this mutual arrangement that I resolved to allow the introduction of one car with every twe to chassis imported.

In a telegram which has just come to hand, the Secretary of State has advised that the Board of Trade have concluded negotiations for 600,000 crates of hooked skinned rabbits direct with the Meat Control Board, Sydney, and that the exporters in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania, are to participate in proportion to the respective production for export last season. The Secretary of State added that he very much regretted that, owing to a misunderstanding, the question of the rabbit purchase has not been handled in a more satisfactory way. As to thu purchase of the 600,000 crates, the Board of Trade were uuder the impression that, as the offer was made through an official body, the Commonwealth Government were aware of the negotiations.

On the 25th April of this year, the Australian Wheat Board unanimously decided to recommend that payments, as soon as found convenient, should be made to the wheat growers of the various States as follows: 191516 Pool -3d . per bushel in New South Wales and Victoria; lid. per bushel in South Australia and Western Australia. 191617 Pool -3d . per bushel in all States. 191718 Pool -3d . per bushel in all States. The amount involved in those payments is approximately as follows:191516 .. .. £1,750,000 191617 .. 1,750,000 191718 .. .. 1,250,000 Total .. .. f4,750,000 I ""have now been able to arrange with the financial institutions to have the payments made as follows:191516 -15t h day of June. 191617 -15t h day of July. 191718 -15t h day of August.'

58,Mr WATT,SAL E OF RABBIT S TO GREA T,"It is not quite final,- but it is as nearly a clean-up of the'first pool as is possible, in view of the shipping and deterioration difficulties.

61,Mr JH CATTS,SAL E OF RABBIT S TO GREA T,But as to the lot?,26
62,Mr WATT,SAL E OF RABBIT S TO GREA T,"It is impossible to say, because, as honourable members know, the British surveying officer is valuing wheat in the various States, particularly in New South Wales, at the present time, and until that valuation is completed we canto not know what the remaining portion of the wheat any given pool is worth. Mr J. H» CATTS - That is, his valua",26
63,Mr WATT,SAL E OF RABBIT S TO GREA T,"As to losses, yes, for a take-over date. This pool question seems simple from the outside, but its finance and its figures become very tangled as years go oh. I am sure that the Board and the Treasury are-alike desirous of coister operating in the simplification of wheat methods, which can only be achieved by the gradual wiping out of the early pool balances, and possibly bringing them forward into other pools. I am sure that the wheat farming community in the four States will be grateful for this extra ment. We should have been - glad to noticemake it more, if that had been safe as well as possible; it involved, however, starving financial organization, and the present ing arrangement is just about as fair a, deal chaff? as we could possibly have at the present time, in view of the condition of the finances.

Thomson, 42 Kingston-avenue, Perth, and delivered on the 29th April last, was handed in by the sender at London on the 18th of the previous month? 2. Is there any reason why a cable should take forty-three days in transmission from England .to Australia ? 3. ' Will the Government take steps to insure that messages from soldiers abroad to their relatives shall be handled with promptitude? ' Mr Wise - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The Defence Department is unable to say, but a communication has been received by the Minister from Mr John Thomson complaining of the delay in transmission of this cable. 2 and 3. The transmission of cables is controlled by the cable companies, and not by the Defence Department, but similar complaints have been brought under the notice of the companies by this Department from time to time. It is understood that the delays occur through the heavy pressure of Government business and the occasional breakdown of cables. The whole question is at present being gone into to see whether it is possible to make such arrangements as will obviate further complaints of this nature.",29

100,Mr RODGERS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Wannon) [3.16] - In the absence of the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) and at his request, I move, pro formd, the following ' amendment of which he has given notice: That after the word ""effected"" the following paragraph be inserted:and (o) all interest actually paid by the taxpayer in the year immediately preceding the year of assessment PAPERS. upon money borrowed and actually used or invested in Australia. The effect of the amendment is that all interest paid on money invested in Australia shall be regarded as an item rightly deductible from income. I regret to say that I cannot give a fuller statement of the reasons actuating the honourable member for Kooyong in the framing of his amendment, but I have done what I undertook to do in moving it , and in giving to ' the Committee what inf ormation he was able to impart to me on passing from the chamber. If the Minister is of opinion that the carrying of the amendment will affect money invested in the war loan, I shall not support it .",31
101,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Angas-Minister forHome and Territories) [3.21] - I cannot accept the amendment, though I am sorry that the honourable member for KopyOng (Sir Robert Best) has not been able to move it himself, because there may' bo other reasons which do not occur to the members of the Committee for considering his proposal. My opinion is that the amendment would affect an enormous number of investments, and, if carried, would cause a large loss of revenue. In relation to the war loans, it would mean sary to recoup the expendi- that a man borrowing to invest in war ture on improvements made stock would not only enjoy an exemption undercovenantwith the lessor of income tax in respect of the interest on land by a lessee who has on the stock he bought, but also an exno tenant rights in the improvements. The deduction emption in respect of the interest paid on under this paragraph shall the money borrowed to buy the stock, he ascertained by dividing which would not befair. Take the case the amount expended on the of two men, one starting in business, havimprovements by the lessee by the number of years in the ing capital to the amount of, say, unexpired period of the £10,000, and the other borrowing for lease at the date the im- private purposes to that extent. If you provements were effected"". gave an exemption from income taxation in respect to the interest paid on all borrowed money without respect to use, the man with capital could ask for a similar concession. Mr Rodgers.,- The arrangement made with financial institutions for the borrowing of money for investment in war stock is that the rate of interest payable shall the a little lower than the rate of in terest on the war stock.",31
102,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I believe that is so. I understand that the money is borrowed at 4 per cent. I do not see why investors in war stock who borrow to buy the stock should have the two exemptions that I have mentioned. When a man with capital commences a business, he surrenders the interest which his capital was former ely earning, and if all who borrowed, ""whether for business or not, were given an exemption in respect of interest the capitalist might ask for a similar concession. Mr ARCHIBALD [3.24] - A matter which, I think, may have been in the mind of the framer of the amendment is the fact that occasionally, after serious financial disturbances and consequent bankruptcies, honourable men who have failed have subsequently borrowed to enable them to pay off their liabilities in full , although others, perhaps of greater social distinction, have been content to pay their creditors f d . in the £ 1 . Is it fair for the Commissioner of Taxes to refuse an exemption in respect of the interest paid to enable a citizen to discharge his obligations in full 1 Cases of this kind may not be numerous, but I have known men to pay interest for several years on money borrowed to enable them to meet their liabilities in full . I am certain that the Committee would not like such men tp be penalized for their integrity.",32
103,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Wakefield} [3.26] - I understood the Minister to say that the man who borrows money to in vest in a business is not entitled to an exemption from income tax in respect of the interest, paid on that money. If that is the law, it is outrageous. The Minister said that if two men went into business, one possessing capital and the other borrowing to provide himself with capital, the man without capital should not be allowed to deduct from his income the in terest paid on the borrowed money.",32
104,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"A man is allowed to duct as an outgoing interest on money borrowed, if it is used in connection with the creation of taxable income.",32
105,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Grampians) [3.28] - I understood the Minister to say that the man who borrowed money to put into a. business would not be allowed to deduct from his income the interest paid on the borrowed money.,32
106,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,He would be allowed to do so.,32
107,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,I want that to be made perfectly clear.,32
108,Mr CORSER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Wide Bay) [3.30] - I emphasize the need for a clearer understanding of the position. It would greatly check enterprise if men could not deduct from their incomes the interest paid on borrowed capital, and it would be very unjust. I understand the M in ister to say, however, that this deduction is permitted.",32
109,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Capricornia) [3.31] - I understand the position to be this: If a (Hindmarsh) man borrows, and by doing so is able to add to his income, he can place the in terest he pays against his earnings; but the man who borrows to buy, say, shares which do not return a dividend, cannot claim a deduction in respect of the in terest he has to pay.",32
110,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) . [3.32] - The money expended in connection with the production of taxable income is allowed as a deduction from the amount of in come earned; but the amendment covers all borrowings, without regard to their purpose. What I wanted to point out was that the clause would allow a man to deduct interest on money borrowed for any purpose, although a man possessing capital and using it for business is not given any similar concession. I see no justification for the proposal. Under it , men who have borrowed large sums, whether usingthe money to earn income or not, could deduct the interest from their return of income.",32
111,Mr RODGERS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,The proposed amendment is taken from Victorian legislation.,32
112,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I cannot see any good ground for it . Cases have arisen bearing on the point, though I am unable at the moment to cite them.",32
113,Mr RODGERS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"If the amendment were carried the Commissioner would not be able to inquire how the money which had been borrowed had been in devested ; whether it had been used to earn revenue, to pay debts, or for some other purpose.",32
114,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The amendment covers all moneys borrowed and used or invested in Australia, though the drafting may include money borrowed out of Australia and invested in the Commonwealth. It would allow the deduction of interest in respect of all borrowed money. I have been unable to obtain from the Statistical Department an estimate of 'the effect that the amendment would have upon the revenue, and the Commissioner for Taxes has not the information; but his opinion is that the amendment would cause a large loss.",32
115,Mr BOYD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"If a man bought a farm, the management of which was not exactly a part of his business, and he were losing on the farm, would he be allowed an exemption in respect of the interest?",33
116,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"If a man borrowed for the purposes of his farm , Le would be borrowing for the.purposes of his business. And, I believe, that at present the amount of interest he paid would be allowed.",33
117,Mr BOYD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,-But suppose the farm was a non-paying one?,33
118,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Then it would depend upon the total of his income. I should think, in that case, the amount would be an expenditure in relation to taxable income from property, and, if so, the allowance should be made. of course, subject tocorrection. In general, the principle is that expenditure on interest in relation to income from business is credited as an outlay in connection with the making of that income. I think the honourable member will find that, under the law as it stands, where a man,carries on two businesses, a loss in one business is set off against the profits of the other, and that, on the whole, the amendments made already in the principal Act will attain the end desired. In this Bill we have extended the principle. Where a man has, say, a fixed salary, we will allow a loss on any business carried on by him to be taken into account against his income by way of salary.",33
119,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"If borrows money to«discharge a debt, is allowed to deduct the interest which he pays ?",33
120,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The honourable member is alluding to the point raised by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr.. Archibald). Where a man this year borrows to pay a past obligation, not connected with current business, I do not see on what principle we could allow the interest on that borrowing as a decould duction from his income tax in relation to the present year. The transaction relation to which the borrowing takes place is a past one, and, unless directly related to present business expenditure, cannot affect the principle of taxation for this particular year. When the Committee takes into account the fact that in connection with businesses, taxpayers are allowed to deduct from their taxable income the amount expended by way of interest; that the loss on one business can be taken into account in connection with the profits made on another carried on by the same taxpayer, and - that in connection with the taxation of a man's salary a loss made by him on his business may be taken into account, I think it will be recognised that we have gone as far as we ought.",33
121,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Tak e the case of a man who, owing to the precarious nature of his business, has incurred heavy losses over a number of years, and has had to obtain an overdraft. Would a man so situated be allowed to deduct the interest payable on that overdraft, which was incurred in a past year, from his income in respect of the present year? I speak, Mr Glynn - I do not know on what principle such a deduction could, in all all cases, be allowed. The question would depend altogether upon whether or not the borrowing was in relation to the production of income for this particular year. It is all very well to put these hypothetical cases, and to expect an immediate and authoritative decision,- which will bind the administration of the law, but I can only say that, having looked at the principle of the Act, I do not think we would be justified in allowing past obligations, which are paid out of present borrowings, for purposes nob related to production of present taxable income, to be taken into account in relation to the income of this particular year. a man Mr LYNCH (Werriwa) [3.40]. This he amendment seems to me to be too sweeping, and I cannot support it . Under it a man who was making big profits in , say, an importing business, and who, at the same time acquired a large area of unimproved country, and borrowed money for the purpose of developing it , would largely evade his responsibility as a taxpayer. He would be able to go on building up a valuable asset, upon which he realise after our war-time taxation had passed away. This amendment jrould in open up'an avenue by which wide-awake people, full y alive to the development* possible in a country like ours, might largely evade their legitimate obligations under our income taxation > laws. Por that reason I shall vote against it .",33
122,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Wakefield) [3.42] - The Minister says that assuming that the liability to pay interest was in respectof an overdraft secured in a previous year, he does not think it would be fair to allow the interest on that overdraft to be deducted from income. I think he is wrong, and I shall give him a concrete case to support the position I take up. It seems to me that the amendment introduces a principle which has been in operation for a long time nnder the Victorian Act.",34
123,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,I think that Victoria has more use for this particular provision than Australia generally has.,34
124,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I do not disagree with the Minister as to that. The case I-have in mind is that of a land broker who was one of three partners: The firm fell upon evil times, and got into financial difficulties. To escape those difficulties two of the partners filed their schedules, and got off scot-free. The third partner borrowed money to pay notonly his own liabilities but those of his partners.",34
125,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,He was an honest man.,34
126,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"He was an honost man, and under the Victorian Act he was penalized because of his honesty. It took him years to liquidate the debt; and the point I wish to make is that while that debt existed he was not allowed, under the Victorian Act, to deduct the interest which he paid in respect of it , nor would he be allowed to do so under this clause as it stands.",34
127,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,But the debt was incurred in respect of past years.,34
128,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Quite so, but if it exists today, 'and interest is still .being paid upon it , why should the man not be allowed to deduct such interest from his income? Surely we ought not to penalize a man for honesty of purpose. If , as I suspect, this clause is an exact copy of the Victorian law, it is absolutely unjust and un-British.",34
129,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3.46] - I believe this clause will affect Victoria more than any other State, and probably the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) sees the position in the light 'of some debts that have ibeen incurred here. However honourable a man might be in borrowing money in a particular year to pay off past obligations, can it be said that it is the duty of the Income Tax Commissioner to recognise, that honesty in a way that is inconsistent with the Act ? Plainly put, the case stated by the honourable member is that of a man who borrows in a particular year to pay off expenditure incurred in relation to the income of another year which we are not taxing, and which We could not tax even if the borrowing meant' not a loss but a very great profit. M i . RICHARD FOSTER - If a bank overdraft were involved the interest paid in respect of it should be allowed as a deduction. . Mr Glynn - Every bank overdraft is not taken into account in relation to a man's income. "" If it is an overdraft on which interest has to be paid in relation to the production of taxable income, the interest so paid is, of course, taken into account under section 18, sub-section 1, paragraph a of the Act. This amendment is very wide aud indefinite. It is in relation to interest generally.",34
130,Mr RODGERS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,I admit that that is its Weakness.,34
131,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Of course it is, and I am glad that the honourable member is ready to admit it. I cannot see that in framing our income tax legislation. we are bound to take into account all the conditions of society.",34
132,Mr LIVINGSTON,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,It seems to me that under this amendment it would not matter where the money was borrowed or where it was used.,34
133,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Grampians) [3.48] I can see the force of the objection raised by the Minister, and I ask him to say that if we do not press the amendment he will draft one that will meet such a case as that mentioned by the honourable member for . Wakefield (Mr Foster). The pastoral and agricultural industries are very precarious, and frequently involve heavy burdens in interest payments on the part of those engaged in them. Will the Minister draft an amendment, and cause it to be inserted in another place, so as to enable those who have been paying interest on borrowed money for ten or eleven years' - thos e who have been trying to pay their way instead of becoming insolvent in order to escape the burden of interest-to deduct from their income the interest so paid ? Mr Glynn"" (Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3!49] - The honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett) is now referring to a debt in curred, in relation to a business, and if that debt exists as a current obligation, is, as the law standsat present, deductable from the income of the taxpayer. The principle is to allow a deduction of interest, the obligation in respect of which has been incurred in the production of the income for the year in regard to which the return is made. If , say, a man borrowed money last year or the year be-fore, and was paying interest upon it today, he would be allowed a deduction in respect of that interest as against his i come for the present year. This amendment, however, has no relation to anything of that sort. It is a general pro-^ vision in respect of interest paidi n the previousyear of any borrowings. If there is any want of clearness in the legislation in that regard, an amendment will be brought in ; but I do not think that it exists. Amendment negatived. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 48 (Application bf> Act ) . Mr Glynn"" (Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [3.51] - This clause deals with the times at which the various provisions come into force. has been recommitted, on my. motion, at the request of several, honourable members, particularly the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory). Sub-clause 1 deals with provisions which are to be deemed to have come into force at the commencement of the Act oni the 13th September, 1915. The first of these provisions relates to an amendment made by paragraph e' ofclause2, which provides a new definition of income and in cludes as income in the case of a co-operative company practically all moneys received by it in thecourse of its trading. Honourable members will remember what was-said about the matter in Committee. It is simply an extension of the word "" commodities "" in order to make it clear that it includes land and sales of goods. The amendment, although it is made retrospective, will not involve a single payment from, any taxpayer.",34
134,Mr GREGORY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Most of them have already paid the tax.,35
135,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Yes , but there was some slight doubt as to whether the word "" commodities "" covered the items I have referred to, and in order to remove that doubt we have made the amendment retrospective. The second provision which is made retrospective to the commencei t ment of the Act is an amendment made by paragraph h of clause 2, relating to standard value fon live stock: There is a regulation based on section 14 of the Act giving a definition of "" standard value,"" but there was a slight doubt as to whether or not that regulation could be framed under the wording of the section. In order to make the matter certain; the amendment has been made retrospective,- so that the definition of standard value may be, as hitherto, pren - scribed by regulation. Another provision which is made retrospective to the commencement of the Act is* an amendment made by clause 5, relating, to section 10 of the Act. That section providesSubject to the-provisions of this Act, income tax shall he levied and paid in and for each financial year upon - the'taxable income derived directly on indirectly by every taxpayer from sources within Australia during the period of twelve months ending, on the thirtieth day of June preceding the financial year in and for which the tax is payable. The words "" in and for "" have been a source of some legal objections to assessments and payments that were not complete within the particular year. It dbes not It really matter whether aman gets notice of* aparticular assessment^ and the' payment happens to fall due on the 2nd July or the 29th June, but the wording of the Act renderedi t doubtful as to whether the Department could really collect where the payment did not fall due within the actual financial year of the assessment. Clause 5 remedies that defect. Another provision which is made similarly retrospective is an amendment made by paragraph, d of clause 8 relating to the decision given by. the H i gh Court in the Meares case, which has already been referred to. In that case, it was declared that income accumulated prior to the30th June, 1914, was not taxable, but that if the company had carried forward income into a profit and loss account' it was taxable .when distributed. In any - event, income is only taxable when it is distributed among the shareholders. The High Court's decision was that where money had been paid into an appropriation account, it was really not paid into a profit and loss account, and therefore was not taxable. The Act has been amended to add the words."" appropriation account, revenue and expenses account, or any other similar account"" to the words ""profit and loss account."" ""We have already discussed this' matter at length in Committee. If the amendment is not made, a considerable loss of reveuue will be involved. ",35
136,Mr BOVD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The Minister was asked whether Meares, who had obtained a verdict in Court, would be compelled to pay by this amendment.",36
137,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Any man who has actually obtained a judgment in a Court of justice is never asked to pay.,36
138,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,'But others who have not secured verdicts are affected.,36
139,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The amount involved is practically £500,000, the whole of which is practically for refunds, and not for payments that have to be made. There have been a few objections to the assessments made by the Commissioner in this regard, and some who have lodged objections have not followed them up; but in the Meares case the objection was followed up, and - a verdict was secured against the Commissioner. The firm will get the benefit of that verdict.. Another provision made similarly retrospective to the commencement of the Act, is an amendment made by paragraph 6 of clause 10. The Act, as it stands, requires the Commissioner, where he is not satisfied .that a company has distributed a reasonable proportion of its taxable income, to divide that income amongst the shareholders in proportion to their interests in the paid-up capital. The amendment will operate to the benefit of the taxpayers. The drafting of the provision in the Act is somewhat loose. The Commissioner is without limitation in regard to his power to tax as if the income of the company had been distributed. If he exercised his powers to declare that all shareholders would be taxed, and that the company also should be taxed at a flat rate, one man might be compelled to pay two taxes. This was a matter to which I drew the attention of the Treasury before this Bill was drafted. As the section stood, a shareholder in a company might be called upon to pay more than the tax to which he was morally liable. A man holding three-fourths of the shares of any company might be required to pay three-fourths of the flat rate imposed on the company, and also, later on, when he received his dividend, at the rate of his own income. The section has been made} retrospective in order to cover that error. ^ Sub-clause 2 deals with war pensions and .agricultural and kindred societies. A promise was given during last year that action would be taken to exempt from taxation war pensions and agricultural and kindred societies. The sub-clause will carry out that promise, and exempt these pensions and these societies from taxation as from the 1st July last. There is also an amendment made by clause 11 which is covered by the same sub-clause. Clause 11 relates to income derived from shares transferred to the Public Trustee from enemy shareholders. The amendment in that regard will also come into force as from the 1st July, 1917. Sub-clause 3 relates to a number of amendments which are to come into force on the 1st July, 1918, and to apply to assessments for next year and onwards.

140,Mr GEEGORY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Dampier) [4.5] When the Bill was in Committee, I consulted with the Treasurer, and also with the Minister in charge, with a view to a recommittal of clause 8; but I think there was some misunderstanding on the point. I am sorry that the Minister did not see his way to permit this clause to be re-submitted, because it is one of the fundamental provisions of the Bill, and well worthy of discussion. I desire to do nothing that might in the slightest degree curtail the power of the Government to collect revenue at such a time as this. We all realise the difficulties of the position, and desire to give, every assistance to those responsible for the nnances. However, for many years, in this and all the other Parliaments of Australia, there has been a strong desire expressed for uniformity in taxation administration. At conference after conference, attended by both Commonwealth and State Ministers, the question has been discussed in full realization of the inconvenience experienced by taxpayers in dealing with the many varying taxation forms. Yet in the Bill before us there is proposed an entirely new The method, so far as Australia is concerned. My desire now is to urge the adoption of the principle of taxation at the source, so that, instead of individual shareholders, companies shall be subject the to an imposition in the natureof a divithe dend, tax. There is nothing new in the principle; indeed, it is embodied in the that Bill, inasmuch as provision is made for if employers to collect ihe tax from employees. But, in relation to a section of of retaxpayers of much greater importance, the principle is ignored. The advantages of taxation at the source are obvious, and the first is that it means a large increase of in revenue. If these matters are left to of the individual, there must be loss. Only recently I heard of a case in which a acting on information, bought certain shares on his own behalf and on behalf of two others. Except in the case of one of those concerned, the shares were never transferred; and yet dividends were paid. How is the Crown to trace a transaction of that kind, assumthe taxpayer does not include it in his return?",37
141,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,The Government get a list of shareholders everyyear.,37
142,Mr GREGORY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"But , in this instance, the person who actually received the dividends was never registered as a shareholder, the shares being in the broker's name and hands. The Minister ought to remember that, if there are 10,000 companies, there must be hundreds of thousands of shareholders'; and, if the tax is received from the company, the Government are sure of it, while they certainly cannot be sure if all these individuals have to be traced.",37
143,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,A shareholder always remains liable.,37
144,Mr GREGORY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Does the Minister know the extent of the staff in the Taxation Department?,37
145,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,That does not affect the question before us.,37
146,Mr GREGORY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"If the Minister does know, he may realise what staff would be required if these individuals had to be traced.",37
147,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,That : is another subsidiary question.,37
148,Mr GREGORY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The plan proposed in the Bill will mean certain circumlocution, expense, and loss. When an income tax was first imposed in the Old Country, the individual was taxed, but, after four from dividends, the same applies. years' experience, the Government sorted to taxation at the source, with the tax on the dividends. result, that the revenue was nearly doubled.

It is doubtful if there will be any saving in the preparation of returns. At the present time, many taxpayers have to employ experts to make up their returns, and I do not know that their position will be any easier under the Bill. The Government have come out of this business very badly. Uniformity in taxation methods has been promised repeatedly. week, the Premiers met in conference to talk over the subject, and now the Treasurers are to meet and discuss it ; but three sensible business men would settle the whole matter very quickly.",41
189,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"""Why do you always disparage politicians?",41

As the Leader of the Opposition has said, our income taxation is likely to increase. An immense debt has been heaped up because of the expenditure which, this awful war has entailed upon us, and we must face it. Nevertheless, a system of duplication prevails which keeps in employment an arcny of public servants that is constantly increasing. The States have the sublime impudence to say that their Departments could look after taxation matters more cheaply than the Commonwealth Department, but if we were silly enough to hand over to them the collection of taxation, there would be a great collision of regulations and no uniformity. ""We suffer through having Bills put before the House in a form in which they cannot be understood. Many of the statements made during the Committee consideration of this Bill were a surprise to me. The Minister for Home and Territories I (Mr Glynn) is learned in the law, a great worker, and a man whom we all respect; but I - do not think that he thoroughly understands the Bill. He has had to consult ""constantly an official placed behind your chair, Mr Speaker. Why cannot we march with the times and have the necessary officials placed alongside their Ministers at the table, or adopt the American system of referring Bills to Committee for information? No one can say that he is thoroughly au fait with this measure. We must remember that those whom we are taxing have to work very hard for their money.

He is one of the ablest public servants that we have, and independent. So, too, are many of his responsible officers. They will do their duty, and they should have power to give consideration where it is needed. There are many hard cases in which a strong man should have the Tightf to show consideration. I hope that the Treasurer, when dealing with financial matters, will tell us that the duplication of functions by Commonwealth and State Departments is to be brought to an end. For two or three years past, Lord Forrest, replying to questions asked by me, has said that the duplication connected with electoral rolls and electoral printing generally will be stopped, but, although, the Postmaster-General economizes by sending us telegrams on such small scraps of paper without envelopes that it is almost impossible to read them, I and other members get nearly cwt. of useless printed matter every week. members can only protest against this extravagance; it is for Ministers to act.

It would be far better to increase the inconie tax, and so to deal equitably with every taxpayer. I do not wish to labour this question, but I warn the Government that unless Private they wake up something w i l j happen. The people are complaining that We are not legislating as we ought to do. This Bill is supposed to make our income tax law clearer and more explicit, but it seems to me that the only man who understands it is the Commissioner - All taxation measures should be so brought forward that every honourable member oan readily grasp their effect. So far as this Bill is concerned, we do not know what we are doing, and our income tax legislation generally is a perfect maze. I strongly object to this or any 'other tax being made retrospective. Such a principle is most dangerous. People may be called upon to pay taxation in respect of incomes earned two or .three years ago, and which they have in the meantime expended. The tendency of bath menand companies, when making good incomes, is to spend those incomes.. It is only the fortunate few that can live within their the incomes, and I certainly object to any of our legislation being made retrospective. I invite honourable members to take their bearings, so that when the Treasurer comes down with his financial statement we shall know exactly where we are. When things are prosperous, as they are today, and have been since the war began, we ought to be paying off more than we are doing, if the people are not to be ground down to the very dust. I have only to say, in conclusion, that the provisions of this Bill should have been more clearly explained to the House. In the old days, Ministers used to be primed up with in formation in respect of any measure they were introducing, and I hope that in the near future the officer who will have to administer any Bill that is before the House, and who, therefore, thoroughly understands it , will be allowed to sit beside the Minister introducing The quesi t , ' and so enable him to answer any inquiry in regard to it .

That matter meahas not been entirely overlooked'. On at I least half-a-dqzen different occasions, I have drawn attention to it in this House, have mentioned' that in America we In 1912 or 1913, a conference took place at - Buffalo between the representatives of the States and Congress, and the lines upon which uniformit y in respect of quite a number of matters could be secured were laid down. ' On a previous occasion, I mentioned there were, at least, three different matters in respect, of which it was suggested that uniformity, could be and. a saving effected as between the States and the Federal Government. out The Commonwealth, on the whole, has led the way in regard to uniform methods In the election manifesto of the Cook-Deakin Government unia formity was suggested, and, as a matter of fact, the Commonwealth is prepared to comgo . further in that ' direction than the the States appear to be. We desire not only uniformity of returns, but uniformity of administration. We ought not to forget that by failing to have some uniformity r in respect of rates of taxation we are it marring the economic effect of our progressive rates. A man is taxed under the Commonwealth legislation according one theory of progression, and under y .a State law he has to pay according to o r quite another theory. Although he is paying taxation in respect of the same income, the policy expressed in the State Act may completely neutralize the economic efforts of the Federal Act.",43
206,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,There is no great difficulty for adjustment.,44
207,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"There is the difficulty of securing unanimity as between the several Governments, but the larger tions of uniformity have not been overDampier looked by Federal Governments or by Ministry at present in office. This Bill has received the attention Ministers, although some honourable memnot bers may assume that it has not. I went through the original draft with Mr able, Ewing, Commissioner of Taxation, many months ago, and it has been drawn as nearly as possible upon lines which will enable the States to adopt uniform methods. Some questions which do not direotly touch this point were raised the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory). As to the taxation of comthe panies, it was pointed out at the last ference of Premiers that uniformity desirable, but not really necessary. believe it is now understood by the presentatives of the States that they can, if they wish, agree to uniformity on the lines of this Bill, without rendering sary any alteration of the Commonwealth law in regard to the taxation of commethod. panies. The honourable member suggested that we should adopt the State principle of taxing the profits of companies matter at their source. All the - States have adopted that principle, but I do not think a single State allows a rebate to the payer. The majority, at all events, do not. They tax a company, and leave incidence of the rate to affect differently the various taxpayers, so that the smaller a man's income may be the greater inequality of the method adopted by the States would be. We could get over the difficulty by adopting the English ciple of taxing dividends at their source. Shareholders in English companies are better off, as a rule, than the average shareholders of an Australian company may be said to be, and the companies the main source of the wealth or the able capacity of the nation at large. result is that the principle of taxing come at its source can be adopted, because they are dealing with men with larger comes than are to be found in Australia, and who, therefore, have a greater inclinalay tion to ask for a rebate. What is the result of the English system? A very large Refund Department has had to be established, really duplicating administration, and instead of simplicity being brought about, more confusion and expense are occasioned than is the case with our system of taxing the shareholders questhemselves. The honourable member for (Mr Gregory) has referred to the the fact that possibly leakages would , take place, and he quoted an instance of of where shares could be actually sold but transferred. If a man does not see that his shares are transferred he is taxbeing liable as the registered share, holder. There is no difficulty in dealing with the taxation of shareholders. Every .year a return of dividends paid is prepared by each company and forwarded to the Commissioner of Taxation, and he by compares it with the amount of the company's total income, and after deducting one from the other assesses the balance Conas the taxable income of the company at was the flat rate. He can also compare the I company's dividend list with the indiviredual returns furnished by the shareholders who have received the dividends, and see if they have included those divinecesdends. I have asked the Commissioner to give his opinio* in regard to thiB I believe that our system is as efficacious, as is the English system in the of getting all we should get; it is certainly as economical, and it is the fairest method that we could possibly taxadopt. Therefore, there is no justification for the strong condemnation we have the heard in regard to it today. The matter of uniformity was discussed at the last Premiers' Conference and at the the subsequent meeting of taxation officers, and it was seen that it was not . necessary to adopt the principle followed prinby the States in Order to bring about uniformity of assessments. That is one step towards that uniformity which we all desire. I admit that great savings will be effected by having uniformity. The are Commissioner has told me that about tax800,000 returns would be affected. A The good many people have their returns preinpared by agents, and if the average agent's charge for the preparation of an income intax return is put down at 30s. to each taxpayer, it will be seen what a large outwould be saved if we could only have one return instead of two or three. Treasurer has already referred to the ministrative saving that could be effected. I am pointing out the saving that the payer would effect in the matter of paying agents for preparing returns. would also be an immense saving of time and worry on the part of the taxpayer.",44

211,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,The general trend of the feeling at the Conventions was that this form of taxation should regarded only as an auxiliary power for the Commonwealth.,45
212,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Whateve r may be said about the land tax, we are driven into the position of saying that an income as a means of raising revenue Commonwealth will have some degree of permanency. Of course, no Parliament can bind any future Parliament in rethat gard to the form of taxation which be adopted, and it is idle for any one to declare the duration proposed to be assigned to any particular measure; but there is about this income taxation gree of permanency sufficient to justify the States and the Commonwealth adoptwith ing uniform returns. The opportunity to do so is afforded by this Bill. Even Germany set us an example in this rebut spect in about 1911, a uniform system of direct taxation in connection with the tax having been adopted for what we would call the German States and the Central Power. Honourable members have asked that printed information should be circulated so that some of the provisions of the Bill might be made more lucid to them. It is siderable a technical measure, and its provisions somewhat dimcult to follow.

Had I been here yesterday, I would have voted with those who were seeking to obtain greater uniformity. However, it is not yet too late. I am in saying this by the attitude taken up by the Treasurer - at the PreConference held in Sydney the other day, particularly when he suggested that the Taxation Commissioners of the various States should meet again and endeavour to suggest some method by which all taxation machinery could be drawn into a closer line of uniformity. I hope be that something practicable will come out of his suggestion; but, judging from what I know of the temper of the different States, I do not think there will be any probability of an agreement being arrived tax at to allow the Federal authorities to for the collect the income tax.",45
214,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,May not the reason be we are continually saying that we should should abolish State Parliaments?,45
215,Mr EICHARD FOSTEE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I do not know; but we' must, as a Parliament, insist on uniformity in every possible direca detion, and we must avoid unnecessary overlapping of machinery in connection every form of government. I have no sympathy with those who would seek to weaken the authority of the States; I believe the time is coming when ne' cessity, which knows no law, will enforce land rigid economies in many directions, in which no attempt is made to economize now. This is a machinery Bill whidh does not impose new taxation, yet I think I am quite within the Standing Orders when I suggest that the time is not very far distant when there will need to be a conincrease in contributions are through the income tax in order to meet be the almost daily increasing commitments this Parliament. Those increased contributions will form an intolerable burden on the people if we do not insist, as we have never attempted to insist, on necessary and reasonable economy. I would start with this Parliament, and go right through it from A to Z, and not only with this Parliament, but with every State Parliament. Casting stones at one another is useless; we have all-been sinners in this regard for a long time, and it is quite time that the Federal Parliament set an example and made a commencement of practising economy. On the civil side, we should not undertake anything except that which is necessary. ""We will have untold millions to provide for before very long unless we put an end - to a great deal of the excessive expenditure that we encounter in connection with the construction of public works in. Australia. We have taken in hand works which are not iinmediately necessary, but we should put an end to that sort of thing. We have been multiplying departments and increasing the number of public servants in every direction; and always the burden is put on the rank and - file of the people. Mr FrsfLAYSON - Whil e we import highly paid experts!",45
216,Mr EICHARD FOSTEE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"On that question, I cannot agree with my honourable friend. It is possible, at times, to import highly paid experts with great benefit to the country, and especially with benefit to the rank and file of the workers, if only we can get men of the right type. I desire to emphasize the note of warning given so vigorously by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman). If the Government do not travel energetically in the direction of proper, reasonable, and necessary economy, this side of the House will have to compel them to do so.",46
217,Mr WEST,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"East Sydney) [5.20J It must be admitted that the Bill is a very necessary one, its main object being to provide machinery so that the Commissioner may know really what, and how, to collect, and the public may know exactly what they have to.pay in income tax, and why they have to pay it. The conference of taxation officers was in a rather peculiar position, inasmuch as it had no directions or power to do anything; and, under the circumstances, I think they brought their common sense and business ability to bear with good effect. Practically, we have in this Bill the results' of that conference; and this is one of those matters in which. I am content to be guided b> expert officers, by whom I am afforded information unobtainable elsewhere. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) speaks in a depreciatory tone of the Commonwealth Parliament, and complains, amongst other things, of an increase in Commonwealth officials and in parliamentary expenditure. Personally, as a member of this Parliament for some years, I am quite satisfied with the work that has been done here. Whoever may write up the history of this Parliament, especially during the war period, can relate nothing of which honourable members, who are now taking part in the business <fcf the country need feel ashamed. To ine it is amazing that we have got so successfully through our difficulties up to the present; and I am satisfied that much of that success is owing to the useful groundwork provided in the legislation passed by the Labour Governments between 1910 and 1913. There is - doubtless a very trying time ahead of Australia, and much of the work we shall have to do will prove displeasing, but it is work that has to be faced, and the Bill may prove of some assistance. At the same time, I must say that the people of Australia take things more easily than the people of almost any other country on earth. At the present moment there is sitting a Premiers' Conference, which. even seeks to dictate to the National Parliament; but I fancy that if the people have an opportunity, and if the war dir'. not overshadow all else, short work woiild be made of the State Parliaments and their sovereign rights. In my. opinion it - is only due to the war that they have been permitted to exist so long; aud they present a question that the 'Commonwealth Parliament will have to take into serious consideration, no matter how the susceptibilities of the State legislators may be hurt. The Commonwealth Parliament should rise to the occasion, as I feel sure the people expect us to do, and remove these anomalous fourteen Houses of Parliament with their duplicate powers of taxation. Honourable members like the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) may talk somewhat slightingly of the work of the National P a r l i a r ment, hut, after all, I believe the people are more satisfied with our efforts than with those of any other Parliament in Australia. Until such honourable members show that they desire to do none other than real national work, they should dis"" continue to asperse those who are endeavouring to raise this Parliament to and maintain it in the position it ought to occupy in the public estimation.

218,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Capricornia) [5.30] This at any other time would be a very important measure. At present I do not think we can attach the importance to it that its position on the notice-paper would appear to indicate. Some time ago I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) whether there was any arrangement between himself and the Government whereby important legislation should not be introduced during his absence, and), judging by the character of the measures brought before us, I believe that there must be some arrangement of the kind. By way of illustration, I may say that a measure having for its object the scientific protection of Australian secondary indusbries would more fittingly be considered at the present time than can this Bill . I mentioned, in a recent speech which Seemed to cause honourable members some anger because it had reference to the war, that we were incurring very large liabilities, that at no distant date our war loan debt would amount to £300,000,000, and that honourable members were, apparently, not paying sufficient attention to the fact. When it is considered that under this Bill we shall require to put aside out of our revenue at least £1,500,000 every year in connection with a £300,000,000 loan debt, we are compelled to consider whether this is really a proper time to introduce a Sinking Fund Bill . In 1916, when I had the honour to be Treasurer of the Commonwealth, I endeavoured to ascertain what amount was set apart by the Imperial Government as a sinking f u n d to repay war loans. On the 11th A p r i l in that year I sent the following cable to the Official Secretary of the Commonwealth: Please ascertain what is the amount set apart by the Imperial Government as a 'Sinking fund to repay war loans. On the 14th Apri l I received the following reply from the Official Secretary: With reference to your telegram of 11th April, Treasury state details of sinking funds will probably not be settled till after the war. Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in Budget speech that, reckoning interest at 5 per cent., sinking fund 1 per ceut. basis, thirty-seven years have to meet new charge at interest and sinking fund amounting to £79,000,000. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the question of a sinking f u n d would probably not be settled until after the war, and the question is, whether we are not .now taking up time which might be better devoted to-other measures, in discussing one which may have to be. amended at a future date. The Government have found it necessary for some reason already to foreshadow the repeal of one measure- I refer to the bachelor tax-and I would much prefer them to bring down the legislation which is extremely necessary at the present time, rather than that we should have discussions which will have to be repeated at a very early date.",47
219,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Does that not apply to 90 per cent of the legislation ? 1,47
220,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"No , it does not. I admit that we do amend our legislation from time to time; but when the British Government is of opinion that it would be better to wait u n t i l after the war to settle the question of how much shall be set apart for sinking f u n d , we ought, perhaps, to follow - their example.",47
221,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Where is the comparison ?,47
222,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I am not introducing a comparison to the disadvantage of the British Government, but merely endeavouring to show that, if the British Government think such a course advisable, it might be even more advisable in our own case.",47
223,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"It is impossible for the Imperial Government to deal with the matter now, but it is not impossible for us.",47
224,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"At a very early date we shall have to find £10,000,000 more of revenue than we require at the present time. We are now raising about £35,000,000, and we shall require to raise afc least £45,000,000. A r e we in a posior tion today to say how much of that retinental venue we are able to put aside as a sinkare ing fund for the redemption of our debts? I do not think we are. Government have introduced this measure, and although I have heard honormend a sinking fund? able members in the past ridicule a sinking f u n d , I am of opinion that such a f u n d , if provided strictly out of revenue, is a good thing, and will impress upon ney, saidthe Treasurer the necessity'for economy. It will act as a sort of flood warning, reminder of the amount of money that debt will be required to meet our obligations, unless Parliament is prepared to adopt a whole."" spendthrift policy, and pass on to future generations the obligations that we ought to meet from time to time, as far as possibly can.

The Commissioners took evidence f r several financial authorities in Australia, and they reported that the utility of a sinking f u n d for a borrowing country useful for the following purposes: (o) To retard the growth of debt.

Clause 6 of the Loans Sinking Fund Bill empowers the Treasurer to invest any moneys standing at the credit of the Sinking Fund in the purchase of any securities of or guaranteed by the Government of the United Kingdom, the Comevimonwealth, or any State, and to sell such used securities at any time. That provision is seems to be inconsistent with clause 5, our which says that no repurchased or redeemed securities shall be re-issued.

227,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,There is in England a body called the National Debt Commissioners.,49
228,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"We might give to the body I am proposing a similar name, but I would give it something more to do than the management of the public debt. should like the Board to be associated with the Commonwealth Bank. The present Governor of the Bank, Mr Denison Miller, is an extremely able man, and has done extraordinarily good work for the Commonwealth in the establishment of an institution which already has ramifications throughout the world ; b ut it is possible that some future occupant of that position may not be as capable. I suggest that we should have twoor three men, not to control the Governor, b ut to act as his advisers-h e having the casting vote-and also to manage the sinking fund in conjunction with the Treasurer. Make the test of efficiency for such advisers as high as you choose, but also make the salaries commensurately high. If such a body'were created, I would propose that the moneys to the credit of the Loan Sinking F u n d might be invested in other ways than in the repurchase of Government securities. On this point, I believe I am treading new ground, and likely to find myself in opposition to a great many honourable members, who will doubt the wisdom of investing Government moneys in the way I propose. Political economists are groping about from time to time for some method of removing the grave discrepancies in society. There is an enormous gulf between the rich'and the poor, and to bridge it men advocate the nationalization of monopolies, because those monopolies make huge profits, and it is hoped that by nationalization they will prevent the public being exploited, and secure a better distribution of wealth. We hear of other schemes, such as profit-sharing, the payment of bonuses to workmen, and so for t h . It would to some extent relieve the tension if we could get men able, caref u l , and honest enough to do the work that I think should be undertaken. I believe that they, are to be got; I should be sorry to think they could not be got. I suggest that, instead of investing in our own securities, we should invest in bank shares, for example. The Bank of Australasia has a paid-up capital of £2,000,000, and its reserves aud undivided profits amount to £2,997,868. It s shares, which are paid up to £40, are quoted at £114 10s. buyers, and £116 sellers, and sales give a return of £ 5 17s. 6d. per annum.",49
229,Mr WEST,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,They carry a second liaI bility.,49
230,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"That is true. The bank has been so long established, and the people have such confidence in it , that they are willing to buy its shares at a price which gives them a smaller return than they could get from other investments. In my opinion, it would be safe to invest the Government money in such an institution. Then there is the Bank of New South Wales, with a capital of £3,904,860, and reserves and undivided profits amounting to £2,994,187. Its shares have the nominal value of £20, and at present prices are £36 buyers, and £36 2s. 6d. sellers, the return to investors being £5 7s. 6d. per cent. It must not be. forgotten that the investors in this bank from time to time get the right to buy new shares at their nominal value. A shareholder may thus acquire for £20 a new share which on the market is worth from £35 to £36, getting a substantial bonus, and in this way increasing his rate of interest. I dare say that some of the investors in the bank get a return of 10 per cent, on their money. Another bank that I might name is the Union Bank, with a paid-up capital of £2,000,000, and reserves amounting to £2,073,503. I ts shares have a nominal value of £25, and are quoted at buyers £55 12s., sellers £56, the return to the in vestor being £ 6 5s. per centum. There are several sound shipping companies whose shares return £ 5 7s. 6d. and £ 5 12s. per centum, and two or three sound gas companies giving a return of over 5 per cent. Then some industrial companies give as much as £6 12s. 6d. and £7 per cent, to investors in their shares. I suggest the appointment of a board of directors to assist the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and to manage our sinking f u n d , and it should be empowered to invest in concerns such as I have mentioned. This would be more profitable to the taxpayers than the in vestment in Government securities, and would enable us to keep down our taxa-. tion.",49

Those who today are paying £20 i h income tax may next year have to pay £ 4 0 , and the following year £ 6 0 . What I suggest might relieve our taxpayers to some extent. I do not agree with K a r l Marx that all the various - industries will organize themselves into huge monopolies which will then be taken over by the State. I am inclined to think that that will not happen. The State, however, could invest its money as I have suggested, and, if necessary, take over any particular concern.

Although I should have preferred a different measure, I am prepared to vote for the Bill .",50
237,Mr WEST,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"East Sydney) [6.1] - The state of the House makes it plain that honourable members pay little heed to questions of finance. Unfortunately, the public life of Australia has never attracted men who have devoted themselves chiefly to financial matters. Proper finance is the foundation upon which our prosperity rests; no nation can make progress unless its finances are on a proper footing. The last speaker drew attention to the fact that the British Government have not thought it necessary to introduce legislation of the kind under consideration. The reason for that is plain; the nation is still borrowing. It might well be asked, what is the use of setting aside money for the - redemption of loans while we are adding In my to our debt. The various States have done this without any good result. In New South Wales they established a sinking fund of \ per cent., and then, within five years, borrowed £30,000,000. They would have been better off had they had no sinking f u n d , but had borrowed less money. Probably, before the war is over we shall owe £300,000,000, and it would be better to reduce our borrowings by £1,500,000 than to put that amount into a sinking fund . The question of banking will be one of the most important after the war. We may despise the Germans, and feel enmity against them, but we cannot ignore the fact that their system of banking, by assisting industrial and manufacturing life, is the quintessence of prudence, and that Australia would benefit largely by imitating it . The powers of the Commonwealth Bank are not large enough, but the private'banks are not prevented from doing what the German banks have done. In Germany, if a manufacturer finds that he cannot dispose of hi3 goods without giving his customers three is months' credit, a bank will advance him ' sumcient to meet the obligations which hiscredit entails, and thus enable him to continue manufacturing. I feel sure we shall not be slow to adopt that system after the war. If I understand the Acting Prime Minister's proposals aright, it will be one of the means proposed to continue and expand our in dustrial power. I regret that so few honourable members are prepared to give any attention to the important question of finance.' If supporters of the Government are not ready to take an active interest in the finances of Australia, the Opposition, at least, will do so, and will endeavour to educate the people up to the view that Australia must avail herself of every opportunity for advancement after the war. I believe that at the close of the war we shall have a flood of immigration. Many people on the other side write to me of their interest in Australia, and of their desire to come here. The author of a book that has recently been published points out that the fact that this is a country in which a Labour Government has ruled, and will rule again, will act as an incentive to many of th& people of Canada and the United States to come here. A friend of mine writes ine that it is dimcult to forecast what will become of the women of England after, this world war is over. Some 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 of them, in following wartime occupations, have 'so developed themselves mentally and physically, that if they are called upon later on to return to their former employments, they will be greatly discontented. no doubt will come here. This Bill will not have any effect u n the war is over, since, as long as the war lasts, we shall go on borrowing. seems to 'be an absurd system of finance that permits of our placing £1,500,000 the credit of a sinking f u n d , while at the same time we .borrow £.10,000,000 or more. All the States have sinking funds, and for every 5s. they into them they borrow £ 5 0 0 .

I see no objection to the proposal to allow the banks-and this is one of the features of the Bill - to secure a lien over inscribed stock or war bonds, v which have been purchased as the. result of advances made by them to their clients to ""the extent of 90 per cent, of the value of such stocks. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) thinks the provision should be extended to firms who have advanced money to their employees Many of them for the purchase of war bonds; 'but with that point I am not much concerned.

Isi the first place, n the section 52a of the principal Act proStock certificates, stock certificates to bearer, scrip certificates ito bearer, Treasury bonds and coupons, and transfers to stock ior Treasury t bonds shall not be liable to stamp duty or other tax under any law of the Commonwealth or a State.

No doubt it was a wise precaution to take at the time of our first war loan issue, since there was considerable uncertainty as to whether the people of Australia would subscribe SECOND READING. locally tq such loans. But we have seen since that it is a great mistake, inasmuch as it, removes from the area of taxation an enormous amount of capital. Mr WEST"" - It favours the big companies.",51
242,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"It favours the rich as against the poor. In connection with the last war loan, the public were given the option of receiving 4£ per cent interest, free of taxation, or 5 per cent, terest, liable to taxation, and I dare say that, of the £42,000,000 raised, about £35,000,000 were subscribed at 4& per cent. That is' an illustration of the fact that this system of exempting interest on war loans from taxation is a splendid thing for the rich man. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) pointed out today, a man with an income of £7,000 per annum who invested in the war loan would get as much as 6 per cent, for his money. When I was assisting the honourable  time ago in his admirable amendment to make interest on war loans liable to taxation, the ""gag"" was applied to me by honourable members opposite. I would point out the unwisdom as well as the unfairness of ""gagging"" any honourable member who is endeavouring to persuade the House to keep on the right track. The "" gag"" was applied to me at the instance of Lord. Forrest. He moved, "" That the question' be now put."" At the time, I was showing honourable members what an advantage a rich man would have by investing in our war loans at 4-J per cent, interest free of tion.",52
243,Mr GROOM,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,But the honourable member did not propose any alteration when he was Treasurer.,52
244,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,No ; I give the honourable member all the advantage he can get out of that statement.,52

246,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I have no desire to into that phase of the matter. I admit that, when I was in the position of Treato surer, I did not propose to alter the prinyou ciple adopted with regard to war loans, but I am very glad to see that under this Bill the Government propose a provision by which they may make interest earned on war loans liable to taxation. However, I think that they might do it in a pro formd. more diplomatic way than the method which they propose to adopt. Why is it proposed to add to each prospectus the words, "" The loan is liable to income tax on the interest earned""!",52

248,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Would it not be sufficient to put a provision in this Bill that such interest is liable to taxation after the passing of the Act? To put on each prospectus for the new loan a notice that the interest' earned under it is liable to incomt, tax is very much on a par with the action of a man selling house property, who would say, "" This house is for sale, but I remind you that, in estimating the value of your proposed investment, you ought to make allowance for depreciation, repairs, and taxation."" If a man wishes to sell a house, he does not do that. He talks of the number of rooms in the house, and says how well it is built, and he speaks of the advantage of its beautiful eastern aspect, but he does not tell the prospective buyer that he should allow so much each year for depreciation, and that he must expect to pay taxes. If he should do so, the possibility would be that the would be buyer would still continue to pay rent. But that seems to me to be on a par with the unbusinesslike methods of the Government. I have already drawn attention to the fact that taxahonorable gentlemen opposite have all the brains and education of university men, especially those who have obtained the degrees of the profession to which the Minister in charge of the Bill belongs.",52

252,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Capricornia) [7.46] Tbis Bill, baving for its object the repurchase of war loan securities, is not, to my mind, the embodiment of financial wisdom. It proposes that the Treasurer may create a trust fund by taking a sum equal to one-eighth of 1 per cent. of° so much of the public debt of the Commonwealth as represents moneys received in respect of war loans from lenders other than the Government of the United Kingdom. That, of course, refers to money raised in Australia. This fund is to amount to £1,000,000, and so long as it does not go below £900,000 the Treasurer need not make those payments, but if it does go below £900,000, then he is to continue to take the one-eighth of 1 per cent, and replenish it. It will be seen that this trust fund has really no limit, because as soon as it gets below the sum stated the Treasurer may replenish it. The Treasurer, when introducing the Bill, said that it was to provide the Treasurer with means, not out of revenue, but out of wiar loans, for operating on the market for the repurchase of waT loan stock, to keep the market healthy-to take up, I think he said, "" the slack of the market."" Honourable members will observe from the Stock Exchange lists that our war loan securities in the case of inscribed stock fluctuate when sold, sometimes, as during April, bringing par value,, and at other times £9 9. Messrs. Goodall and Company, in their Stock Exchange circular, issued on the 4th May, covering a month, said that Commonwealth Bonds 1925 were- buyers, £4 10s. 6d., and sellers, £4 l i and sales, £99 7s. 6d. Throughout the whole period since the issue of our war loans there has been fluctuation, but the only serious discount was when the Government announced that they proposed to make a levy on wealth. The stock then fell considerably, but, after the Government let it be known that ""such was not their intention, the price went up, until now, as a rule, a [174] man may obtain for inscribed stock or bonds, about £99 12s. 6d. Now a Bill is introduced whereby the Treasurer may go on the market and purchase stock up to par value.  English practice.",53
253,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"So I believe; and it would appear to be the practice of the Commonwealth Government, whenever a Bill is introduced in the British House of - Commons, to get a copy of that Bill and submit it to this House. I do not approve of the Bill before us, because I deem it unnecessary; indeed, I think it may turn out an incentive to people to sell their war loan stock. There is already a provision that persons in trouble with regard to war loan money, especially those who have taken up bonds on the time-payment system, may go to the Commonwealth Bank, have the bonds taken off their hands, and be repaid t'.e amount already contributed. As I say, I am afraid this Bill will encourage trafficking in war loans. If a man desires to sell his war loan inscribed stock or bonds, why should he not lose the discount? He ought to the prepared to lose; aud, certainly, if , at the present time, a person wishes to sell a house or any other property, he does not, in most cases, expect to get the same value as before the war. Why should we create a fund which will have the effect of inducing people who have taken up war loan stock to put it on the market, sell it, and invest the proceeds in the new loans we raise from time to time? The effect of this Bill will be to bring the stock up to par; but war loan stock carries 4 i per cent., and is not subject to income taxation; and I ask whether that does not represent a good enough investment without our raising loan moneys s . 9d., for the purpose of repurchasing and keeping the stock up to par value. The financial members of the House who deal in war-loan stock, and the financial public generally, know very well how much they earn by investing in new war loans. Some time ago, when I was Treasurer, and there was some question as to the soundness of-our war-loan stock, with a depreciation in value on the market, a friend- a high authority-writin g to me on the.subject, saidWith reference to your letter of the 3rd inst., there is a point in connection with the issue of the war stock that is sometimes overlooked. I refer to the fact that the subscriptions to the loan are made in instalments, the last of which (30 per cent.) is payable on 15th November, while a full half-year's interest is payable on 15th December. The outcome of this is that an investment in the new loan may, from one point of view, be considered as bearing interest at a rate of 11 per cent, per annum .(11.08 per cent.) for the period up to the 15th December, 1916, aud of i i per cent, thereafter until redemption - On the other hand, a purchaser at par on the Stock Exchange of stock or debentures on which the initial half-yearly interest payment has already been made, will be obtaining an investment at a rate of 4* per cent, only throughout. The slight discount at which the War Loan is quoted on the Stock Exchange is, consequently, not an indication of depreciation in the value of the Commonwealth securities, but a result which naturally follows from the initial accrued interest bonus having ceased to operate in stock on which the first interest payment has been made. On account of this fact, a subscription to the new issue at par is a better investment over all than the purchase of existing stock would be at a discount of even 25s. The interest that would be actually earned by 15th December on the instalments paid in up to and including that paid on 15th November is 18s. 3d. if interest is reckoned at 4* per cent, per annum. The investor in the new issue consequently gets interest at 4J per cent, over the whole term of his loan, and, in addition, a bonus of £1 6s. 9d. per cent., payable on 15th December, 1916. In other words, the War Loan issue is practically equivalent to an i ue at £98 13s. 3d., without any accrued interest bonus. The interest earned during the first six months on our war loans is about 11 per cent., but if we take the interest for a year-and I now. speak of the loan posimarket. tion at the time. I was in office-the instalments of subscriptions of £100 and under from the 1st August, 1916, meant that the investor earned £6 8s. 3d. per cent, per annum. We extended the loan for a month, and the interest earned on the five instalments from the 1st Septemment at-par. ber, 1916, was £7 5s. 7d.; on the ten instalments from the 1st August, 1916, £9 2s.; and on the ten instalments the 1st September, 1916, £10 18s. lOd. below par. per cent. In the case of subscriptions over £100, the five instalments from 1st August, 1916, earned £6 8s. 3d. per cent., traffic in warloan stock. with no deduction; the five instalments from 1st September, 1916, £6 13s. per cent., with 7s. 6d. deducted; the ten Mr Higgs. instalments from 1st August, 1916, £ 7 4s. 3d. per cent., with 18s. Sd. deducted.; and on the ten instalments from 1st September, 1916, £ 7 15s. 3d. per cent., with. £1 6s. 2'd. deducted. My point is that when the investor pays in his deposits from , say, the 1st August, and so on to the December, he spreads his payment of £100 throughout a period of only about at h i r d of twelve months, he earns no less a sum than £6 8s. 3d. per cent, for the first year. It will pay any investor to take up war loan stock, hold it for six months in order to receive the interest at 4£ per cent - whic h will mean, in some cases, 9 per cent., 10 per cent., and 11 per cent - and then sell. The Commonwealth Government, through the Trust Fund, will be a buyer in the open market.",53
254,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,At what price?,54
255,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"At par, perhaps. Mr RICHAB D FOSTEB - No ; at such price as the Treasurer determines.",54
256,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,The Treasurer is empowered to buy the stock at a price not exceeding par. Honourable members opposite seem to regard as ridiculous the idea that the Treasurer may buy at par.,54

If the stock ever fell as low as £98, it was when the Government forecast a levy on wealth - Ap. honourable member interjects that today's prices will not be maintained for ever. In my opinion, shortly after the war is ended, this stock will be at a premium, because of the freedom from tax conditions attached to it . For a period after the war there will be a boom, but in the course of a year or two a depression will set in, and people will find that they cannot get the same return on industrial investments as they are getting today. The moment money becomes cheap war loan stock will be at a premium.",55

As to when money will become cheap will depend on when the depression sets in, and when the Government cease borrowing money and causing a fictitious prosperity. As showing the value of this 4 | per cent, war loan stock, free of income taxation, honourable members will find that, of the £42,000,000 borrowed recently, only about [174]- 2 £7,000,000 was taken up at 5 per cent., the balance of £35,000,000 being taken up at 4 j per cent, free of income taxation. I think that this Bill will provide an incentive to people to sell their war loan stock.",55
272,Mr LIVINGSTON,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"If the honourable member thinks that this stock is a good thing, why should people sell it?",55
273,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"They will sell it and take up new war loan stock when they can get 9 per cent, to 11 per cent, for the half-year.",55
274,Sir ROBERT BEST,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Is that the honourable member's idea of finance?,55
275,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Suppos e the Treasurer is buying stock at £99 12s. 6d., it will pay a man who has bought up war loan stock, and kept it for six months in order to get the half-year's interest, to sell it to the Government, aud take up fresh stock, because the Government are floating a loan every six months.",55
276,Mr BOYD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"It would not pay him; he would have to give i per cent, to the broker.",55
277,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Eve n so, he would lose only 12s. 6d.",55
278,Mr BOYD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"He would only sell after receiving his first half-year's interest, and the moment that interest had been paid the price on the exchange would fall by almost the equivalent of the interest paid.",55
279,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"That may be the case now; but when this Bill is passed, and the Treasurer has a fund of £1,000,000 for investment, and he is resolved to - keep the war loan stock at par, there will I>e an inducement to investors to sell their v stock. Why should a man sell his war loan stock?",55
280,Mr LIVINGSTON,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,He may need the money.,55
281,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"If a man has invested £100 in the war loan, should he not be is prepared to pay any discount he may have to suffer if he sells? I say he should. If he desires to sell, he ought to think himself lucky if he gets £99. A person who sells a house or other property that was worth £1,000 before the war does not expect to get that price for it now. He is lucky if he receives £900.",55
282,Mr BOYD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,All property values are up.,55
283,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"A man who is prepared to bide his time may probably get the full value of a house, but if he is in the same position as a man who is compelled to sell his war loan stock, he must accept a great deal less. We ought not to offer inducements to anybody to sell war-loan stock. Let me quote the opinion of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who, in his review of the last war loan, had something to say about the priceless lesson of t h r if t . I should like to add my word of warning to the general public, that in these times of fictitious prosperity, brought about by the expenditure of war loan* moneys of great magnitude, everybody who can save money ought to do so. At the present time a great deal of money is being spent foolishly. The other day a witness, giving evidence before a Commission, said that in his opinion the ladies had money to burn, and he was going to help them. He told the Commission that there were some who, if offered boots at 25s - per pair, would decline them, and that the retailers, if they wanted to sell such boots, would have to charge £ 2 10s. a pair for them. But we must make allowance for this foolishness. There are in Australia a number of poor women who never before the war were able to spend a pound recklessly, and now, having money to spend, they do not see why they should not spend it .",55
284,Mr LIVINGSTON,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,The ladies are ways careful of their money.,56
285,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The honourable gentleman against comes of a race which is noted for economy. He probably knows a song, danger zone? the burden of which is "" the best friend in the world is the shilling or t w a . "" He will agree with me that much money is credit. now being spent foolishly, and that the more the saving on clothes and amusemark to make. ments the less the misery that will fall on the community when the war is over and the depression comes. after speaking of this "" priceless t h r if t , "" saidAnother point I desire to stress is that - man is not a patriot who buys bonds and .sells them as soon as he can. The actual - c-liase of a bond means nothing. it that helps. People must not only save, in - order to be patriotic, but they must invest. People who buy bonds must realise that tralia can benefit only if they hold them long as they possibly can. The man who buys a bond, and holds it in spite of temptation to - sell, and has to practise rigorous economy self-denial to retain it , is as truly a today as if he wore the King's uniform. ^.Che Bill offers an incentive to the selling so to speak. - of bonds. At the present time wishing to sell bonds can get only 12s. 6d. for them, and has to pay a brokerage of 10s., and lose a certain amount of accrued interest. But the Treasurer wishes to be able to assure the public par value for their bonds. I object to that. If the Treasurer wishes to maintain the credit of the Commonwealth, he should refrain from making remarks such as that to which he gave expression the other day in regard to a lecture by Professor Meredith Atkinson on the note issue. The professor said that in his opinion we are approaching the danger zone in connection with the note issue, to which the Treasurer replied thatThe Government had expressed its disapprobation of such views and methods. If this expression were not sufficient, the Government would have to take what measures it thought prudent and necessary to protect Australia's interests, in order to relieve the mind of the public creditor and assure the stability of our currency.",56

293,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The fact that opinions Aushave been uttered by a university proas fessor is not a reason why they should be disregarded, rather is it a reason why and we should pay attention to them.

Jn my opinion, it is more likely to do harm to the credit of the Commonwealth and the stability of the note issue to suppress the criticism of a professor who has made a study of political economy, than to allow the freest expression of opinion. If criticism is suppressed, the public will be likely to think there is something wrong with the finances, and there may be danger of panic. I do not think that there is such danger , though some persons fear it. 1",56

295,Mr SPEAKER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"It has no bearing on the note issue. Mr HIGGiS - I repeat that we ought not to offer an inducement for the selling of stock. Some hold that we ought to try to keep our stock up to par value, so that people may be encouraged to invest in it. That, no doubt, is the opinion of honourable members opposite. They argue that if the stock is saleable on the market at £99 12s. 6d., the public will not subscribe to new issues. In my opinion, the Government should not go to the public cap in hand; they ought to tell the public who have money to invest that it is their business to take up the Commonwealth war loans.",57

300,Mr SPEAKER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Then the honourable member would be wise to confine himself strictly to the Bill. Mr HIGGS* -'What I wish to point out is that the Bill has been introduced to induce the public to subscribe to war loans. The Treasurer has said that if war-loan stock "" sags "" in the market, if it is only saleable at a discount, the public may not readily subscribe to new loan issues. My reply is that, inasmuch as we have put certain question's to eligible young men regarding their willingness to recruit, we should, instead of making inducements for subscribing to war loans, put similar questions to the moneyed men of the community. We should say to themHave you lent any money to the Commonwealth to carry on the war? If not, why not? What is the amount of your total assets ini excess of your liabilities? . How much money have you invested in the Australian war loans? "" I think that those questions should be put to every pe^on iolding a certain amount of property, say, to every one possessing more than £1,000.",57

302,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"This Bill will afford those who wish to traffic in the war loans"" an opportunity to make money. The honordo able member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) asked just now, "" Supposing a man had already invested his money, what would the position ?"" If a man had invested his money in any industrial enterprise, or in the purchase of a house, and desired reto help in the war loan, I imagine that the he would go at once to his bankers with his scrip or his deeds, and say, "" Here is a security worth £200, on which I ask you the to advance me £100 to invest in the war",57

304,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Undoubtedly . The honourable member for Wide Bay knows very well that a man could readily obtain an to advance on.the security of his scrip, or deeds of his property. I sincerely oppose this Bill; I think it is a mistake, and that it is unnecessary, and even dangerous. Mr JOWETT. (Grampians) [8.32] The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has done a service, not only to the House, but to the people of Australia, by directing attention to a most important issue which is involved in this Bill. That issue is as to whether it is worthwhile for us in this great war to take any steps to maintain the credit of the country. My honourable friend has held office as Treasurer, and he must feel satisfied that no Treasurer would exercise the powers conferred on him under this Bill unless he felt that in doing so he would have the whole community behind him. If the Treasurer, acting on advice, should consider it necessary, in order to maintain the credit of' Australia, to purcha'se a limited amount of war loan stock at a price not .exceeding par, he will have power, uuder this Bill, to do so. My honourable friend has put with great force the point that, while these loans, allowing for accumulated interest and terms, are floated practically below par, the Treasurer will have the right to redeem them at not exceeding par. In speaking of "" p a r "" as he frequently did, he ap-. parently had in mind "" nominal par.""",57
305,Mr BOYD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"What is the difference between par and nominal par? Mr JOWETT,-No one knows better than does my honourable friend that, for all practical purposes, when one goes on the Stock Exchange to buy inscribed stock, there is no such thing as par except immediately after the interest on that stock has been paid. We must have regard to the question of accumulated interest. Therefore, while the term "" par "" may be used, w'e must always bear in(mind the distinction between par-the giving of £100 for a stock on which no interest is due at all, and the giving of £100 for a stock with, perhaps, half-ayear's accumulated interest. The point which the honourable member for Capricornia seemed to press home was that, while these loans had been floated at less than par, the Treasurer might be disposed to buy them back at par or almost par. In other words, the inference which I drew from his remarks was that he thought the Treasurer of the day, without any sufficient reason, might purchase from those who subscribed to the loan of a' few weeks ago stock at such a price as would enable them to make a profit out of the transaction. I am perfectly satisfied that there is no such intention on the part of. the Government.",58
306,Mr CORSER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,The very object of the Bill is absolutely opposed to anything of the kind.,58
307,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Undoubtedly . I am confident that any Treasurer who purchased these stocks at a price which would give a profit to the man who had taken them up would become involved in such a scandal that the Government of whioh he was a member would not remain in power for twenty-four hours. Such an . action could not be contemplated for one moment by any Treasurer. I would remind the honourable member for Capricornia of a period in the history of Great Britain which was perhaps almost as critical as the present. I refer to that day in 1797 when, during the great war between England and France, the mutiny of the Nore broke out, and Consols fell to £48. Supposing the Government of England of that day had found it necessary to float another loan-as we may. have to do a few months hence in order that we may continue to play our part in this great war- a few weeks after that : mutiny, when Consols had fallen to £48, what prospect of success would it have  can well imagine that he would, have been glad to avail himself of such a measure as this in order that he might go into the market before Consols fell to £48, and so maintain the financial credit of the country. That is the sole object of this Bill, and there is not the slightest doubt that no Treasurer ""would remain in office fortyeight hours after he had attempted to use, or had even thought of using, this Bill in the way which it seemed to me my honourable friend, Mr Higgs, implied a Treasurer might do.",58
308,Mr WEST,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"East Sydney) [8.41] It is a healthy sign when measures of this kind are criticised in Parliament,, since it is only by a discussion of them that we 1 can arrive at their true object, and elicit the intentions of the Government in regard to them. I have never .been a pessimist in respect of the finances of this country. On the contrary, I have always endeavoured to encourage optimism, believing it to be essential to' the maintenance of our financial equilibrium. My War Loan Securities [16 MAV, 1918.1 ] honourable friend, Mr Higgs, and I not agree as to the probable effect of Bill. I regard it as a measure to mainmay tain the buoyancy of the national debt. It is essential that the public mind be satisfied as to the stability of the rise and refute his statements. national debt. And, by the way, a national debt is no disgrace to any try. England has always had one, and gests her statesmen have never thought it of sufficient importance to try to abolish it. I viewed with favour the first proposal float a war loan in Australia. When we have to float loans, I believe it is a good thing that they should, if possible, be raised Avithin Australia. I did not cipate that our first local war loan would prove the success that it was. I was very friendly with Mr Fisher, who surer at the time, and I know that his mind was greatly agitated as to what would be the effect of the experiment. He feared that we should not be able raise in Australia the. £20,000,000 for which he asked, and no man was more pleased than he was at the success of that loan. I may be wrong, but I understand the meaning of the Bill to be this: that war loan scrip shall not be disposed of other than at what might be put down its face value. War bonds are held by the people of Australia, by friendly societies, and persons like myself, who have put as much into the loans as they can afford, because they regard it as their duty to do so. Once Australia's national debt has a severe slump, it will have material effect, on the progress and prosvestment? perity of the country. Because we have such a measure as this in the statuteour book, the Treasurer will not go down street, Sydney, or Bourke-street, Melsoundness bourne, waving a flag and asking people to bring along their war bonds because will buy them. The object of the Bill is to provide that, if some unfortunate citination zen who holds bonds is compelled, through force of circumstances, to dispose of them, he will not suffer by reasonCof that,, in the hour of the country's need, he was prepared to put his money into war bonds. I did not follow too closely all that was said by the honourable memhe ber for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). With a great amount of ability, he endeavoured to convince the House that some persons were going to make 11.. per cent, if this Bill was passed. I could not see' eye Repurchase Bill. 4795 do eye with him. I think that he allowed this his imagination to run riot. His motive have been a good one. He may have been endeavouring to ascertain whether should honourable members had the ability to Occasionally, it is necessary to follow that line counof action. The honourable member sugthat after a first instalment is paid on a bond, the holder may propose to sell it to the Treasurer; but the Bill will make to no provision for the repurchase of bonds until persons offering them have the bonds to deal with; therefore, the allusion of the honourable member to 11 per cent, vanishes antientirely. The Treasurer will only be called upon to act under the authority given by this Bill in extreme cases, and was Treain cases of forced sales. It seems to me that war bonds aud scrip will become negotiable paper. I do not see why I should not be able to utilize to my bonds in securing a loan, or in making a purchase of property. It is quite within the realm of reason that personswho have property or shares in companies for sale will accept war bonds or Comv monwealth scrip in lieu of cash. At any rate, there should be nothing to prevent as its being done. There is no possibility of these bonds being wiped out within the life-time of any living person. I have been nominated as executor in many wills. Many other honourable members are in the same position. What is to prevent an executor of an estate recommending a the purchase of war bonds as a good inThere is no safer security under the sun. Just as is the case with note issue, the nation is behind the Pittbonds, and we are exemplifying the of their security in a most substantial manner by saying that they shall he not go below their face value. We are now a nation, and one of the benefits of a is that it may have a national debt.",58
309,Mr BOYD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Does that benefit apply the fact . privately as-well?,59
310,Mr WEST,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"If the honourable member is running a large business and he can improve it by securing a loan of £10,000, would have sufficient brains to do so.",59
311,Mr BOYD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Now I feel flattered.,59
312,Mr WEST,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I admit that it does not .take too much to flatter a Scotchman. In reference to the sale of bonds, the honto orable member for Capricornia has spoken about quotations of £99 2s. 6d., and 4796 War Loan Securities -[REPRESENTATIVES.] £99 7a. 6d., but in the month of December I have seen these bonds for sale at £100 10s. Every business man knows that in that month the half-year's in terest is due. In January, when the holder of the bonds must wait nearly six months for £2 5s. on a £100-bond, he may be offered something under £100 for his bonds. It does not necessarily mean that he sells them. Many people make offers to buy sheep, but an offer to buy does not complete a transaction. The holder of the sheep does not sell unless he gets what he wants for them. In January and in July there will always be some of those gentlemen who deal in this class of business, and make a livin g put of it , who will be ready to buy bonds at a figure lower than the face value. If circumstances should arise by which there may be a serious financial position of a momentary character, then, if Parliament cannot rise to the occasion, it is not fit to be intrusted with the administration of the affairs of the country. The honourable member for Capricornia has made some reference to the fact that people are spending too much money in luxuries. Nobody regrets it more than I do. If we could only get people to realise the seriousness of the position, and if they would only cast their eyes on the future a little, they would be a little wiser, and would put &- stop to a good deal of - the unnecessary expenditure that is going on at the present .time. But in Australia we do not seem to be able to realise the exact position. Nature has been bounteous to us so far as climate is concerned. We live an outdoor l if e, and the seriousness of things cannot be grafted into the people too easily. Perhaps it is a good thing that it is so, because our manner of livin g has kept money in circulation. No doubt, there are many people in this country who are making untold wealth. There is not a company that is not piling up reserves, and we can only guess that their profit and loss accounts are genuine. It is not only in Australia that this is going on. In the newspapers this week I read of a Japanese shipping company, with a capital in 1916 of £36,000,000, to which they have since added £40,000,000, while their profit on the half year's transactions is £336,945.",59
313,Dr MALONEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Is not that yen ? is not much profit on £40,000,000. Mr West. Repurchase Bill.",60
314,Mr WEST,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"No , I was very careful on that point. I differ from the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), in as much as T do not see in the Bill the danger he anticipates. In this legislation we have been set a good example by the Old Country, which has had years more experience than we have in financial matters of the kind, and has always jealously guarded the national savings as represented by the British consols. No matter on which side of the House I sit, I always have, and always shall, support any proposal whicF I deem to be for the public good; and this Bill shall certainly have my vote.",60
315,Dr MALONEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Melbourne) [9.2] Every credit is due to the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) for the time and study he has devoted to this measure from his point of view. Honourable members on both sides agree that at the present time it is. absolutely necessary to establish the public credit as 'firmly as possible; and with that end in view I in tend to support the Bill . In my opinion this measure will contribute greatly to strengthen the public credit, for it will enable the Government to assure all in vestors, especially those for small amounts, that tliere is no chance of their suffering any loss. I cannot think that the banks, insurance companies, and ' other great financial institutions, whose loans reach hundreds of thousands, and in some cases millions, would be so mean and contemptible as to unload extensively on the market six months after their subscription.",60
316,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,That is quite true in regard to the great majority of companies.,60
317,Dr MALONEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The honourable member was quite right in saying that there is'a larger amount of interest paid in the first six months than would appear from the face value of the bonds; and doubtless that is done to promote investment. Those who invest from patriotic motives need no encouragement of the kind, but it is necessary, I suppose, to also attract those who have an eye for a little extra interest. The value of securities is bound to rise and f all. On the issue it will be near to par, though, iii the course of time, it may go down very low, as was shown by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) to have been the case during the continental crisis at the end of the 18th century. As such loans That become 9ue, there is always a rise^though during the long curve, the same interest has been paid by the Government. cording to the monthly share list, ComI monwealth bonds are sold at 9 9 | , and twelve months ago they were quoted at to 99$, or £ 9 9 17s. 6d., just as the honorof able member for Capricornia toldus. that Some of the New South Wales 3 per cent, stock has come down as low as 59J, but when the due date approaches, it will rise period. until it reaches par. That is the rule of all finance in regard to bonds. toria stock has gone even lower, but 59£ so on. is the lowest shown in the share list I have in my possession. In to-night's Herald it is stated that Victorian stock, 1917, due 1930, is bringing only £ 7 4 10s. odd lots, and that the 3 per cent, in - 1913. scribed stock, which I take to be continuous, has gone down as low as £ 6 buyers offering £ 6 3 . People who invest at these low rates frequently get 5 cent., as in the case of the New South Wales 3 per cent, stock. I take it that the Treasurer of the will not seek unwisely to purchase tinually at par, but that if stock is being sold, say, at 9S, he will purchase, and thus make a clear profit of £2, less trifling expense for transfer. To that tent, the Treasurer will tend to carry an idea of Mr K in g O'Malley, once Minister of the Crown for the Commonwar; wealth. Mr O'Malley was one of keenest financiers that ever came into Chamber; without his assistance we should not have had now the Commontax. wealth Bank with all its public advanwarning, tages. That gentleman suggested that fund should be placed at the disposal the Government of the day in order to do exactly what this Bill proposes, namely, to enable the repurchase of bonds which may for some reason f all , and make a large profit for the public venue. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) is quite right when he says that, during this war-time, profits are being made on far too large a scale. The Sydney Bulletin publishes the balance-sheets of all various companies, and I personally take every opportunity to thank that journal for giving us these lessons in finance. I suppose my friend the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) will agree that the Bulleand'that tin is one of the best business and cial newspapers in Australia today. Mr JowETT.r-Hear, hear! Ac- Dr MALONEY - P r o m the Bulletin learn that the Australian Mutual Provident Society, in 1913, added £1,476,000 its f u n d ; and, in 1916, a further sum £1,366,000; though I regret to say in 1917 this reserve fel l to £954,000. This is one of the few instances of less profit being made than in the pre-war",60
318,Mr SINCLAIR,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"There are big outI n Vicgoings in the shape of death claims, and",61
319,Dr MALONEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"That is so; and, in those claims amounted to in £3,436,000, as against £2,179,000 in",61
320,Mr SINCLAIR,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"And the company has 4 5s., invested heavily in war loans.",61
321,Dr MALONEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Yes ; and we have per reason to be thankful to them. Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, an i m portant shipping company, had, in 1913, day a reserve of £206,000, reduced by a cash conbonus of £40,000 to £166,000; and, in 1918, that reserve has risen to £498,000. .We know that the financial conditions in some Prance, when the German indemnity was exbeing wrung from it in 1870, were better out than even in Prussia; but still we must a look forward to the debacle which follows and Sir John Grice, Chairman of the Directors of the National Bank, has this shown us the danger of borrowing large sums of money with relief from income This, Sir John Grice has done as a and not with a view to provide a a peg for men of Labour opinions to of hang arguments on; and certainly we must all realise the difficulties that face us in the future. I hate the word "" r e pudiation,"" but I will never, by vote or thus voice, put the crushing 'curse of interest reqn the untold millions of people who are to follow us. We have, to save our face and keep our pledge, but, if necessary, we shall have to make still further use of our note issue. B y this means we shall be able to say to those who have advanced large sums to the community that, on the 1st January, 1919, all to whom the country is indebted for over £100,000 will be paid in notes with interest to date. They willplace the - notes in the banks, will enable those institutions to . finanadvance money again for all ventures that offer good security, such as the starting of new manufacturing industries. All honourable members will agree that it is necessary that we should make tralia self-contained in every By the means I have suggested, all current capital would be paid into the banks, which would lend out the money Honourable members must be of how the banks today are seeking to limit their advances; are obliged to do that for their own safety. This Bill has potentialities great good, primarily in establishing and keeping firm the Commonwealth At the present time we are living en' tirely on credit. All the metal currency in the world would not pay for one month's transactions in connection this horrible war. The Germans, with a keen power of organization which amounts almost to genius, are by means of their banking system carrying on a wonderful financial fight. They are lending to themselves over and over again, and so longas the people have a full belief in their own credit, they will be able to finance the war. We have seen what we in Australia have been able to do in that way. I agree with what the honourable for Grampians (Mr Jowett) said in regard to any Treasurer who, knowing that an insurance company or bank had advanced large sums of money for the purchase of war bonds, would demean his Government by going into the after the first payment of interest and repurchasing the stock. Such an action would really amount to worse than bribery and corruption, and if the guilty surer were put against a wall and shot he would be getting only ""his deserts. think he would get very short shrift in this House. This Bill is carrying out a suggestion which was first made in this House by Mr King O'Malley, and I shall have pleasure in voting for it. the same time, I thank .the member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) for the study he has given to the We all hold different views. There are monometalists and bimetalists, hope that some day even wheat will have a currency value. Only once in the history of Australia has gold been imported to balance exchange. We pay with gold, wool, and other/raw material, and I hope that, some day, financial credit will not have to depend almost solely on gold, and, to a lesser extent, on silver. When day arrives, the world will be happier, because credit will be better established everywhere. Dr Maloney. Aus- Mr ARCHIBALD (Hindmarsh) respect. [9.30] - I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this measure. In fact, I think that if Parliament had adagain. journed even for a short time without aware having passed a measure of this character, we should have been neglectful of our they duty. I am surprised that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who of is an ex-Treasurer, does not realise that a measure of this character is of vital imcredit. portance to the Commonwealth at the present time. At a period when our borrowings for war purposes are extensive, we should not be above taking lessons from with older countries, and the principle embodied in this Bill has been operated by the British Government for a great number of years. In fact, apart altogether from war loan stocks, when we are borrowing to any extent, it is absolutely essential that we should have a policy such as this Bill will establish. The National Debt Commissioners of Great Britain operate without the knowledge of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the Governor of the Bank of England. It member can be readily understood that if it were known that they were operating on the market to steady British Consols, their work could not be so effectively done. The Government should seek, in this Bill , power to create a similar authority in market the Commonwealth. It is not necessary that the Commissioners should be appointed entirely for the operation of this f u n d , for I do not think there would Trea- be sufficient work to occupy the whole of their time. But somebody of standing I and probity in' the community should be placed in charge of this work, because it is not desirable that the Treasurer should have much to do with it . It is not that I fear that we shall ever have a Treasurer At who is lacking in public spirit or corruphonorable tible, but this work will necessitate a vigilant watching of the.market, and if it subject. were left in thehands of the Treasurer and his officials they might be so deeply and I engaged in ordinary official duties as to miss the right opportunity for operating on the market. The idea that the Treasurer will try to keep the stock at par seems' ridiculous. My impression is that the authorities will ' not operate,for the purpose of steadying that the market u n t i l stock falls to about £98. Nobody cantell what will happen after the war. War loan stocks may remain at their present price or they may f all , but I do not think .they will fall more than a couple of points. At the present time all mining flotations, except in respect of concerns which are already in operation, .are practically prohibited, because the authorities will not allow the money market to be depleted by large speculations in mining ventures. It is not impossible that later mining may take an upward move, and, naturally, there will be extensive operations by speculators. If the mining prospects were good some people would sell their bonds. Of course, everybody should patriotically hold his war bonds; but as men of common sense, we must realise that a good number of people will sell if they think they can get ""a bigger return by reinvesting the money. If such a position as that Were created, there would be a necessity for operations by the Government in order to steady the market. At the time when Mr Gladstone was reducing the national debt of Great Britain by leaps and bounds, the operations of the National Debt Commissioners, although known only to themselves and to the Chancellor of the Exchequer from time to time, were very essential to steady the market, and they certainly did take advantage of any opportune time for buying up Government Stock. When the redemption of our war loans is due, such an authority would be of very great help to the Commonwealth. . In following the example of the British authorities in this matter, we are proceeding on safe lines. I hold that in matters of finance we should follow the beaten track, especially in war time. We cannot afford to play any tricks in finance matters at this period; it is essential that we should proceed on safe and sound lines, and defer some of the proposed wonderful reforms and innovations until we return to the piping times of peace. A reference has been made to the remarks made by Professor Meredith At k in son regarding the Commonwealth Note Issue. I think the Treasurer was justified in giving that gentleman a friendly warning that he should weigh well his statements on this matter. Professors, with their large academic training and lack of business knowledge, are unqualified to discuss many of these questions, and their remarks would have very little value were it not for the positions they occupy in connection with universities. I except such a man as the late Thorold Rogers, Professor of .Political Economy at Oxford, who based his theories on facts, and not on things of which he had dreamed. Will any man say the note issues of Great Britain and France, the two most stable Governments in Europe, are covered with gold to the same extent"" as they were in pre-war times ? Of course they are not, and no banker or commercial man, or even an intelligent working man, would think for a moment that a note issue in time of war can be supported by the same gold reserve as in time of peace. Yet today we were warned that the Commonwealth is not altogether on safe ground in regard to its note issue. I sav that we are absolutely on safe ground. During these times the soundness of the note issue",61
322,Mr SPEAKER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP, I ask the honourable member not to discuss the note issue.,63
323,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Then I shall merely say that there is no reason for public alarm about the present financial position. Statements have been made about the necessity for economy, in which, no doubt, there is considerable force. The secret of economy is to abstain from buying those things which you can do without. Reference has been made to the prices that are being paid for boots.",63
324,Mr SPEAKER,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,That matter does not come within the scope of the Bill .,63
325,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I merely wish to state my opinions regardling the solid position of our finances. If I am confined strictly to the subject-matter of the Bill , there is nothing to be said except that the measure is on sane lines, and has the approval of all with any authority to speak on financial matters, and, before many years are passed, will prove to be of great value.",63

330,Mr FENTON,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I do not know that I agree with everything that .was said by honourable member for Capricornia, though he is to be commended for having brought about a healthy discussion of the measure. The Bill evidently plates redemption operations, because clause 4 says that securities under it shall be immediately cancelled. I take it that if the Government were to purchase £100,000 worth of stock in the market, the scrip would not and no further interest would be payable on it. When a big investor in war-loan stock "" shuffles off this mortal coil,"" if , under his will, his assets have to be immefund). diately realized, the placing of a large lump of stock on the market suddenly cause such a depression as to alarm - us holders. It will then be for the vernment to step in and buy some of stock, not at an exceptionally low, but at securities. a modest, figure, and redeem it. The Canadian Government adopts this method of redemption. Instead of creating ing funds, it goes upon the market favourable opportunities, and repurchases its stock, thus partially redeeming loans during their currency. We shall do well to follow their example. Some months ago the Sydney Morning Herald, which certainly does not views-referre d in a sub-leader to the extent to which rich men were purchasing sistency ? war loan stock, which, it said, was not wholly desirable, because, if these operais tions were continued for any length time at the then rate, quite a big parcel of scrip would get into the hands of of the richest persons in Australia, would be free of taxation on the interest.",64
331,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,The intention of the Government which the honourable member supported was that the interest on warport adopted. loan stock should be free from taxation,64
332,Mr FENTON,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"That is so; not too late to mend. I am referring to the manipulation of this stock by rich men.

337,Mr WISE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Gippsland-Honorary Minister) [9.50] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a short Bill to make three or four amendments in the Defence Act 1903-17. It is practically a machinery measure, covering three or four matters that might have been dealt - with when the last amending Bill was before the House, but which were then overlooked. Wlhen we sent the first division to the Front we had no idea as to what would be the duration or the magnitude of the war. Believing that we would be sending away only 20,000 men, and that there would be plenty of transports available, we provided for the enlistment of the men for the period of the war and four months afterwards. Having regard to the many thousands who have since been sent to the Front, and to the great shortage of transports, however, it is anticipated that far more than four months will elapse after the close of the war before all our troops can be brought back. I remember that the. honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), when Treasurer, said it was estimated that two years would elapse after the close of the war before all our men could be returned. If the Act, as it stands, were not amended, therefore, the term of service of these men would expire in many cases while they were in Britain, and they .would be discharged many months before we could get them back.",65
338,Mr TUDOR,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,But surely no Government would propose anything of th-at kind?,65
339,Mr WISE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The point is that we could not keep them in the Forces if they thought fit to leave four months after the war terminated. . It is now proposed to amend the principal Act by .inserting in section 31 a new sub-clause providing thatIf the Governor General, by proclamation, declares that, by reason of the recent existence of a time of war, it is necessary in the public interest that the Permanent Military Forces should be maintained after the cessation of the time of war, Permanent Forces raised in time of war for purposes other than those specified in sub-section (2) of this section may be maintained after the' time of war and so long as that proclamation remains in force. That will enable us to cover the whole period during which the men are away and pending their return to Australia. A further provision was inserted in the Bill in another place to the effect that any soldier who makes application in writing for his discharge will be discharged within two months of his return to Australia. It is also provided in the Bill that a soldier on becoming entitled to his discharge shall receive it with all convenient speed, but that until his discharge he shall remain a member of the Defence Forces. Andther amendment which this Bill makes in the principal Act relates to a question of administration. The principal Act provides that "" Minister "" means "" the Minister of State for Defence or other Minister of State "" administering the Act.* At present there are honorary members of the Executive Council without portfolio who are not Ministers of State, and in order that they, in the absence of the Minister for Defence, may exercise the powers conferred by the Act, it is proposed to amend the definition of the word "" Minister"" by omitting the words "" of State for Defence or other Minister of State,"" so that the meaning of "" Minister"" will be "" Minister for the time being administering the Act."" That definition will include members of the Executive Council who are members of the Ministry. The matter is to be further dealt with by an amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act, which is already on the notice-paper. Another provision which was wholly overlooked when the amending Bill of 1917 was before Parliament deals with Senior Cadets. The law provides that if a Senior Cadet becomes a cadet oflicer he may, with the consent of the Defence authorities, on attaining the age of eighteen years, remain with the Senior Cadets as a Senior Cadet Officer, and if physically unfit at that age for the Citizen Forces, he may remain another year with the Senior Cadets. Further in order to secure the requisite number of officers, it has been found necessary to appoint volunteers. We have provided that certain drills which members of the Cadet Forces are required to undergo shall be carried out in their employers' time, and that an employer shall not make any deduction from the pay of his employee in respect of time lost when attending such drills. There is no provision in that respect, however, with regard to cadet officers, so that as the law stands at present, while a cadet oflicer has to attend these drills, his employer may make a deduction from his salary in respect of time so lost.",65
340,Mr TUDOR,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,That is in the case of members of the Cadet Forces who are over eighteen years of age.,66
341,Mr WISE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Yes . It is intended by this Bill to put such officers of the Senior Cadet Forces on the same footing as ordinary members of the Senior Cadet Forces. . The last amendment proposed to be made in the principal Act relates to officers. ' Section 148 .of the Defence Act provides that no person who is not a graduate of the Royal Military College shall be appointed an officer of the Permanent Forces. In time of war the Australian Imperial Force is part of the Permanent Forces of the Commonwealth, and men who are not graduates of the Royal Military College have been granted commissions in the Australian Imperial Force. This Bill will enable us to continue such appointments and to validate those already made. Debate (on motion by Mr TUDOR) adjourned. ADJOUiRNMENT. CBNSOBSHIP-DEPOETATIO N OF ITALIANS: SEIZUEE OF PETITION-SAL E OF ZINC AND LEAD CONCENTBATES. Motion (by Mr WAT T) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",66
342,Mr TUDOR,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Yarra) [9.56] - Dur ing the discussion of grievances on Thursday last I raised the question of the censorship. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) will remember that on that occasion I mentioned that certain matter had been censored from the Labour Gall, and that on the following day I supplied him with a copy of the matter to which the. censor had objected. In the course of my Temarks I indulged in some criticism of the censorship, but no one could say that my criticism was extreme OT severe. I quoted an extract from Liberty and Progress, which the censor had not allowed to appear in the Labour Gall. I also quoted from a speech made by the Prime Minister at the recent Recruiting Conference, in which the right honourable gentleman said that he would not stand. there as the protagonist of the censor, and that if he had been in my place he would have said far more than I had in regard to the treatment to which I and our party, had been subjected. I went on to urge that no one could defend a censorship of the kind that was being indulged in. I now find that the Labour Gall sent a copy of my speech to the censor, with an intimation that it proposed to publish it , and that the censor cut out of it everything that I had had to say in regard to the censorship. I hand the Acting Prime Minister a copy of the speech, with the deletions made by the censor, and bearing his initials. If we are to have set up in Australia a Department which considers itself above all criticism, then the sooner we know it the better. In this speech I made no statement that could be of any military importance to the enemy - The Acting Prime Minister was ^.present, and took no exception to what I said. I merely criticised the Department as such, but this Department apparently thinks that it should be aibove the criticism of Parliament. I quite believe that if any newspaper submitted to the censor tonight a report of the speech I am now de- livering, it would not be allowed to publish it. This sort of censorship must stop right here and now. I am not here to dictate to the Government, but Ministers must Tecognise that if such a thing were allowed to continue, it would be absolutely fatal to the good government of Australia. At the present time no newspaper is allowed to publish any criticism that we may indulge in concerning that Department. What I said last week can be read in Hansard, although it was not allowed to appear in the Labour Call. I ask the Acting'Prime Minister to deal with the matter himself. I feel confident that the Minister . for Defence cannot know what is going on, but, if he does, and if we are not allowed to say a word of criticism of the censor, we should know it. Recently I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Defence with regard to reprints of members' speeches, and I was informed that they must he submitted to the censor. On one occasion I asked Mr Speaker how many copies of .Hansard were circulated each week, and was informed that the number was 7,500. Each honourable member is allowed thirty-five copies, and lic libraries and newspapers are supplied with free copies, a certain number of which are also circulated by the High Commissioner in the United Kingdom. What I say in this chamber in regard to the censor may go out into free' circulation in Hansard, but directly any newspaper seeks to republish my remarks, down comes the censor and prevents it from doing so. In the case to which I have drawn attention, the military' people apparently wish to save some of their own officers. That was why the report was censored in the first place. I did not quote one word of the article in the Labour CaU which was censored. I merely mentioned one or two facts in connection with the matter, but evervthing had to be struck out. We were told that' there would be no censorship of anything which took place at the Governor General's Conference. If the Lahour Call wished to cut out 3 or 4 inches of the report of the proceedings at the Governor General's Conference, they would be allowed to publish it, but because I mentioned the same matter in connection with my criticism of the action of the censor, the whole thing was struck out. I would like to keep the proof which I have submitted to the Acting Prime Minister as a memento of the idiotic way in which the Censor's Department is being run. If all this is being done with the connivance or by the orders of the Minister for Defence, we have a right to know it. No one could defend such conduct. The conference of editors denounced it. Mr. Holman denounced the action of the censor in preventing the publication of Senator Millen's speech upon repatriation in the Senate. I thought that, as the ""result of the Conference at Government House and of the conference of editors in regard to the censorship, we would have saner administration of the regulations dealing with the matter. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to let us know exactly where we stand in regard' to speeches which are delivered in this House.",66
343,Mr CONSIDINE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Barrier) [10.4]. - I desire to draw attention to another method adopted by the Minister for Defence, or some of his emissaries, in suppressing a matter of public importance pub- and of great personal importance to a large number of people in Australia, namely, the conscription of Italians for service overseas. This morning, I received the following letter, written from 110 Queensberry-street, Carlton, apparently the premises occupied by the Italian Club:The military authorities yesterday (Tuesday, the 14th inst.) visited the above premises and seized all the printed petition forms and a number of other papers. We Italians now feel that we are helpless to express our protestation against the introduction of conscription for Italians if our right of petition is to be taken from us. We appeal to you to assist us toretain this right, which we believe is recognised as an institution in the Commonwealth of Australia. It appears that these Italians have had a petition printed for the purpose of obtaining signatures of the citizens of Australia to a protest against the treatment which is being meted out to them, their ultimate object being to present the petition to this House. I have seen a copy of it, and there is absolutely nothing in it which would justify the high-handed procedure on the part of the military authorities of visiting the premises of the Italian Club and seizing the printed petition forms, as well as otlier documents, the nature of which is not stated in this letter. What is the object of preventing these people from petitioning this House if they feel that they are aggrieved ?",67
344,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Is the honourable member alluding to citizens of Australia?,67
345,Mr CONSIDINE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Thes e Italian citizens are citizens of Australia.,67
346,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"I do not know that unnaturalized foreigners have the right of petition, but citizens of Australia certainly have.",67
347,Mr CONSIDINE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Thes e people are naturalized citizens who have supplied me with the information. They are interested in the fate of their feliow countrymen. They believe that the Italian Government is not aware of the circumstances existing in Australia."" Many of them are firmly of the belief that the Italian Consul, for reasons of his own, is concealing from the Italian Government the condition' of affairs existing here. He may be acting from the highest of motives, but the Italian citizens, feeling that the Italian Government ought to be made aware of the hardships that they are suffering because of the way in which they are being treated, have attempted to communicate with it . In pursuance of that  ing two cables to the Italian Minister for War, asking him whether the Italian Government was full y aware of the conditions existing in Australia, or whether they endorsed the action which was being taken at the initiative of the Italian Consul here. The money spent on these cablegrams has not been returned, and no information has been made available as to whether the cablegrams were delivered or not. On top of this, the petitions which they were attempting to circulate among their fellow citizens have been seized by the military authorities. isters could very well give a littl e consideration to the feelings of these Italian citizens. At any rate, the relatives of those who are now being forcibly deported are deserving of some consideration. procedure which has been, adopted is not calculated to inspire them witli any great feeling of love for the Commonwealth Government. . I understood from the reply furnished to me this afternoon by the Acting Prime Minister that the Government had rethat ceived instructions from the Imperial authorities that the details of the arrangealready ment entered into by Australia for the sale of lead and zinc concentrates to the British Board of Trade were not to be made public.",67
348,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,It was not an instruction; it was a request.,68
349,Mr CONSIDINE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"It amounts to the same thing in the end. They have requested the Government not to divulge the information. I understand that I can obtain the information privately, but that I am not at liberty to make use it.",68
350,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,The honourable member will not be at liberty to publish it or give it any public circulation.,68
351,Mr CONSIDINE,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Then the information would be of no use to me in. my capacity as representative of the district which is mainly concerned in the producthe tion of lead and zinc concentrates. price received by the companies, and the details of the arrangement may vitally affect the people I represent, and although it may be personally gratifying to me to obtain the information, which the Acting Prime Minister offers to supply to me privately, if I cannot make use of it on the public platform or through the press, it will be of no value to me. I cannot see what object the British Government have in making the request that the matter should be kept free from public discussion. When I was in Sydney on behalf of the men who were in dispute with their employers at Broken Hill , certain of the mining companies published a statement that they were being prevented from marketing their concentrates by reason of a combine which was said to be in existence. They said that if the Federal authorities would enable them to secure a market, they would be prepared, in the interests of the Empire, to let the I m M i nperial authorities have the concentrates at pre-war costs. Consequently the Acting Prime Minister will understand why I am interested in learning the details of the conThe tract, and in view of certain comments in the Sydney press to which I have drawn his attention, I hope that he will reconsider the matter of not making the details public if there is really no vital reason why they should not be so treated. It . has been inferred in the Sydney press the withholding of this particular in formation will have the tendency to boom boomed shares. The interests of those who own shares are not served if shares are boomed beyond their real value; and from the stand-point of. m y constituents, the workers of Broken Hill , and of other workers engaged in handling zinc and lead products, the Acting Prime Minister should reconsider the matter.",68
352,Mr BLAKELEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Darling ) [10.15] I desire to draw the attention of the Act ing Prime Minister to what is, at least, of very high-handed conduct on the part of some public officials. . 1 refer to"" the censorship of honourable members' speeches. Some time ago, in. answer to a question by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor), the Assistant Minister for Defence said that it was necessary for members to submit their speeches to censor when they were reprinted for The circulation, so that he might delete what he thought should not go out to the public. Will the Acting Prime Minister take steps to see that these reprints of honourable members' speeches enjoy the same privilege as is given to the circulation of the ordinary Hansard numbers? _ Members are allowed thirty-five proof copies of their speeches, over which they have full control, and may send to whom they choose; but if those speeches are issued in pamphlet form they have to be submitted to the censor. One of the results is that matter which is allowed to go out in the Hansard number is not allowed to go out in the reprints. Mr ""WATT - That might be an argument for thecensoring of Hansard.",68
353,Mr BLAKELEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"It appears to me that the Government make all kinds of promises, hut are not prepared to carry them out.",69
354,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,That is not correct.,69
355,Mr BLAKELEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Two of my speeches have been censored, and most ridiculous deletions made. In one speech I said that men have been put in gaol for effortB on behalf of their own class, and that was scored out. If the Acting Prime Minister intends to honour the promises whioh were given on behalf of the Government hy the Prime Minister, he will at least see that there is extended to these reprints the same privilege that is given to Hansard",69
356,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,I have nothing to do with it ,69
357,Mr BLAKELEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"You have all to do with it. In answer to a question, I think by the honorablo member for Batman (Mr Brennan), the Acting Prime Minis-' ter said that, so far as he was aware, the censor had no right to seize petitions. Does the Acting Prime Minister intend to let the matter go at that ?",69
358,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,I did not say that tp the honourable member for Batman.,69
359,Mr BLAKELEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,That is how the Acting Prime Minister will find himself reported in Hansard.,69
360,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,I do not recollect that form of answer. What I said was that the censor had no right to interfere with the immemorial right of citizens to petition to Parliament.,69
361,Mr BLAKELEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"That is not how the answer was printed. If members' privileges are to be taken away-if the censor is to be used in connection with their - speeches-wh y not bring the censor into the chamber, and, once' and for all, [175]. decide the question? If certain things did not please the censor he should stop an honourable member from speaking; and it seems to me we are fast approaching' that stage.",69
362,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,I have a proposition that I can make to honourable members opposite and the House generally.,69
363,Mr BLAKELEY,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Then I am quite prepared to listen.,69
364,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.20] - My irritation at the protracted nature of the adjournment debates is due to the fact that honourable members who leave when the motion is moved are not fairly treated if, in a small. House, we indefinitely discuss questions of public prominence. I entirely agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) in regard to his treatment by the censor. I speak as a layman, with no knowledge of why or how the censor does his work, and I promise to look into the matter myself, in coni'unction with the Minister for Defence, t seems to me that the hulk of the stuff censored is quite innocuous so faras publication is concerned. There is one part, however, which the censor, in the exercise of his judgment, properly omitted. I am speaking of the embarkation of Italians. Honourable members opposite have had explained to them three times why the censoT is excising such matter. There is another portion - which, it seems to me, most unfair to have excised. That is a compliment, and a Tare one, too, that the Leader of the Opposition paid to myself; and the fact that it has been excised excites my utmost indignation. We get BO few compliments from honourable members opposite that I shall make it my business to ascertain why this passage was excised. As to the seizure of petitions respecting the Italian movements, referred to hy the honourable memher for Barrier (Mr Considine), I have not consulted Hansard as to what I said, hut I gave a view which I do not retract - The censor has no right to limit the right of Australian citizens to petition Parliament. Nothing that I am aware of, in peace or war, ought to interfere with that right. As to why the petitions were seized, I do not know; indeed, I did not even know that they had been Beized, and I shall inquire as to the reason. The honourable member for the Barrier also referred to the publication of information regarding the. sale, and so forth, of rinc concentrates. All I can say is that the British Government has requested us not to make public these details. There is a tendency amongst honourable members opposite to exercise too freely the privilege of asking questions respecting goods that are contraband of - war. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) has frequently requested information about wool, although it is perfectly clear that i be unwise on the part of the Government to give, or chance the giving of, information to the enemy respecting' the price of wool in Australia. It would be unwise to run that risk in regard to those to whom such commodities are sold, or to let the enemy, or even neutrals who may he in touch with the enemy, know where our trade is going, how goods are carried, or the nrice at which they are sold. If that applies to so important-a part of military equipment as wool, it applies with double force to material for munitions, such - is zinc, lead, and other concentrates. have offered to give the honourable member what information the Government has for his private use, and I cannot promise anything further without consulting the cables of request from the British Government. As to the censorship generally, if the Leader of the Opposition, after consulting with his party, will set out distinctly the grievances they feel about the treatment of their speeches in reprints of Hansard for circulation, I shall consult the Minister for Defence and the Chief Censor and see what Temedy can be applied.",69
365,Mr TUDOR,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,Criticis m of. the censorship should be allowed. ',70
366,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"In the honourable member's absence from the chamber I admitted, as a layman, that the excision referred to was without warrant or necessity. To prevent this constant and recriminating discussion, if the Opposition, or honourable members generally, will set down what they complain ahout I will see how far, in fairness it is possible to find a remedy. Beyond that I cannot go. I hope the honourable member for Darling will not accuse the Government, in the absence of the Prime Minister, of withdrawing one word of any promise or undertaking. ' I have said on half-a-dozen occasions, here and elsewhere, that the Government intend to keep, not only the latter, but tb spirit, of every promise.' Mr BI.AKEI.EV - Tw o weeks after tht promise was made, honourable members' speeches were deliberately mutilated b the censor.",70

369,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OP BOYS OP,"The Government take the responsibility for what the censor does, but we cannot know his every particular act. For instance, I heard for tht first time to-night of the illustration supplied by the Leader of the Opposition, and I have undertaken to make inquiries.",70
