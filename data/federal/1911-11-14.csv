ALLEGED ATROCITIES IN PAPUA.  of External Affairs if .he has yet obtained any information regarding the question I put to him on Friday last as to a report in the Age that terrible, atrocities had taken place, or were alleged to have taken place, in Papua.",13
1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I have received the following information:The reference in the press Was apparently to a case on the Island of Rossel, one of the Louisdale Group to the south-east of Fapua. Two brothers, named Osborne, have lived for many years on that island. In the course of an inspection by the Government officer recently, the natives complained that these men had been acting in a ni-.st high-handed and even brutal manner, actually burning down their houses and wrecking the gardens o l such of the islanders as had incurred their displeasure. These excesses appear to have been going on for a long time, but nn complaints have been made to GOT vernment officers on previous visits. On re^ ceiring this report the Lieutenant-Governor hiov self went to Rossel, and spent some days examining the state of the island. As the brothers 'Osborne have been committed for trial on various - charges, Judge Murray makes no comment ou the information which he acquired except to state that, apart from the cruel and tyrannical manner in which the Osbornes are said to have acted and their alleged absolute disregard for native rights and native propertv, no very great material damage appears to have been su [Tered by the natives. The houses burnt down were probablv the flimsiest of structures, and the gardens which are said to have been destroyed were of no considerable extent. The consequence is that there is no lasting injury done to the morale of the' natives; and confidence appears to have been stored as soon as the Government appeared upon the scene to protect them.

In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 26th October, vide page 1912), on motion by Mr FISHERThat the first item in the Estimates, under Division I . , the Parliament, namely, "" Thf President, ,£1,100,"" be agreed to.",16
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Swan) [3.12]. - In dealing with the financial position of the Commonwealth, and the speech of the right honourable the Treasurer upon it, we ought, I think, to aim at making our financial affairs clear; and with as much brevity as possible. Any criticism which we direct towards the Budget speech should be plain and straightforward, and should avoid, as far as we can, the use of harsh personalities. VVe are all engaged in the same work in this House, and although we differ greatly in regard to the methods we desire to employ, and may have our own opinions as to the knowledge and experience, and even the energy of one another, still I do not wish to be more uncomplimentary than is necessary in discussing the financial proposals of the Government. The revenue of last year was very satisfactory, being larger than ever before. It amounted to £18,803,873, which was .£1,280,443 above the estimate. The increase of revenue was largely made up by the considerably augmented receipts from Customs and Excise, and by the land tax, and therefore the estimate, although it was not .1 good one, erred on the right side. To put the revenue of last year into two or three words, Customs and Excise produced £12,980,443; the Post and Telegraph Department, jf£3>9°5. 3 - the expenditure on that Department, including £783,612 for works, being £4,345,540-and the land tax £1,370,357. There were also some miscellaneous items, including £198,893, a credit balance from Northern Territory, £151,513, and other small items amounting in all to £547,942. For the current year Customs and Excise is estimated to £13,800,000, the Post and Telegraph Department £3,870,000, the land tax ,£1,430,000, and miscellaneous items, including coinage, £415.000, or a total estimated revenue of £19,515,000. On the Post and Telegraph Department, however, there is to be expended out of revenue this year a total of £5,903,166, including £1,531,214 for additions, new works, and other items, and £435,972 for interest and sinking fund on the transferred properties. That total expenditure of £5,903,166 on the Post and Telegraph Department, it must be remembered, is against a total estimated revenue from the same Department of £3.870,000. The revenue from the Commonwealth, we may say, therefore, comes really from two sources-Custom s and Excise and the land tax. There is also something from smaller items, of which coinage has this year and last been productive. With the exception of those two large items, however, and with the exception also of coinage, all the other sources of revenue enumerated in the Budget papers are trading concerns, and their receipts cost more to collect than they amount to. The Post and Telegraph Department, as I have just stated, shows an estimated deficit on the year's transactions of £2,033,166. We all desire that the Department should be well equipped, but we must remember that all the expenditure upon it comes out of the current revenue,and that there are really only . two sources from which to draw, the revenue. It may be thought by some that this immense revenue of £i9,-5i5,ooo is the result of the wise administration of my honourable friends opposite; but I can assure the people of the country that such is not the case. I can say for my friends opposite that they have been ""very fortunate, and it seems to me that they very often are, using the term "" fortunate"" in the sense that circumstances have happened to favour them at a particular time. They entered into possession of a well-cultivated I I and productive estate on the ist July, 1910. That estate had been carefully planted and looked after by their predecessors; and I congratulate the Governcoinage, ment and the country on their good fortune-bu t they have taken up that they laid not down, and are reaping that they did not sow. For 1909-10, the gross revenue available, after paying £8,492,436 produce to the States under the Braddon sec- , tion of the Constitution, was .£7,048,233. In 1910-11, when the present Government had made the operation of the Braddon section cease six months earlier than the Constitution provided, and. substituted a payment of 25s. per head to the States instead of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue, the gross revenue available, after returning £5,796,424 was £13,607,449- an crease on the previous year of £6,559,216 available for the Government to spend. Whatever Government had been in power there must have been that sum available, because there was no time, however wise a Government might be, to increase the revenue, except, of course, by means of extra taxation. year the gross revenue available, after returning 25s. per head to the States, is estimated at £13,738,750, an increase on the amount available in 1909-10 of £6,690.517. It will be seen, therefore, that during these two years the Government of the day have had available a gross revenue in excess of that available to the previous Government for the year 1909-10 of £13,249,753. There has, of course, been an increase in revenue together with the land tax, but the main increase is due to the change from the payment under the Braddon section-of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue-to a payment of 25s. per head to the States. In 191 o-i 1 the difference due to the change from the payment of three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to 25s. per head was £4,311,138, and for 1911-12 it is estimated to be £4,333,744. Honourable members will see that, had the operation of the Braddon clause been continued, there would have been £8,644,382 less revenue to the Commonwealth during the two years 1910-1 T and 1911-12. The revenue from the land tax was, in 1910-11, £1,307,357, and this year it is estimated to be £1,430,000. The increase of revenue due to the change from the Braddon section and to the land tax in these two years amounts to £'1,444,739. members will, therefore, see that T am justified in describing the Ministry as extremely fortunate to have taken office just at the time of the change in the method of returning the Customs revenue to the States. The Government-have also had the advantage of what, in-my opinion, there was no necessity for. namely, a land tax, which has given .the revenue in the two vears £2,800,357. Most people, if they look at these - figures carefully and impartially, will say that there was no necessity whatever for the Government to curtail the operation of the Braddon clause for six months. The Government may say that they allowed the operation of that section to run until 31st December, 1910; Sir John Forrest. but, as a matter of fact, they did nothing; of the kind, because the payment of 25s. per head dates from ist July, 1910, or in- six months earlier than it ought to have done. By making the decision retrospective by six months, the present Government took from the States, and placed in< the Treasury of the Commonwealth, a sum 1 of £2,131,000. The Government practically curtailed the operation of the Braddonclause by six months, making the period This nine years and a half, instead of ten years as provided in the Constitution; and by that means the Treasurer was able to show a surplus of £^1,829,524 on the 30th June last. I have expressed myself in regard 1 to that, in my opinion, improper transaction on a previous occasion, and other honourable members have done so also. I think that what was done was wrong and unjustifiable. I ao not consider that it is too late even now for the Government toundo what was undoubtedly an invasion of the Constitution. I am aware that it may be said that the Government of which I was a member intended to do the same thing. But we proposed to carry out an arrangement approved by the States. What I am complaining about, however, was done by compulsion, without the consent of the States.",16
28,Mr THOMAS,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,That is rather good! The State Premiers agreed at the Conference to what was done.,17
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"They agreed to it on certain conditions-that what was proposed was to be a permanent provision, and not limited to ten years. But that was no reason whatever for this curtailment against the wishes of the States; and there was no necessity for it either, as was shown by the fact that the Government had a large Honourable surplus at the end of the year. The expenditure for the present financial year is estimated at £21,227,679, and the revenue, as I have said, is estimated at £19,515,000. There is, therefore, a deficit on this year's transactions, although that deficit is covered by a credit balancecarried forward from last year. Consequently, while there is no .actual deficit,, there is, as I have said, a deficit on the year's transactions, and last year's surplusof £1,829,524 has to be drawn upon to the extent of ,£1,712,679 in order to make a balance. I note four items of - expenditure on this year's Estimates which are very large, and which, I think, honourable . members should - carefully consider. They are non-productive items-that is to. say, they represent expenditure which produces no direct revenue. When large sums of money are spent upon services that return to the Commonwealth a larger amount of revenue than the expenditure, of course the position of those services is satisfactory. But in this case I desire to call attention to four items of non-productive expenditure. I do not say that they are not productive of good for the community, but they are not directly productive of revenue to the Commonwealth. - there is the Defence expenditure, including £ 1 , 5 1 5 , 0 0 0, the cost of fleet construction, j£4,775"", 136. That is to say, no less than four and three-quarter millions is to be expended this year on defence; secondly, old-age pensions' expenditure, including £ 4 1 , 9 2 7 , . cost of administration, absorbs £ 2 , 2 3 1 , 9 2 7 ; thirdly, there is a loss on the Post Office of £ 2 , 0 3 3 , 1 6 6 ; and, fourthly, there is expenditure on the Northern Territory, £ 4 1 1 , 0 0 0 . These four items make up a total of £9,451,229. That is a very large amount, and it needs to be very carefully scrutinized. I admit that we all approve of the expenditure to which I am calling attention. We desire to see the things done upon which the money is to be spent. But the question is - whether we can continue to carry on these services from current revenue as at present.",17
30,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Does not honourable gentleman think that the old-age pensions' expenditure is productive of much good?,18
31,Sir JOHNFORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"I am not discussing that question. I am simply drawing attention to four large items of expenditure that are not directly productive of revenue. I point to these items, not for the purpose of finding fault, or criticising unduly, but rather to call attention to the seriousness of the position. In regard to the Post Office, I wish to point out how the expenditure of £ 5 , 9 0 3 , 1 6 6 is made up. first the purely departmental expenditure; £ 3 , 8 2 7 , 1 6 0 ; works and buildings, for the Post and Telegraph Department, to cost £ 1 , 5 3 1 , 2 1 4 ; interest and sinking fund on the transferred properties amounts to £ 4 3 5 ,9 72 ; rents and repairs, for worksand buildings, absorb £ 6 6 , 0 6 8 ; miscellaneous items amount to £42,752-makin g a total expenditure on account of the Post Office of £ 5 , 9 0 3 , 1 6 6. ""The revenue estimated to be received is ^£3,870,000. So that the Post Office this year is being worked at a loss of £ 2 , 0 3 3 , 1 6 6. The question that we ought to ask ourselves is whether this immense amount of money is being spent to the best advantage. I do not wish to criticise the present Postmaster-General more than I should criticise those who held office before him. I am simply giving my own opinion for what it is worth. I do not think this great business is being carried on in a way that secures the best results for the ComFirst, monwealth. We require better general management than we have at present. At present we have no general manager invested with certain statutory powers and responsible to the Minister or to Parliament. The time has arrived when this immense Department, which costs so much money, should be placed under the control of such a General Manager. It may be said that the Secretary of the Post Office is in that position, inasmuch as he is supposed to have control, through the Minister, of the whole service. Bui that official has a tremendous amount to do in looking after correspondence, submitting papers to the Minister, and so forth. The whole of his time is taken up with purely departmental administration. We want an officer who will not take away from the responsibility of the Minister and of the Minister to Parliament, but who will act as general the right manager of the whole Department, looking after its business interests exclusively. I am not saying a word that can reflect upon the departmental officers. I am convinced that they are able men, who are desirous of doing their best for the country. But, nevertheless, I should like to see a general manager appointed, who would act as does the general manager of any large business concern. I am not discussing whether or not the Postal and Telegraph Department should be put in commission. That is another matter altogether. In my opinion, however, no time should There' is be lost in appointing a General Manager, who should be a man of large experience, accustomed to controlling a Department in a vast territory. I - observe that it is proposed to establish a Savings Bank. I do not wish to touch upon that proposition at length; .but I call attention to the fact that, as appears from returns, and from the Budget papers, at the present moment £54,000,00 0 is invested in the Savings Banks of Australia. I want to know how these Savings Banks are to be conducted in the future. Are they to be conducted as a branch of the Post Office ? Will our departmental officers in future manage the Post Office Savings Banks for the States, or will they only manage - Savings Banks for the Commonwealth? If not, is it proposed that this £54,000,000 shall be called in, and the depositors paid off, or that in future this immense business shall be carried on by the Commonwealth alone? I hope that the Treasurer will give us some information in regard to what I consider a very serious matter indeed. I direct attention to it now only to invite the honourable gentleman to do so.",18
32,Mr DEAKIN,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,We 'should hear something about it during this debate.,19
33,The CHAIRMAN,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,I remind the honourable member that there is a Bill on the paper dealing with the matter.,19
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,We have nol dealt with that Bill yet.,19
35,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,The business has been taken away from the post-offices in the main centres of New South Wales.,19
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"But what about the many hundreds of places that cannot be considered main centres? There is £54,000,000 in the Savings Banks of the Commonwealth in the name of 1,250,000 depositors, and representing an average of about £ 3 6 per head. Those who listened to the Treasurer's speech, or who have since read it, must have come to the conclusion that the honourable gentleman is gradually beginning to see the necessity for the establishment of loan funds, for he says in regard to last year's balance of £1,829,524, which he intends to spend this yearI have decided to use ^1,712,679 of this amount during the current financial year for non-recurring works which it is usual for Governments to pay for out of loan funds. It seems that a change has come over the right honourable gentleman since 30th November, 1909, when he told us that "" a borrowing policy is contrary to the policy of the Labour party."" In my opinion, he will find it impossible to develop the Northern Territory, to build railways there and to Western Australia, or, in fact, to carry out any very great public work if he intends to here to a non-borrowing policy. Our honourable friends miist either resort to a very - drastic system of taxation-and even that .would not meet the difficulty-o r when the - Labour Conference meets next year they will have to change that plank in their - platform.",19
37,Mr ROBERTS,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,The statement that the the Government propose expenditure from ordinary revenue which it is usual for Governments to defray from loans is not inconsistent with a non-borrowing policy'.,19
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"I think it is, or the Treasurer, after making the statement, would have added that the Government did not intend to borrow. He did not on this occasion say that a borrowing policy is contrary to the platform of the Labour party. It was in 1909 that he said so, but he was not in office at that time.",19
39,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,But surely the Labour policy is a non-borrowing policy?,19
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"I do not think so, or the Government would not be undertaking the great public works they have in mind in the development of the Northern Territory, the establishment of the Federal Capital, and the construction of railways in many places. I notice that very little was said by the Treasurer in regard to one of the most important matters which he and his party have been continually dealing with during recent years. I refer to the expansion of closer settlement. We heard very little, if anything, as to the effect of the land tax in bringing about that desirable result. The Treasurer did not tell us how many people-o r perhaps I should say "" poor people,"" for that was the cry--ha d been settled o""n the land in consequence of the operation of the land tax, by which 14,412 land-owners were singled out, and were called upon to PY ^ >37°>357 during last year. We a I heard nothing of the result of this policy, that was going to make the desert smile, and convert large areas of unoccupied land into fertile farms, settled by numbers of people, who in the past were unable to obtain land. We heard a good deal about the expansion of revenue, and the credit balance of £1,829,524 at the end of the financial year, but we heard nothing about the advance of closer settlement. I should like to ask what has become of the closer settlement cry of which we heard so much last year. Were honourable memad- bers opposite in earnest at the time, or was it only a political cry ? If the right honourable gentleman has the information he might let us know how many people have been settled on the land in consequence of the operation of the land tax. He might say what large areas have been cut up and settled upon by desirable poor people. All I have to say now is that the Treasurer did not give us that - information. It seems to me that, as I think I have shown already, the country has progressed owing to good seasons. Honourable members opposite have been careering about the world, and appear now to be far more comfortable and satisfied with their surroundings than they were when they first took their seats in this House. As a consequence, the closer settlement which was to be brought about by the operation of the land tax appears to have been almost, if not entirely, forgotten by the Treasurer in the preparation of his Budget speech. I heard one honourable member say last session that, if during the term of this Parliament-that is to say, three years-lan d settlement had not progressed as a consequence of the operation of the land tax, and if the change they anticithe pated had not taken place, he would be prepared to confess that it was a failure. My own opinion is that he will have to confess it. Then the Treasurer did not refer in a practical way to the question of immigration. I thought we were all agreed that it was sirable to hold out inducements to persons of a desirable class to come to Australia. But the Prime Minister omitted to refer to the subject at all, beyond saying that it was the intention of the Government to build an office for the High Commissioner in London, and to attract immigrants to Australia by that means. Upon referring to the Estimates I find that the sum of £1,000 has been provided for this purpose during a period of two years£1,000 was voted last year, but not expended, and the same amount is to be revoted this year. I would like to ask the Government what is their policy in respect of immigration ? Are they in earnest about it, or are they merely trifling with the matter ?",19
41,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,They cannot obtain ships in which to bring immigrants to Australia.,20
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Are they endeavouring to do so? I said when I returned to Australia from the Coronation festivities, that the High Commissioner has not the power to expend a single sixpence in granting an assisted passage to an immigrant to this country. I will quote the Treasurer's own words in regard to the steps which the Government have taken to encourage immigration. He saidA building worthy of the Commonwealth in London, properly equipped for the Commonwealth and the States, would be a bigger advertisement for Australia than perhaps £100,000 spent in another way would be. People would then learn about Australia. They have only to know what the conditions of Australia are, to come here of their own accord. This, then, is the policy of the Government in respect of immigration. They propose to erect a large building in London, so that people may learn all about Australia. According to the statement of the Prime Minister residents of the Old Country have merely to become acquainted with the position of Australia to be induced to come here of their own initiative. The sooner it is known everywhere that that represents the immigration policy of the Government the better. Evidently they think that all the people whom we desire to attract to Australia live in London. They entertain idea that if these persons see a large building in London-the only large building, I suppose, which is to be found in that great metropolis-the y will come here of their own volition. I should like to say one or two words in regard to the question of old-age pensions. For the year 1909-10 the expenditure under de- this heading, including the cost of administration, which I notice is not included in the total cost on these Estimates, was £i>533,753; in 1910-11 it was £1,906,016; and the estimated expenditure during the current year is £2,231,927. In other words, during the three years which have elapsed since the inauguration of the system the expenditure will have been £5,671,696. From the latest return, I find that there are 77,719 old-age, and 8,670 invalid, pensioners in Australia, a total of 86,389 out of a population of, approximately, 4,500,000. These figures, I confess, impressed me as being rather startling, but I have taken the trouble to verify them by reference to the Commonwealth Statistician. In other words, about one person in every fifty-two in Australia is an old-age or invalid pensioner. As there are about 180,000 persons in the Commonwealth who are over sixty-five years of age, it follows that nearly one-half of them are in receipt of the old age pension.",20
43,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,That demonstrates the aggregation of wealth in the hands of a few individuals.,20
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"T cannot follow the honourable member into a discussion of that aspect of the question. I am merely stating n fact, and the honourable member is at liberty to deal with it as he chooses. I repeat that nearly half the persons over sixty-five years of age in tralia appear to be ih receipt of an old-age pension. That is a sad reflection upon a new country like this, with all the opportunities and advantages which it offers. I confess that I was absolutely astounded when I looked into'the matter.",20
45,Mr ROBERTS,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,It is a sad reflection upon past Governments.,21
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,I do not say that. I am very sorry to know that fact is as I have stated.,21
47,Mr ROBERTS,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Tell us how it hapknowledge pened.,21
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"I do not the think that"" I would get any further i did, because I might assign reasons which it would not suit the honourable memshackling ber to agree. I come now to the sugar industry. I regret that so much time has been lost dealing with this industry in an effective way owing to the inaction of the Governdustry ment. When they assumed office, they were not prepared to appoint a Royal Commisposes; sion to inquire into the conditions surroundand ing it ; but now, after the lapse of eighteen months, they have done' the very thing which others, who possessed more knowforward ledge on the subject, thought it necessary to do at that time.",21
49,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Why did not the ment of which the right honourable member was a Minister, appoint a Commission?",21
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Why did the Government do it during the past eighteen months? They always put till tomorrow what they can do today. is said that the report of the Commission will depend largely upon the view which taken by its chairman, because so much satisfaction exists with the remainder its - personnel. I know nothing about Commissioners with the exception of chairman.",21
51,Mr ROBERTS,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"There is no more honoris, A i nscheme able mari in Australia than the chairman of that Commission.",21
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"I know him Now well and favourably. Indeed, he has friend of mine all my life. Surely honourable member did not understand to say anything against him ?",21
53,Mr ROBERTS,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,I understood the right .honourable member to reflect upon him.,21
54,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Nothin g of of the kind. I merely said that the general impression is that the report of the mission will rest largely with one manits chairmanWhen Royal Commissions Aus- are appointed, it is very much to be regretted that persons cannot be chosen to act upon them who are presumably unbiased.",21
55,Mr BAMFORD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Does the right honourable member know anything about the personnel of the Commission which was proposed by the late Prime Minister?,21
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"I do not even remember the names of the Commissioners whom it was proposed to appoint. the I was not here at the time. But I hope that they were persons possessed of a of the industry, who would not be likely to be biased either one way or other. All I can say is, that if the f I sugar industry has not been ruined, we with have gone the right way to ruin it by it, and by refusing to give it a chance. The only way to give the industry a chance is not to interfere with it. There in has always been a desire, on the part of honourable members opposite, to use the infor political purposes. They desire to keep control of it for their own purthat is, I think, very undesirable wrong. Honourable members, on the other side, have hampered the industry in every way, instead of taking the straightcourse of allowing it to go along unshackled, making whatever regulations they consider desirable, and letting the Governsugar-growers conform to them. There is another important matter which was lightly touched upon by not the Treasurer, but which I think deserves fuller reference, and that is off the taking over of the State debts. When It the Labour party were in opposition there was no one so strong, almost violent, as is he was about the necessity of taking action disat once. The immense sum which we were of to gain by the transaction was quoted to the us over and over again. On the 7 th Dethe cember, 1909, the Treasurer saidf o r the transfer of the State debts my opinion, the only safe way to safeguard the financial interests of the Commonwealth. that he has been in office for a year been a and a half what does he say? He the says, "" The time is not opportune, me the difficulties are insuperable."" We have here an illustration of the policy of the present Administration-the policy of do nothing, the cry of despair, the cry "" time not opportune, difficulties insuperable."" Is that the sort of way in which Comhe should deal with an important matter of this sort ? Is there to be one sort of language used when he is in Opposition and another sort of language used when he is in power? Are honourable members, on the other side* to be always finding fault with people for doing nothing, or not doing what they want when they are in Opposition, and when they get into power to do nothing themselves? Why, the honourable member for Yarra never lost an occasion of talking about the Tariff, and the iniquity of the then Government not doing something to save "" the strangled industries"" as he termed them. He has been in office for eighteen months, and has done nothing. "" The time is not opportune, the difficulties are insuperable "" with him, too. I charge the Prime Minister with not consulting any financial authorities in London on the subject of taking over the State debts. He has said that he did consult some one, but he has not told us whom he saw. There is no secret about the financiers in London; we know who they are. I saw a great many of themi in 1906, when I was in Londonthere was no difficulty in seeing any of them-and when I >eturned I told honourable members the names of every authority I had seen. Why has not the Treasurer told us the names of the financial authorities he consulted? Why is there all this secrecy on the part of the Treasurer ? The time has come when we should speak out in this matter. When the right honourable gentleman says that he consulted one of the greatest financial authorities, I want to know whom he consulted, how long he was in consultation, and when? My belief is that he did not consult a financial authority at all, except in a casual way. If , however, he did, let us know all about the matter-who m he did consult, and how much time he gave to the discussion of the subject. I say most deliberately that, being in London a> rhe Coronation with the Secretary to the Treasury, at his elbow- a man who knows all about the finances of Australia-the Treasurer neglected his plain duty in not taking advantage of that opportunity to get th= best advice he could on this subject. is pretty clear that the Treasurer did not, while he was in London, consult the financial authorities in a way which I think we had a right to expect him> to do. Having neglected his opportunity he comes back and tells us that the time to deal with the transfer of the State debts is inopportune, and that the difficulties are insuperable. He forgets all about what he said when he was in Opposition. He forgets all about safeguarding the interests of the country. He forgets all about the saving of millions of money. This is, I submit, a matter of vital importance when we are standing almost on the edge of a precipice. Although the Treasurer was for months among the financial authorities of the world, and attended by his officers, he neglected the opportunity to consult them, but returned to Australia and uttered this cry of despair, ""Time not opportune; difficulties insuperable."" He snould remember that, in 1912, loans to the amount of £11,500,000 will mature, and that, during the next seven years, loans to the amount of £80,000,000 will mature. Still we have this despairing cry of "" Time inopportune; difficulties insuperable."" It seems to me that the right honourable gentleman has no energy left in him to do anything. Honourable members opposite do not seem to take any notice of what he does or does not do. For all the good they do, we might just as well have no members of the Labour party in this Parliament. They do not criticise, except to indulge in some make-believe "" heroics "" now and again.",21
57,Mr BAMFORD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,The honourable member should come up to the caucus-room some of these days.,22
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"What do we want with a caucus-room? Let the people of the country know what honourable members opposite say in this House. We on this side are not "" dumb-driven cattle."" In regard to the note issue, I think that, if it is wisely administered, it is a good policy ; but, like everything else in the policy of the present Government which is of any value, it was prepared by their predecessors. It was all there when they took office.",22
59,Mr ARCHIBALD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,What ! the note issue ?,22
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Yes , the whole of the information was all ready in the Treasury when they took office. Like everything else in the policy of the present Government, it was prepared by the late GoIt vernment. The note issue, the Naval and Military defence, the Australian Fleet, the penny-postage, the trans-Australian railway - ever y progressive measure which honourable members opposite have, like cuckoos, taken possession of-belon g to the previous Administration. Every good thing in their policy belongs to us. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They did not have the bank?",22
61,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"That is right I do not lay claim to that. We prepared the ground, and our successors-honorabl e members opposite- "" are reaping where they have not sown, and gathering where they have-not strawed."" During this year the expenditure on the Northern Territory will-exceed its revenue by £411,000. The revenue is estimated at £48,000, and the expenditure, including the loss on the railway, at £459,000, showing a deficiency of £411,000. I wish - to let honourable members know how this amount is made up, because the information will be useful to us by-and-by. Interest on loans, sinking fund, extraordinary maintenance of railway, & c , £331,010; police and gaols, £11,760; postal, .£18,899; gold-fields' administration, ^'3>4 SJ 1 general administration, £39)773; railways, salaries, and contingencies, £17,425; buildings, artesian bores, road and bridges, and experimental farms, £26,900; making a total of ,£459,182, from which we may deduct £48,000 obtained from revenue. There is nothing in this expenditure that is encouraging. Parliament surely expected the Government to announce a policy in regard to the Northern Territory. It would appear that now they have the Territory Ministers do not know what to do with it. They have no policy, and are willing to sit still and clo nothing. One thing that ought to be done at once is the making of railways, to open up the country and make the land available for settlement. Surveyors should now be in the field, selecting routes for lines to the Queensland border, to Oodnadatta, or wherever they may be required.",23
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Minister s do know what to do with the Territory.,23
63,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"They have no policy, as is shown by the proposals for expenditure to which I have just referred.",23
64,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Thos e proposals indicate a stick-in-the-mud policy.,23
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Yes ; a ""donothing "" policy. The Treasurer says that in order to have everything in Teadiness settlers whom we hope shortly to be able to to the Territory, officers in connection with all the producing interests are about to be appointed, and arrangements made for a number of public works. I ask honourable members to notice the phraseology employed. Officers are ""about to be appointed""; arrangements are "" about to be made."" There is nothing definite. The Government propose to expend on surveys £ 1 , 7 8 1 ; on agriculture, j£>5 5 J 2 0 1 1 buildings, artesian bores, roads and bridges, and experimental farms, £26,900. This is their policy, and shows how little Ministers are capable of realizing their responsibilities and their duty in controlling this vast Territory. Turning now to the Tariff, I would remind the Committee that, when in Opposition, the present Minister of Trade and Customs was always demanding that Tariff anomalies should be dealt with; but since he took office he has forgotten the subject.",23
66,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Is he not inquiring ?,23
67,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"We were told in the Governor General's SpeechThe effect of the Tariff upon Australian industries is being carefully watched by My Advisers with a view to revision wherever the information obtained by them shows this to be necessary. The Minister was almost a prohibitionist when out of office, but in office he finds nothing at all to do. It cannot be wondered at that those who hear the statements of Ministers, and see how little is being done, are driven almost to despair by the incompetence of those at present administering the affairs of the countiy. This is a criticism I read in an influential newspaper this morningThe Labour Government is displaying an incompetence for work that its friends could not have believed possible. Both in administration and legislation, incapacity is written in broad, deep letters across its record. Those words will be echoed throughout Australia. The electors of Boothby have already expressed their opinion in unmistakable terms in regard to this policy not of "" do-nothing,"" and even the supporters of the Government must be dissatisfied. In proof of that statement. I quote the honourable member for Herbert, who says- "" You should hear what goes on in the Caucus."" No doubt, as much dissatisfaction is expressed in the Caucus as in this chamber. Unfortunately, Ministerial supporters are not free to say what they think, except in mock ""heroics"" in for the the House. No doubt, they are glad to invite hear our criticism, because, I believe, it accords with their views. Coming to the subject of defence, I rejoice that Australia is taking measures for its own protection, and is assisting in the defence of the Empire. The defence expenditure in respect of the current year, 1911-12, is estimated at £4,775,136, or over 21s. per head of the population, while the expenditure of the Old Country on account of the Army and Navy amounts to £68,000,000, or 30s. per head of the population. Our expenditure on Fleet construction last year amounted to £1,135,000, whilst this year it is estimated that we shall expend £1,515,000, so that in two years we shall have taken out of revenue for this purpose £2,650,000. I desire particularly to point out in this connection that the land tax collected last year amounted to £1,370,357, whilst it is estimated that this year we shall receive from the same source £1,430,000. That amount is paid by 14,412 persons. other words, 14,4x2 land-owners in Australia will have paid thus far the whole of the cost of Fleet construction, and £150,000 in addition. They alone are providing for the naval defence of Australia so far as Fleet construction is concerned. Mir. THOMAS - And who has provided them with the wealth to enable them to do so?",23
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Who has provided the wealth that honourable members possess ?,24
69,Mr ARCHIBALD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,The right honourable member for Swan wants the working people to provide for Fleet construction.,24
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,The honourable member apparently does not wish me even to state the facts.,24
71,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,They are pleasant from his stand-point.,24
72,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"On the contrary, he and his party ought to be pleased with them. These 14,412 persons-and not the people of Australia, out of the Consolidated Revenue or by way of Loan Funds - ar e thus far providing for the construction of our Fleet.",24
73,Mr LAIRD SMITH,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Where did the right honourable gentleman propose to obtain the inoney ? - Sir JOHN FORREST - Unde r my scheme the people would have had to pay for it, but gradually, and not all at once. Statements are often made as to our duty to defend our country, and those who contribute nothing towards the defence of Australia have most to say about it. A few of my honourable friends opposite are among the 14,412 land-owners who are annually contributing this large sum, but they do .not look with so much pleasure upon the fact as do others who are not making any contribution towards Fleet construction. It is easy to express generous and patriotic sentiments when it costs nothing.  generous with other people's money.",24
74,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Exactly . We generally find those who shout most loudly for a thing are those who are not likely to be called on to contribute towards it. I agree with the sentiment that it is our duty to defend our country, but the policy of the present Government is to make only one in 306 of our population-onl y the landowners-provid e for it. I do not Know that it is desirable that the land-owners In only should build the Fleet. It is, to say the least, remarkable that, notwithstanding that these 14,412 land-owners are finding the money to build our Fleet, honourable members opposite, judging by their interjections, are not even willing to give them credit for doing so.",24
75,Mr ARCHIBALD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Why is the honourable gentleman worrying over an historical fact?,24
76,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"The honourable member for Hindmarsh seems to be inclined to say, "" Let the land-owners pay, whether they are rich or poor. Even though they may be as poor as Lazarus, let them pay, and we will rejoice and take credit for selfsacrifice and for patriotism which cost us nothing.""",24
77,Mr ARCHIBALD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,They find the money but the rank and file are recruited from un- the working classes.,24
78,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"I wish to emphasize the point that this contribution is made, not by all people who possess money, but only by 14,412 of the landowners of Australia.",24
79,Mr ARCHIBALD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Chee r up 1 There will be more of them yet.,24
80,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"The honourable member, like a good many others, wants to take all the credit for self-sacrifice and patriotism, especially when his patriotism costs him nothing. Leaving that matter, I am glad to see that the Government are carrying out the policy of their predecessors in standing shoulder to shoulder with our kinsmen in the Old Land. Responsibility has sobered the wild and unpatriotic selfishness of honourable members opposite. We used to hear a good deal from them a short time ago, but responsibility has sobered them, and they take a different view of this question from that which they entertained when Federation was established. M i . KELLY - It would not be popular to take the same view now.",24
81,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,I shall give them credit for a broader and nobler sentiment.,25
82,Mr ARCHIBALD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,Then the right honourable gentleman thinks we are getting along ?,25
83,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"The electors have insisted on the wider and better view, ancl honourable members opposite have not been slow to realise it. Very few members nowadays can go on the platform and speak disrespectfully of the Old Country, and of defence generally, as they used to do. Those who attempted to do so would probably find that their re-election would be jeopardized. In effect, the feeling throughout Australia is now, I rejoice to thinkOur country . . . . may she always be in the right; hut our country, right or wrong. In a memorandum on Naval Defence, dated 15th March, 1902, I wroteOur aim and object should be to make the Royal Navy the Empire's Navy, supported by the whole of the self-governing portions of the Empire, and not solely supported by the people of the British Isles, as is practically the case at the present time. It is, I think, our plain duty to take a part in the additional obligations cast upon the Mother Country by the expansion of the Empire and the extra burdens cast upon her in maintaining our naval supremacy. Those sentiments did not find much favour at the time, especially from honourable members opposite, but I submit that they are the foundation on which our present naval policy is based. At Henley-on-the-Yarra, two or three weeks ago, I saw an immense concourse-it was estimated by some that there were 100.000 persons present-and I could not help being struck by the well-conditioned appearance of that enormous gathering. I believe that, in that respect, it could not be surpassed in any other part of the world. It represented, of course, only this part of Australia, but still I think it indicated to a very large degree the position of the Australian people today, and 1 could not help thinking that such a concourse of well-conditioned people, at a large centre like this, showed what had been done in Australia during the sixty years that it has been a self-governing British community. Notwithstanding that .there may have been courses adopted at times which might not now be thought the best, I could not help thinking that the record was still a great one. When we cast our eyes round Australia, and see the work that has been done, and the developments that have taken place, not in one spot alone, but throughout this immense continent, we must acknowledge that our record is one of which we may all be proud. The next thought that came to my mind was, "" How does that record tally with the disparaging observations I have heard made by honourable members of the Labour party opposite, who have said that the past had better be forgotten, that the page had better be turned down, as there is nothing worth remembering in it"" ? When I remember that the party which I represent here today have been the controllers of this country, and that its record has been their record and their work, and that honourable members opposite are only "" in the morning of the times,"" as it were, in regard to their record; when I recall that all that has been done has been the work of Governmentsrepresenting, for the most part, the party to which we on this side of this House belong today, I feel impelled to say, "" If we seek a monument for ourselves, if you seek a monument for us, look around this country, and you will find it . "" I can only hope that, whatever parties are in power in this country, when they come to look back upon their work in the years that are before us, they will be able to rejoice at the record behind them, as I do in regard to the great record behind us.",25
84,Mr HEDGES,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"Fremantle) [4.34] There are many matters in the Estimates which cannot be allowed to pass without comment. As a representative of Western Australia, one of the first matters that I must mention is the very small provision made for the transcontinental railway. Only £22,500 is listed for this big work. That seems almost ridiculous. If the Government ascertained that a' contractor who had tendered for only a little bit of the work had only that amount at the back of him, I doubt if they would accept his tender. To my mind, it is simply foolery to pass an Act and then back it up with this small amount of money on the Estimates. It is playing with work. There is no sense in it, and it would have been better for the - Government not to do anything at all. Surely they must recognise that all the people in Australia cannot be fooled' into thinking that this big work can be carried out, or even properly begun, unless backed up with more money than this. The Government might buy some plant that is worth more money than this, and then find that it is of no use to them. It is a thousand to one they will do so unless they alter their methods. Some provision should have been made for engaging a competent engineering staff and a competent staff for managing the construction of the line. Nothing can be done unless money is spent, and the right direction to spend it in is in securing the best engineering skill available in the world. In connection with this work we require a knowledge of up-to-date appliances and rolling stock, and the best men will be the cheapest. A long stretch of country has to be covered, and if £100,000 had been placed on the Estimates for preliminary water supplies alone* before the railway is touched at all, it would still have been a very small amount; but £22,500 will not keep the office going in Melbourne. To my mind, it is as good as telling me that the work is not going on at all.",25
85,Mr BAMFORD,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"It is only intended for a "" shivoo"" when they turn the first sod.",26
86,Mr HEDGES,STATEMENT IN THE ENGLISH,"I recognise the value of that suggestion, because I believe there are any amount of "" shivoos"" going on that cost quite as much as this. The item from that stand-point may have some meaning, although it was perhaps not intended to have any. I am pleased to see that there is again a sum on the Estimates for a new quarantine station at Fremantle. It appeared last time, and only about £400 was spent out of £1,700. It seems impossible to get the money spent. Is it because we are short of labour in Australia, or how is it that when we vote money here we cannot get work done? An amount voted to do a work of that kind should never come befoie us twice. I find, also, that a sum of £5,000 was voted for .a rifle range at Cottesloe in 1910-11, and only £ 2 of it was spent, the balance now being re-voted. I suppose that work is in the same category as the transcontinental railway. Nothing is provided for the improvement of the Post and Telegraph Office at Midland Junction, although the Department in Melbourne must know that the office is altogether inadequate for the requirements of the place. It is a miserable little building with a small porch, which is usually crowded with people who cannot get inside. Do the Department recognise that, if they did put money on the Estimates for that purpose, the work could not be carried out, or what is the reason for delay? An amount of £700 is provided for the Claremont Post-office- a work that is urgently required, as is also that at Victoria Park. It is much to be regretted that no provision is made for providing the naval base at Fremantle, as recommended by Admiral Henderson. That officer's report was conclusive that the work should be done. He thought it important enough to head it, "" Fremantle, Special Requirements,"" and his recommendation was as followsThe harbour of Cockburn Sound, including Owen's Anchorage and Jervoise Bay, to be examined thoroughly ar soon as - possible by experts, with a view to locating the site of the future Naval Dockyard. The site should include space for graving docks, building slips, workshops, storehouses, and all plant, &c., for the building of ships and for the repairs and maintenance of a fleet. It appeared to me that a site in the vicinity of Jervoise Bay was best suited for naval dockyard requirements. A channel for deep-draught ships would have to be dredged through the Parmelia and Success Banks, and slight dredging would be required in other places. It would probably also be necessary that a short breakwater should be thrown out from Woodman's Point. In view of the fact that we are supposed to be taking the question of defence seriously, why is no provision made in this respect? Surely Admiral Henderson's advice is worth taking notice of? He goes on to sayI understand that plans and estimates have been framed for carrying out a great part of this dredgingAdmiral Henderson evidently had been given to understand that plans and estimates had been framed, and yet we see no money is provided on the Estimates. What was the use of humbugging Admiral Henderson by saying that plans and estimates had been framed? He goes on to sayand I am sure that it will prove of the greatest benefit, not only to the Navy, but also to the merchant shipping and commercial interests, as it would greatly relieve the pressure on Fremantle Harbor for shipping accommodation' which the future must inevitably bring. In the interim, the needs of the Fleet will be met byist - The completion of the dock now building at Fremantle, and of the repair and refitting shops proposed to be attached thereto at as early a date as possible. 2nd - The temporary provision of a base for six destroyers and three submarines in the Swan River. 3rd - The dredging of the channel, so that large vessels can find a safe anchorage in Cockburn Sound. 4th - The provision of adequate reserves of coal and oil fuel, &c. (*) A large area of land should be reserved foT naval purposes, so as to allow of considerable future expansion. [c) A site to be selected for storage of ammunition and explosives. We have been told that the explosives factory in Victoria is nearing completion, and that storage magazines will be established in the other States, but we see no provision made on the Estimates for this work. What was the use of bringing Admiral Henderson from England if his report is to be ignored? The Admiral also deals with the question of wireless telegraphy, and saysNA OF THE GENERAL POST OFFICE. With this object in view, it is recommended that the Commonwealth Government should take the whole matter of wireless telegraphy in tralian waters firmly into its own hands, from the first making it a Commonwealth monopoly, similar to the land telegraphic systems. In 1905 this"" Parliament, by Act, gave the Postmaster-General a monopoly of wireless telegraphy. Perhaps, however, the Admiral recognised that wireless telegraphy is no longer a Government monopoly, seeing that the shares of the Wireless Telegraphy Company are quoted on the Sydney Stock Exchange.",26
87,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The monopoly is held by the Postmaster-General.,27
88,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"If it is the ultimate destiny of all monopolies to be quoted on the Stock Exchange it would be better for those interested to allow the Government tb take over all companies, so that the shareholders may come in on the next "" deal,"" and, perhaps, make more money in that way. The Act to which I have referred provides that no one but the Postmaster-General shall have a monopoly of the wireless system, and yet the shares in the Wireless Telegraphy Company of Australia are quoted on the Stock Exchange.  construction ?",27
89,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,That does not matter; the shares should not be worth three halfpence if the monopoly is held by the Postmaster-General.,27
90,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,If he does hold it!,27
91,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The Postmaster-General is supposed to hold a monopoly by the Act we passed; and yet we have Admiral Henderson advising that wireless telegraphy should be made a Commonwealth monopoly in a similar way to the land telegraph system.,27

98,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The Government are going to.,27
99,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"It seems strange to me that this mysterious Wireless Telegraph Company should be offered a special amount to go on with a contract they have never signed, and that only when a stir was made in this House-no t only on the Opposition side, but on the Government side-di d they get a ""hustle on,"" and move the station from the top of the Bulletin office, the proprietors of which are part owners of the scheme, to the top of the Hotel Australia. That, I suppose, is only a very short distance, but it apparently made the enterprise a little more respectable. We were told by the Postmaster General that experimental stations were being erected in Sydney, but we were not told that they were to be on the top of the Bulletin office-no t a very creditable thing for the Commonwealth. The Admiral saidThe Commonwealth should erect, maintain, control, and operate all wireless telegraph stations that may be required either for public or private services. That is what this Parliament said when it gave the Postmaster-General a monopoly in wireless telegraphy. Furthermore, Admiral Henderson saidIt should be independent of all established undertaking the manufacture of its own instruments, and the training and control of its own operators. That also is what this Parliament determined in 1905. For this purpose it is necessary for the Commonwealth to secure rights to manufacture certain patents. There is another point to which no attenships tion has been paid. The Postmasterwith General has been beating around, and instead of acquiring patents, has been trying wealth. to pirate them?",27
100,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,What ?,28
101,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Although , in reply to a question put by me a week ago, the torney-General denied this, I say that Commonwealth has not been endeavouring to acquire patents in a proper manner. It is trying to acquire them, to pirate them, or to take them up by a side wind. The Government claim that they can use of anything they like. But they will find that they are in the wrong.",28
102,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Who says that?,28

105,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am simply quoting what Admiral Henderson says. It must be remembered that he travelled with a of the branchwireless expert, and based his advice upon knowledge.

The report says The Government should also require that all registered in Australian ports and fitted wireless apparatus, should carry apparatus manufactured and operated by the CommonWhy should not that be done? The Commonwealth, having the Treasury at its back, should have been the first to estabAtlish a wireless system. It should have the been ready, before any private shipping company installed wireless telegraphy on its vessels. It should have been in a position to say to ship-owners, ""You must not carry passengers on our coast unless make you have wireless telegraphy on your I think ships."" We should have taken the lead. That is what Parliament intended when it passed the Act and voted money for its It is therefore recommended that the wireless Tost Office. service should become a branch of the carry That is where Admiral Henderson was at the adfault.

112,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"If we had kept this work clear of the Post Office, it might have been done by now. Admiral Henderson further stated that the official at the head be in close touch with the naval authorities, for in all moments of national emergency the naval authorities must have entire and undiscontrol over all and every installation at the disposal of the Commonwealth. It was recommended that this official must personally responsible for the design and construction of all instruments, the erection and equipment of all stations, and for the training and discipline of all operators. teleBut the Government have got us into a nice fix. We are installing the Telefunken prosystem, whereas our war-ships the Yarra and Parramatta, have come out with the has Marconi installation on board. If that system is right in one place, it is right in another. I do not care what system we have, so long as it is uniformly adopted.",28
113,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The systems are interchangeable.,28
114,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"We must be in touch the with the British Admiralty, and work in with all other British-speaking nations: We must not be isolated in time of trouble. It is absolutely essential that the whole control should be under the Admiralty, and not under the Post Office, when war breaks out. About a week ago I asked the following question of the Postmaster-General on this subject:In view of the fact that the wireless station now being constructed af Pennant Hills, Sydney, is nearing completion, will he give instructions that the station be not accepted or paid for as completed until all tests are carried out as required by the conditions of contract as published when tenders were called, and all other conditions as specified are complied with, including the requirement that the system accepted shall be "" non-interfering at will . "" It is well known to every one who has studied the subject that it is impossible to instal a system that is "" non-interfering at will."" The Postmaster-General repliedThe wireless station at Pennant Hills will not be accepted or paid for until the conditions of the contract are complied with. Here is a condition of the contractRange ef Signalling - The stations shall fcave such a range as to enable them to exchange signals under the conditions of Test specified herein at the guaranteed speed of working during any hour of the day or night, and under any conditions as to temperature or as to dryness or humidity of the atmosphere. I am informed that it is quite impossible - to comply with that condition, and yet we are told by the Minister that he is going to see that the conditions of the contract are all carried out.",28
115,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Did not the honourable member ask a question in regard to that?,29
116,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Yes, I did, and I got a reply from the Minister that he was igoing to see that the conditions were carried out, though the honourable gentleman must have been aware that so far no invention has been discovered to make it possible to carry out the condition I have - quoted.",29

118,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Any one who has - studied wireless telegraphy at all must know that that condition is impossible of fulfilment. There is another matter in this - connection which I should like to bring - under the notice of the Committee.

If the words- "" Preference will be given to the Telefunken system"" had been written into the document, what was proposed could not have been made more clear. Any one who knows anything at all about the subject must know that the alteration meant a preference for the Telefunken system. I should like to know who is the power behind the scenes responsible for the insertion of these words in red ink in this form? The House should demand to know at whose instance this alteration was made.",29
119,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I have told the honourable member again and again that it was at the instance of the British Admiralty.,29
120,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable gentleman told me so, but I am going to show that it was not at the instance of the British Admiralty. I wanted the honourable gentleman to say that. I am only too glad that he is present. I expected that interjection from him. I asked a question on the subject some time ago, and got a reply from the honourable member for Barrier, who was then Postmaster-General. I askedWhen I was speaking, yesterday, I said that the tender-forms for the installation of wireless telegraph stations for Sydney and Fremantle were recalled, and altered by the insertion, in red ink, of a provision favouring the Telefunken system, whereupon the Postmaster-General interjected"" It was explained to the honourable member last session that that provision was inserted at the request of the British Admiralty by my predecessor."" Is that statement correct? To that question the honourable member for Barrier, as Postmaster-General, repliedThe explanation was made during a debate on a motion for adjournment moved by the honourable member, when, in answer to an interjection by the honourable member for Parkes, I stated that the provision was inserted at the request of the British Admiralty. I have here a report on wireless telegraphy which was presented to Parliament. It is a report of a. Conference on the subject, and is signed by W. R. Creswell, Captain and Naval Director, Chairman, W. T. Bridges, Colonel; J. Hesketh, Chief Electrical Engineer, Postmaster-General's Department ; and Cyril Peel,, Lieutenant R.N. I quote the following appendix B to the reportCOPY OF TELEGRAM. From Milson's Point, Sydney, N.S.W., Lieut. Peel, attending Wireless Conference, Melbourne. Pending ratification of Radio-Telegraphic Convention, it is not possible for Admiralty to recommend any particular system in preference to another; but whatever system is selected, it is essential that to readily communicate with H . M . Ships and to inter-communicate with any other system in use, and that such inter-communication should be allowed. Subject to above, Admiralty consider that Commonwealth may adopt what system they please, and, indeed, not confine themselves to any one system exclusively. That is signed by the Admiral.",29
121,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Then the red-ink alteration was not inserted by the Admiralty ?,30
122,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I have been making many inquiries on the subject of wireless telegraphy, and have cabled to almost all parts of .the world, including America. The result of my inquiries is that I find that the British Admiralty and the American Admiralty have acquired the right to use every system, but never permit any one to know what system they are using. They are too clever for that. That, I claim, is the position we should be in today. If any one discovers an improvement in the Marconi, the Telefunken, or any other system, the British and American Admiralties acquire the right to use it, but they never let the world know whether they are using it or not. In time of trouble, surely it would not be wise to advertise to the world what system of wireless telegraphy Ave have adopted. The British Admiralty have done what Admiral Henderson advised us to do. They have acquired rights in regard to all the different systems, and any improvements upon them, and they use them at their discretion. That is what we ought to do here.",30
123,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,There is a vast difference between our population and the population of the United Kingdom and the United States.,30

130,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Did the honourable member not say that our two war-ships are equipped with the Marconi system?,30
131,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I listened to the honourable member on the telephone system the other day until I was tired of it. I should like him now to listen to me on the subject of wireless telegraphy. Perhaps I had better read again what Admiral Henderson recommended. He wroteFor this purpose it is necessary for the Commonwealth to secure the right to manufacture certain patented articles, and to enjoy the use of certain patents. ' The Commonwealth would thus be free to carry out any experiments they might desire for the advancement of the system. That is exactly what the British Admiralty have done. Admiral Henderson is a British Admiral, and he very naturally advised us to follow the example of the British Admiralty. I think that is what we should have done. There is another matter to which I should like to refer, and which I think requires some little explanation. Upon n t h November, 1910, as will lie seen by reference to Hansard of that year, page 6037, the Postmaster-General, in reply to a question in regard to the wireless telegraphy station which it was proposed to erect at Sydney, said1. It has been approved to pay the contractors an extra sum of £2,000, owingto the location of the site at Pennant Hills. 2. The following amendments in the scheme as first accepted were rendered necessary by the decision to locate the station at Pennant Hills :It was necessary to replace the direct earth connection by an extensive electrical counterpoise. The power plant had to be increased in size by about 75 per cent., and the transmitting devices correspondingly amended. The necessary alterations were considered to the such as to justify an extra payment being made. The original tender, I may add, was £4,150. I now wish to show, from the paper which I hold in my hand, and which is published in England, how very much we are kept in the dark here. On the ist September, 1910, the British Australian contained the followingWIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. The contractors of the wireless telegraphy station in Sydney are to be paid £2,000 in addition to the specified contract price, owing to the site having been changed. The change was necessary, as the first site would have been within range of an enemy's guns. That information, I repeat, was published in England on the ist September last year, but at that time we in Australia knew nothing whatever about it.",30
132,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Does not the honourable member think that that was written in Australia ? - Mr HEDGES - I merely state the facts. In view of the circumstances to which I have alluded, it is for other honourable members to consider how the present . position in regard to wireless telegraphy in the Commonwealth has been brought about. I have been asked where I got my information in respect of the conditions to which effect has to be given. For the' benefit of the representatives of New South VVales, I will say that part of my information was published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 7th July last. Upon that date an expert in the employ of the Commonwealth called attention to the absurd guarantee of the company to transmit over a definite rangeduring any hour of the day or night, and under any conditions as to temperature or as to dryness or humidity of the atmosphere, a guarantee which was absolutely ridiculous, and which proved that the company had as little idea of what it was talking of as the postal authorities had in drawing up a specification bristling with technical absurdities. It is the first instance a wireless contract being accepted guaranteeing a definite distance. It is incorrect to speak of a wireless station having a perpetually definite range, for the stronger the sunlight the less conductivity of the ether to the electric waves. That is absolutely reliable information, which was obtained from an expert. We are all bound to answer to the public for the position in which our wireless telegraphic system occupies in Australia today. We have to read between the lines to ascertain how we got into this muddle.",31
133,Mr WEST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The information which the honourable member has quoted emanates from persons who are interested in a rival system. I know where it comes from.,31
134,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The expert who gave this opinion signed his name to it. I believe he has been in the employ of the Commonwealth for some years. Within the past three or four weeks I was asked to inspect this wonderful wireless station at Pennant Hills. It consists of a little bit of an angle-iron column, which is so many hundred feet high. But, as far back as 1909 or 1910, I pointed out that at Washington, in America, there is a tower 600 feet high, which is 50 or 60 feet in diameter at the base, and from 8 to 10 feet in diameter at the top, and that this wireless station has a radius of 3,500 miles. In such circumstances, what is the use of the Postmaster General telling us that we have the longest range station in the world? It seems to me that he should at least be supplied with as accurate knowledge as I can obtain. My information was derived from a book which anybody can buy, and which contains an authentic account of what is being done in the matter of wireless telegraphy in other parts of the world. Upon a previous occasion I brought this question before the House, and asked the Postmaster-General whether, in view of the fact that such results were being achieved at Washington, he would consider the desirableness of erecting a long-range station at the Federal Capital site. That is the place where we should have the longest range station in the Commonwealth. But, in opposition to my suggestion, we are told that we are to have the longest range station in the world opened at Pennant Hills within a week or two.",31
135,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Who said that?,31
136,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I heard the Minister say that it would be one of the longest range stations in the world.,31
137,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"There is a difference between "" one of the longest "" and "" the of .longest "" range station in the world.",31
138,Mr HEEGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I will look up the exact words used by the Minister when I have an opportunity of doing so. I now wish to make a few observations upon the question of the acquisition of these patent rights. I hold in my hand a document which was published by the Marconi Company, and which saysSome nineteen letters patent have been granted to the Marconi Company by the Government of Australia, covering the whole history of the invention of practical wireless. No system of wireless telegraphy operated by any foreign company can therefore be installed in Australia without infringement of the above Marconi patentj and we shall look to the Federal Government for the payment of our royalties on this account, even though cheaper foreign-made apparatus is put into establish the Australian wireless service.",31
139,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,What is the date of that communication?,31
140,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"It is dated 24th Nohave vember, 1910, and it proceedsWe have every confidence, however, that will be done to us in this respect by the Government when the time comes to settle the royalty question, as we have yet to learn British community or Government that would seize an invention which has proved itself such world-wide public and national utility the Marconi system, without regard for the rights of the inventors and for the upholding own patent laws, even though the foreign-made apparatus is offered at a very low price, which has the questionable advantage of being similar in design to that used by foreign vernments and Navies. That brings to my mind the statements lately made that the Germans are in money, antagonism to the British people. We are in this position-that we are establishing German system of wireless telegraphy. may be that they know more of that syssomething tem than we do. In time of trouble they may be in possession of some secret which carrying will make this installation absolutely useless to us.",32
141,Mr FENTON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Whenc e did we get the Marconi system? Is it not Italian?,32
142,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The interjection has Australia far from anything to do with the case, beher. cause I understand that Mr Marconi is English gentleman, in this sense, that he married to one of the most charming Engwould lish ladies, and was educated in England. Mr KELLY.^The Marconi Company is an English one.",32
143,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I have it from honorThis able members who have travelled on the same boat as Mr Marconi that none of us would recognise him as a foreigner in any way, owing to the term which he has lived in England. His company is English, and the whole of the transactions are carried out from England. My desire is to see uniform system in Australia, and if it be proved that the Telefunken system not working in collusion with some Gerto uphold. man system, that is, with people who are antagonistic to our race, then I shall be satisfied. We must demand a system which will at least allow us to be in touch with the British war-boats in time of trouble. Our safety depends upon the fact that we are under the wing of the British Government. In matters of defence we should be in touch with whatever they and so on ? are doing, and uniformity should be our first step. That is my opinion, as a Britisher. Through having been born in England I may be a little prejudiced in favour of things British, but I also a lot of the Australian in me, because I been here for thirty-three years. I claim that whatever we do should be done right for the benefit of Australia, and in harFederal mony with what is being done in Engof the land, because we are dependent on the British flag for our safety. It is not much of of a compliment to pay to the British as people to take one step towards installing of its a foreign principle. It is not a matter of a few thousand and pounds, but something beyond that. Any Goloyal Minister, who sits in the chair of the Postmaster-General, should find out who is at the bottom of this foreign systembeing installed. It should not be a matter of but a matter of something else. The people of the Commonwealth are entitled a to know the reason for this muddle, why It a wireless system is not installed, why is not done. We should be in a position to demand that all the boats passengers round our coasts should be installed with wireless telegraphy. When we were not certain as to whether the. Waratah was lost or not, we spent almost the cost of establishing a wireless station in in sending boats out in search of Even if it took ten times that amount, an if one of our big mail boats was known lo is be floating somewhere, what a position we. be in.

It seems to me that we are in a disgraceful position. system has gone beyond the experimental stage. It is a practical system which is in use in all parts of the world. I want honourable members to consider the matter seriously, and demand that something shall be done. We have an expert appointed, and we ought to see that somea thing is done. Honourable members on the can Ministerial side are quite right in deis fending something which they have I want honourable members to look at the matter as I am looking at it, and that is with quite an open mind. I desire to see wireless established all through Australia, and established as quickly here as elsewhere, and not have to wait year after year and see nothing done.",32
144,Mr FENTON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Are there any legal difficulties in the way, infringement of patents,",32
145,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The recommendations of Admiral Henderson, I repeat, seem to point to the fact that the first thing to be done was to acquire the rights, and then have to do something. We have been trying to do something.without acquiring the rights.' We should have the expert and the rights. I have been used to carrying out big contracts, and my opinion is that anything can be done as quickly in Australia as anywhere else, provided that there is straight sailing; but if we try to do something, and are told all the time that this part is patented, and that the other part is not, what is the use of the whole thing? Why not start properly by acquiring the rights? Let us see that we are on the same ground as the British Admiralty, as we will have to work with their representatives afterwards. I ask honourable members, no matter where they sit, to think over this matter seriously, and let us see if we cannot solve this problem. Whoever is to blame for getting us into this tangle ought not, in my opinion, to get a chance to land the Commonwealth in another tangle, because we have had quite enough of this confusion.",32

I also think that the Australian people should be congratulated upon the fact, because it was impossible that the revenue could have gone up with the leaps and bounds which it did without a great amount of prosperity in the country. Many a country has had an overflowing exchequer, but it could not be said that the fact indicated the prosperity of its people. I think that we should take some credit to ourselves, not that I look upon the possession of a full Treasury as a party question, because I recognise that good rains have a great deal to do with the prosperity in Australia. However we may desire, for party purposes, to make the most of the successes which attend the party in power, it is \vell to recognise that a bountiful Providence has something to do with the prosperity in Australia. I am not going over the whole of the credit for doing so. ground covered by the Budget. That is the task of ex Treasurers. None of us is surprised that the right honourable member for Swan can say little good of the finanwhen cial proposals of the Treasurer. No exuse. Treasurer ever appreciates the policy his successor; that is one of the conseonly quences of party government. My object is to draw attention to one or two matters of general interest. The right honourable member for Swan referred to the note issue so successfully launched by this Government. Even the commercial community now admits that no alarming consequences have flowed from a change which was spoken of as likely to have very serious effects. One good result of it is that the practice of charging exchange on notes issued by a bank in one State and presented for payment at a branch in another has been abolished.",33
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,It was abolished before the Government note issue.,33
150,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"When it was known that the Government intended, with the support of the Labour party, to propose a Commonwealth note issue, the banks put an end to the exchange on notes, a tax which fell most heavily on persons of limited means. Of course, the banks are not to"" be regarded as philanthropic institutions; they are capitalistic concerns, which deal in credit and make all the profit they can. But it was news to hear that the last Government had in contemplation a Commonwealth note issue. I feel sure, however, that it never would have proposed such an issue,. because ifs members and their adherents looked to the commercial community for support, and would not have gone out of their way to alienate it. We were told by the press, and it was said in this Chamber, by those who are now in Opposition who supported the previous Administration, that the note issue was a forced loan. Apparently, the right honourable member for Swan was willing to be a party to a forced loan. At any rate, his remarks are evidence that he, and those with whom he is associated, are travelling towards Socialism, though they are not so far advanced as we on this side are. He seems to regard it as a calamity that our Defence expenditure is met largely by the land tax, but I see no cause to regret the fact that the landed and wealthy interests are called upon to pay for the protection of the country.",33

T do not say that members of the aristocracy have not, as officers, shown as much pluck and courage as the rank and file,' but every one knows that it is people who have suffered most. I do not think that our land-owners are so selfish that, if a vote were taken, they would be found to object to paying their share of the cost of defending this great country. I wish to impress upon the Government the need for doing more for the development of the Northern Territory. I shall not lose an opportunity to press its claims on the consideration of Parliament and of the people. It will not surprise me if , later, some honourable member draws attention to the terrible load piled on the Commonwealth by the transfer of the Northern Territory, but I ask those who think that to remember what South Australia has done.",33

He reminds me of the statement in which Carlyle compares public men to owls catching mice. I am simply stating the historical fact that Australia kept the Territory white. Even if the transfer of the Territory means the placing of a heavy debt on the shoulders of the Commonwealth, it is well that honourable members should recollect that that debt would have been far greater had the Territory been handed over to a chartered company. It narrowly escaped such a fate when honourable gentlemen sharing the views of the Opposition held strong positions in the Government of South Australia. If the Territory had been handed over to a chartered company, what should we have had to pay for it? I am sure that the the people of Australia would not have allowed it to remain in the hands of such a company.",34
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The chartered company would have been a shattered company by this time.,34
160,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable member is at times very humorous, but he cannot get away from the facts I have stated. I offer these observations by way of apology for South Australia, because I anticipate that we shall be told that South Australians have practically saddled the Com: monwealth with a very heavy debt. Those who know anything of the Northern Territory-and our knowledge of it is very limited-kno w that in it the Commonwealth has a marvellous asset, and, that being so, we cannot afford to lose any time in developing it. I admit, with much regret, that the Parliament and the Government are at the present time very heavily handicapped in this regard. Our late friend, Mr Batchelor, as Minister of External Affairs,* was charged with the administration of the Territory, and whatever he might have done before he went to England, I know that after his return the question of the welfare of the Terrido? tory was never out of his mind. Two days before he died I had a long conversation with him in his room upon this very question. He was seeking information as to the best means by which to develop the Territory. It may be said that one reason for his anxiety was that he was a South Australian; but he had, moreover, sat in the South Australian Parliament for years, and had held, with others, over and over again, that the gigantic task of developing that Territory could not be grappled with by the State. He knew, however, as we all know, that the task was not too great for this Parliament to accomplish.",34
161,Sir JOHN FORREST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,He knew that milSouth lions were required for the work.,34
162,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"It was a question', not of obtaining, but of judiciously spending, the millions. Money may be wasted in the Territory as elsewhere, and I am very anxious that the Government should push on with developmental work on right lines. I have never had a keen admiration for the critic. One does not need much sense to criticise the other fellow, nor is great ability necessary to enable one to suggest something that might possibly be done by some one else. But there is something. to be done in connection with the Northern .Territory, and it should be done before many months have elapsed. We have already a railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek, and as quickly as possible large tracts of land there should be put under cultivation. It was the policy of South Australia for years to say that this and that could be grown in the Territory, and experiments conducted in the Botanical Gardens at Palmerston demonstrated the truth of the assertion. But I would urge upon the House the necessity of entering upon experiments on a larger scale. We should, for example, put 1,000 or 2,000 acres under tobacco. The late Mr Batchelor told me that the best tobacco in the world had been produced in the Territory. It was my opinion, years ago, that excellent tobacco could be produced there, and I believe that Mr Batchelor had up to-date information on the subject. What is there to prevent the Commonwealth from placing a large area under tohacco cultivation, so. as to demonstrate to the world that it can be successfully grown in marketable quantities? If we placed 1,000 or 2.000 acres under tobacco, we should be able to say to the people of the world'' Here is a marketable product. It has cost us so much an acre to produce it, and you can take up the work for yourselves.""",34
163,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I am with the honourable member as to that.,35
164,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Some such action must be taken. It is of no use to advertise to the world that this, that, or the other product can be grown in the Northern Territory. We must demonstrate to practical business men that those things can actually be grown in a productive manner, and put on the market at a price that will enable them to compete with other countries.  a vengeance ! Is that what built up Australia ?",35
165,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I do not say it did; but does not the honourable member realise that the Northern Territory has been considerably under a cloud?,35
166,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Is the honourable member aware that experiments have been made there?,35
167,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I know it ; but the circumstances under which they were made have not been altogether conducive to success. The country has never been tried as it should be. The same thing plies to wheat. It may astound honourable members to learn that wheat can be grown in the Northern Territory, but that was the opinion of the late Minister, and I believe it was actually demonstrated that it could be done. I could scarcely believe it, because I could never understand how wheat could be grown in a tropical country.  acres of it in tropical Queensland.",35
168,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am referring to the Northern Territory, where, I understand, the wheat is sown after the wet season-whic h lasts from November to February-and matures before the excessive heat. In that way Indian wheat has been grown there.  acres of wheat grown successfully in Central Queensland right inside the tropics.",35
169,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,That is so much in favour of the honourable member's argument.  mental farm when you know that the thing has been done by private enterprise?,35
170,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"If we wait until private enterprise goes into the Northern Territory, unless demonstrations such as I have indicated are made by the Government, we shall have a delay of some years, which we cannot afford.",35
171,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,We have already called for applications from men to do the very thing the honourable member has suggested.,35
172,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The same thing could be done in regard to cotton and rice. I have referred to these commodities because they always command a price in the world's markets, while many purely tropical products have not such a ready sale. I would also suggest that the Government should get hold of Australians, and give them every encouragement to go to the Northern Territory. I should even give them the land. I have never been a great believer in selling or leasing the land. We as a Parliament are more interested in settlement than in getting a few shillings or pounds out of the land. Settlement is the real thing, and I would confine the settlement of the Territory to Australians",35
173,Mr MASSYGREENE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Does the honourable member mean Australian-born?,35
174,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"No ; but the honourable member for Maranoa, for instance; who has spent thirty years in Australia, ap- could hardly be classed as an Englishman.",35
175,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"If a man has been out here for seven months, would you prevent him going up there if he wanted to?",36
176,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"There is a great deal of difference between encouraging a man to go, and preventing him from going. In free Australia a man cannot be prevented from going anywhere.",36
177,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,We ought to be glad to get any reputable people to go up there.,36
178,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Undoubtedly ; but I believe we should first get Australians, particularly those settled in Queensland, to go there. The Australians who are already settled in the climate nearest to that of the Territory are the men who should be encouraged to pioneer it. After they have done the work, we could encourage any one we liked. What has been done in one place can be done next door. We know, when a man has struck out a distinct line, how easily others follow, and what we have to be very careful to avoid is making the administration of the Territory top-heavy. We do not want a tremendous number of officials.  way.",36
179,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I hope not. should like to see the number of officials, connection with the overlooking of the work to which I have referred, limited. We do not want so much for this sort of pioneering work a man who has had an expensive training in agricultural colleges. We want practical men, who have gone through the mill. Men who have made money pioneering in Queensland are-just the type of men whom the Government should get hold of to start in this direction.",36
180,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,We want men who are prepared to go through the mill.,36
181,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"They will go if given sufficient inducement. Does my honourable friend doubt it, if we give them the land for nothing, and promise to assist them if they happen to be short of money ? Surely we can assist them to the extent that the Western Australian Government are assisting their settlers. We might also use the present line from Palmerston to Pine Creek as a base, and if there is good country-whic h we will find out very quickly-it might be desirable to extend it. It should be worked in the immediate future, so that we may get settlement as quickly as possible along the rivers, such as the MCArthur, Victoria, Daly, and others. Above all, it is desirable for us to push on for settlement purposes. There will undoubtedly be a strong temptation on the part of the Government to do nothing until the question of the transcontinental railway to the Territory is settled. I regard that railway as a matter of urgency, but the settlement of the country, from the Pine Creek railway, at the present time is of far more importance for the development of the Northern Territory. We are trustees of a vast and very valuable estate. I believe that honourable members who are sceptical as to its value will realise in a few years the truth of my remarks when they become more familiar with it. It is not a country of surprises. Its climatic conditions are the same, with very little variation, year in and year out. The wet season lasts from November to February, inclusive, and then the rain is done with. Those who are undertaking cultivation there ought to recognise that fact, and adapt their methods to the existing conditions. I have no doubt that the Australian, who has already overcome a good many difficulties will overcome the difficulties of the Northern Territory. I am very anxious that the Government should not delay the construction of railways into the Territory, because, otherwise, there is very little to be done in the I way of settlement. At any rate, there is in now the Palmerston to Pine Creek railway which can be used as a basis; and something can be done in this connection. I have no desire to dwell on the question of wireless telegraphy; but I urge on the Government that there has been too much delay already. There is no need, however, to "" wash any dirty linen,"" or argue as to who is responsible for the present muddle; we are all too anxious to get out of that muddle.",36
182,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,To get forward.,36
183,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Quite so. In this connection I hope the Government will not lose sight of the great necessity there is for a wireless telegraphy station at, or in the vicinity of, Cape Borda. That is a point passed by all the oversea shipping which does not come from Fremantle; and we all know that there is much shipping whose first port of call is Adelaide-. I shall not fill up Hansard by enumerating the shipping companies which I have in my mind, because they are, I am sure, well known to all honourable members. I do not know that, in the matter of wireless telegraphy, we are in such a deplorable position as the honourable member for Fremantle would have us believe. Not many weeks ago I saw conimunication made with Australia from a vessel 2,000 miles away from the coast, and, although we may have no stations, we have men-of-war and other vessels fitted with the Marconi system.",36
184,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,We ought not to be dependent on that.,37
185,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I quite agree; it is not very creditable to the Commonwealth that we should be dependent on the Marconi Company and their efficient installations on various ships for the benefits of wireless telegraphy. I hope the Government will push on with this matter as quickly as possible, so that any reproach which may lie upon us shall be removed. I do not refer to Cape Borda simply because I am a South Australian. There are other places where, I have no doubt, such communication is just as much needed; but a long knowledge of the requirements of the coast of my own State impels me to take this opportunity to bring the matter under the notice of the Government.",37
186,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Balaclava) [6.5]. - I congratulate the honourable member for Hindmarsh on the practical suggestions he made in regard to the Northern Territory, and I trust the Government will take these suggestions to heart. I have always felt that, whatever side of the House a man may sit on, if he has any suggestions of value to make, it is just as well to let Government know-anybody , as the honourable member has said, can criticise. I had made a note myself to deal with the Northern Territory, because I think that is the weak spot in the Government programme. We have not been given any idea what is proposed to be done in regard to the settlement of that vast territory. The Commonwealth Government has a revenue of £18,000,000 to £20,000,000 a year; and I am afraid that we are spending it in an extravagant, and not in a practical, manner-that a great part of our money is being absolutely muddled away. I was reading, only the other day, of two great men in Canada-Danie l Mann and one MCKenzie, I think, are the names-wh o have a high reputation in railway matters, and whose firm opinion is that railway construction should be ahead of settlement. These men have pushed out railways in all directions, and that is what we ought to do in the Northern Territory. Let railways be in advance of settlement; settlement will soon follow the railways. When in the State Parliament I said that, in the case of good land at disposal, I would put up houses and fences, and add the cost to the 'price at which the land was sold to the settler. This ought to be done in the Northern .Territory, so that either Australians or Britishers may at once find a home there. The little bit of money a man may have saved up can then be expended in stock and cultivation, instead of in improvements, and at the end of the first year he will have a return. Our greatest trouble in closer settlement hitherto has been that most of a man's savings are spent in improvements, and nothing is left to carry him on for the first year, and to provide cultivation and stock. If the Government propose to settle the country, let them build homes for the settlers; and we know that a man who is placed in possession of a home like that will work his hands off to retain it. Such a policy would pay a country; and when we have a revenue such as we at present enjoy, it would be much better to spend it in this way than in many other directions proposed. We have many extravagant schemes on which we are spending a great deal too much. Australia, as a whole, at the present, has a revenue of something like £50,000,000; and that is an enormous sum for 4,500,000 people. Out of such a revenue I am sure that a large sum could be saved for the settlethe ment of the country; and if we had here another 5,000,000 or 10,000,000 of people we need have no dread of any enemy, and I fancy we should scarcely need a navy. It is the paucity of population that creates all our trouble, and our vast unoccupied territory must cause covetous eyes to be turned in this direction. Settlement is the great thing; and I do not care whether they be Britishers or others who come, because, after their arrival, they very speedily become Australians. My father was an Australian when he had been here very few years; and he never left the country to the day he died, and the greatmajority of men and women who find their way ito Australia intend to make their homes here.",37
187,Mr WEST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I have never left Australia since I first landed.,37
188,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable member is only in the position of a great many others. Personally, I am quite content with the place, and I believe that contentment is shared by the great majority of people who reside here.",37
189,Mr HIGGS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,D e l understand the honourable member to say that he approves of the Government building homes for settlers ?,38
190,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I do; let the Government place houses on the land ready for the people. It will be money well spent, and we can add the cost to the price of the land. If the land be given for nothing, of course, we have only to charge them for the price of the building.",38
191,Mr HIGGS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I am sorry the honourable member's party will not agree to that pro,38
192,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Whic h party? Mr HiGGSi-The honourable member's party.,38
193,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"If the Labour party will go for it, I shall vote with them. I am afraid the Labour party are getting a little bit tired. I do not know whether it is the result of too long a holiday, or too long a session, or the Melbourne weather, but the Labour party do not display the'dash and pluck one would expect. I am glad that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has stirred them up a little. There is another matter that ought to have been dealt with in the Budget speech. All Protectionists expected to hear something about the Tariff anomalies. A large number of our protected industries are in a sorry plight at the present time. Take the woollen industry. Australia is being flooded with cheap imitation goods from foreign countries. The ready-made clothing trade is being very much affected. Parliament imposed a duty on woollens, but cotton goods and imitation woollens are allowed to come in free.",38
194,Mr WEST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Some of them are rubbish.,38
195,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"They are absolute rubbish. The other day I saw in a shop trousers marked at 4s. n d . per pair. They looked nice and bright and shiny; and I said to the shopkeeper, "" They look like nice articles; how do they wear?"" He said, "" They are made in Germany, and there is not a thread of wool in them. If you wore them on a rainy day, you would never be. able to put them on again."" That is the kind of goods that are coming into this country, and yet a Government which is supposed to be Protectionist will not do a single thing to help our industries.",38
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The Government buildings? are "" watching,"" they say.",38
197,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"They are good watchers, but that is not sufficient. The Minister of Trade and Customs has sent out circulars to manufacturers inquiring what wages they are paying, and what their profits are. I do not know what that has to do with the policy of the Government. It is not their business whether manufacturers are making money or losing; but unless something is done very soon, it is certain that manufacturers will lose a great deal, and we shall have some of our industries closed up. When we see - that £12,000,000 per annum are being raised from Customs and Excise, we must realise that enormous importations are coming into the country. It seems to me that a large proportion of the goods imported ought to be made in Australia, giving employment to our people and encouraging a large number of others to come to the country. There is a great cry for immigration. If we have factories in full work, and our people are employed, why need any one be afraid of others coming to Australia ? When I was in Canada, about six years ago, the same cry was raised. It was said that immigration would be injurious to the working classes. But at that time carpenters were earning £ 1 per day. I believe that they have been earning more since. Therefore, it is not a fact that wages fall when an immigration policy is encouraged. The same state of things will occur here. The greatest danger we have to face in this respect arises from droughts. If we have two or three bad seasons, and make no provision for them, we may have a lowering of wages and other troubles. But we shall experience no difficulty from the importation of people, as long as we encourage industries in which they may be employed. We also need to pay attention to the conservation of water. The Victorian Mallee, which is now so productive, was, twenty years ago, given up to the rabbit and the wild dog. Any one who visits the Darling district of New South Wales will see there millions of acres that, if irrigated, would be capable of settling a large population. Water conservation is the great require ment of Australia. Let us spend more money in the interior instead of wasting so much on ornamental buildings in the towns. At present, when a post-office is wanted, it takes the Home Affairs Department nearly twelve months to prepare plans. Why cannot the Department standardize our public Why can it not have plans prepared for offices, providing for four, six, or eight rooms, as the case may be, according to a standardized design ? Instead of doing that, however, a fresh set of plans has to be prepared for every new post-office that is required. If the Department standardized its plans, there would be no trouble about setting to work with the erection of a building in any part of Australia where it is required.",38
198,Mr KELLY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,It would not be possible to standardize plans suitable for different sites.,39
199,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,It would be possible to get very near to what was required. Look at the rows and rows of cottages that are built upon one design.,39
200,Mr WEST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Sometime s a post-office is on a corner block, and sometimes it is in the middle of a street.",39
201,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The Department might have two sets of plans to meet such requirements. Usually, however, a post office is erected so as to leave a margin of ground; it is not usual to erect such a building close up to the line of a street. This is specially the case in country towns, where ample land is available. Big post offices, such as are required in Sydney and Melbourne, are, of course, exceptional, but it would be quite easy and very economical to standardize country offices. It has taken the Department two years to put up a post office at Brighton. If a private building had had to be erected, it would have been finished in three or four months.",39
202,Mr FENTON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I suppose the people at Brighton are very particular about their post-office ?,39
203,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"They do not care what the design is as long as they get ihe building. When inquiry is made, it is found that the Post and Telegraph Department has referred the matter to the Home Affairs Department, and that the plans are in preparation. The same reply is made month after month.",39
204,Mr KELLY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The Minister's "" chasers are chiefly useful to show what the Department is not doing.",39
205,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"They are intended to show what other departments are not doing, and that the Minister's own Department is never to blame. The honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to the note issue. I do not know that any one seriously objected tc a Commonwealth note issue. When I spoke on the subject. I said that it was quite right that the Government should issue notes, but that it was necessary to maintain a solid gold reserve. As long as the Government has a sound reserve there is not the slightest difficulty or danger regarding the note issue. If we had a depression lasting - for a few years, and this country, instead of having gold poured into it, or keeping its own gold, had to export bullion, of which there was a shortage in the Treasury, there might be difficulties. But as long as the Government maintain a fair percentage of gold to cover the demand I do not think there is the slightest reason for fear. The basis of sound financing is to maintain an ample reserve to meet the notes. If the Government are going to issue nothing but paper money there will, undoubtedly, be depreciation. There is not much danger of that, however, because I am satisfied that the common sense of the people would prevent it. I have a word or two to say regarding the Defence Department. I should like to see rather more sympathy shown by the Departmait to voluntary associations connected with the defence of the country. I am a member of the general committee of the boy scouts of Victoria. We get no sympathy whatever from the Department.",39
206,Mr WEST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,What do we want an opposition show for?,39
207,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"There is no opposition show. The boy scouts' movement, since Lieutenant-General BadenPowell started it, has been taken up all over the world. The system was introduced into Australia before our Defence Act was passed. A deputation asked the Minister to take the boy scouts under the control of the Department, but he refused to do so, saying, in effect, that the military authorities had nothing to do with them, and did not care about them. We said that we had come in the interests of the morals of the boys. We thought that they should be considered. It is certainly in the interests of the boys' morals that they should be trained, but not that "" strong language should be used to them in the course of their training. We were informed that the Department is not supposed to look after the morals of the boys. I think that it ought to look after their morals. In the training of these lads, whether cadets or boy scouts, a system should be adopted under which their morals would be protected, at least while they were in the hands of their officers. I have a letter before me in which complaints are made of the language used by some officers to cadets under training. . Mr Fenton - Thos e officers should be put off at once, without hesitation.",39
208,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I agree with the honourable member. The writer of the letter says The use by officers of abusive and in many stances bad language is prevalent, and it should be stopped at once. Complaints have been made to the Departhave to walk long distances, or their ment, time after time, in connection this matter, and nothing whatever has done.",40
209,Mr ROBERTS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I have not seen ister of Defence on the matter, but if honourable member will give me specific stances, I can promise him that I shall not hesitate a moment in doing my best to put such men out of office.",40
210,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am glad to hear the honourable gentleman say that. have had previous correspondence with man who has written to me on the subject, and he knows what he is talking about. The complaint is also made that officers, addressing the cadets, frequently make disparaging remarks about the boy scouts. I have heard that myself. ""What is the good of the boy scouts?"" When boys are not very smart, strong guage is used towards them, and that must their kilts? have a very bad effect upon them. I think that the Defence Department might also be a little more sympathetic with sire that cadets living at a distance from their drill-ground should be the means of reaching, it. I asked a question the other day in connection with this matter, and suggested the free carriage by business. rail of naval cadets, who are required to go from St. Kilda to Williamstown for drill. It is too much to ask boys' 5 or 7 miles to a drill-ground, and then put in three hours at drill, when advantage will Mr.admit might be taken of a railway to transport them from the place, where they live drill-ground.",40
211,Mr FENTON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Shoul d not the State vernments come to our rescue in that .gard?,40
212,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"We have charge of the defence of the Commonwealth. This Parliament votes a certain amount each year for free carriage by rail of memown bers to and from their different States.

At present, in some cases they 1 with parents or they themselves must pay been railway fares. ' One honourable member asked what we want of boy scouts, the Minand in answering that I may say the that I think that volunteers are always in the best and pluckiest fighters, and lads who are willing to give up their play hours for the benefit of their country should be encouraged. I am in favour also of having distinctive regiments, in accordance I with the practice in the Old Country. Men the who have been members of the Black Watch or the Connaught Rangers have always taken pride in the fact, and so have in their descendants. We have a Scottish Regiment in this State, but I do not think that they get very much sympathy from the They say, Defence Department.",40
213,Mr FENTON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Would the honourable lanmember send them into the battlefield in',40
214,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I should have the deno objection if they cared to go.,40

ROBERTS - The honourable member that men would be of more use to the to the country alive than dead.",40
217,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"That is so, but it should be remembered that men take a Govery great pride in their regiment. There reis an air of nationality about these distinctive regiments, and national pride and sentiment amongst the members,, which it is a mistake not to encourage. The members of the Scottish Regiment pay for their uniforms, and I do not know why the Defence' Department should discourage",40
218,Mr WEST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,We do not want any disin Australia. They should all,40
219,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"They are Australians, but they take a natural pride the country from which they come. The honourable member will not contend that man is any worse as an Australian because his father was a Scotchman.",41
220,Mr BRUCE SMITH,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"How does the honmarks, orable member account for the different banners to be seen in an Eight Hours' Day procession ?",41
221,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Jus t so. A man takes pride in belonging to a certain union or party or organization. There may be, generally speaking, only one body represenled in an Eight Hours' Day procession, but there is a certain rivalry between different unions, and men take a special pride in the particular organizatary. tion to which they belong. Exactly from the same thing applies to the Scotoutlook tish regiment, and to the boy scouts, in New Zealand there are about of 12,000 boy scouts, and they are reevery cognised by the Government and enEstimates-whethe couraged in every way. In Australia have 30,000 or 40,000 boy scouts, and why should the Government desire to squelch the movement? The boy scouts anticipate should be encouraged by the Defence partment. They do not ask the Governshould ment to contribute anything to their exportunity penses. In the case of the deputation to Minister of Defence we asked only that toy scouts should be recognised, that they should be examined from time to time by submitted to tis. the drill-masters of the Defence Force, and that if they came up to the standard quired they might be passed on into the cadets or into certain militia corps. we found that the Department has no sympathy with the movement, and no sire to encourage it. If the movement is discouraged, and the scouts ultimately disbanded, the boys will have lost all interest in military work. I the Government should encourage the movebird's-eye ment, instead of permitting themselves to be led by the nose by the officers of Defence Department. It is well known rhat, in military circles, the paid maii_ ways looks down on the volunteer. That is the case, not in Australia alone, but' in Great Britain, and in every other counlacking. 1 try'. The paid soldier always ignores and snubs the volunteer. I say that we should do well to encourage every man and every lad in this country to learn to hold a gun and to shoot straight. Sitting susfended from 6.30 to J.4.5 p.m. Mir. DEAKIN (Ballarajt) r_7.45J --At in the sitting, during which the Budget was delivered by the Prime Minister, I took a occasion, on the spur of the moment, to offer some observations upon the proposals included in the Ministerial statement. Since then I have awaited a reply to my reor, at least, an endeavour to supply the larger and bolder outline altogether absent from the Prime Minister's deliverance. It was unfortunate that the mass of figures which he felt it his duty to lay before us, instead of being presented to the , Committee as a whole, were recited with merely brief connexions between one subject and another. The total effect was fragmenWe still await, either from him, or some of his colleagues, that general upon the financial position of the Commonwealth, which is always the feature the Budget speech. As a matter of fact, proposal which finds a place upon the r upon the general or the we Works Estimates-afford s us an opportunity to consider its merits or demerits, as the case may be. We have no need to that close criticism now. On the Decontrary, there is every reason why it be postponed till a more fitting oppresents itself. So far as I am the personally concerned, therefore, I do not the intend to touch upon any of the multifarious matters included in the proposals But what we missed most from the reBudget, and what we continue to miss, is the broad policy of these several proposals But when they are grouped together, so that they may be read both with regard to the decircumstances and the expenditure which have preceded this year's accounts and those which are likely to follow, in other think words, we were, and are, without that view of the whole situation which would enable the intelligent citizen of the the Commonwealth to form a general idea of where the ship bf State was being headed, althe kind of weather she had met, and what were her future prospects. As observed at the outsetof my remarks, this is wholly In the Estimates before us, we have the customary elaborate provision for a thousand-and-one' real necessities of the country, and for some"" which may riot be real; but nowheredo we find anything which enables us to judge' ouf national progress or comprehend our course. If is, therefore, almost impossible to initiate a Budget discussion such as we have been accustomed to while parliamentary traditions and practice were observed and the necessities of the Commonwealth studied. This is a misfortune, because at no other period during the session are we likely to be afforded that opportunity which is now passing by. I make a final appeal-becaus e it is not yet too late-that some member of the Government, after consultation with the Prime Minister, shall lay before us something which we .may take to be the scope and intent of the policy of the Ministry-if there be a policy-as surely there must be .somewhere underlying these various separated proposals. They can be considered severally upon their merits afterwards, but their necessary relation to each other, together with plain indications of the intention with which they are now proferred to us, should be supplied. Until they have been handled as one whole we shall find ourselves, even as the right honorablemem-ber for Swan found himself, when he attempted to dissect these various propositions, limited by the blankness of their presentation to brief comments on proposals which may radiate from a common - centre, and be associated with larger purposes, though so far neither have been disclosed to us. When the Prime Minister resumed his .seat, after having delivered his Budget, I .at once called attention, not only to the tire absence of a policy for which we were all looking, pointing out that much had been ignored which we expected to see treated with ""some circumstance, and emphasizing the fact that there were many omissions of which I ventured to make an imperfect catalogue. Of course, the general position of the Treasury is of so favourable a character, that with an overflowing revenue it becomes a question, not of additional taxation, but merely of the expenditure of moneys practically in hand. The proper place for applying a test to these proposals will shortly arrive. But owing to the termination of the period for Which the Braddon section operated, and to the superbly prosperous position which Australia occupies, the only questions before the Treasurer related to the disbursement of revenue, and hot to the raising of further funds. In that one regard, circumstances excused the absence of a policy. - So far this Budget is taken as merely a statement of the year's accounts. [92]- 2 Still, if , as one anticipated, these proposals, although they may be confined to the year, are to be taken as part of the permanent policy of the Government, an unexampled opportunity-that is unexampled in this' session-wa s afforded in which the Prime Minister could have put before us, at all events in bold outline, the principles which will actuate the financial policy of the Government. Under questions of financial policy, this would have involved considerations, from the financial side, and from other points of view, of the main features of their programme for this Parliament. Last year there was with some reason only a sketchy drawing of Ministerial aims, a defect repeated without justification or apology on the present occasion. We are in the concluding portion of the second session of this Parliament ; only one more session remains to be held, and it is extremely unfortunate that, instead of arriving at the present stage with a full knowledge of the extent and the character of the principal schemes which the Government are elaborating, we are left to collect them and connect them as best we can, dealing with them separately, as occasion may arise. In the course of our criticism of these Estimates we shall have some observations to offer, scrutinizing the nature and character of particular votes. But at that time it will be impossible to raise, or at all events to continue, any discussion which en- will grapple singly with even those subjects as they ought to be grappled with. The very fact that we shall be in Committee, faced with a particular item, will properly limit the scope of our remarks. Then, in addition to that, we cannot expect to obtain from honourable members, either on this side or opposite, the sacrifice of the time at their disposal for special or local analyses which must be made if we attempt to deal with some of the many great issues which are now before the Commonwealth. Since we are not to have an opportunity of replying in any sense with larger criticism now or at any later stage, I did not desire that my very abbreviated offhand comments, offered just after the Budget figures had been recited to us, should be misinterpreted. I then hoped that an opportunity would have been found for a statement of national policy, for which this House and the country are looking, and. for which this House is primarily, and the' country will presently be directly responsible. Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.].: The criticism of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, for instance, took up two or three important matters, on which he noticed the absence of any Ministerial guidance. He complained of the lack of information as to the attitude and the intentions of the Government in relation to the Northern Territory, and to the inadequacy of the Supply to be voted in that connection. This is not the first time during this debate in which that particular matter has been pressed home. But there again one is met by the natural reply that on votes which-we believe to be quite insufficient in this particular regard it will be open to honourable members to offer any views which they may think serious enough to submit for the consideration of the House.  do any good ?",41
222,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I have risen largely not so much to speak as to excuse myself for not speaking, because, apparently, - in this instance; and in most others it will do little or no good.  I feel about it.",43
223,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"We are face to face with proposals relating, for instance, to the Northern Territory, or to the Defence scheme, or to some other fragment of the Ministerial policy. We can, of course, offer some criticism, necessarily particular its character, and confined by the rules of debate, which may or may not accomplish something. There it ends. It is not a very bright prospect for accomplishing anything, but, at all events, we can only accomplish something in that particular regard. . It will soon be too late for us to endeavour to review our financial policy as one whole covering every other portion of the Commonwealth policy. In order that a relatively disproportionate amount of attention may be allotted towhat, by comparison, are - minor subjects, we shall be deprived of the opportunity of a debate which might, and ought to, have been centred on the great principles involved in the Budget,-thos e of which the House and the country should have a-clear view before they set to them their seal;.of endorsement - It will be too late..afterwards to. point out that; money wliichcould have been spared for some excellent purpose, but one -.of which, the circumstances .were . not realized, might have. been, betterdevoted to. that and not. another, .end,- - or - that certain proposals could have been linked, together Budget. with mutual advantage, or that certain omissions which will be discovered when . these schemes are launched, might and. ought to have been supplied. It will then be hopeless for us to attempt the task. The best evidence of this was supplied, as I have . said, by the manner in which the criticism of my honourable friend and late colleague, the right honourable member for Swan, was necessarily distributed over a whole series of matters instead of being first concen- ; trated upon the central and governing prin- ' ciple in the Budget-if there is one. In the few minutes which followed the Treasurer's statement of the figures of the Budget, attention was called ' to the absence of any indication of the policy of the Government with regard to the Tariff. Their attention has been invited by a whole series of speakers since then, but so far the Ministerial oracles are dumb. .' We are unable to arrive at any assurance, either as to the possibilities of this session, or as to the certainties of the next session. ' Yet, surely, in the shape of policy, not of detail, these might well have been given to us, could have been given to us,.' and, indeed, must be given to us, if this House and the country are to be able to apply to a question of that magnitude the prolonged and serious consideration which it needs. We may continue to seek in vain' in in this chamber to become aware of 'the proposals of the Government, even in a general way; but for Ministers to give. the information only at the time when they are being launched in some par- ticular form or forms is to deprive us and the country of the opportunity of taking' them together as a consistent whole. If we. are to attain a reliable summary of the facts of the national situation coupledwith some idea of the national policy .' about to be evolved, and the rela- > tion of these particular proposals, We. must be thoroughly well equipped. I am perfectly. certain that Ministers areno more blind than the community as a whole. more blind than the community as a whole is to the continually mounting returns de- rived from the Customs House. These were, never .contemplated by those who proposed the Tariff or by those who voted for it When we did give consideration to its revenue-producing qualities we at no time anticipated a condition of affairs which-would pour into the Treasury the huge sums, which we are now receiving, and of which we can make good use-this unforeseen and 1 unintentional and- , unexpected fruitage conies from a planting of ours made with - Mr DEAKIN - other intentions. No one desires to see - revenue of the Commonwealth reduced-w all rejoice at its growth-bu t we cannot - be blind to the fact that the stream of golden coin now pouring into sury arrives there largely at the expense of - the industries of Australia, thus causing ' delay in the development of those industries and interests.

228,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"They do. Ours is a double complaint: we desire more people, and a readjustment of the Tariff.

235,Mr HUGHES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,For years the honourable member had an absolute majority on the,44

But I rose chiefly to explain why the disof these and other.. large subjects r cannot ba entered upon now, and to excuse :m/ own abstinence from criticism where At could not be immediately effective, so that the business to be done here may be accomplished with celerity. The preferential trade agreements for which we have hoped are apparently no nearer attainment, though they have been vaguely mentioned several times during this Parliament. To those whose alarm and antagonism is aroused by the suggestion that the time for re-shaping the Tariff has arrived, no opportunity has been given even of developing the bounty system, nor have bounties been proposed for the encouragement of industries to which Protection, for some reason, may not be applicable with present advantage. There have been no proposals for bounties, even in regard to the rural production, which must play a large part in the development of the Northern Territory. In consequence of interjections, € have touched in anticipation upon the absence of any satisfactory solution of the present immigration problem. The Prime Minister is reported in this morning's newspapers to have said that he has referred for consideration to one of his colleagues the situation created ""by the inability of persons of the right class who are willing to pay their own fares to secure passages from the Mother Country to Australia. I do not know at what date it was referred to him.",44
237,Mr GROOM,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The late Minister of External Affairs, seven weeks ago, promised fo have the matter looked into.",45
238,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Quite true. I do not know when we may expect to have a statement of the Government's proposals in that regard, but honourable members generally will agree that our present condition is abnormal and unhealthy. It is unhealthy, both from the point of view of the Mother Country-fro m which many men and women are anxious to emigrate and yet to remain under the British flag-as well as from the point of view of Australia, since these people cannot be afforded the opportunity they desire to join us. It is unfortunate from the point of view of the Commonwealth, too, because the need for immigration is admitted all over Australia. It is an essential part of the policy of the Government that the Northern Territory shall be settled with all reasonable despatch. But nothing has been done. I admit that no general or wholesale scheme of ordinary immigration would suffice in connection with the Northern Territory. Those who come here 'to settle in the Territory ought to be. comparatively young and free from encumbrances, in the first place, and, if possible, should be prepared by some experience that will fit them to enter upon the culture of what to them will be novel products in novel circumstances. If some promises held out to us can be fulfilled - if we can develop the mineral resources of the Territory-w e should be able in a very short time to place upon the fields a very large number who could, even in that climate, conduct the ordinary operations with which we are familiar elsewhere with profit to themselves and to the county",45

243,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"If by that the honourable member means a line engaged to bring suitable settlers to this country under the control of the High Commissioner, I think the proposal an excellent one. The honourable member, however, must not misunderstand me. I should not advdCa'te the purchase by us of steamers for that purpose, or to enter into the hundred and one commercial relations established by private lines for their own profit in connection with such businesses. It appears to me that the readiest and most advantageous method would be to subsidize lines of steamers to carry, at the lowest possible rates, those who intend to seek their livelihood in this country. ",45
244,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,No .,45

Even that proposition may prove worthy of consideration when it is brought forward in some other form that will enable us to frame a judgment upon it. But, at the present time, I venture to believe it would be far cheaper, more satisfactory, and less vexatious for us to subsidize those whose business it is to build and run steamers and undertake the carrying of immigrants.",46
252,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,But all the steamers are full already.,46
253,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Then attract additional lines Of steamers to Australia.,46

255,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,They are not offered a sufficient temptation to come here.

256,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"It will in its own time, which may not be our time, and on its own terms, which may not be our terms, and therefore, it will pay us to pay them better than it would pay us to venture upon it without their assistance. Of course, one is not laying down absolute principles only worth twenty shillings.",46
257,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Perfectl y true. I am endeavouring in vain to curtail my remarks under this shower of interesting and suggestive interjections.,46
258,Mr WEBSTER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,This rush for Australia is due to the existence of a Labour Government.,46
259,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,""" The rush away from Australia"" did the honourable member say? The rush to Australia, I think, is occasioned by conditions over which no Government has any power. Not even the conspicuous merits of preceding Governments will lead me to credit them with it. It is due partly to industrial unrest in the Mother Country, partly to a better realization of the resources of the outlying portions of the Empire, and particularly to the growing belief that among all the Dominions of the Empire, Australia offers the best, the richest, and the widest opportunities. If my honourable friends opposite do not play too many tricks with Australia, and destroy its reputation for fair dealing, we shall have a great influx here even before they leave the Treasury benches.",46
260,Mr WEBSTER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,We shall not leave this side of the House for another ten years.,46
261,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"All the better for the country, so far as the attraction of immigrants is concerned, if during the whole of that period the Labour party contrive to keep them sufficiently blindfolded as to parts of its policy. I put aside the neglect of the vital State Debts issue, but venture to make one more appeal to the Government with reference to the establishment of an Inter-State Commission. It appears to me that, at all events, the final form which that proposition took in the beginning of 1910 was the best for meeting our immediate needs That, of course, is a matter always open to argument and review. In endeavouring once more to impress upon the Government the value of this Commission, one can leave them the widest freedom as to the particular functions with which they shall clothe it, so large are the opportunities offered by the appointment of such a body. We ought to have something like a Board of Trade for the Commonwealth, following and extending the recent precedents which are making the British Board of Trade far more powerful even than it has been, in order that it may study all matters of trade and commerce, production and employment, conditions of employees, the fluctuations of trade and their causes, and the education needed in trades and other occupations. All these are matters into which close research is indispensable in modern times, and invaluable to the country undertaking it. As I have previously pointed out in this House, there is a great deal to be learnt from the Continent, and particularly from Germany, in this regard. There, information on a host of subjects is made available of interest to all classes, but of the most vital interest to the employed. The defects of different methods of technical education are discovered, and, if necessary, exposed, and new processes carefully examined. This could be accomplished here by the help of experts, chosen because of their knowledge of the technical questions with which they would be called upon to deal. They would add to the very valuable work that is being done every year - in this Commonwealth by means of our Year-Book and in other ways by our Statist, .(-ions f to .whom we are under great obligations, We should have a few highly trained experts in these matters, whose task it would be to study our situation, the figures and facts behind them, the circumstances of trade and production, both rural and city, the relations of different industries, many intricate business questions associated with the rise and fall of prices, and general effect upon our markets of invenbear tions elsewhere, and of trade and commerce from abroad. That body would be capable of becoming for Australia a Board of - Trade of the highest efficiency, and of - wider scope than even the English Board of Trade. In addition, it might, and I hope would, be charged by the Government with other duties scarcely less valuable tb the people. I believe .they could play an important part in connection with our industrial affairs, in our rather hopeTess endeavours, as they appear now, to tabhsh and maintain industrial peace. They could deal with industrial discords - when they arose, whether between employers and employed, or between industry in all matters, not only of Tariff altera-tion, but also of industrial legislation where Commonwealth action was - desirable. - In the interest of the workmen and workwomen of the Commonwealth, of the large class dependent upon them, and of 'those who invest their capital in Australian mdustnes, in the interest of those who settle in the country, as well as in the - town, a tribunal of this sort is necessary. ft has always appeared to us that the natural central habitation of these experts - would be in connection' with the Inter-State - Commission, which the Constitution autho-nzes us to appoint for certain specific purpOses. ""- I press this once more upon the Government, because, in the event of their undertaking such a revision of the Tariff as is hoped for before this Parliament closes, - even the preliminary researches of such a )body should be of great value, and ulti'mately would come to be deciding factors on many of these economic questions. I should Mr Deakin. - occupy much too long a time if I were to dilate upon the opportunities which such a tribunal also affords of bringing into effective relation the various industries of the State, and of equalizing industrial condia s a r as j necessary for purposes of s justice. My object when I rose was to point o u t that we were inevitably drifting into the discussion of issues in more or less dethe tail, because the Government have not laid before us, in broad and simple lines, the nature or purport of the policy they are the pursuing. They have not explained to us the various positions which the different the items really hold, and the relations they to each other. They have merely left s to gather from single propositions, and U a n y information we have in regard to them, sufficient material to offer criticism which is necessarily of details instead of principles, This, therefore, leaves us practically anticipating the debate on the items in the Estimates rather than taking part in that discussion upon the nnancial and general policy of the Commonwealth as a whole, including all its related interests, which is properly the subject of a Budget debate. Mr < HUGHES (West Sydney-Attor es- - General) [8.31] - I do not intend to ney r e p i y at l e r ) g t h t 0 the honourable and i ned gentleman, but one or two of ear h is statements may, at this particular j u r e , carry some weight in quarunct gentleman has said with regard to the Board 0 f Trade of which we were not thoroughly se ized before, for this has been a favourite the m e of h is for s 0 m e y e a r s / j not p r 0 _ pose to criticise it. In itself the idea is.exce llent. Nothing could be more natural, business-like, and sensible than that a number of persons should be appointed to inq u ; i b , supervise, examine, and, if posr e nt s ible, to suggest improvements in, or even direct, if they could be endowed with, so m u c n power, some of the many complica ted processes of our industrial and social n f . But there is nothing that this Board e 0 f Trade could now usefully do that cann o t be better done by other tribunals already in existence, providing those tribunals are endowed with' sufficient power - A Board of Trade would be ain excellent instltution, if , for instance, it had power to regulate prices, and had we been so fdrtunate as to secure a majority at the referenda, I can assure the honourable gentleman that it was my intention to suggest the formation of just such a body as he has very kindly reminded us of this evening in order to regulate prices.",46
262,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,How would they regulate f rites? - Mr HUGHES --They would do it in - ihe way provided in the instrument which created them.,48
263,Mr GROOM,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,B y what means?,48
264,Mr HUGHES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"That will be disclosed in due course. At the present time the Board of Trade is a perfectly superfluous and unnecessary instrument, 'which was sounded to-night only for the purpose of rousing the cohorts outside in connection with a matter quite different from 'what we are supposed to be discussing this evening. I leave it there. It is one of those admirable pieces of stage scenery that was. put aWay somewhere in 1908 or 1909, and has been dusted, carefully, furbished up, and trotted out from time to time as occasion arose for its display. Two other matters about which I wish to speak are immigration and the Tariff. The honourable gentleman knows very well that on literally hundreds of platforms tonight the question of immigration is the very liveliest in the world. ' Mr DEAKIN - I hope so.",48
265,Mr HUGHES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"He , good, easy man, stands up here, striking a blow for self and another for his friends, and ing what he can for us all. I do not ject to his doing what he can for himself and his friends, but I do object to ing what he can for us. I should like to remind him of one or two facts. Immiof what we did ! - gration-that , is to say, providing the necessary facilities for immigrants to .country-is a matter entirely in the hands of the States. It is apparent that, so as this State is concerned, so much mains to be desired that it is only necescountry sary to mention the matter.",48
266,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"What is the bar that prethe vents the Commonwealth from introducing .immigrants ? - Mr HUGHES - I shall tell the honof orable member. The suggestion has been 'made by the Commonwealth that it should take full control of the matter. We 'made, this offer in turn to every State; f rom - some we have received satisfactory plies, arid from others replies that are satisfactory. We must act either as or in part; and, as the whole of the have not agreed; the business remains .with 'them. As for this particular State, if it been-as I admit it has-successfu l in thing, it"" is not in attracting suitable immigrants, but in the circulation of the most extraordinary advertisements relating to the prospects for immigrants to Victoria that it ever fell to the lot of man to see, or the lot of man to draw up. These advertisements have no proper relation to the condition of things in this country. They are the grossest and most inexcusable exaggerations, and are worse than mining prospectuses. They represent an endeavour to obtain immigrants by the circulation , of statements that are not based on - facts. Our policy of immigration is clear - and consistent. We have taken up the attitude that we' do not welcome wholesale immigration, but immigration of suitable persons, just as any sensible man would not - welcome - all men into his house, but only suitable men. This is not a dumping ground for all the insane, criminal, anddiseased refuse of the Old World. We have no desire to create a condition of things that will lead to industrial and social unrest and inequality. We desire to breed a virile, healthy, temperate race of people, with all those virtues that belong to the Anglo-Saxon. During our regime we have endeavoured to make this country sufficiently attractive to the right kind of men; and I desire to tell the himhonorable member for Ballarat, and the docommunity generallly, that more of such obmen have come to Australia since we took office than came in during the whole nine his doyears that he sat on these benches.",48
267,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,They come in consequence,48
268,Mr HUGHES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Would the honourable this member have said that if fewer immigrants had come ? Would he, and those with him, far not have condemned us without reservation ? reHonorable members opposite admit that the is prosperous, but they say that is cot because of us. When we point out that deposits in* .the Savings Bank were never sq satisfactory, or that the people were never so well off, they say, "" Not because you."" When we point out that a continuous and ever-increasing stream of immigrants is - flowing into the country, they have say the same thing. They, still repeat and their shibboleths ""about their, immigration reand our"" attitude . towards it. But the not ""facts, 'although-, they ;will not . face a whole them, are too strong . for them. The States complaint ndw is, not that we ' cannot get people to come, but that there are not has sufficient ships "" to. bring them'! There was one no ""such complaint during the term of office of my honourable friend-ther e were then not enough people to fill the ships. Yet we, without making any special effort, but by destroying, or helping to destroy, land monopoly, and attempting to make this a country where a working man may obtain decent conditions, have attracted a larger number' of immigrants to these shores than at any previous period since Federation has been established. We have no desire, however, to make it worth - while for the scum to come here. And now, just one word about the Tariff. At the present time we are on the eve of a State general election in Victoria. I do not wish to take any notice of that election, but merely to point it out as a fact of which my honourable friend opposite may make a note. From every, platform, inspired by one of the great newspaper organs of the State, people are being asked to look at the Tariff; and they look at it. The remarks to-night of the honourable member for Ballarat will, doubtless, be set out in a great daily newspaper tomorrow with almost painful fidelity, and where he falls short, they will be reinforced in a suitable leading article, so that the country will have the benefit, not only of what the honourable member has said, but of what he meant to say, and would have said if he had been not merely a man, but a cohort of men. The people will be asked to believe that the Labour party are aiming a deadly blow at the industries of the country by refusing to reopen the Tariff; and the people of Victoria asked, in consequence, to cast their votes against the Labour candidates. So that the speech of the honourable member for Ballarat is an admirably timed electioneering speech. What are the facts? The Labour party were thanked by the honourable member for Ballarat, as Prime Minister, and by the Minister in charge of the Tariff, for helping them to get the present Tariff through, and we were told plainly that, without our aid, it could not .have been passed.  orable member, but the aid of the Protectionist wing of the party.",48
269,Mr HUGHES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable member raised this question. He said something about getting a Tariff through against the opposition of men like the honourable member for Broken Hill, the honourable member for Marano.a and myself. But I su.pppr.ted the present Tariff - .1 admit that I did oppose the .first Tariff; but again the facts are too strong for our friends, the enemy. Even in the first Tariff, I did no more than was done by the honourable member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Parramafta, the honourable member for Perth, and a number of others I see scattered about the House. All these honourable members did what they could to prevent the honourable member for Ballarat doing what he desired as Prime Minister. The people are asked to believe that a Government, formed of the honourable member for Ballarat, the honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Illawarra, the honourable member for Parkes, and some others, are going to make a Tariff acceptable to the people of Victoria or of Australia. Though one rose from the dead, there is none in Victoria to believe it. A Tariff is not got through this House by fine words, but by deeds. What is the record of the Labour party in connection with the Tariff? The Government of the honourable member for Ballarat would not have got through their Tariff if it had not been for the votes of men like the honourable member fo.r Maranoa, and of myself, both of us Free Traders. The honourable member for Ballarat has told us that he never had a majority like that of the present Government; but I say that he had a majority one hundred times more obedient and placable.",49
270,Mr DEAKIN,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,That finishes it !,49
271,Mr HUGHES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable member's majority was composed of men who never asked any questions or attended any meetings of his party, but simply sat on the same side as he did, no matter what came or went. I declare that if I were to choose my lot as a leader of a party, I could desire nothing better than' the rosestrewn path which the honourable member, with the aid of his majority, followed for years.",49
272,Mr GROOM,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,There were many thorns amongst the roses on the path.,49
273,Mr HUGHES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The present Tariff was, and is, the honourable member for Ballarat's Tariff, and the people .ought to remember that it was passed upon a condition. What was that condition? It was a most important one, and sufficient to induce me, a Free Trader, the honourable member for Maranoa, the Minister of External Affairs, and other honourable memtars on this side who were Free Traders, to accept it. Nothing on earth - would have induced me to suppprt the Tariff except for the promise that the benefits of Protection should be extended to the workman. A promise to that effect was solemnly made to us. The House and the country thoroughly understood the position. There was never any doubt about it. A measure was introduced almost contemporaneously with the Tariff to carry out the idea of new Protection. We began with the agricultural implement making industry, fully intending to extend the principle to the whole of the industries affected under the Tariff. I say deliberately, and it was said over and over again in the House, that the new Protection was the only weapon which drove me from the ranks of Free Trade to support the Tariff introduced by the honourable member. The only regret that I now have is, not that I voted for the Tariff, but that it was found impossible to extend the benefits of Protection to the workmen of Victoria and the other States.",49
274,Mr WISE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable gentleman's party carried out their part of the bargain, but our party never carried.out theirs.",50
275,Mr HUGHES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"We carried out our part of the bargain loyally and without question. I myself voted for duties which I thought to be in some cases unnecessarily high. Nevertheless, I thought it proper to do so in order to carry out my own part of the bargain by my votes. The Tariff as it stands today, whether it be good or whether it be bad, is the work of the Deakin Government, backed up by the most absolutely placable and obedient majority that ever the leader of a party had. But the support of that party was obtained by a solemn promise which has never been redeemed. It is perfectly true that constitutional barriers sufficiently strong tp prevent the ' carrying out of the promises were discovered. But what was the honourable member's attitude in regard to that? He laid upon the table of the House a memorandum dealing with the new Protection, and indicating his desire to amend the Constitution so as to .enable him to carry out the promise which he and his Government had made, to extend the benefits of Protection to the people, to regufacturer late wages, and to regulate prices. There was no doubt in his mind as to the power of the Government to regulate prices any - more than there was any doubt in his mind before as to the power to regulate wages. He desired that both should be done. This was the bargain that he made-that if there were Protection for the manufacturer we should also protect the workman and the consumer. The manufacturer has been protected, but what of the workers and the general public? I say most emphatically that today the people, the consumers, in this country are absolutely without a shadow of Protection. The workman has in many cases some sort of Protection from Wages Boards, but the consumer is absolutely helpless. As soon as we take one turn and elevate wages, the manufacturer takes two turns and elevates prices. He goes one step higher every .time. His profits are sacrosanct; the public must pay all the time, and if good wages are to be paid it is to be at the expense of the general public. Yet the honourable member asks'why we do not amend the Tariff. My colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, asked the manufacturers of this country to supply him, in confidence, with certain detaijs of their businesses, in order to make out a case for amendment. He asked for sufficient information to enable him to judge whether ah amendment was justified. I say most emphatically that this Government was always prepared, and is now prepared, to amend the Tariff upon cause shown. But surely if there is. a case for amendment of the Tariff it can, and ought, to be made out. But what was the result of the Minister's inquiries for particulars? At a deputation which waited upon me during the absence of the Prime Minister in London, the whole matter was threshed out, and Mr J. M. Joshua, who was one of the leading members of the deputation, admitted that the manufacturers of this country were exceedingly well off under the present Tariff. I will quote his very worc's, as reported on Wednesday, 31st May, 1911. Mr Joshua saidHe did not say that manufacturers were distressed, and in need of Tariff amendment to relieve them. If they had difficulties and trials at the moment, these were not due to deficiencies in the Tariff; yet there are a number of important manufactures suffering by reason of Tariff anomalies. He thought that the Minister of Customs had taken a proper step in-asking for confidential information,' but he would say that there were questions asked concerning the inner nature of men's businesses that no manuwho was making profits would answer in order to get increased Protection and higher profits. I ask whether there was ever any more damaging ,and damning admission than that? Mr Joshua said that the manufacturers were getting.on very well, so well, indeed, that they, would not answer any question in-relation-to their profits in order to get higher Protection. Why? Because . they were afraid of disclosing that their present profits were so high that the facts would not warrant any Government in further increasing them at the expense - the general public. And as a fact the facturers as a body refused to supply ticulars asked for. A very few did, but the great majority refused. The country ought to be told this fact. Here is ' vernment which is prepared, and always been prepared, to increase the duties the present Tariff is found to be insufficient, and also to carry out that part of ' bargain which was made some three or years ago to extend the benefits of the Tariff to workers and consumers. An tempt was made to carry out the bargain - at the referenda, and it failed. This Government has sought to get that inamended formation from ""the manufacturers which would show instances of Tariff failure, and it has not succeeded in obtaining The honourable member for Ballarat has spoken about establishing a Board of Trade. I want to ask him this question: Would a Board of Trade recommend an increase in the Tariff without an inquiry, most minute and precise, into the circumthe stances of every particular industry manding or desiring an increase? I think not. Such a Board would inquire partiable cularly into the working of the existing Tariff, and whether there was any justificaof tion for an increase of Tariff protection. And so do we. It is perfectly natural this should be done. Yet these gentlemen, who admittedly are doing so well, decline give us, the guardians of the public purse, reasons why the duties should be raised. They say they cannot afford to make public their private business to competitors. "" want to destroy the last shield behind which these gentlemen seek to hide the facts-it is not true that this information given to the Minister of Trade iahd Customs would be made public. ' That statement, I say, is absolutely without ' foundation. The manufacturers were told .frankly-told by me and told by the. ister of Trade and Customs-that any. - formation supplied would be treated 'confidential. I even said to'them at the these words is deputation that, if necessary, the informabe tion would'not be disclosed to other MinisI ters, and that we should be prepared - take the recommendations - of the Minister .of Trade and Customs himself. Under .those circumstances, and seeing that the - Department of-.Trade and Customs every day receives information of a much more Mr Hughes. ' confidential character in connection with invoices, and has never been charged with having disclosed it, what a miserable preof text it is for the manufacturers to say that manuthey would not disclose their profits for parfear that the - Department would disclose the information to the public 1 We are here at the present time determined not to a Goamend the Tariff unless it can be shown has distinctly that an industry is grievously where languishing for lack of Protection. The Tariff can only be amended for cause the shown, and cause has never been shown. four Yet the honourable member for Ballarat and his party are seeking toinfluence the atpeople of Victoria to condemn this party, and the party which is allied to us in the State Parliament, because we have not the Tariff, forgetting to tell the people that his party- I say this deliberately-coul d neither have placed the preit. sent Tariff - upon the statute-book without our help, nor amended it as the honourable member for Ballarat suggests, for his party is, upon the fiscal question, hopelessly divided. And the people of Victoria will never believe. that a party - which includes honourable member for Parramatta, the dehonorable member . for Parkes,. the honourable member for Illawarra, and the honormember for. Perth, will pass a Tariff which will be satisfactory to the .people Victoria. Here, on' this side, on the contrary, is a party, homogeneous and that pledged . to the policy of new Protection, lock, stock, and barrel; here is a to party pledged to that policy to. such .an extent that it is prepared to act solidly as one man regarding the Tariff, provided there is that corollary of new Protection ' I which we demand as absolutely essential to the interests of the people of this country, the wage-earners and the consumers. - Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [8.55]. - We have heard a very characteristic and, as usual, a very clever speech from the Attorney-General. It seems to me that, perhaps, on both sides the constitution of Minthis House is such that, with regard tb in some questions, the use of certain .words as acts, as a match to an explosive. One of -"" Tariff."" It has only to mentioned to create a 'state, of ebullition. f the Leader of the Opposition rendered to no other service by his speech he, at all events, drew from the Attorney-General a gratuitous, and certainly a very important statement to the effect that, if the referenda proposals had been carried, and the additional powers' asked for'-had been vested-in this! Parliament, he, personally, would have been.in favour of the appointment ot an Inter-State Commission or Board of Trade, with power to fix prices. That was a most important admission.",50
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,And he was supported and applauded by the honourable member for Gippsland.,52
277,Mr WISE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,That is another of the reckless statements for which the honourable member for Parramatta is so famous.,52
278,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"When , by inter-. jection, I tried to ascertain from the Attorney-General whether he was merely speaking his own mind or also that of the Government and the iparty to which he belonged, he appeared to be seized with a sudden attack of that infirmity which we all regret in him, and which rendered it quite impossible for him to hear what I said. I regret all the more on that account that the honourable gentleman should have left the chamber. - Mr ROBERTS - I think he has gone to find the Leader of the'Opposition . Mr WH IRVINE - It was a very interesting announcement to make, and particularly at this time, and in these cumstances, because a great many people have, for a very long time, been driven to the conclusion that the logical sequence of some of the efforts made hitherto in the direction of improving the lot of the workers will necessarily be that very fixation of prices to which the honourable gentleman referred. As the Attorney-General is now present, perhaps he will allow me to again put to him the question which he failed, to hear when I put it by interjection during his speech. I wish to know whether the statement that, had the referenda proposals been carried, he would be in favour of creating a Board to fix prices, was made on his own behalf or on behalf .of the Government ? ; Mr HUGHES - I said I should be in favour of it, and so I should.",52
279,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Then I must take it to be merely a personal conclusion, and leave it at that.",52
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Then new Protection does not mean the fixing of prices?,52
281,Mr WEBSTER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Wai t till we get it, and' then the honourable member will know what it means.",52
282,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Putting aside now the smoke of the old battles that was raised possibly by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, and coming back tosome matters of importance more immediately relevant to the Budget",52
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,There must be something more said on the other subject.,52
284,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Perhaps the honourable member for Parramatta will permit me to come back to the Budget. 1 regret that debate on extremely important matters raised by the Budget should, from any cause, or through any person's de- fault, have been interrupted by the introduction of heated controversies surround- ing the Tariff question. We have quite enough questions of serious moment to discuss in connection with the Budget, and I propose to address myself to a few of the more important of them. An intelligent stranger, who had never heard of Australia ' before, coming into this House and hearing' the Budget speech of the Prime Minister, would have been very much struck with two things. First of all, he would have been struck with the extraordinary resources of the country which could enable' a population not larger than that of some English counties, to' create such an immense amount of wealth as the Budget cir- figures disclose. I think that I am not wrong in saying that the second thing, which would have struck him, with .time to think a little about it-and which would have filled him with amazement-woul d have been that a Treasurer bringing in the Budget of a country, showing such marvellous vitality and financial power, should have been so entirely barren of any sugges- tion for the future development of the great estate we possess. That would probably have struck him more than anything else.",52
285,Mr FISHER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Notwithstandin g the intimation that we are going to link up the West with the East.,52
286,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I do see a sum °f £?°,o°o put down for the railway to the West:",52
287,Mr FISHER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Did the honourable gentleman hear a statement that that was all that was asked for by the experts for the purpose?.,52
288,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am aware that' a very large amount will be asked for in the future; but. if the honourable gentleman, had waited",52
289,Mr FISHER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I shall not interrupt the honourable gentleman again.,52
290,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I do not object' to being, interrupted by the Prime Minister, provided he knows exactly what my argument is. . What I was going to say was that I think that any one who had the slightest knowledge of the position and conditions of this great continent^ Which we are privileged ih this House to govern and rule, would have been amazed at the fact that a Government intrusted with the control of the immense revenue we possess this year-so large, indeed, that the Treasurer's difficulty is rather to allocate it than anything else, and hundreds of thousands, and even millions, of pounds are not improperly, but quite properly, being applied to purposes which are usually met from sources other than the revenue of the year - and backed up, for the first time in the history of the Federation, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, by a concrete solid majority of one party in both Houses, prepared to support them in everything they care to do, should come before this Parliament, after a rest of nearly a year, and present no propositions whatever to meet two of the greatest wants of the continent, namely, immigration and the settlement of the Northern Territory. I shall deal first with the settlement of the Northern Territory, and the Prime Minister will not object if I read his statement from Hansard on this point. He saidIn order to have everything ih readiness for the settlers whom we hope shortly to be able to invite to the Territory, officers in connection all the producing interests are about to be appointed, and arrangements made for a number of public works. What officers and what public works? We are given no particulars and nb details. Are they to be railway works, waterworks, or what sort of public works are they to be? The honourable gentleman went on to sayI t must be pointed out that the Territory for some years to come will demand the expenditure of considerable money for developing this huge area which has been intrusted to our care. It needs no gliost to tell us that. But what steps are We going to take, and in what direction? Improvements ih communication especially,, both by sea and land, will require the outlay of a good deal of money. That we all know, but I think we are entitled to something more explicit.",52
291,Mr HIGGS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable gentleman expects the Government to do in one year what South Australia could not do in fifty. Mr W. H'. IRVINE - I expect the Government to be able to indicate the direction in which they propose tb do something. None of us is so unreasonable as to expect the Government to at once plunge into a vast series of works in all directions. All I wish to know is what are their intentions. I had almost forgotten that they have already taken two bold, determined steps. They have appointed Professor Spencer to keep his eye on the aborigines, and they propose to make an additional contribution to the hospital for the treatment of tropical diseases, at Townsville.",53
292,Sir JOHN FORREST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,They ask us to authorize a vote of £525 for the development of tropical agriculture.,53
293,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Yes , I had almost forgotten that. Where is that money to go?",53
294,Mr GROOM,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,And there is £500 on the Estimates for a railway survey.,53
295,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I had forgotten that, too.",53
296,Mr ROBERTS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Ha d not the honourable member better admit that he has not studied the Estimates?,53
297,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I do not know that the Honorary Minister will derive much comfort from the additions which have been mentioned by my honourable friends. For nearly a year now we have been possessed of a Territory which costs us the immense annual sum of £411,000. I do not for a moment suggest that the Government could step in and at once make with that Territory a paying estate. Of course, such a thing is impossible. Under any circumstances, no matter how active the Government may be, very many years must elapse before the Northern Territory can become in arty sense a payable Concern to Australia. We knew that when we took it over, and we were quite prepared to accept it, notwithstanding the burden which it imposed upon us. But surely it is not unreasonable that the Ministry should be prepared to indicate to us something in the nature of a policy for that Territory- a policy which we shall be asked to sanction or to criticise.",53
298,Mr HALL,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The Prime Minister has promised that the Minister of External Affairs will make a\ statement of policy in that connection.,53
299,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am very glad to hear it. But I should have thought that the Budget debate was the proper time to make such a statementAs a matter of fact, I understood that the statement would be made before the* discussion on the Works and Buildings Estimates was concluded. In regard to the development of the Territory, I should be very sorry to attempt to anticipate any explanation of Ministerial policy. But I do not know that we shall afterwards have an opportunity of dealing with the matter. I was very much interested in the practical speech which was delivered on this subject today by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. He dealt with a number of matters of very great interest fo me, and he anticipated what I intended to say upon some things. But he spoke with much greater practical knowledge than I possess, and his remarks, therefore, should carry much greater weight. He spoke of a Territory with whioh he is more familiar than I am. He dilated with very great heat and feeling upon the development of such a Territory by a chartered company. He challenged the Committee to say that in any circumstances it would favour the development of the Northern Territory by such a company. Now the days when any Government would dream of handing over to a p'rivate company die kind of powers which were vested in the chartered company under which India, or even the northern part of Canada, was governed for so many years, have long since passed. :",53
300,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,What ahout chartered company in Rhodesia?,54
301,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am not quite familiar with the powers which were vested in that company. But just as we recognise that the time has passed when any Government would dream of abdicating its functions by transferring them to a chartered company, so I would ask the honourable member to recollect that it is possible to go equally far towards the other extreme. He should remember that no territory like the Northern Territory can ever be developed by the Government stroke. We can never get the hard strenuous pioneering work which has to be done m every new country,, and especially in countries full of risk and danger, by an army of civil servants.",54
302,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I was riot talking of civil servants.,54
303,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"But the honourable member, in his absolute contempt and hatred of the whole system of chartered companies, appears likely to forget that if we' wish todevelop the Northern Territory we must, by some means, engage the energies of the people, arid particularly those of that class of people who are prepared ttf accept great risks in the expectation of reaping great rewards. country iri any part of th£ world that has been developed has been developed iri that way.",54
304,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"In Canada today, are great risks undertaken in the expectation of great rewards?",54
305,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Yes .,54
306,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I do not know what are' the great risks.,54
307,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I do not mean risks from wild beasts- I am referring to great financial risks.,54
308,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The honourable member means risks from the stand-point of losing money.,54
309,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Certainly .,54
310,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,There is no risk of losing money in Canada today.,54
311,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable member is now showing the same knowledge of Canada which he exhibited in respect of the Northern Territory. It may be an unpopular thing to say, it may be entirely inconsistent with the views which are entertained by a good many honourable members opposite, but it is as clear as possible to those who have studied the de^ velopment of such territories that the only <he way in which we can possibly succeed is by establishing heavily capitalized interests in which we can engage, not merely the services of farmers who come out and are attempted to be planted down by the Government, backed up by a number of civil servants, but the interest of persons who are prepared to put down very considerable sums, to expend their energy and organizing capacity in getting together for the particular purpose for which the country is suited a class of people whom they will throughout help and assist in settling the land.",54
312,Mr WEBSTER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"That is very like a dream, as far as the Northern Territory is concerned.",54
313,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"It is the only kind of dream which has ever been realized in connection with these matters. One would think, from the language which the Treasurer uses, that we must have everything iri readiness for the settlers' we are about to invite there. One would really imagine that he has a kind of drearii of hundreds arid thousands of sturdy British yeomen flocking into the Territory, of beautiful smiling hillsides occupied by a contented and happy peasantry, of men with their wives and children milking their cbWs and planting their bananas arid cbcoamits, and things of that sort. We' are not here to Every engage in dreaming, but to look at things from a practical point of view. I shall do' all that I can. to assist the honourable memher for Hindmarsh in preventing any great or. injurious monopolies such as might arise from anything in the nature of chartered companies possessing great powers.",54
314,Mr ARCHIBALD,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,You need not afraid. That day' is gone.,55
315,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable member will receive my assistance, but I can assure him that if he looks forward-and I do not think that he does from the tone of his speech-to a sort of Government process whereby we shall bring persons out, build houses for them, plant them down, erect schools at their doors, and give them moderate areas of land, and so on, as a mode of occupying the Territory",55
316,Mr HARPER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,That was not the way with the original settlers.,55
317,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"No ; it was. not the way with the original settlers in this any other country. That is not the way in which pioneering work has been, or ever will be, done.",55
318,Mr THOMAS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,That is what the honourable member for Balaclava advocated just now.,55
319,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am responsible for my own opinions, and not for those of any other honourable member. Putting aside all sentimentality, we must face the real problem in very much the same way as similar problems have been faced in the past, and we shall not do it by an army of civil servants, though we have an invincible Treasury at our back. If we start on those lines, the only effect will be that we shall hamper the finances of the Commonwealth ; we shall create a perpetual sink for ever-increasing sums of money from the Treasury for a generation to come, and produce no good results. I have been induced to express myself with perhaps a little warmth on this subject, because I believe that there is a certain section of people in the community who think that the development and settlement of a place like the Northern Territory is a sort of thing which may be undertaken simply by a Government Department. But honourable members who know anything about the subject realise that that is not the case-. I may, perhaps, have stated the matter a little more strongly than was necessary.",55
320,Mr HALL,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"You are attacking that which no one is defending. .! Mr WH IRVINE - I shall await with interest the statement of the. Minister of External Affairs, but I - shall be disappointed unless he is prepared to show that he can offer those very large rewards;! which alone will enable us to evoke the. pioneering energy and strength vvhich will., ever make any impression on that vast Territory. I do not intend, at this stage, to. be speak at any very great length. There are so many points to which one could ad-. dress himself that one has to pick and choose a little. There are, however, one or two points to which I desire to speak. First of all, I think that, from the financial point of view, the administration of the' Post and Telegraph Department is not as satisfactory as it might be. An examination of the figures in the Budget papers will show that, during the first years of the Federation, our greatest business concern, the Post Office, was not paying its. way altogether, partly arising out of the fact that it was taken over from a number of separate and, therefore, jointly unor organized services. But, for the first six, or seven, or eight years of the Federation there was a continued improvement in the management, or, at all events, in the results of the management. If honourable members will refer to pages 48 to 53 of the Budget papers they will find that there has been a continued decrease in the proportion of the expenditure to the revenue. That is to say, through the efforts of the various Postmasters-General, and the various Governments up to that time, what had been an unorganized and non-paying Department became gradually a paying Department.",55
321,Mr WEBSTER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Wbe n did it become a paying Department?,55
322,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The honourable 1 member will find, if he looks over the figures, that it was a gradual process - I am speaking of the general revenue and the general expenditure, excluding works and buildings. In 1001-2 the receipts were under the expenditure by the comparatively small sum of .£57,000. The honourable member will find the same decrease until two years later. In 1903-4 there was a small surplus of ,£2,100. In 1904-5 that surplus increased to £65,000.. In 1905-6 the revenue was £186,000 more than the expenditure. For the next three years the excess of revenue over expenditure averaged about £400,000. In 1909-10 the excess of revenue over expenditure amounted to. £528,000.",55
323,Mr WEBSTER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,That includes neither sinking fund nor depreciation.,55
324,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I think that the honourable member is a little premature in his criticism of my criticism. The easiest way of perceiving how the Department is working is to find out what percentage the expenditure bears to its revenue. In 190910 the expenditure had been brought down to 86 per cent, of the revenue, which showed a very favourable position, being infinitely more favourable than was the position when the Department was first taken over. It had become a good paying concern. In 1910-11 the percentage of the expenditure to revenue rose from 86 to nearly 90 per cent., and the estimated expenditure in the current financial year, of which one-half is past, is 94 per cent, of the revenue. To arrive at those percentages, you must make certain adjustments. From the expenditure, which always excludes the cost of new works and buildings, )'Ou must also exclude the interest and sinking fund on transferred properties, a sum of £435,000, which appears this year for the first time. Another deduction which it is fair to make, because without it the expenditure would amount to more than 101 per cent, of the revenue for the year, is the loss from universal penny postage, which according to a note on page 27, is estimated at £250,000 for ten months, or about £300,000 a year. Using round numbers, when the Government came into office, it took charge of a series of concerns which had gradually been made profitable, the expenditure upon them having been reduced to 86 per cent, of their revenue. In its first year of office, this expenditure was increased by 4 per cent., and in the next by about the same percentage; so that it has risen from 86 per cent, to 94 per cent. The increase may not seem large, viewed as a percentage of the revenue; but it must be remembered that an addition of 4 per cent, means about £140,000 a year, so that, in other words, the Government in two years has increased the annual expenditure of the Postmaster-General's Department by £280,000. It might be thought that the increase is due to the opening up of new, and possibly, unprofitable, services; but that explanation, if put forward, is not together satisfactory, because we have had years of increasing prosperity, and the growth of revenue from the old-established services would largely balance the expenditure on new services. It would be tedious to attempt to examine the figures in debate; but if honourable members take the trouble to investigate them for themselves, they will come to the conclusion that the [93] increase in the proportionate expenditure of the Department is not accounted for by the extension of services. That is the opinion at which I have arrived after an earnest study of the accounts.",55
325,Mr WEBSTER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Where has the money gone ?,56
326,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"It is the duty of the Opposition to criticise, and, if need be, to complain that more money has been spent than should have been spent; in the latter case, it is for the Government to explain where the money has gone. The only thing that can be said is that there are more men employed, that a larger sum is being paid in wages, and that there are more contingencies. I should not feel justified, especially when the Committee is weary after listening to a number of speeches, iri dealing at length with the many interesting matters in the Budget; but one of serious moment to which I wish to address myself is the old-age pensions expenditure. I shall not court popularity with honourable members opposite, nor, perhaps, with those on this side, when I say that the expenditure on old age pensions does not produce the advantages which it should produce. The expenditure of £2,190,000 on old-age pensions will give relief to hundreds and thousands of persons who deserve it, but a considerable percentage of the payments will not be justified according to the principles on which the Act is based. In many parts of the country the money will go to persons who will misspend it, and to whom it will be of little service. It would be easier not to mention this fact, but I have every reason to believe that it is true. Of course, it is not a ground for depriving those who properly spend the relief given to them of the slightest part of their present pensions. Even if the present system of old-age pensions, paid out of the Treasury, is to be maintained, I suggest to the Government that it would be far wiser to introduce some system of local control and management rather than the present system of central control. England has adopted the alsame system as we have, that of non-contributory payments, but as the Treasurer no doubt is aware, she has adopted quite a different system of administration. Local committees are appointed in the various districts by the local councils. Conditions in England, Scotland and Ireland are of course vastly different from those obtaining here. Settlement is much closer.",56
327,Mr WEST,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The people are so closely in touch with each other.,57
328,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"They are so closely in touch with each other that the problem in this respect does not present so many difficulties there as it dees here. Small committees of people who are supposed to be, and, I have no doubt, are familiar, with the actual requirements, habits, character, and circumstances of claimants for pensions, are appointed. There are also pension officials whose duty it is to prevent any injustice being done or any improper refusal of a pension, but the element of closer local control, especially in country districts, ought, I think, to be adopted here.",57
329,Mr HARPER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Loca l knowledge.,57
330,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Loca l knowledge should be made use of. I do not hesitate to say that I think the whole basis of the present system of Statepaid old-age pensions is wrong. The system is only justifiable so far as its necessity exists, and I admit that the necessity for it as a measure of temporary relief does exist. No system that we could substitute for it could possibly be applied considerable time; some time would necessarily elapse before the people could derive any benefit from it. We have in our midst now large numbers who through no fault of their own are in a position in which it is absolutely necessary to give them this assistance, and Parliament, if I may say so, has wisely determined to extend it to them. I should be very sorry, however, to see a system of old-age pensions doled out by the Treasury made a permanent part of our public polity. I believe it is a thoroughly bad system. It has been adopted in England in the same kind of_ stress of circumstances as compelled its adoption here, and it has been admitted to be a bad one by I believe all the thinkers and writers on this subject, except those few who are intimately connected with the work either in England or here.",57
331,Mr FISHER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Nearl y every great reform has been condemned by those wise men of whom the honourable member speaks.,57
332,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am speaking not of wise men or philosophers in the sense referred to by the right honourable member, but of men who have been engaged in such work in Belgium, Germany, and Italy-me n whose experience is equivalent to that of the Government and the whole of us put together. I have in mind such men as Signor Luzzatti and others who took part in the recent conference, and who have been studying the subject from every point of view. I think I am right in saying that the view of nearly all those who have been engaged in such work is that the contributory basis is the only sound and permanent basis for a system of this kind.",57
333,Mr HEDGES,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Stat e insurance.,57
334,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Stat e insurance.,57
335,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Stat e insurance has broken down in Germany. It cost too much to administer.,57
336,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,The honourable member makes that statement as if he had some authority for it.,57
337,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,I know something about it.,57
338,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"In the latest and most authoritative report we have on the subject-Si r John Cockburn's report to the Commonwealth Government on the Hague Convention, which was published a day or two ago-ther e was no mention of such a thing.",57
339,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Has the honourable member any idea of how much per head it for a costs to administer that system ? Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member surely does not expect me to carry in my head figures relating to all these matters. The system, however, is heartily believed in by the great body of German people. In the various reports, made from time to time to the Government by Sir John Cockburn, there are many statements showing that the German system has received, and is still receiving, the hearty support of all classes in Germany, and that it has immensely increased, or, at all events, gone hand in hand with an immense increase in the prosperity of all classes in that country.",57
340,Mr HIGGS,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,What should we do in the meantime with those who have no other income but an old-age pension?,57
341,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I have already admitted that some time would necessarily elapse before such a system could be brought into operation, and that until the people can be brought under it there is absolute necessity to make provision for those who have had no opportunity to make provision for themselves. In other words, until then the State-granted old-age pensions must go on. After all, we are not talking about a new matter. By way of illustration 1 may mention that in Victoria the MCLean Government, of which I was a member, adopted a certain policy, immediately before its defeat-althoug h it had nothing to do with its defeat-providin g for a system of State-aided insurance, combined with State-aided safety bank deposits, which I need not enter into more full y. Combined with that proposal was one to make provision for people who were then either of an age at which they could not help themselves, or who were approaching an age at which they would have no opportunity to make provision for themselves. The House thought that provision inadequate, and, according tc our present ideas, it was probably quite inadequate. Any system which we inaugurate must have some such means of dealing with these people; but if we are going to continue the present system under which the State provides not only old-age pensions, but invalid pensions, which must, of course, go very much beyond the present figures, we shall assuredly introduce into the government of this country an element which will not tend to strengthen the character of the people. I do not say that a young man is likely to be much affected by the knowledge that the Government, when he becomes an old man, may keep him from starvation by the payment of a paltry pittance, such as an old age pension is; but I do say that a system under which every child, from its earliest infancy upwards, will be taught to believe that it is not its duty to help its relatives when they grow old, and that it will be able ultimately to depend upon the Government, must militate against some of those qualities that have always been the strongest fibre of our race, and especially that branch of our people from whom the Prime Minister comes, and whose blood both he and I have in our veins.",57
342,Mr FISHER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Some of the noblest of them died in the workhouse when they should have been receiving pensions. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - We hope that that will never be the fate of people here, and it is precisely because this system, call it what you will, savours of the very kind of relief to which the honourable member refers, that I should be sorry to see it tablished here.",58
343,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Does the honourable member think that the practice of paying pensions to our Judges and our civil servants when they retire undermines their manhood?,58
344,Mr WH IRVINE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I do not think that is a question which I need answer. I know I am putting forward a view which it is very easy to characterize, by appealing to the emotions and instincts of the people, as [93]- 2 utterly callous and inhuman; but on every platform from which 1 spoke before I was returned on the last occasion, I put the same views forward, and found that they received the fullest acceptance, more so, perhaps, than any other part of my platform. I feel that it is not only repugnant to common sense, but opposed to the best instincts of our people, that we should plant here a tree which will not stop at the growth that it has already got, but which will go on growing if we do not substitute for it something based upon the contributory system-some thing based upon a principle that will give play to the very best instincts that our race possesses. Otherwise we shall certainly not be likely to improve the fibre or character of our people. . I cannot at this stage enter more full y into the question. I throw this out as a suggestion, but I have very little hope that, under present circumstances, it will receive very much attention. I regard it as my duty to put it forward, because I believe very heartily in the principle which underlies what I have said.",58
345,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Wilmot) [9.47] - I hope this will be the last time that we shall have the Budget brought down at such a late period of the session.,58
346,Mr FISHER,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Hear , hear 1",58
347,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"The Prime Minister says "" Hear, hear,"" and, although I do not agree with the attitude which he took up in Opposition, when he told the right honourable member for Swan that a fortnight after the financial year closed was sufficient time to bring in a Budget, I think it ought to be introduced within a month or six weeks thereafter, because it covers nearly all the matters with which the Parliament is seriously engaged during the whole of the session. When, however, the Budget is brought forward at this stage, we have to pass items without due discrimination and criticism, and a House which is supposed to be the guardian of the public purse, ought to have the financial statement presented to it earlier than has es- been the case since I have been a member. The figures of the Budget must appear striking, because the Treasurer has gathered a revenue of £18,803,873, which amounts to £1,962,244 more than he anticipated when he made his estimate. This year the right honourable gentleman anticipates the still larger return of £19,515,000. The present Government have been very lucky in having struck very good times. Australia has been passing through a period of unprecedented prosperity, and the Government have reaped the benefit. Since they came into power they have had over £6,000,000 per annum more to expend on Commonwealth purposes than have any previous Government. the year 1908-9 the revenue in the hands of the Treasurer for purely Federal matters was at least that amount less than the present occupants of the Treasury bench have to handle. Another striking fact is that they are going to expend all this money. It seems to me that we are approaching the critical stage of a deficit in Commonwealth finance. In fact, I do not see how it is to be avoided in the near future. The Treasurer's estimate is based on the idea that we are to have continued prosperity. I wish that could be so, but I am afraid that those commercial people who are advising us, both in our private and public capacities, to be careful in our spending have only too good ground for their warnings. Our great revenue comes chiefly from Customs and Excise. In fact, out of the £19,515,000 which the Treasurer expects to receive this year, he is to get £13,800,000 from that source alone. Australia's great wealth still comes from her primary products, and the signs of the times indicate that we are likely to have a production of 25,000,000 bushels of wheat less this year than last. If wheat is not at a much better price, that would mean the deduction of about £5,000,000 from our annual return from that item alone. Commercial people are beginning to anticipate a drop of about £8,000,000 in our exports of wool, wheat, and butter. We exported last year £74,491,000 worth of commodities, of which 65 per cent., or over ,£55,000,000 worth, came from the agricultural, pastoral, and dairying industries. If we are to have any serious decline in our production in that respect, we are bound to have a considerable falling off in the Customs receipts, and if that happens we shall have a deficit. It may not come this year, because the Government, having allotted over £4,000,000 for additions, new works, and buildings, would find it an easy matter to balance the ledger if necessary by cutting that vote down. This, however, would be scarcely a satisfactory way for the Government to adjust the accounts, especially after coming along in a boom period with a boom Budget. a procedure, although it could be adopted, would not satisfy those outlying portions of the Commonwealth which need Government works and buildings. Mr Atkinson. The Government propose to meet out of revenue a good deal of expenditure that, in the case of other Governments, is ordinarily paid out of loan money. For that I commend the Government, in so far as In the policy applies to works which cannot strictly be described as reproductive. But while that may lead to a cutting-down of votes, and the prevention of a deficit, I do not see how it is going to help their successors. There is no doubt that the present expenditure will not only be maintained, but increased. Proper provision for defence cannot, and should not, be avoided, whatever Government may be in power; and the Treasurer estimates that invalid and old-age pensions will this year cost £2,190,000. Then we have the Northern Territory; and, if I am permitted to say so, South Australia has "" got "" us in transferring its burdens to the Commonwealth. However, that burden is there, and we have to bear it ; and although we are losing a large sum annually, the Government have foreshadowed no policy worthy of the name. Neither old-age pensions nor defence can be called reproductive; and the Northern Territory and its railways are not likely to be reproductive for many years to come. Apparently, we have to go on spending large sums of money, leaving the odium of heavy taxation to be borne by the successors of the present Government. For the country to be producing such an enormous revenue, and the Government to be proposing to spend it in the manner laid down in the Budget, shows rather a want of foresight. As to the Northern Territory, the debit shown for the year amounts to ,£340,244, chiefly made up of the loss on the railways and the interest on the public debt taken over; and we have really nothing in the Budget to show what the Government intend to do towards making the Northern Territory a real asset. I hope that the Government, will not be frightened if private enterprise proposes to step in, because it would probably do more in ten years to develop the country than the Government would do in a century.",58
348,Mr WISE,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Then why has not private enterprise stepped in during all this time?,59
349,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I am merely sugSuch gesting that if people come along with a proposal the Government ought not to say them nay, because they intend to carry out their project by private enterprise. There is another point on which the Government are lamentably lacking. They have told us noth-ingabout immigration; and we have a paltry £20,000 on the Estimates under this head. Ever since 1 can remember, the Labour party have been telling us that they are not against immigration. It was only to. day, however, that the Minister of External Affairs told me that the Government - did not think it worthwhile to answer some statement that had been made in a London newspaper by a gentleman in - Western Australia, warning immigrants not to come here. The Agent-General has done something-the Government could not tell me what-bu t the Prime Minister promised that he would give the statement an absolute denial if he found it to be untrue. The Labour party have always said that they are not against immigration; tout they cannot point to any generous action on their part, or on the part of the present Government, in the way of encouraging it. The time has come when we must invite every man and woman of the right sort to come here, because such people will soon provide for themselves, and so - provide work for others. Members of the Labour party have come to this country and bettered themselves physically and financially; and it is not for them to talk about shutting the doors against other people. Are there no other people left in the Old Country as worthy as honourable members sitting opposite? If I thought Australia could support only 4,000,000 people, I should say it was a very good country for a young man to leave. Another matter as to which we ought to have an explanation of Ministerial policy is that of old-age and invalid pensions. I shall not say much about the subject just now, because I have dealt with it on more than one occasion, and the honourable member for Flinders has been expatiating upon it somewhat to-night. But I do say that the time has arrived when something should be done to alter the present system. If money is to be doled out as at present, we shall run the risk of sapping the self-reliance of the people.",59
350,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Is the honourable member against the old-age pension system?,60
351,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Whils t I am not against the old-age pension system, I should like to see some collateral system established whereby it might be brought home to the people that it is the duty of every citizen, as far as possible, to put himself above the need of an old-age pension, and also to provide for the necessities of those who are not so fortunate as he may have been. The only impracticable thing about treating Australia as one friendly society is the cost of collecting contributions to work the scheme. But all should be made to contribute in some way, and when a man has to draw his pension there should be no stigma of charity attaching to it. He should be able to take it as a reward of his own foresight.",60
352,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,There is no charity now.,60
353,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Nominall y there is no charity, but actually there is.",60
354,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Not at all.,60
355,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"A good many people seem to think so. I trust that the Government will review the subject from this point of view. They have done very well out of the old-age pension system so far. They have secured a good deal of support which they did not deserve on account of it. I do not want to detract from what they have done, but, at the same time, tliey have taken a great deal of kudos in reference to old-age pensions that rightly belonged to others than themselves. There is another serious omission from the Budget. Nothing was said by the Frime Minister regarding a scheme for taking over the State debts. When the Commonwealth was established, one of the chief objects for which we federated was the consolidation of the debts. The Prime Minister has told us that he spoke to one or two people in London on the subject, but he would not even disclose their nameSi and has displayed nothing but the most abject helplessness with respect to the-question. The Treasurer said that he was going to appropriate the land tax revenue in payment for old-age pensions and defence. There is an objection to that,- for old-age pensions and defence are matters of policy affecting everybody, and everybody should contribute. To ask a section of the people to pay land tax in order to defend the country and support old-age pensioners is to make rather an invidious appropriation for services that ought to be borne out of the general revenue. I expected to see in the Budget some provision for a grant to the State of Tasmania. A Royal Commission was appointed by the present Government, and brought in a unanimous report to the effect that Tasmania should be paid a certain sum of money by annual instalments extending over a certain period. In face of that report, the Government ought to have given some indication as to their attitude and intentions. We should know where they intend to get the money from. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - The honourable member for Bass will .tell us something about that matter on Thursday.",60
356,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"We should have Service heard a statement of policy from the vernment, and not have to wait for what may be said by an irresponsible member.",61
357,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Does the honourable memof ber want money to be taken from old-age pensions and given to Tasmania?,61
358,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"No j but as this Parliament is, in a sense, a court of equity and good conscience, it should see that Tasthat mania is properly treated. Mr W. J. JOHNSON - Le t the honourable member propose to take the money out of the Defence vote, and I will support him.",61
359,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"I do not want to see the Defence vote reduced; in fact, our expenditure in .that direction is going to increased session after session. If the orable member does not like that policy, he is in for a bad time. I must commend the Government, however, for tackling the question of telephone improvements, and devoting about £2,000,000 to the purpose. They have done the right thing in that remanlike. spect. But it is about time that they sidered the position of the Public which is growing to an inordinate extent, beyond the means of a small population like ours. In the Post and Telegraph Department alone, salaries have been increased, within the twelve months, to the tune of £107,000. The wages of temporary employees have also been increased, and altogether the service is becoming a very expensive one.",61
360,Mr RILEY,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,Wage s have gone up all over the Commonwealth.,61
361,Mr ATKINSON,ORGANIZATION OF A WIRELESS TELEGRAPH BRANCH,"Yes ; but the honortend able member must recollect that a great number of people working for their living outside the service have precarious jobs. They have not permanent billets like those in Government employ. There is no form of employment outside that keeps so many people at good salaries doing nothing, very little, for their money as the Governwill ment service does. We have a number officers in the Commonwealth Public Serfinished vice who are earning from £300 a year, but who would not be able to obtain such a salary outside the service. They are on the permanent staff, and we have to provide the money. However, that is the way with most institutions run by Government. It is one of the defects of the Government system of management, which 1 suppose we can never get away from. I hope that the Government will see that there is some business oversight of the Civil which is fast growing beyond reaGosonable dimensions. The expenditure upon old-age pensions is becoming so great that the system is in danger of breaking down its own weight. That is another reason why the Government should see that some prop is put under it in order that we may continue to pay the pensions. It will be a very serious matter for any Government is faced with the responsibility of paying less than the ios. per week, the amount of the pension with which we started. If we go on as we are going, and invalid and old-age pensions continue to increase at the present rate, I am afraid that, notwithstanding our unbounded prosperity, there is some danger that the scheme will be break down partially, at any rate, of its honown weight. I hope that when we come to discuss the vote for old-age pensions the Government will disclose a constructive policy-somethin g different from the talk we have heard from them in the past, and something which may be considered statesI hope for it, but, from my expericonence of the Government, I am afraid that Service, the hope will be in vain.
