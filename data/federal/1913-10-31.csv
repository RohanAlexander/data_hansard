4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The question is not in order. I ask honourable members to refrain from frivolous or ironical questions. I have pointed out on several previous occasions what questions are allowable and what are not allowable under .our Standing Orders and by the parliamentary practice laid down in May.,12

16,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have no objection to an adjournment over Tuesday, but I point out that in a matter of this kind a lead is expected from the head of the Government. It is strange in these times to see him come begging to the Opposition, though it is like him to lean on some one else when there is a delicate situation.

23,Mr WEBSTER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"In view of your ing a few minutes ago, Mr Speaker, I understand that if you declare a question to be frivolous I must subside. But does such a ruling deprive me of the right to rise on a question of privilege? Are the [102 j - 2 rights of honourable members to be f r it tered away? Is no member to be permitted to raise questions of privilege concerning matters of public importance ? Is the right to raise a question of privilege a dead letter? You have never refused any one else the right to do so.",13
24,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I hope that the honmember will not repeat his last re-' I .think the House generally will n admit that I try to be fair to every honourable member. In reply to his questions, me point out that, apart from the decisions recorded by recognised works reference, it has been laid down by Mr . Speaker MCDonald and other occupants of the Chair in this House, that it is disorderly and not in keeping with the dignity of the House to ask frivolous of questions, and that such questions should It is also laid down that the Speaker, u n t i l the House otherwise decides, is the sole judge as to what questions should be put, and that a question of privilege cannot arise on the decision of the Speaker disallowing or otherwise dealing with a question or motion in his opinion, should not be asked",13
25,Mr WEBSTER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I think that you misunderstood me, Mr Speaker. You in that I wished to discuss, by raising a question of privilege, something pertaining to the ruling which you had given. I the reguhad no such thing in my mind.",13
26,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"If that be the case, I express regret if I have unintentionally done the honourable member an injustice. he did not at the time state that his requestion of privilege related to another matter. WESTERN ELECTRIC COMPANY.",13
27,Mr THOMAS,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I ask the Postmaster General if it is a fact, as rumoured, that he has lifted the embargo as to tendering for supplies for the Commonwealth imposed on the Western Electric Qpmpany by his predecessor ?",13
28,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,Yes .,13
29,Mr FRAZER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"The matter mentioned by the honourable member for Barrier is one upon which I believe I may be privileged to ask a question. When r u l - the Western Electric Company were dealing with the Commonwealth they deliberately swindled the Commonwealth out of Â£5,900. Having taken action and recovered that amount from this company, I submitted a communication to Cabinet, in which I claimed that the Fisher Government should not have dealings with a set of swindlers, and I got the approval of that Government to the recommendation, which is minuted on the papers, that the Western Electric Company should not be allowed to tender for any Commonwealth requirements during. my term of office as Postmaster General.",13
30,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,The member must ask a question.,14
31,Mr FRAZER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I shall ask a question. The present Postmaster-General has now lifted that embargo from a company that for five years deliberately swindled the Commonwealth, and I ask whether the Postmaster-General has had the approval of the Prime Minister and his Cabinet in removing that embargo ?",14
32,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I did not consult the Prime Minister or Cabinet in connection with this matter. Prior to the passing of the Customs Act this company was under contract supplying certain material to the Postal Department. The Customs Act provided that if there was an increase in duties on certain articles the purchaser of the articles should pay the increase, and that if there was a decrease in the duties the seller, if called upon by the purchaser to do so, must refund any extra duties paid; but owing to an oversight in the Postal Department, no claim was made in this way upon the Western Electric Company. I admit that it was sharp practice on the part of the company to retain the money, but technically and legally they were entitled to hold it until it was claimed by the Postal Department.",14
33,Mr WEBSTEE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,Were they morally entitled to hold it ?,14
34,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"No . neither the Postal Department nor the Auditor-General's Department had discovered that this money was being retained ;*and it was only when an ex-employee of the company, in search of reward, disclosed what had happened, that the Department became aware of it .",14
35,Mr FRAZER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,He proved his case.,14
36,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,C e r t a in l y ; and the company refunded the money.,14
37,Mr TUDOR,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,After they were found out?,14
38,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"That is so; but if the Department had called on the company at any time, they were liable to make the refund, as might happen in the case of any merchant throughout the country. As soon as this embargo was placed on the Western Electric Company, there was a lock-out among other people, and it cost the Department more than Â£5,000 or Â£6,000 in the interval, u n t i l I had removed the embargo. Now that these people have been allowed to tender again, prices have come down more than that amount. honourable Mr Frazer - Following upon the explanation that has been made, I would like to ask the Prime Minister' whether he thinks that a Government which has demonstrated to the public that it is dealing with a company which deliberately,, for five years, swindled the Postal Department",14
39,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I ask the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to put his question, and not make a speech.",14
40,Mr FRAZER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I am personally interested in this matter, and I am entitled to ask the Prime Minister a question.",14
41,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,C e r t a in l y ; but the honourable member must not make a speech beyond what is necessary to explain himself.,14
42,Mr FRAZER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he approves of the action of the Postmaster-General in releasing the embargo placed upon a deliberately swindling company that defrauded the public revenue, and intended to keep the money. They put it into a suspense account for five years, and then when it was not claimed by the muddling maladministration of the previous A d ministration it was claimed by the Fisher Administration. Mr AG AB WYNNE - Y o u did not find it out yourselves ? Some one disclosed it But to you.",14
43,Mr FRAZER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I am sorry to have to ask this question of any other than the Postmaster-General, but I feel it my duty to ask the Prime Minister whether he approves of allowing a swindling company to be placed back among people who may be expected to deal reasonably with the Commonwealth ?",14
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,I am not in favour of swindling in connection with any public contract. I do not know whether swindling has occurred. I know nothing about this matter.,14
45,Mr FBAZEB,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,I assure the Prime M in ister that what I have said here I am prepared to say elsewhere.,14
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,What does the honourable member wish me to do ?,15
47,Mr FRAZER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,I wish you to dissociate yourselves from thieves.,15
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,I shall do it at once.,15
49,Mr WEBSTER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I would like to ask the Postmaster-General a question without notice. Did the Postmaster-General act on the principle that those who have robbed the public, and have been convicted, and have returned the plunder, are entitled to be restored to their former position ?",15
50,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"Order ! We are now developing an irregular debate. This is distinctly out of order. I allowed the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, whose own action when a Minister was involved, more latitude than was strictly allowable; but it has been laid down over and over again, both in this House and in the practice of the House of Commons, that questions arising out of an answer given by a Minister to a previous question are distinctly out of order, and cannot be permitted, as they must inevitably lead to an irregular debate. question of the honourable member is not in order.",15
51,Mr WEBSTER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,I am sorry I cannot get the information for the benefit of the public. The public should know it is impossible for members to do their duty. Later :,15
52,Mr THOMAS,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,Will the Postmaster General lay on the table of the House or the Library all the papers in connection with the case of the Western Electric Company ?,15
53,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,Certainly . POST OFFICEBALANCE - SHEE T - Wester,15
54,Mr WEBSTER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,Will the Postmaster General inform the House when we are to get the promised balance-sheet of the finances of the Postal Department?,15
55,Mr AGAR WYNNE,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,The balance sheet is just about ready. members will get it probably next week. LATE SITTINGS.,15
56,Mr HIGGS,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I should like to make a little personal explanation, and conclude with a question, if I may. It is a matter of regret to me that I was not present during the proceedings last night. I apprehended that the debate would be adjourned after at least two or three speakers had spoken. I did not think that it would last until after 11 o'clock ",15
57,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,The honourable member cannot make a statement of that nature under the cover of a personal explanation. A personal explanation may be made in connection with something in which the honourable member has been misunderstood or misrepresented in connection with the proceedings of the House. The honourable member is now simply stating why he was not in the chamber last night.,15
58,Mr HIGGS,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"Then , I ask a question. I do not think it is in any way frivolous. I would be glad if the Prime Minister, when he proposes to force an important measure through at one sitting, would so inform the House at some convenient time . during the day.",15
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL COMMISSION ON,"I shall be very happy to do that, if my honourable friends will reciprocate and inform the Government when they are going to take the business out of the hands of the Government. The NA RAILWAY.",15

70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"May states Whenever the attendance of a member of the other House is desired by a Committee, it is advisable to give him private intimation, and to learn that he is willing to attend, before a formal message is sent to request his attendance. But these formalities, though occasionally adopted, are not usual or necessary in the case of private Bills, where the attendance of members of either House as witnesses is voluntary. The same practice obtains in relation to both Houses, and that is why I propose to single out only those who desire to attend before the Select Committee.",16
71,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"After reading some of the evidence, may not some of the others desire to attend before the Committee ?",16

80,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUST A,"Then I shall withdraw the remark, and say that the Prime M in ister does not treat this question seriously. The Senate is elected on the same franchise as the House of Representatives represents the people as full y , although not in the same capacity, as we do.

The first we heard of these two questions was yesterday, the Prime Minister giving notice of one, and the Attorney-General of the other. We have on the notice-paper Bills that have been under the consideration of the House, and any one might reasonably suppose that those were the ones which had to be considered immediately. They have been partly dealt with, but they are now to be put on one side, and the Government, because they consider that a certain position has been created in the House, take advantage of what looks like a majority to force these two questions on.

PAIRS. Mr Webster (Gwydir) [2.16] - I am very pleased that the Treasurer has set an example in the manner of introducing measures into this House. It is refreshing to find that there is a man in the Ministry who has some sense of decorum, and some respect for members on this side. The difference between him and the other men, who have been misleading the Government during the past twenty-four hours, is highly creditable to 31 him. I do not think that the measure 27 will be introduced one day too soon. It has been a weakness of the Federation that there have been no lines of guidance in regard to the Commonwealth AYES. finances. Every member of this House, or of former Houses, must have felt at times in a fog when endeavouring, in the performance of his duties to his constituents, to solve the financial problem by means of the statistics available. The way in which the measure has been introduced by the Treasurer is a happy augury. It indicates that the Bill is likely to get a different passage through the House from the passage of the measures introduced by other Ministers, who have assumed Bulgarian tactics. The Treasurer is likely to get the treatment to which deNOES. cent men are entitled from those who are equally decently inclined.",25

164,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,The honourable member has used an offensive expression. I order him to withdraw it .,26
165,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Do I understand that you object to it , Mr Speaker?",26
166,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"As the expression is unparliamentary, I have ordered that it be withdrawn.",26
167,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,I withdraw only because it is unparliamentary. Question resolved in the affirmative. Original question resolved in the affirmative.

168,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"Gwydir) [2.30] - I believe that the Opposition are in accord with me in giving the Treasurer the right to move the second reading of this Bill on the next sitting day. In agreeing to this we are showing to the Treasurer respect that cannot be shown to any other member of the Government, because the right honourable gentleman has our sincere sympathy and respect for the manly way in which he conducts business as against the savage manner of the Bashi-bazouks on the f r o nt Ministerial bench.",26
169,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,The honourable member must withdraw those remarks.,26
170,Mr WEBSTER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"I withdraw them, and apologize to the Bashi-bazouks.",26
171,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS,"The honourable member must withdraw the remarks without qualification. NOES. Mr Webster - I withdraw the comparison. I am sorry for having libelled the section I have mentioned by announcing them in connection with honourable members on the front bench opposite. We should discuss the Bill at the next sitting, when a better feeling may prevail in the Government ranks, and give the Opposition an opportunity to discuss important measures such as this. It is sad and sickening to me to think that members of the Government party, by their brutal majority, prevent our doing PAIRS. our duty to the people who send us here. I hope the interval will enable honourable members to reflect upon the conduct for which they have been - responsible, and I hope that when we meet again the Treasurer will be able to explain in his usual courteous and civil way why this Bill should be agreed to, no matter what the fate of other Bills may be. The Treasurer has my sympathy as being a man worthy of leading any Government, who treats honourable members as they should be treated. Question resolved in the affirmative.
