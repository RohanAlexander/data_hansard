The present method of able in that ratepayers are paying greatly varying rates for essentially the same municipal services. 2. Ratepayers in inner Canberra are subsidising municipal services in the newer suburbs. 3. Since valuations were carried out in January 1976 the housing market and resultant values have become severely depressed. 4. The decline in demand and consequent drop in unimproved land value in the newer suburbs resulung in the mcrease in unimproved land values in the inner suburbs has been brought about by the Government's economic policies applying to Canberra. 5. The steep increase in rates is directly counter to the Government's stated policy of as expressed by its strong suppon for the wages and prices ' freeze' earlier this year. 6. Purpose clauses contained in residential ignored when determining valuations for rates. 7. The percentage increase in rates in many instances is far greater than the percentage increase in real incomes. 8.

That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card shall have a telephone very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners very little else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist them. The subsidy to be governed by a means test. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by MrMorris. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the existence of a system of double taxadon of personal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who more than one State in any year would(a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same vary from State to State even when gross advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records in each State.

31,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL ELECTION,"by leave- Mr Speaker, I wish to whole inform the House that the Government ommended to His Excellency the GovernorThose General that the House of Representatives be sition. dissolved on 10 November next and that a mean general election for the members of the House Representatives be held on Saturday, 10 December. His Excellency has accepted my only to the quesrecommendation. s to The places of one half of the members of the Senate will become vacant on 30 June next. If their places are to be filled by 1 July 1978, an to nil them must be held no later than May. Under the second paragraph of section 13 of the Constitution an election to fill vacant Senate places may be held within one year before the places become vacant. Members of this were elected on 13 December 1975. Their matterm expires on 16 February 1979. However, sec28 of the Constitution enables the House of Representatives to be dissolved before then. It was the general practice prior to 1963 to hold elections fbr the House of Representatives and fbr half the Senate at the sametime.Indeed, in the Governor General, Sir William Slim, on the advice of the then Prime Minister, dissolved the House of Representatives much earlier than its three-year term to synchronise the elections for the two Houses. In that case the election for both Houses was held some 18 months after the previous election for the House matters of imporof Representatives. In May this year the Government put to the people a referendum proposal which was intended to ensure that elections for both Houses have to be held simultaneously. The proposal was supported by all poltiical parties in the and the arguments in favour of it were widely canvassed. It was approved by a sigmajority-6 2 per cent-of all voters and a majority of voters in three States. It is the urview of the Government that at the next election for half the Senate an election should also be exheld for the House of Representatives. This clearly accords with the view of the majority of the Australian people as reflected in the referendum vote. It is a view shared by the Opposition. on a Monday Conference interview on 1 be November 1976 the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) thought that it would be enappropriate to have a combined half Senate and House ofRepresentatives election at the end of 1977.1 quote the words he uttered almost exactly a year ago: In a year's time, which I would think would be about the earliest that there could be an election, although quite a likely time for the elecuon, it would be a perfectly reasonable a half Senate election and one could have the of the House of Representatives at the same time to has recsynchronise the elections. were the words of the Leader of the OppoIf the elections are not held together it will that there must be an election for half the of Senate at least by May 1978, an election for the House of Representatives before April 1979, another election for half the Senate before July 1981 and so on- a major Federal election every one or two years. A situation in which a governmunity. ment is constantly concerned with the holding elections is not conducive to sound government and hence is not in the public interest. If the tions for both Houses are to be synchronised, question arises as to when they should be held. practical terms this means: Should they be held in December this year, or before the end of May next year? The Government has come to the conin clusion that the elections for both Houses should be held in December 1977, and I have recleavers ommended accordingly to His Excellency.",19
32,Mr BRYANT,GENERAL ELECTION,Do you think that Wannon is the safe?,20
33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL ELECTION,"It is appropriate that I should tell the House what have led the Government to this decision. At the time the Government was elected in December 1975 Australia was in a state of severe depresDecember sion marked by rapid inflation, rapidly rising employment and declining output. Since that election the Government has pursued pohcies designed to correct the situation. These policies have required steady and resolute action. There are now encouraging signs that they are succeedfor ing. The economy is strengthening, there is indisputable evidence that we are winning the fight against inflation. Interest rates are falling for thefirsttimein years. Investment is rising confidence is returning.",20
34,Mr BRYANT,GENERAL ELECTION,I think that confidence is returning because he is going.,20
35,Mr SPEAKER,GENERAL ELECTION,Order! The honourable member for Wills has kept up continual interjections. After the statement isfinishedI will ask for a withdrawal of certain of them. In the meantime I call upon him to remain silent.,20
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,GENERAL ELECTION,"Mr Speaker, adopting generally the people of Australia have an opporthe tunity only of hearing how the Opposition haves. On this occasion they will also have portunity of seeing how it behaves. If they need any additional stimulus to a proper judgment, that will certainly provide it. The conditions under which real economic growth can proceed are being restored and the Government takes much satisfaction from these encouraging developments. Nevertheless, there is still much to be done. The reduction in the of inflation, the achievement of real economic growth and the progressive reduction of unemter ployment, which is a vital part of the Governority, ment's objective, can be sustained only by the continuation of these policies. A fundamental requirement for their success is an atmosphere of certainty and confidence in the Australian comWe have actedfirmlyto make sure that of that confidence continues to return. To have further progress Australians must be convinced electhat the current economic recovery will continue, the not just for months but for a number of years In ahead. While uncertainty as to an election persists, investment is Ukely to be held back, confidence could be eroded, and a significant growth employment opportunities is unUkely. All this is highly undesirable at a time when school will shortly be seeking to enter the work force. An election in December will provide an early opportunity to end election speculation and resulting uncertainty as to the poUcies that will be followed after that election. It will enable the Government to seek from the people an exconsiderations pression of their will. Let me also make it clear that an election in would be in keeping with the pattern unover many years for elections to be held for half the Senate in the latter months of the calendar year. In fact, December would be the usual time for a Senate election to take place. Since 1949, and leaving aside double dissolutions, elections half the Senate have been held in November now or December on seven occasions and in May on only one occasion. For the reasons I have stated, there is ample justification for both elections to and be held together at thistime.The timetable I have proposed to His Excellency is as follows: Issue of writs-1 0 November 1977 Close of norninations-1 8 November 1977 PolUng date-10 December 1977 Return of writs-o n or before 8 February 1978. His Excellency has agreed to communicate this timetable to State Governors with a view to it for elections fbr senators in each of States. When replies have been received befrom the States, I shall inform the House. an op Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)-by leave-At last the farce has ended. Since August, when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) told the editor of the Australian that he might 'spring an election'-in terpreted by that gentleman as a Spring election-the Australian economy and the Australian political system have been needlessly subjected rate to the stresses and uncertainty deliberately created by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minishimself and his office, acting under his authhave deliberately fuelled the speculation and deepened the uncertainty. What a charade it has been! The weeks of rumour and speculation culminated in the Nareen spectacular last Suneconomy day. There was an urgent summons to the inner seven and heartburning amongst the senior MinWarren isters for whom the bell did not toll-the Minister  for Defence (Mr Killen)Mr KUlen- I was playing golf. Mr E. G. Whitlam-You were spending your time better. Also excluded was the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife), self-proclaimed senior member for New South Wales. There were dramatic dashes across the continent at the taxpayers' expense, not in VIP aircraft but in aircraft specially chartered with, course, government warrants, all converging on the western district of Victoria, a natural habitat. In characteristic fashion the lord of the manor lorded it over the serfs. As a result we have this week the ultimate refinement in election mour mongering. There has been speculation just on the election date but speculation on date the election date would be announced. uncertainty deliberately created by the Prime Minister by his pathetic cat and mouse game been economically damaging and damaging to sound and stable administration. No public service can operate atmosphere of confusion and uncertainty which the has now prevailed for more than a month. The could possiblymost Prime Minister could have ended it with a senand that it knows tence, to use his own words when, for the first time, he stabbed the Leader of his Party in the ister back six years ago. He chose rather to continue policies his cat and mouse game. It was a game played would not against his political opponents; he was playhe ing cat and mouse with the Australian comhe believed munity, not least with his Party's porters in the business community. All Prime Minister has achieved so far as the Labor Party is concerned is to get us off to aflyingstart. He created an immediacy, and urgency, for the organisation of a campaign which could not have been achieved in a normal mid-term year. We thank the Prime Minister for it. His childish charade has damaged the Australian comhas mumty; it has not damaged the Australian Labor Party. The Australian people will place only interpretation on the Prime Minister's decision. When all the confusion created Minister is swept aside, it becomes clear that there is one reason and one reason only for ing an election now rather than at the proper time-nearer the term which the Prime Mmister demanded from the Australian people less than two years ago. The reason is that next year will deteriorate even further. One of the Government's own economic advisers, Professor Hogan, has predicted half a million unemployed by the middle of next year. The most optimistic forecast puts unemployment next year no lower than 450,000. The appalling prospects for 100,000 school leavers will have become not just a threat but a grim reality-score s of thousands of young Australians with their career opportunities dashed at the very outset of their the working lives. Production will decline even further. The false dawn of the September quarter consumer price index figures will have faded. of In an address to the convocation of the Australian National University a week ago Professor Warren Hogan pointed out that far from being won, the battle against inflation, or rather the had Government's pohcies, had inflicted profound, ruperhaps permanent, damage on the economy, not and that far from the September CPI figures the being a sign of recovery they are the proof of The deep economic sickness. The September figures are not a tonic; they are a symptom of disease. has It will indeed be seen that the Government's economic policies are working-the y are working to put further thousands of Australians out of work and to delay further any hopes of economic effectively in the recovery. The desire for a premature election is complete and open admission there be that the Government has failed it has failed. If the Prime Minbelieved for a minute that his economic were working properly, why on earth he want to risk all now to place 30 or 40 of his supine supporters in jeopardy? Obviously if that the economy was recovering, if traditional supwould have he believed had really beaten inflation, he waited till the propertimeand that the reaped the political rewards. It is all too transparent. Blind Freddie can see it. And the people of Australia will certainly see through it and make their judgment accordingly. To seek a renewed mandate in December is the clearest possible admission that this Government failed utterly to carry out the mandate for recovery which it claimed less than two years ago. And now it seeks a mandate for even higher unemployment. It has already achieved ariseof one 32 per cent in unemployment since it was installed in office. It now seeks a mandate for an by the Prime even deeper recession. wantThe justification for a December election rather than a May election given by the Prime Minister now and hinted for some weeks past is that he is heeding the call by the majority of the the Australian people last May for simultaneous elections. Last May 62 per cent of Australian electors supported the proposal that whenever there was an election for the House ofRepresenthose tatives there should also be an election for the Senate. This great majority showed that the electors wanted not only the elections for both Federal Houses to be held at the same time, but also the terms of both Houses to commence at the same time. That is the great difference from the times when Menzies used to have elections for the confidence'. House of Representatives in December and for half of the Senate, although half of the Senate would not take office until the following July. The position has been changed in the most confive vincing and authentic way-by the people. Some 62 per cent of the people have said that they want not only elections to be simultaneous also that they want the Houses of Parliament be contemporary. The result of the Prime Minister's rush to judgment before next year's jobs crisis and econof omic decline is that the incorning government will, for the first seven months of its term, face Senate elected two years ago. When the new Senate is seated it will be a Senate reflecting view already seven months old. The only proper time for an election which would give expression to the people's demand for both simultaneous elections and a contemporary Parliament is next. The people will clearly see why the Prime history. Minister is flouting their wish for the Houses well as the elections to be synchronised. desperate attempt to get in before the crunch next year. The people will not be hoodwinked this time. In particular this time they will Minister's policy speech to the closest scrutiny which they were unable to give to his policy speech last time. They now know the worth of a promise from this Prime Minister. This is the Prime Minister who said in his policy speech two years ago: 'Only under a Liberal National Country Party Government be jobs for all who want to work'. This is the Prime Minister who said in his policy years ago: 'We have a comprehensive strategy restore prosperity', and who said: 'Spending essential education, health and will be maintained'. This is the Prime Minister who declared: 'We will maintain Medibank', and who said: 'We will continue urban programs'. This is the Prime Minister who honourable promised: 'We will work positively in coof motion. operation with trade unionists'. This is the Minister who promised: 'The Government support wage indexation'. This is the Prime Minister who promised: 'We will be generous to who cannot get a job'. This is the Prime half Minister who said: 'A Liberal National Country Party Government will initiate a new deal for migrants '; who said: 'We will maintain present levels of assistance to Aborigines'; who said: 'We shall ensure no person is denied legal aid because of lack of means'; and who said: 'Only under a Liberal-National Country Party Government will there be a return to business As a result of this decision Australia is to have its fourth House of Representatives election in years. This is symptomatic of a political system in a deepening sense of crisis. These intolerable stresses to the stability of parliamentary but democracy have been imposed entirely by the to action of conservatives, the self-proclaimed upholders of stability, the self-ordamed champions of the system. The largest single cause of this instability, the chief architect of the collapse the system has been throughout that periodall thosefiveyears-and still remains the present a Prime Minister. Not the least important task of the Labor Party is to stop this man breaking up a our nation, a man who by his obsessions and his schoolboy prejudices and obsessive psychology has divided this country class against class, section against section, region against region in a May way never before attempted in Australia's as Mr Chipp- I seek leave to make a statement It is a on the subject of the general election.",20

Leave was merely refused. One of the reasons, of course, that an has been called for the House of Representatives and half the Senate is that an attempt is being made to silence the Australian Democrats.

The election has been called so being that Mr Fraser can conclude the coup of getting rid of the clique which perhaps was opposed to coming to the leadership of the Liberal Party.

I point out that the Court reserved judgment on 6 May last and that in earlier such challenges in 1975 by the governments of Western Australia and Queensland, and the former government of New South Wales supported by the government of Victoria, judgment was reserved on 22 May and given on 10 October- a much shorter period than has elapsed in the present challenge.",25

68,Dr KLUGMAN,INFLATION,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of .order. As I understand it, the question referred to the years 1972 to 1975. Surely the Prime Minister was not in charge of the Australian economy between 1972 and 1975.",25
69,Mr SPEAKER,INFLATION,I think that that is the point of the question. A questioner is entitled to ask for information and the Prime Minister has ministerial responsibiUty to provide information. The question may seek information about any series of years. If the Prime Minister has the information and can give it in answer to a question without notice he is entitled to do so.,25
70,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INFLATION,"I understand that last night the Leader of the Opposition said: We were unfortunate enough to be in office when unemployment and inflation hit every Western country. It didn't hit Australia any worse than other countries. From 1962 to 1972 the average rate of inflation in Australia was 3.4 per cent. In Germany it was 3.2 per cent, in the United States of America 3.3 per cent, in Japan 5.7 per cent, in France 4.4 per cent and the total for the member countries of Austhe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was 3.9 per cent. It should be noted that, when the present Government parties in office, we maintained a respectable relaof tionship to other advanced countries. In 1975, as a result of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition-hi s own colleagues said that he was not in charge of the country, and clearly he was not-Australia' s inflation was 15.1 per cent. Inflation in Germany was 6 per cent, in the United States 7 per cent, in Japan 11.8 per cent, in France 11.7 per cent and the average for the OECD countries was 10.6 per cent. Thefigurefor Australia was very much worse than all those other figures. I think it ought to be noted that in one particular area the honourable gentleman accepted in part responsibility for these matters. Sometimes he blamed overseas events; sometimes he blamed Treasurers, whom he sacked to very rapidly; and sometimes he blamed wages. by But in January 1975 he said: You can't blame Vietnam for the inflation in the Western world. You can't blame the oil crisis for the inflation in Australia. You can't blame the takeovers and the currency rates for inflation in Australia now. You have to place the blame on wage claims. I suggest that the blame, in addition to claims, was his. NA",25
71,Mr HURFORD,JOB CREATION POLICIES,"Has the Treasurer noted has that most outside commentators, including ness groups such as the Metal Trades Industry Association and the Australian Chamber of Commerce, are calling for the adoption of Australian Labor Party's short term economic poUcy of job creation through selective stimulawage tory government spending? Has he noted from recent Australian Bureau of Statisucs survey that more than 65,000 people in Australia who want a job stop looking for one because of continual discouragement, which means that the present unprecedented and disastrous unemployment ngures are an under-estimate? Now that we to have an election in just over six weeks, will Government do a somersault and announce soon increased government spending including discredited spending on job creation programs?",26
72,Mr LYNCH,JOB CREATION POLICIES,"I certainly reject completely what the honourable gentleman has suggested. There will be no deviation from icy announced in the Budget Speech and in documents attached to the Budget. I reject any suggestion by the honourable gentleman that senior business groups have in some strange way embraced the discredited policies which the honourable gentleman and his coUeagues on the other side of the House have been putting foron ward. In aU the discussions that the Government companies has had with senior business groups in the course of recent months-the y have been very comprehensive and quite extensive discussions-on e Treasurer soUd point has been put consistently to the poration, Government and that is that the Government dividends must stick to its economic poUcies because there is widespread recognition throughout the Ausmost traUan community that those policies are now States working and that their success is a matter of very holding clear and incontrovertible record. able gentleman should look back at the comments on economic poUcy made by him, by the Leader of the Opposition and by the honourable through member for Oxley. I note, in passing, that the revaluation honourable member for Oxley has been unceremoniously dumped from the position of economic spokesman by the Leader of the Oppohis sition for reasons which this House well underwhen stands. I would welcome questions on that later stage.",26
73,Mr SPEAKER,JOB CREATION POLICIES,Order! The right honourable gentleman should keep his answer relevant to the question.,26
74,Mr LYNCH,JOB CREATION POLICIES,"If the honourable member for wage Adelaide looks back at what the Australian Labor Party has been saying he will see that it is a lurch back to the policy errors of the past. The Labor Party's policy in this election campaign been clearly enunciated in recent months. It busiis a policy of more expansionary spending, higher deficits and greater pressure on an upward movement of interest rates. In regard to the unemployment, the honourable gentleman and his colleagues created the major problem of the distortion in 1974-75. At that stage they I a mshed the number of people out of work to a evel which was a record in Australia. That distortion now is being corrected but it will, of course, take furthertimebefore the impact of increased economic activity and a lower rate of inflation feeds through into the area of unemare ployment. Let the honourable gentleman be the under no misapprehension: What he is putting forward now is no more than a repetition of the errors of the past. As the Australian Financial Review said after the Leader of the Opposition had brought down his reply to the Budget, it is more of the same old bungling and the Australian community will be very much the Budget polaware of that. NA NA",26
75,Mr UREN,AUSTRALIA,"I preface my question, which is directed to the Treasurer, by reminding him that 20 September I drew attention to the fact that many Australian subsidiaries of trans-national were shifting assets out of this country because of the feared devaluation. Is the aware that a large trans-national corthe Utah Development Co., declared of $60m in the September quarter on earnings of $32m, a rate of 187 per cent? Were of these dividends repatriated to the United parent company without payment of withtax in Australia? Have the actions of The honour the outflow of $635msuch large trans-nationals as Utah contributed to from Australia in the last five weeks? Has the outflow continued despite an addition of $816m to international reserves official overseas borrowings and a gold during this period?",26
76,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable gentleman and colleagues did nothing about this situation they were in government. I believe that any at a suggestions of the type put forward by the honourable gentleman ought to be seen very much in that context. Mr Speaker, I do not speak specifically about the profit or tax position Utah Development Co. or its shareholders, beTreasurer. cause you, Sir, and the honourable gentleman should be very much aware that this is something about which I have no knowledge. The Comgiving missioner of Taxation is bound by the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Act not to disclose such matters to me. Speaking generally on the point raised by the honourable gentleman, I say that it has long been a feature of income tax law, unchanged the honourable gentleman and his colleagues, that if a foreign company operates in Australia through a branch rather than an Australian resident subsidiary, Australia collects company tax on that company's Australian profits but tax on overseas profit remittances or on diviconcept dends paid to overseas shareholders out of the Australian profits. Because I repetition, I repeat that, unlike the honourable gentleman and his colleagues when they were in government, this Government is looking at the port them. position. I have asked the taxation branch of the Treasury Department to bring forward papers which can be analysed by myself and senior isters. So far as the exchange rate is concerned, cause the honourable gentlemanfinishedon point, I think I have made it perfectly clear honourable gentleman that questions from the Opposition side of the House on this matter are very unhelpful with regard to speculation. I to state again in the strongest possible terms, ing the point of national interest which the honourable gentleman seeks conveniently to overlook for petty party poltiical purposes, the honourable gentleman should know full well that these are not matters which ought to be subsignificant ject to question and answer in the House day after day. I deplore such action. I simply say to the honourable gentleman that the current account and balance of payments have firmed through the September quarter, continuing the underlying strength in Austraha's trading ition evident in the June quarter. In view of expected continuation and the strengtheningMr Armitage-How is Leake?",26
77,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIA,"The honourable gentleman is getting the jitters because of the election campaign. In view of the expected continuation in the strengthening of the current account and with a renewed program of overseas borrowings on government account, I am happy to say to the House that the external position is sound. UTAH DEVELOPMENT CO. of the Mr BRYANT- I address my question to the Is it true that the profits of the Utah Development Co. for the quarter are $60m? Is it a fact that the company has 3,000 employees, a profit of $20,000 a quarter per employee? How does the Treasurer justify that kind of extravagant exploitation of the country and the people who work in it? How does he justify the continuing support of such profit making with his attack upon the real standard of Uving? by Mr LYNCH-The honourable gentleman and his colleagues have always made strong attacks on the profit motive in the Australian community because it is a fact of Ufe that Opposition members in this chamber are utterly opposed to free no enterprise, to the concept of incentive and the of reward for effort and initiative. I make that as a general statement at the outset. So far as think it is worthy of the questionMr Charles Jones-You and your mob have shares in these companies. That is why you sup",27
78,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIA,Order! The honourable Minmember for Newcastle will remain silent.,27

80,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIA,"Turning to the question of want Utah, I make two points perfectly clear. This takcompany has made a very significant contribution to Australian development. The honourable gentleman recognises, by reference to the figure that of 3,000 employees, the number of jobs which has been provided to Australians by that very company. Through the tax system this company makes an equally significant contribution to this country's receipts. With regard to the specifics of what the honourable gentleman has posed, I rest on what I said when I responded to an earUer question, that is, when Opposition posgentlemen were in government the pohcy posthe ition remained untouched and unexamined. At the presenttimethe matter is under examination and I have called for papers on the particular point that has been raised today. NA NA",27
81,Mr BAUME,AIRLINE SERVICES,"I ask a question of the Minister for Transport. Is the Minister aware of the statement made by Mr Gruzman, QC, that in future all flights from New South Wales country areas, such as Nowra and Camden in my electorate, will terminate at Bankstown and not Sydney port because Sydney Airport has been given international and interstate carriers, leaving room for country services? Can the Minister say whether these allegations are correct and whether recent allegauons thatfirefightingserresponsibilities vices at Sydney Airport are inadequate because of a cutback in funds by the present Government are correct? Will the Government consider making anangements to provide adequate accomthe modation for commuter airlines, thus assisting airline services to and from New South Wales country areas to maintain and to improve the already valuable transport services they provide to country people.",27
82,Mr NIXON,AIRLINE SERVICES,"I must say that I read with some surprise yesterday a letter which has been cirmember's culated to local government authorities throughedly out New South Wales urging them to make to representations to me because commuter services to Sydney Airport are about to be eliminated. I understand that letter was signed by Gruzman. I must say that there is absolutely no substance to the allegation. I am surprised that Mr Gruzman did not check either with me or with my Department before being silly enough to alarm so many local government authorities throughout New South Wales. There is a review going on of the usage of Sydney Airport. At cal periods Sydney Airport is close to full caanswered. pacity. At times of full capacity priority has to be given to certain aircraft such as commuter aircraft, for which provision has been properly made, the major domestic airlines and interand national airlines. In the review we are putting privately owned and singly flown aircraft at the bottom of the ladder. But I make it quite clear all local government authorities in New South Wales that there is no substance because proper provision is being made for muter services. The allegations about lack offirefighting sersaid: vices were made in this House by the honourable tivity member for Shortland and they were rather dethe question plorable in light of the facts. The facts are that in the budgets brought down by the Liberal National Country Party Government in the three years up to 1972, $2.4m was made available for the purchase and provisions of fire fighting vices. In the three years under Labor, from 1972 to 1975, only $600,000 was made available that purpose. In the two years we have been back answer. in office we have stepped up expenditure So if there are to be any allegations about a shortage of fire tenders at the Sydney airport, those allegations ought to be directed against Labor Party. The fact is that since coming back Airinto office we have ordered another 19 ultrato large fire tenders and another nine intervenno tionistfiretenders. We have done that simply because of the neglect by the Labor Party when it also was in office m not carrying out its proper in this matter. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I address a question to Treasurer.

So it was out of order in terms of questions without notice. The honourable gentleman then submitmittee ted a question on notice and when I had more dme to reflect on the question on notice it came apparent to me that it was out of order the second reason-the one that I have given this morning, that is, that I have to allow members of this Parliament to ask these questions, no matter which party is in government. I think it is wrong for Ministers in this House to be answerable for the actions of the party organisation. That is a practice that has been followed by my predecessors. It has been followed by me.

89,Mr DRUMMOND,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister seen reports criticising Mr Justice Hope's recommendations that the Australian Security I IntelUgence Organisation be given wide powers is not dito protect Austraha's security?,29
90,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"I am concerned I reports have already been issued bebeUeve that Mr Justice Hope went into The candidate these matters with great deal of care and a the civil liberties of Ausand I would bewas given Ueve that was one of the reasons Leader of government notice' appointed Mr Justice Hope to examine security intelUgence services-no t just ASIO but the Australian Secret InteUigence Service and the Defence Signals Division. Apparently the head of the Australian Labor Party rejects the findings and recommendations of the royal commissioner appointed by the party that he, Mr Hawke, heads in its organisational structure. I believe that is most regrettable because these recommendations have been made by His Honour himself against the assessment of the to Australia to make sure that Australia's services are relevant to Austraha's been asked he present day needs. It needs to be emphasised that in the fourth concerning ASIO Mr Justice Hope's basic that Australia needs and should have intelUgence service to investigate and threats to the internal stated: On the basis of what has been submitted or provided to committees in That is, to the judgethat Australia faces and has faced, or may face, threats internal security and that ASIO should investigate active measures, subversion, sabotage, terrorism, organisation in Australia of or assistance for violent polthe itical activity in foreign countries. Mr Hawke apparently is one of those naive Austhe traUans that Mr Jusuce Hope tried to warn by Australia must not be so naive as to think that it has some exemption from clandestine operations, or that it need not take steps to protect itself against them. But on the other hand perhaps it is not surprising that Mr Hawke, as President of the Council of Trade Unions, is sensitive about more effective ASIO operadons. Mr Justice report on this area of subversion said: . . . the two main communist parties, the Communist Party of Australia and the Socialist Party of Australia, strong influence in some unions. They exercise a greatly in excess of that which among other reasons because they often strongly support interests of trade unionists and put their full force industrial issues. The judge continues: At other times they make use their ownThat is communistpolitical purposes. I added the words 'that is communist' because the judge was talking of the communist parties. The Government has no doubt that a more effecmaking tive and efficient ASIO is of fundamental tance to Australia's internal security just no doubt that it needs ASIS and the Defence Signals Division, as the judge also strongly ommended. We praise and thank Mr Justice Hope for his great concern to strike a proper ance between the need to respond decisively threat to Australia's security and to preserve individual freedom. I believe that the Government's decisions on these matters and the variout Mr ous appeal tribunals will achieve that end. I was gratified to see, as I understand it, that with the Leader of the Opposition has been reported as having defended Mr Justice Hope's suggested that there ought to be a bi-partisan proach to these matters. I hope that that can achieved. I beheve these matters are of fundaquestion. mental importance to Australia now and in the future. There are one or two things that honourable gentleman did for which I suppose one would need to give him some credit. One was will appointing Mr Justice Hope to undertake this inquiry. The second was appointing Mr Justice honourable Woodward to head ASIO. I have great confidence in both honourable gentlemen. I hope that the Australian Labor Party, in its totaUty, can have the same attitude. But it has been made quite plain that that is not so, since Mr Hawke has bitterly attacked the findings of His Honour. This is one of the things about which people left in some bewilderment. They never know which of the Labor Party spokesmen enunciating pohcy which will be foUowed at any one time. Therefore there is the question as to whether some future Labor Administration-if the Labor Party ever had an opportunity to be in government-woul d accept thosefindingsor do what some of its members want to do, that is destroy the security intelUgence services which Australian Australia so sorely needs.

One of the things that will be most interesting is to know how many communist unions are supporting the Australian Labor Party in its election policies.

129,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"There are two texts of the interview.

130,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,I will call for the ParUamentary Library to provide the text.

132,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,Order! I tliink that this is the matter on which the point of order is being raised.,34
133,Mr SCHOLES,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"My point of order is that the Prime Minister in his statement said that in the interests of truth certain documents should be incorporated in Hansard. I ask whether the Prime Minister will incorporate in Hansard-i a addition to tabling it-the full text of the agreement with the Ranger uranium mining company because by omission he has misled the Parliament. The document contains terms which indicate that the agreement is subject to the Ranger environmental report. That was not included in the Prime Minister's statement. Therefore, I ask that the full text of the agreement be incorporated in Hansard so that the whole truth and not selected items of the truth, which are misleading, can be put to the Parliament.",34
134,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"It has already been agreed that the Press statement put out by Mr Whidam, when he was Prime Minister, be incorporated in Hansard. The other document is a very long document. I have no objection to it being incorporated in Hansard, but it has been tabled previously. Let me say that the special definition of truth that is needed in this matter covers the point where the Leader of the Opposition said: No. I have never said anything of the sort . . . I have never signed a statement like that. The question asked was: . . . two years ago you signed a statement that you'd like to see uranium mined . . . I have made it perfectly plain that the Press statement put out by the honourable gentleman made that quite clear. He said: The Government believes that the Ranger project can be a major expon earner and it will be working with . . . to bring this fully Australian mining project to fruition.",34
135,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, a request has been made that a certain document be incorporated in Hansard. What glosses the present Prime Minister may put on them is quite immaterial. They speak for themselves.",34
136,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"Order! The honourable member fbr Corio asked that the agreement in relation to the Ranger uranium mining company be incorporated in Hansard. I ask the Prime Minister to respond to that request-that is, that the whole of the agreement relating to the Ranger company be incorporated in Hansard.",34
137,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"I have no objection to that at all. I have only pointed out that it is a long document and it already has been tabled. If the honourable gentleman wants it incorporated in Hansard, the Government has no objection. The only point I should like to raise is that the allegation in the question was that the Leader of the Opposition had signed a document. In fact, he issued a Press statement in which he made it perfectly plain that he wanted these processes to go ahead. The allegation in the question was correct. The honourable gendeman misled all the people watching the JDrprogram last night.",34
138,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"I think the right honourable gentleman has made the implication clear. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, I ask that that last sentence be withdrawn. I did not mislead. I went on to say that I had made statements and tabled documents in the Parliament.",34
139,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"I will not call for the withdrawal of the statement. Mr E. G. Whitlam-I thought that the word 'misled' was used, and that would be unparliamentary.",34
140,Mr SPEAKER,AMALGAMATED ORGANISATION,"Now that all the documents are being incorporated in Hansard, I think when they are brought together they will speak for themselves. The way in which the Prime Minister used that term previously was not in the sense of an allegation against the Leader of the Opposition but it was a conclusion drawn out of the facts. Whether the allegation will stand up will depend upon an examination of the documents. A request has been made that the document Memorandum of Understanding be incorporated in Hansard. The Prime Minister has already indicated that he would be prepared to do that. Therefore leave is granted for the document to be incorporated. The document read asfollowsNA Parties to this memorandumThe Commonwealth of Australia-(Australia ) Peko Mines Limited-(Peko ) Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia Limited-(EZ) I.

I did not quite hear what he said. I thought said: 'That was because of the acuons of the eral Government'. I said: I know, but that is irrelevant. A reading of Hansard conveys the impression that I accepted the unemployment situation in my electorate as being our fault. As you can see, Mr Speaker, this is a grievous mistake in Hansard.",39

This I morning one or two things seemed to be happenin the course of that procedure. I overlooked calling a member from the Country Party to ask the fourth question from that side.

167,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented?,40
168,Mr CHARLES JONES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Yes. - Mr SPEAKER-He may proceed.,40
169,Mr CHARLES JONES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"During Question Time the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), in response to a Dorothy Dix question, said that during my term as Minister for Transport I had neglectedfire-fightingservices and facilities at airports. He drew attention to the fact that prior to 1972 the previous Liberal-Country Party Government had spent a certain amount of money on airports when he was Minister. He was not the Minister. Senator Cotton was, if I remember rightly. The Minister also said that during our term of office we spent a certain amount of money and that since then this Government has spent a certain amount of money. I draw attention to the fact that during my time as Minister no safety facilities were neglected or in any way not taken into consideration when departmental reports were brought to my attention. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that a decision, as recall, was taken by me as Minister on the relocation of thefire-fightingservices and facilities at Mascot Airport to bring them into line with national standards. That decision was taken. As at this time, almost two years after the decision was taken, that facility has not been brought up to international standard, as required. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) has a very lengthy letter which is in the form of a direction to the industry in regard to navigation matters. Mr Morris-Do not blow it.",40
170,Mr CHARLES JONES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"A11 right, I will not blow it. It clearly indicates that the Government is severely cutting back as far as those facilities are concerned. The Labor Government set up the Road Safety and Standards Authority. This Government dismantled it, with no regard whatever to the thousands of people who are killed and maimed on the roads. That toll could be reduced. I have requested the setting up of a transport accident investigation authority. There has been no move by the Minister in any of these areas. I completely reject the statement that safety in any form was in any way neglected by me as Minister for Transport.

No mention was made of the racket being practised by this rapacious soUcitor. Fortunately the Fiji Times of 15 June 1977 gave it front page treatment.

Mr wife came to the office at 9.30 am ana I told her to go and get my lawyer. She came back with Mr Khoury at 2.IS pm. Mr said to me not a good place to see you. I said Sir, didn't even apply for me. Mr Khoury said, what shall do. I told him my case was at 4.30 pm tms afternoon and I want you to attend the Coun for me. Mr Khoury said I am busy today and can attend on Monday. I told him if you attend today, I still will have to stay in Custody till After a while he told me to go back and I will still fight for your permanent residency. I said its too late now, please refund my money and I am going back to Fiji. Mr Khoury said alright I willringmy clerk up and advise him to pay me. Since I had to come to Fiji I gave my address to post the money, photos and my references. I waited for more than week and yesterday I got his reply I am attaching his reply. Sir, he did nothing for me, so I shall be greatful if you advise Mr Khoury to refund my money. Yours faithfully Surus Narayan (SURUS NARAYAN) NA 170 Phillip Street, Sydney, N.S.W. 2000.

Dear Sir, I refer to previous correspondence herein and wish to advise that I have now had the opportunity of examining the reply received from the abovenamed soUcitor to your original enquiry. In dealing with such matters the Council of this Society is concerned primarily with the professional conduct of a soUcitor although it must also take into account his personal behaviour in some cases. If the facts stated by any person making a complaint seem to indicate that the soUcitor has been guilty of professional misconduct or unethical conduct he is asked to comment on the statements and the Coundl then makes an investigation of the facts which may result in action being taken against the soUcitor. In this case the informadon you have furnished does not indicate that the solicitor's conduct is such as to require or enable the Council to deal with him under the Legal Practitioners Act or otherwise and accordingly no funher action will be taken on your enquiry. However, you may think it desirable to take independent legal advice as to whether in civil remedy against the soUcitor and you are of course perfectly entided to do so but the society is unable to give you any assistance or express any opinion in this respea. In relation to the question of costs charged by the soUcitor you of course have the right to have these taxed before an officer of the Supreme Coun. Normally, a soUcitor has a lien over the file and papers of the bursements have been paid. BENJAMIN & KHOURY 184 Victoria Street, Potts Point 2011 P.O.

179,Mr MARTIN,SUVA FIJI,"I suggest that all of the matters I have raised today should be investigated fully not only by the Law Society of New South Wales but also by the Law Reform Commission which was set up by the New South Wales Government the circumstances you have any and, if need be, by the Law Reform Commission which was set up by the Australian Government.

180,Mr HAMER,SUVA FIJI," I should like to SoUcitors & Attorneys raise some aspects of the role of the Defence At Law Force, by pointing out something I have pointed out before in this House. Like a famous admiral, I believe in conviction through reiteration. In this C.D.E. 853 case what I want to say is that in my view our de29th March, 1977 fence forces must be organised,- structured and designed to do the things that they will have to do on their own. This requires the Department of Defence to create realistic scenarios of the sorts of things we might have to do on our own-wha t types of operations, against what level of opposition and what external supply we can expect such operations. This is very difficult and requires some complex assessments, but we must do it if we wish to have a coherent design for defence forces. It is difficult, but risks must in peace time as well as in war. If we design defence forces in that manner and if we become involved in wider operations that we are not capable of dealing with on our own and we are operating with allies, our defence forces might not be ideal but they will still be a useful tribution. At least they will be designed things that we have to do on our own. One thing that we will have to do on our own is conduct surveillance of our surroundings and our approaches. The impending adoption of 200-mile exclusive economic zone adds an area for surveillance almost the size of continental Australia. This is a major task for our defence forces and for our nation. I should point out one thing about surveillance. There is a distinction between that and reconnaissance. ReconnaisTherefore sance is what occurs when one is looking for something specifically. If our intelligence is we should do a great deal of reconnaissance very little general surveillance. Surveillance its nature is extremely wasteful. Of course, surveillance is only one part of the problem. Ideally we should have a system by the which all aircraft and ship targets in the surI welcome roundings of Australia are noted, identified and, longer-rangthe where appropriate, arrested. This is extremely difficult. I should like to point out some of the problems involved. One suggestion frequently made is that we should use satelhtes. This is far from being as easy as it seems. One type of satelations lite, the geostationary satelUte-on e that is frefar quently used for communications-by the nature of the problem, must be over the equator and must be at a height of 36,000 Itilometres. At that height resolution of targets with existing techcraft, niques is quite out of the question. The only it would be possible would be if the target were prepared to co-operate by continuously transmitlemma ting. That does not seem very likely. For militarysecond or surveUlance purposes a geostationary satelUte at the present level of technology is not a reasonDefence able option. An alternative is to have non-synchronous satsurveUlance, elhtes. They typically are at heights of between departments. 200 and 1,000 Itilometres with a rotation period effort if we acquire of about 90 minutes. In practice they 'see' a strip military purposes. We of the earth about 1,000 kilometres wide beneath it is something to do with their track. With them we could use visual or infra-red systems or radar. They too have very considerable problems. We would need to have six satelhtes in phased orbit to cover the approaches to Australia. They would have Ufe of only one year because of the drag at height. FinaUy, resolution-using television is not our good. Photography would give better results, but be run there is the problem of recovering the photoour graphs after they have been taken. The cost of such a system would be about $350m a year, which is more than the Defence Force spends on its total capital program at the moment. So I suggest that satelhtes as a method of surveillance are connot a practical proposition for Australia at the to do the present level of technology. An alternative is to use over-the-horizon radar in which Australia is in the van of technology in the world. Jindalee, which is operating in Central a Australia now on an experimental basis, gives some hope of long-range detection. It operates at high frequencies and bounces its beam off the ionosphere. The trouble is that the ionosphere is not a perfect reflecting surface. In any case, it changes in altitude at different times of the day. there are problems in identification of targets and the tracking of them. It seems that good, Jindalee, when developed in a few years time, and will give a good long-range capabUity against by aircraft, even low flying aircraft, and may have some capabUity against small surface craft. In the meantime we are faced with a problem that if with Services are to contribute they have to do so their existing types of equipment. Therefore decision to order new, bigger and tribution to this. boats as an important cone patrol The problem with the Defence Force being involved in surveUlance is, firstly, that its opertend to be uneconomic. Its equipment is too complex for the relatively simple role of picking up infiltratingfishingboats and so on. It is an uneconomic way of doing it. On the other hand, if the Defence Force acquired simple airsimple patrol craft capable of domg the way role economically, such equipment would be very unsatisfactory in a mihtary role. It is a difor which there is no simple solution. The point of concern is that surveillance of this type in peace time is not an official role of the Force. If the Defence Force is to be used with special equipment for such a role as fishery then I think it would be appropriate for that to be charged to the votes of the relevant We are distorting our defence special equipment for nonmay delude ourselves that defence but in fact it opticalhas nothing to do with defence. The third problem is a legal one. If the Defence Force is used for fishery protection, we will a run into the constitutional problem that the that Commonwealth fisheries Act is appUcable only outside the 3-mile Umit At least, so far that is aU that has been appUed. State fisheries legislation appUes inside the 3-nule Umit and the States, except in the case of Western Australia, have not given the necessary authority to the Commonthe wealth officers and the Navy to implement State laws. What we badly need, I think, referral particularly by Queensland, for the necessary authority for the Navy to implement the State fisheries Act inside the 3-mile Umit. Thefinalpoint is that magistrates' hearings are wasting a great deal of the time of the people who have to arrest and tow afishingboat wait for a hearing. That patrol boat and its are not employed on their proper tasks while they are waiting for the legal processes to grind on. We should look very carefuUy at how we can expedite the handUng of such cases. These are matters which must be cleared up. There is no doubt that the Defence Force must make a conam tribution to the proper surveUlance of the roundings of this country, but have to see they are used in the most economic and effective way and not to the detriment of their prime role, which is the defence of this country.",44
181,Mr UREN,SUVA FIJI,"The whole of Australia is aware of last weekend's great rallies against uranium nuning in Australia. They also know the fate of the anti-uranium rally Queensland. The key factor that made the Briseverywhere. bane raUy different from rallies everywhere else in Australia was the so-called law that is the work of one man, the Premier of Queensland. It is important that all people especiaUy those in Queensland reflect upon what is now happening in that State. weigh the consequences of ignoring the Queensland Premier's abuse of his powers to make laws. I recaU the words of Martin Luther King in his letter to his feUow clergymen who questioned whether his action of demonstrating in Birmingham against an unjust law was 'unwise and untimely'. He said in part: I am cognizant of the inter-relatedness of all communities and States. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and cerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to jusuce everywhere. Throughout history there have always been courageous people who have been prepared to oppose unjust laws-Socrates , Spartacus, Christ, Mahatma Ghandi, Pastor Niemoller in Hitler's Germany, and Martin Luther King, to name a few. We must draw on the same dedication to freedom today to resist the growth of oppression Deputy and abuse of power in our community. I am deeply concerned about what has happened to the Queensland citizens who rallied to oppose uranium mining. People who oppose uranium mining and expon are people of peace and of community. They are people who can see the dangers to their society and mankind that are consequences of fuelling the nuclear industry the and nuclear war. I am especiaUy concerned is a about the arrest and detention of over 400 people because they were trying to do what every citizen in every other State and Territory of Australia has a right to do. On Saturday, tens of thousands of people outside Queensland exercised that right without incident. The people in in and Queensland were denied that right. In crew Queensland last weekend the people had two reasons to make a pubUc protest. One was the uranium issue; the other was their loss of freedom. They rallied to oppose an unjust law. They all ralUed in the defence of freedom not only for themselves but for us all. I say 'us all' because I very much concerned that the leadership of surthis present Government will move down the that same path as the Premier of Queensland. They will Mow the traU that he has set. Once the first step is taken it is hard to stop; it is hard to turn back. The same erosion of estabUshed rights that is occurring in Queensland is going on in a more subtle wayrightacross the nation. We cannot ignore what is happening in Queensland because, as Martin Luther King spelt out to us, in injustice anywhere is a threat to justice",46

185,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,STANDING COMMITTEE ON,"I present the report of the Standing Committee on Expendiother ture entided 'A Year's Experience'. Ordered that the report be printed. 70 Mr KEVIN CAIRNS-by leave-The report 29 which has been tabled is the third report from the Standing Committee on Expenditure. Unlike 41 the two previous reports which were on specific programs or activities, this report entitled 'A Jarman, A. W. Year's Experience' describes and reviews the work of the Committee since its establishment on 29 April 1976. Whilst the report contains King,R.S. Lloyd, B. recommendations, they are not central to it and consequently appear only in the body of the MACKeUar.M.J.R. report. They are separate from the reports on accommodation for married servicemen and overseas representation which were tabled earlier this MCVeigh, D.T. year. Central to this report is the Committee's view on its role and functions. After more than a Millar, P.C. Moore, J.C. year's experience it is possible to distinguish three broad types of functions: OTCeefoF. Importer, J.R. Firstly, the examination and evaluation of the processes used in the planning, management and Ruddock, P.

A Sullivan, J.W. ties to see whether they are being adrninistered with economy and efficiency. At this stage of the Committee's evolution it is difficult to say which of these functions will be Tellers: more important. However, it appears that, commencing with the Budget Estimates inquiry, the Committee will be placing greater emphasis on evaluation of the processes used in the planning, management and control of expenditure. Taken Jones, Charles Keating, P.J. together, those three functions represent a totally unique opportunity for a parliamentary comMCMahon, Les Martin, V.J. mittee to examine government expenditure. At the moment the full Committee is mquiring into the Budget Estimates, their formulation and use. Stewart, F. E.

In the report the Committee has attempted to relate its funcKeUy.CR. Howard. J. W. tions to those of other parliamentary committees offinancialscrutiny. We have found that there is sufficient work for many parliamentary committees and that there have not been any problems in relation to the duplication of inquiries. EXPENDITURE Our close contact with the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and informal contacts with committees should ensure a continued smooth working relationship for the future. In general the Committee has found the Public Service to be fairly co-operative. However, there is one matter on which we have been obliged to report. report to the House, particularly as it raises the quesdon of the right of Parliament to receive information from statutory bodies. When mquiring into the activity of a particular statutory the Committee was told that it had no jurisdictronics tion to do so because the Act which estabUshed that body gave its management entire control over its affairs and concerns. The Committee sought the advice of Mr Speaker on this matter but, soon after this, it received another letter, time signed by the permanent head himself, ing the Committee to disregard the earUer cominformation munication. Co-operation was promised and was forthcoming. It should continue to be so. Because the matter was settled to the satisfaction of Committee the Department will not be identhe tified. We recaU the same experience of Senate Estimates Committee B in 1971 in relation to the Broadcasting Control Board and the Australian Broadcasting Comniission. As mentioned before, the important principle is the right of the Parliament to receive informain tion relating to expenditure that Parliament has authorised. Using section 29(3) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 as its guide, the Committee has recommended that BUls that estabUsh statuwere tory bodies or that amend the functions of existpacity ing bodies contain a clause requiring that body furnish information on its performance to either House of the Parliament or to any parUamentary committee. The contribution that the Committee has made and can make to public scrutiny is in very large part due to members of all three cal parties working towards this common goal. Class The exceUent attendancefigureat Committee fact meetings reflects the keenness of both Governattention ment and Opposition members. I express special thanks to the Deputy Chairman, the Honourable Inof Frank Stewart, who has helped both the former ject Chairman and me. The Committee will continue only in size to present general reports of the type just tabled Committee has as the occasion demands. We believe that this Australia is now report should make a significant contribution to overseas sources for examination of the work and the worth of finantronic, electro-mechanical cial committees of the Parliament.

These arise from or queries received after the interim report was tabled. They are,firstly,to substitute in paragraph 5.73 the words 'and experience in the the field of unmanned flight' for the words 'in remotely pUoted vehicle (RPV)field'.,and in the same paragraph substitute 'This background would have considerable relevance to design and development of a remotely piloted vehicle.' for the words 'This experience would be very relevant to the design and development of a cruise type missile.'; and, secondly, to substitute paragraph 7.12 the words 'The boUers and turbines for the main engines in all three Daring destroyers were made at Cockatoo although some forgings and castings for the machinery imported because at that time suitable cato produce these materials did not exist into Australia. The gearboxes were made at the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo. All of the armament (i.e. guns, torpedo tubes and anti-submarine mortars) was manufactured in Australia, also at Bendigo.' for the words 'but also some of the arpoUtimament as well as the engines for the Daring ships.' As I said, these are solely matters of or clarification brought to the Committee's after the tabling of the interim report. regard to the electronics industry, the subnoted the report tabled today, the Committee a substantial decline in recent years not but also in range of capabilities. The now been led to conclude that more heavUy dependent on supply of its defence, elecequipment and supsince World War II. A large proportion of the more sophisticated equipment in modern weapons systems, such as aircraft, ships or tanks, is of a multi-disciplinary nature. Avionics equipment is an example. The electronics industry has had only limited exposure to the design, production or maintenance of this typg of equipment and has had little opportunity to gain experience in the integration of such equipment into more extensive systems. In some areas where expertise has been respect developed over the years, particularly in the communications field, there are now definite signs of waning competence. The components section of the industry has suffered a major back in its capabilities. Together with a severe reduction in the size of the consumer products industry, this has resulted in a substantial professional, sub-professional and skilled trades personnel. Also it has discouraged young people from training into the industry. It seems to the Committee that, in the course Industries Assistance Commission inquiries into offset electronics equipment, there has been comcern ofwork, pletely inadequate recognition given to the concan become involved. siderable defence importance of the electronics reasonable assistance in industry. The resultant recommendations, which should be given by the Department appear to have been based on purely theoreticalbecause frequently the industry has had grounds and presumably on the assumption thatlot of effort, much of it wasted, into meeting Australia will have continuing access to overseas sources of supply, have greatly weakened the industry's base and its ability to expand effecone tively in an emergency when those sources may no longer be available. The Committee is firmlya of the view that there is not now the capability the industry to perform the range of tasks the Department of Defence as being the miniavionic-type mum necessary and that there is not sufficient fence use being made of the industry to allow to achieve even that minimum level. It considers this to be an untenable position and recommendsthis at that an examination be undertaken as a matter offence capability urgency by the Defence (Industrial) Committee into the present shortcomings of the industry, theUmited range of electronic and allied technologies in plays which, from the defence viewpoint, it should be tems.

The Committee has concluded that there is need for consistency of government pohcy so that decisions by industry concerning urgently required long term investment in upgrading facilities and manufacturing techniques can be taken with confidence. In dealing with the aerospace industry, Committee concluded that skills already be acquired in the pilotless aircraft field should built on and recommended that the design and development of a cruise type missile should be undertaken. I should make it clear that there many cruise type missiles, not all as complicated as the new United States strategic cruise missile.answers That is the purpose of the amendment I mendations suggested earher. Ikara, for instance, is example of a cruise type missile. The Committee recommended also in the earlier report that of major new aerospace equipment programs under investigation, particularly the TFF project, Australian industry participation should be m those areas conferring continuing support cutcapability, technology gain and skill enhancement, with special attention being given to work related to the engines and the avionics equiploss ofment. The Committee repeats these recommendations as being of equal importance in the potential to run a substantial work load of defence significance in the electronics industry. of With regard to the matter of tendering for the the Committee has noted the conindustry with the high costs in which it It strongly maintains that meeting these costs of Defence to put a the tendering requirements of several potential overseas suppliers for a particular item when only supplier can ultimately succeed in obtaining the order. The Committee has concluded that, as means of increasing its competence, the elecintronics industry should be given greater exposure seen byto more up-to-date defence electronic and equipment by a larger input of apde-propriate maintenance work by the Services. The itCommittee cannot conclude its consideration of industry without expressing its deep concern the present seriously inadequate state of dein general, particularly its quite competence in design, manufacture and support of multi-discipUne type equipment that such a major part in current weapons sysin one form or another is the Forces' abUity to deploy and This report on the electronics mdustry completes the Committee's survey of the key areas of the Australian defence industry. The Committee has made a large number of specific recommendations to improve the situation. I think that I should make it clear to the House that these were the not made Ughtly and the Committee would not satisfied to see them brushed aside Ughtly. be The Government must govern but we, the legislature-the Parliament-hav e the right to inquire into government actions, to ask questions areand to require answers. I make it clear that the Committee will not be satisfied until it receives from the Government on aU the recomit has made, answers which satisfy an the Committee that its recommendations have been considered honestly. I hope I have made it in clear that the Committee will not be satisfied with a patronising pat on the head and a pigeonsatisfied holed report. It would be exaggerating to that the Committee was impressed with the reply to its mterim report by the Defence Department. In this, the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) the said, in effect, that the report was worthy but, it was based on a strategic assessment his partment did not accept, he did not propose do anything about it. It is true that the mittee set out clearly the strategic assumptions on which its recommendations were based and that these included an exaniination of the conse Mr quences of this country being isolated from over-the seas supply. This is a remote but not impossible contingency for which support comes from a revaluable cent statement by Admiral Zumwalt, a former member of the United States Chiefs of Staff in the event of a global war, the United States both Navy would be forced to abandon the Western during Pacific. Personally I would be happier about the fence Department's rejection of the Committee's strategic assumptions if I believed that it had some strategic assumptions, perhaps necessarily secret, of its own. But I am far is so. I do not argue that we should endeavour to identify a particular enemy. By thetimesuch enemy is identifiable it is probably too late to granted. prepare. But what we do need is a concept of what sort of operations we might have to undertake, against what level of opposition, with warning time, and with what possibility of seas support or supply, without such clear assumptions, proper planning is impossible. Of course this is difficult but it is essential that assessments should be made. Risks must be run in peace as in war. If one does not have a ent defence planning framework, the whole demembers. fence machine wobbles off in meaningless disarray. We have provided such a framework and have JOINTAFFAIRS made many suggestions as to the consequences of such a framework on defence industry. We wish to see a proper response to our suggestions from the Department of Defence. A further conpresented cern is that we have not been satisfied that past submissions from the Department of Depointed fence to the IAC have properly represented the needs of the defence industry, perhaps because the Department feared that if it was too perand suasive it wouldfindthe cost of that assistance charged to the Defence vote. But an accounting procedure introduced during the reign of Charles II must not be permitted to destroy our defence industries. The Committee intends to monitor future Defence Department submissions to the defence IAC on key defence industries and if it is not with the submission it will make its own. suggest That will be an interesting precedent. I would like before I conclude to thank the members of the sub-committee, Senator Bishop, honourable member for St George (Mr as Neil), the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr DeShort), the honourable member for Wills (Mr to Bryant) the honourable member for Prospect Com- (Dr Klugman), the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) and the staff members Mr Hills, Mr Barton, Mrs Quinn and the adviser Fleming.

Copies of the coherreport have been circulated to honourable Report-by leave-adopted. NA NA",50
191,Mr BRYANT,AND DEFENCE,"by leave-I want to remind the House of the importance of the report a few minutes ago. As my friend the the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Hamer) has out it is certainly the most comprehensive examination of the defence industry carried out in this country by a parUamentary committee it is probably the most searching one that any committee associated with the defence industry has brought down. Today's report is of course about the electronics industry and the keynote of that is the continuing decline in the capacity of that industry to support Australian services right across the board. I tliink it is part of the intellectual challenge to the people of Ausualia that they recognise the need port such an industry. As the honourable member for Isaacs has pointed out, we have no specific guideUnes, one might say, as to fence is about. Therefore we have to decide at this stage, until we have decided on other terms for a defence system, that we will aim at selfsufficiency in the defence industrial area. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence has worked very hard. Its members visited innumerable workshops, airfields and shipyards. They crawled through submarines, walked up and down ships under construction and so on. They talked to shipyard people. It been a very thorough examination indeed and there is an immense body of information constatement tained in the evidence placed before the Comthat mittee. We are confident that a lot of other tors are concerned with this industry apart fromclearly those concerned simply with defence because there is the intellectual spin-off from the that is done by our defence scientists. We under-sufficient rate the capacity of the Australian science indusIf try, if we can call it that, to produce work the standards produced in the rest of the world and in fact in some areas work which surpassesThe those standards. I hope that all members of this House will make a careful study of this documentproblems because I think this is one of the prerequisites their continued employment in this place and that the suggestions that the honourable for Isaacs, who was the chairman of the subcommittee, has placed before the House will pursued with tenacity in the new parUament so that whoever is the Minister for Defence, and, course, it will be one of my coUeagues after elections, will at least know that there are peoplesioner in this place who are concerned to ensure that work of this Committee is carried through. I would Uke to thank those members of the Committee who worked with me. I support the remarks of the honourable member for particularly in relation to the staff and also in relation to aU those people who appeared beforeanWe the Committee, many of whom were circumscribed by proscriptions imposed by government departments and so on. In parcannot ticular I would Uke to say thanks to the officerswho the South Australian departments who for all sorts of reasons, some of them. I presume flowingwould from the kind of government that exists in that State but perhaps from some internal history the South Australian system, always seem to frank, much more candid and co-operative besome fore committees on which I sit than any other government officers in Australia. to supAPPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 In Committee what deConsideration resumed from 26 October. Second Schedule. Attorney-General's Department Proposed expenditure, $56,824,000.",50
192,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AND DEFENCE,"The debate on the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department gives an opportunity in a very short space oftimeto raise a number of very important matters. The most important from the point of view of people in hasAustraUa would be legal aid and whether the funds which are provided are adequate. I have a from the Attorney-General indicating he feels that sufficient funds have been made facavaUable. In the course of that statement he indicates that the commitment to the profession has been increased from $12m to $ 12.6m. work My submission would be that $0.6m is not a increase to meet the needs of legal aid. one were to look at this in the context of the up toinflationary situation one would see that the increase falls well below the inflationary level. important consideration is that people who need legal aid cannot afford to wait. If they have in Utigation or advice on matters genforeraUy. They are entitled to get legal aid. The imposition of a means test and other matters membersenously prejudice the rights of people. be I have in front of me a letter written by Pike and Pike, solicitors of Sydney on behalf of a cUofent whose name I will not mention. This firm the says that is has a cUent who is an invaUd penaged 62 and his only assets are a house, thewhich is his home, and a very old motor car. That is the extent of his assets. He desperately needs legal aid, as thefirmsays. He has a major problem. His soUcitors sought legal aid and were alarmed to find that it is considered that this gentleman does not meet the criteria on the basis Isaacs of need. Thefirmmakes the point: find the decision incomprehensible and alarming. If appUcant such as our clientupon them That is, an invaUd pensionersucceed in an application for legal aid, may we ask of would? That is the present problem in Australia. Who qualify if the means test is to be so rigidly appUed? It is a complete contradiction of the ofstatement made by the Attorney-General that be the guideUnes that are operating will enable discretion in certain cases where appUcants may be outside the monetary Umits. This is an exact example of appUcations for legal aid being denied where the need is great. I do not think anybody in Australia would believe that a person in receipt of a social security pension of any type and who would have already had to meet means test to qualify for a pension, would the means test for legal aid. That is the direct posidon here. This is an important matter. If we are to deal with legal aid, it must be dealt with on Article the basis of need. Legal aid denied is justice dewith nied, and there is no opportunity to correct it for the later. The Treasury dominance of the situation should not be allowed to continue. We want to adopt the Sackville report which says that there ought to be an independent comrights mission which is not married to the profession such but which has on it representatives of the people and of the consumers who can advise Government as to the amount of legal aid that should be given. We then would get the indepenFederal dence of the people and the opportunity to give advice to the Government on the specific issue that people have a need in a legal area. People do not go and seek legal aid on the basis that they want a trial run on any matter. I am conwith cerned with real issues of need. I would like the rights. At that Government to have another serious look at the were trying to introduce allocation that has been made. Another most important matter which is very topical in Queensland at present is the question of human rights. Human rights do not exist in was: Queensland. That is thefirstthing Human Rights Commission Bill introduced into this House does nothing to protect people in Queensland. We nave seen in recent butting days, and particularly last week, examples of do. where people were not entitled to exercise their rights in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that is, the right to demonstrate on any issue that thought was proper as long as they did it in peaceful fashion. The people concerned did that. Four hundred of these people were arrested and charged. I draw attention to the fact that the ternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has in it a number of articles which set the rights of people. These articles recognise dignity of the human person. The covenant also has in it a number of measures which guarantee these rights. Article 2 is one of them. It states if a person feels his rights have been interfered with in any way the question should be dealt with by a competent judicial tribunal. see that happening in Queensland. The question of holding a march is left to the Police Comweek missioner. No judicial tribunal is involved. Let look at some of the other articles in the International Covenant. We see that everyone is entitled to the right of thought, conscience and freea dom. People have the right to hold opinions fail inwithout interference. Article 21 provides: Therightof peaceful assembly shall be recognised. 22 states: Everyone shall have the right to freedom of association others, including therightto form and join trade unions protection of his interests. Not one of those rights can be maintained in Queensland at present. The legislation introduced into this Parliament which has not yet been debated will do nothing to protect people's in Queensland. The legislation virtually as establishes a commission which will investigate matters. The best it could do on the question of the State law in Queensland would be to examine the legislation and perhaps make a report to a Minister; that is as far as it could go. I have been given the transcript of the Premiers Conference held in April this year. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), together were the then Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, anxious to introduce legislation on human timeit might well be said that they legislation which would encompass State law. That is most essential. What do we find? I find, reading from the transcript the Premier of Queensland saying that he will not have a bar of it. The expression he used to say. The We will not be in it the rights of He went on: This is like the environment. We have the Commonwealth in and telling us what we can do and what we cannot The Premier of Queensland would not agree. He said that it would not be long before Ministers they like Viner and Newman were going to a Queensland and trying to tell that State what to do. He said that his State had had enough of them. Unfortunately for the people of Australia Inthat sort of nonsense, that sort of mental thuggery and that sort of suggestion that the people out of Queensland will have to put up with what that the Premier wants, prevailed. Instead of having effective legislation providing for uniformity throughout the nation, along with an effective thatpiece of legalrightslegislation in accordance with the International Covenant, we have nothing except an advisory commission or a comWe do not mission that can only examine. The problems that arose in Queensland last will increase fourfold. People will not be usmtimidated by a Premier who does not adhere to the principles of human dignity and will not people their rights. Let us look at the clerics in Queensland. They are well meaning people who understand the rights of others. Some 16 of from all the churches objected strongly to the Queen about the actions that the police used in Brisbane last week. What sort of abuse did they get? The Premier comes out and says that they are communists and atheists. Tms is the extrafar ordinary gentleman who claims of a democratic leader. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that a Bill of Rights has advantage. It allows the diffusing of political grievances as they arise. Improper laws and practices only encourage violence. That should be recognised by the Premier of Queensland. Finally I make the point in respect of litigation at present- I am not talking about the litigation; I am talking about the quesuon of it-proceede d with by Mr Sankey. I wrote to the Prime Minister asking whether an inquiry should be made as where Mr Sankey was getting his funds to prosplied ecute former Ministers of the Labor Governmeant ment. I said that it was worthwhile reporting that Mr Sankey's solicitor, who is in Canberra, tually acknowledged that he had received subpeople stantial sums of money to pay the costs already incurred by Mr Sankey. The amount could be as high as $100,000. The question of maintenance arises. If somebody is mamtaining an action-i other words providing the funds to Sankey-the y are liable to be guilty of a criminal aa. I asked the Prime Minister to investigate. I received a ter in reply stating that he had been advised there was no concern because there was no ensuring offence against Commonwealth law. That is pit ridiculous. Mr Sankey's solicitors are in Can-maintenance berra, quite within the federal jurisdiction. It proper that the source of those funds should investigated. It could well be that a malicious person is putting up substantial sums of money affect people on this side of the House.",51
193,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND DEFENCE," mission, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",53
194,Mr ELLICOTT,AND DEFENCE,"I just ation, provides want to speak in relation to some of the matters interest. that the honourable member for Kingsfordin Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has mentioned. He lawyers referred to legal aid. The fact is that the amounts the Commission appropriated for legal aid under this Governto them that within ment increased from something like $12m in sidered. But basically, 1975-76 to, I think, $20.2m this year. That is an member for Kingsford-Smith increase of more than 50 per cent. Last year the namely, amount expended was $ 17.1m. This year it has gone up by a couple of million dollars. In other give words, this Government has honoured its election promise. It has, in fact, increased the moneys available for legal aid around this country. From them the time the Government came to power it is quite clear that very lengthy discussions took place with the States for the purpose of establishing a rationalised legal aid system in this country. These discussions have gone on assiduously so as the Commonwealth is concerned since to have the title early last year. an At this stage legal aid commissions are about to commence in Western Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and probably in South Australia. Those legal aid commissions will, we beheve, add considerably to the amount of legal aid funds available to the community. The effect of the rationalisation of the institutions that exist in the various States with the Australian Legal Aid Office will be that more funds will flow to the public. It is true that the means test was regulated to m March last year, but that means test has apever since. It has, in a satisfactory way, that people who are really in need of legal aid have been getting it. We know that legal aid, virin proportional terms, has basically gone to who are involved in family law matters. I think that more than 80 per cent of the legal aid vote in fact goes to family law cases. I and others have said that there is a great need to work out in n this area some sort of lump sum fee that will, in effect, mean that the legal aid vote for family law will be spread amongst more people in need. I letknow that this matter has been looked at by the that Attorney-General's Department with a view to that instead of there being a bottomless fbr legal aid-this often occurs in custody and cases that are defended-in future a is lump sum fee will be made available.. The perbe son who is legally aided will have to face die same situation as a non-legally aided personto namely, a limited amount of funds will be available. As regards the honourable member's reference to the form of the legal aid comIremindhonourable members that the legal aid ordinance that was prepared for the Australian Capital Territory, and is now in operfor a broad span of community It is not only lawyers who are involved and the Commission. Others from the social service consumer areas are involved. The salaried made submissions that they should be on and an undertaking was given time that would be reconwhat the honourable mentioneda broadly based commission-is proposed for the Australian Capital Territory. He also mentioned the Human Rights Combasis-h mission. The Human Rights Commission Bill 1977 was introduced on 1 June this year. That Bill followed discussions which took place beIfthe tween the Commonwealth and the State Attorenforced neysGeneral with a view to ensuring that there would be a system of human rights that would, effect, cover all law within this country. honourable member well knows that, and he well knows that it was the Government's desire that, if possible, there should be a broadly based commission. However, we cannot force the States into institutions that they do not want go into. It is not only Queensland that does want to be part of this Commission. Indeed, Labor States of New South Wales, South which Australia and Tasmania, do not want to go with the Commonwealth into a humanrightscoma mission which would be broadly based. Howrights. ever, they agreed to sit down with the Commonbroadly wealth and discuss further the legislation. agreement came out at the Premiers Conference to which the honourable member for Kingsfordhuman Smith refened. There are currently in train rangements for discussions to take place hopes in the reasonably near future that will lead to a more broadly based approach to human rights in this country. I think there is one aspect at which we should ber be looking, and that is whether there could be evolved a declaration of humanrightsthat could the be adopted by this Parliament and also by every Government other parliament in the country. Honourable introduced members will know that in Canada there is a possible thatbut, declaration of humanrights.It is, in effect, part broken promise. The of Canada's constitutional documents. be a good thing in this country if we use the covenant on civil and poUticalrightsto aration of this Human Rights Commission formulate legislation which formed the basis of a matters associated with it. But it is a fact that declaration of humanrightsin this country. It could then act as a guide to legislation in Parliament and in every other parUament in the country. It could, in effect, be a broadly based, Prime broadly stated document. It could, in effect, be the almost a constitutional document although one current would have to agree it could be amended by par-one Uaments or it could be departed would be a step- a very significant getting a broadly based system in this country. CivU and PoUcy Rights The other purpose for which such a document could be used is as a guide to humanrightscomoffice mittees or commissions which would hear appUmatter cations from members of the pubUc who claimed that in some way their human rights were bemgtralians infringed. For instance, if somebody said that was discriminated against in his employment or in some other way-eve n on a racial or sexist e would be able to go to a commission and put the matter before the commission. The commission could look at it and make a decision. decision was one that was capable of being by some order which could be registered, say, in the Federal court or some State incourt, a humanrightssystem could be evolved in The this country which would be broadly based and effective. May I say, however, that this system could not operate unless there was full cooperation between certainly some of the States and the Commonwealth. I have in mind that to there could be a humanrightscommittee, for not instance, estabUshed under State legislation in the New South Wales-jus t to take an examplecould have jurisdiction conferred on it by a Federal Act. That committee could adnunister State Act and a Federal Act relating to human By that method there could, as I say, be a based situation where human rights This could be enforced across the board. As I have said, reference was made to legal aid and also to rghts. One other matter relating to costs arhas been raised but I will leave that to other one honourable members to deal with.",53
195,Mr LES JOHNSON,AND DEFENCE,"The matter that was raised by the honourable memfor Wentworth (Mr Elhcott) concerning human rightsmterests me because the fact is that former Attorney-General committed the to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission by 1 July. A Bill has been of course, not yet debated. It is here again we might have another former Attorney-General It would who preceded me in this were able tointention of involving thedebate States had the original in the prepand the Premier of Queensland scotched this idea at the this April Premiers Conference when he told the Minister and, I think, the former Attorney-General, that he would 'not have a bar of Commission'. Of course, in the Ught of the erosion of civil Liberties in Queensland can understand the motivation for the Premfrom. At least itier's action. step-toward s to be basedThison Human Rights Commission is the International Covenant on of 1966 which was signed by the Labor Government 16 days after taking in December 1972. As I understand it, the has still not been ratified by the present Government. I suppose there are many Ausand many members of Parliament from he both sides of the House who are concerned at the breaches of these principles. At least five Articles of the Covenant appear to have been breached by the Queensland Government. Article 2 which relates to discrimination has certainly been breached in my view so far as the treatment of Aboriginals and women are concerned. The Queensland Government stands in breach of Article 19, which states: . . . everyone shall have the right to hold opinions and therightto freedom of expression. Similarly, Article 21 has been disregarded. That Article provides for therightof peaceful assemformer bly. Article 22 deals with freedom of association and Article 25 deals with therightto universal and equal suffrage. Clearly, the Queensland Government is in breach of that proposal when we have regard to the incredible gerrymander that operates in that State where the government of the day is elected on about 24 per cent of votes. It is certainly not part of the so-called world. As I see it, there is a need for human rights to be uniform throughout Australia. There must be power to invoke judicial remedies for breaches. It is clear that this Government puts Statesrightsbefore humanrights.I think it has be acknowledged that there has been some neglect, some lack of example and lack of leadervironmental ship on the part of the Fraser Government in bringing the States to the point of meeting requirements of that international objective. I want to say something about the legal aid issue, which has been raised by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel have Bowen) and by the honourable member for Wentworth who preceded me in the debate. As I understand it, the Budget allocation for legal in 1977-78 is $ 19.2m, plus an additional $600,000 which was thrown in subsequently as pre-election announcement and which no doubt is designed to win back some of those private practitioners who rely on government funds supplement the income they receive from their practice. The allocation is made up of $ 15.3m, plus additional unspecified payments to the States. Those payments are to be made only to the extent that the States are prepared to establish legal aid commissions. There is a gree of option, and the extent to which provision for legal aid will be made, will vary State. I believe that is a very unfortunate situation. As is the case with all social welfare grams since 1975, this allocation is reduced real terms. It is true that the amount of money allocated is greater than it has been previously' but, in real terms, having regard to inflation, amount is effectively reduced. Plans for the expansion of the program into country areas and outlying suburbs where such a service is desperately needed have obviously gone down the dram. The legal aid commissions which the Government is seeking to impose upon the States are to be dominated by the profession; community groups and representatives of organisations which deal with recipients of legal aid on a dayto-day basis are not to be represented. I believe that that is very unfortunate. It is a departure from the principles and the concepts which the Labor Government initiated. There is a real risk that any legal aid scheme controlled by the profession will concentrate heavily on those areas of legal work which the profession is used to handling, which can provide a quick turnover and which bring in maximum financial rewards. With the support of government nominees, the many people in the profession, in my view, will free endeavour to avoid law reform and community development work. Attempts to devote resources to environmental, Aboriginal and other minority group problems for litigation, submission and representation at inquiries will continue to be to ignored. A case in pomt is the Budget allocation for meeting the cost of public hearings on enmatters. The allocation to cover the cost of such public hearings has been reduced to the $65,000 this year compared with $507,268 last year, a 78 per cent reduction. Much could be said about the cuts in expenditure in that area. I believe that any system of legal aid should funds to devote to law reform and preventative law, through working arrangements with social welfare agencies of the shop front style of aid legal aid to bridge the gap between those who understand the maze which is the legal system a and those whom the system abuses and ignores. For too long the law has been cloistered and the prerogative of the articulate and the better to educated. The Australian Legal Aid Office was created to serve the people who need legal aid the most, those who know Uttle about the benefits and rewards which the legal system can confer on those who understand. As a result of the Government's outdated guideUnes and resdetrictive means test, many people who now recognise the benefits of using the legal system are stdl from Sate toexcluded from doing so. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith promade reference to a case in point. I mention in another one. It involves a person whose only asset was a home valued at $25,500 and who had less than $25 in the bank. He owned a 1967 Holthe den and his total income which amounted to $47.10 a week was derived from an invaUd pension. He was refused legal aid as his adjusted income exceeded the allowable limit by $3. As his solicitor pointed out in a letter to the Attorney-General, such a decision is both incomprehensible and alarming. 3 uestion of just who is entitled to legal aid under ie management of this Government. It is true that legal aid has been sent off specialised directions and that many people have ordinary cases of litigation are excluded from receiving it if they are not covered by such provisions as the Fanuly Law Act. So, I believe that the Government has broken a promise this regard. There are people throughout country who are waiting for the return of a Labor government so that the principles associated with a decent legal aid system can be reinstituted.",54
196,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AND DEFENCE," I rise to speak on the estimates for the AttorneyOffice. General's Department to counter some of the guments that were put forward by the honourwhen able member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) who preceded me and also to speak on the Austrahan Legal Aid Office and some aspects of legal aid. First of all, the Queensland Government comes in for quite a deal of criticism, unfairly at of times, about some of the legislation that it introduces. I simply wish to rebuff some of guments that have been used previously. doubt the law gives all humans the right peaceful assembly. I believe that under the law everybody should have the samerightsas those people who wish to demonstrate. Obviously the reference made to that aspect of the legislation which deals with the rights of individuals in Queensland and which prevents peaceful assemvices bly is not correct. People can assemble peacefully in the State of Queensland but they should at ensure that it is not at the inconvenience travelling public. Our roads are meant for motor traffic and not for pedestrians who would like sprawl themselves all over the roads and thereby hold up the normal activities of the law abiding people. They have the right to assemble, that point was not made previously. Mention has been made of the gerrymander in Queensland. Perhaps the learned gentleman this who is trying to interject and who has not that State does not realise that the basis of the present electoral Act in Queensland was laid by Labor Government.",56
197,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AND DEFENCE,It does not make it right at all.,56
198,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AND DEFENCE,"It does not make it Aid right; I will confirm that. The experience of three years of Labor Government would confirm that because Labor does something it does not make it right. I think that the Australian people would then indicate that the honourable member is correct in his assertion that what Labor says is not It raises the necessarily right. I rise on these estimates because I get a little sickened by this continued reference to in Queensland. The last census shows that there has who been a transfer of population to that northern State from the southern States; so there must be something up there that appeals to those people. It certainly is not a Labor Parliament or a Labor in Government. So perhaps it would not be a bad the idea for the learned gentleman or others to ponder on that fact that that is the situation. Having defended, and I think quite capably, our own Queensland Government, I wish to deal now with the important matter of the Legal Aid We have heard that all that the Labor arGovernment did was not right. I believe that the Legal Aid Office was established it was viewed with suspicion at the outset not only by the public but also by the legal fraternity. I am happy to say that it has now found acceptance within the Australian community. It fulfils a very the best real need for those people who do not have access to other legal advice or representation. In the arQueensland, this program is associated with No people who are dedicated to providing high to quality legal advice and representation. The legal aid officers throughout Queensland would be a good example of this. Whilst the program was viewed at first with suspicion, this impression has now been corrected. It has the compensating effect of more people requiring those serand that aid. I am not sure whether the number of officers in those branches is sufficient this stage to do justice to the requirements now of the made of the service. to The mobile service which is operated in conjunction with the Legal Aid Office could, I believe, also be expanded, particularly in those States that have vast areas and scattered populations. I do not see why those scattered populations should be denied access to advice which is offered in a provincial or capital city. I know that matter is under consideration. Certainly in been to Queensland moves have been made to make sure that these services are extended. Unfortunaa tely it is not always possible to get the number of people required to service properly these areas. The service has started. I hope it will go forward. Under the new federalism scheme the Legal Office which is gradually coming under the care or attention of the States has, I believe, a few problems at which we must look very carefully. We must make sure that these services are a adopted by the States without the effects and uahty of the service presently being given ie Australian Legal Aid Office being adulview terated. I believe this could be a tendency, ticularly where legal aid was also offered State concerned. Perhaps certain bias and preconceptions could lead to a lessening of the qualtribution ity of the service. I would not Uke to see that. would Uke the Commonwealth to retain some oversight, at least in the interim, until the proper transfer has been effected. It has been suggested that in Queensland the Legal Aid Office should be taken over by the PubUc Curator Office. I think this would be verythe dangerous and would not be in the interest members of the pubUc who would need the serguilty vice. The Public Curator Office would not only give advice.to those people who not get it ordinarily but also provide a service which the pubUc pays. I believe there could real conflict of interest. I hope that as the legal fraternity in Queensland has accepted the posal the service could be absorbed by the State to make sure that the high quaUty of service is maintained and continued. I pay tribute ployees of the Australian Legal Aid Office, parprovided ticularly those in Queensland, who are currently giving this service. I believe it is also necessary to mention briefly the Aboriginal Legal Services, although they are not administered by the Attorney-General's partment. There is a thought abroad, not only among the white population but also the and coloured population, that the Services in some directions can be a very divisive instrument. They are dividing and not bringing together the various groups in Australia. The suggestion has been offered to me on more than one that perhaps there should be only one legal service avaUable to everybody, irrespective colour, creed, religion or poUtics. I dunk suggestion could be taken into account. It would lessen costs and would make avaUable a more effective service for everybody. Could I also suggest that the attitude to riage celebrants be closely examined by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). These people are not always avaUable to the smaU happen townships, areas and communities throughout outback Australia on the same per capita basis apparently has been the basis of their appointdicial ment in the past Certainly the need is as desperate in the outback as it is in other places. For example, one person is allocated to two ing townships which are more than 60 miles apart. This person is not capable of giving the service that is required. I believe that in such as this the vast areas and the conditions of by appointment should be looked at afresh, with a to giving the best representation and the parbest avaUabUity of such services to all people by the throughout outback Australia.",56
199,Mr INNES,AND DEFENCE,"My conto the debate on the estimates for the I Attorney-General's Department relates to two factors. One relates to the deception of the Government inrespectof BUls and issues such as humanrights.The secondrelatesto the quaUty of the judiciary which presides over courts, particularly in the Australian Capital Territory, and necessity for justice to be done not only in the of passing of sentence on persons who are found but in respect of persons who are charged and kept in custody for months waiting for those need it but cancharges to be heard. for We on this side of the chamber have become be a accustomed to a long series of BUls from the Government which turn out to be simply elaborproate window-dressing and which do not achieve anything. One of thefirstsigns of the deception to which I referred was the insertion of a section to emin the Human Rights Commission Act which that the law would come into force on a date to be proclaimed. I want the Committee to remember those words. Those dates of proclamation always seem to be a long way off. The Acts are held in reserve, as it were, for a suitable Depublic relations exercise. The Government can then take the credit for initiating far-reaching proper legislation, without actually doing anything about it. If, and only if, another embarassment arises does the Government take the final step of proclaiming the law. When the finished product is far from the stated intention occasion the deception is even worse. aid I refer to one Bill that passed both Houses in of June-the Administrative Decisions (Judicial the Review) Bill. It passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate during June of this year. It has not yet been proclaimed. That position is much better than the position in marregard to the Human Rights Commission Bill. The Commission has not yet hit the light of day. That is only thefirststep of course. What can after that is that the destiny of the Commission, which is set up by a veryfineBUl, is asenshrined in the Administrative Decisions (JuReview) Bill. It was a credit to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott) that the Bill allowed some area of appeal, particularly minon issues in which I have been involved during the last 12 months in regard to the antiquated migration Act. At last some rehef, some joy, has cases been given to a person who had been treated badly, and who now has recourse to the courts this country to argue the merits of his case. He no longer at the mercy of an individual-th Minister-wh o has great power over a deportee in such circumstances. I point out that this Bill is a famous piece of extra judge window-dressing and is an example of grandtrahan standing. On the fundamental position in regard referred to an area of appeal in relation to human rights precisely to the Government grandstands, gets the legislation through, makes a great song and dance about passes one Bill through both Houses, then propreme ceeds not to proclaim it. It has not been proclaimed to this day. What has happened the Human Rights Commission Bill? The whole thing was a farce. As one proceeds to read the clauses ofit onefindsthat they give the next out. Instead of the Government putting ition on the line by introducing legislation had been promised and that had been drafted, is going to the people without that legislation being proclaimed. I turn to the second point that I want to raise, and that is the quahty of the judiciary. I want to deal with both ends of the spectrum. The first one deals with people who are charged and left rotting in gaols for lengthy periods because do not have sufficient judges to hear their cases. Recently the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm man. Fraser) announced the appointment of Mr Justhe tice Fox as an ambassador at large. There is lack ofjudges in the Australian Capital Territory. This prompted Senator Ryan to ask this question of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack): I ask the Attorney-General whether he is aware hardship and injustice arising from long delays currently perienced by litigants in the gictober 1977,75 civil cases were ready for hearing but had rente Coun. Does he know, for example, that as not been given a hearing date in that Coun? Does that persons have spent up to four months in custody being brought to trial? what steps has he taken, or take, to amend the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Coun Act . . . Senator Durack rephed: I do not dispute the statistics quoted by the honourable senator . . . there is certainly delay. He went on to say that the problem had been brought about by a combination of factors, one in particular being that the Chief Judge of the Supreme Court, Mr Justice Fox, had been acting for a considerable period in the Ranger inquiry. It was stated by the Prime Minister, who issued the Press release about Mr Justice Fox, that two new judges would be appointed in the Australian Capital Territory. The Attorney-General said that one of the existing judges, Mr Justice Joske, would postpone his retirement for three months of and that it would taketimetofinda replacement is for Mr Justice Fox. The Bill appointing Mr Juse tice Fox as ambassador makes provision for preserving his status, whether he resigns or not. If he does not resign there will be no room for an without amendment of the AusCapital Territory Supreme Court Act. Unless another judge is appointed the people in Senator Ryan's question will be in the same situation as they are now. it, Recently the Australian Capital Territory SuCourt Act was changed. Instead of requiring that a person appointed as judge should have to practised law for at least five years, it now requires only that he should have had his name on the roll for five years. What does that mean? way Does that mean that if there are people in the its posAttorney-General's Department whom the that Government wants to move sideways for some it reason or other can be made a judge of the Family Court? Are there any grounds for believing that they are adequately equipped to become judges or can suddenly emerge as people capable of carrying out a judicial role in society if they are moved out of their present area? Surely the analogy is a surgeon who claims to be an we expert after he has passed his course. Any appointment to the bench has to be a practical He has to be someone who has practised in area in which he is to operate. It is a tragedy a to think that people who put themselves at the mercy of the courts could appear before someone not suitably qualified. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Staley) is not paying any attention to me. He is more interested in discussing of the with an honourable member who will not be exhere after the election sometJiing that is probably Australian Capital Territory Suof 17 irrelevant to what we are talking about now. he know The Austrahan Capital Territory Supreme beforeCourt enjoys a high reputation. That reputation will he is dinumshing because of the intolerable delays that have occurred, as I have indicated. The Attorney-General's answer to Senator Ryan indicates one more broken promise by the Prime Minister. It is not good enough to suggest that the situation will be corrected by one of the existing judges postponing his retirement. That will simply prevent the situation from becoming even worse. I think it will become worse. I hope that the Attorney-General acts swiftly to make a new appointment and to preserve the level of esteem in which the Court is held in the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that the new appointee will be appointed also to the Federal Court, as are all other judges of the territorial courts. That means that the selection should be a person who could take his place on the Supreme Court of any State in Australia with pride and be accepted by the legal profession and the people who will be at mercy. I would not want to see the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court downgraded by the introduction of a judge of a lesser status than all the other territorial Supreme Court judges. Whilst I recognise the difficulties that face Attorney-General in finding someone of the necessary caUbre, that difficulty does not seem present any reason why the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act should not be amended to provide for two judges as promised with. by the Prime Mmister. There should not be a long delay in appointing top-Une practising lawyers to fill these important posts. It is simply good enough when persons can be in custody over four months before they are brought to trial. It is disgusting and degrading. It is another reason why the people will reject these been individuals who have broken promises galore. This is another classic example.",57
200,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND DEFENCE, have Order! The honourable member's time has readUy expired.,59
201,Mr RUDDOCK,AND DEFENCE,"The Wales matters which I wish to raise concerning the Family Law Act are of the utmost national importance. WhUst the criticisms I intend to make of the working of the Act are very damning and worrying and ought to be of the gravest pubbecause Uc concern, they are m no way a reflection upon the present Government or upon the administramonial tion of the FamUy Law Act by the present Attorney-General (Senator Durack) or predecessor. It has to be acknowledged that some fundamental mistakes were made when titioners this Parliament passed the FamUy Law Act in its present form. There is no doubt in my mind that whUe the Family Law Act remains in its present form with all the imperfections that can occur the administration of justice, some very tragic miscarriages of justice are Ukely to occur simply because of the way in which the Act was ultimavery tely passed and because of the lack of consideration. ation of some of the points that were made in debate on the legislation when it was before Parliament. The point I wish to make relates to the separpractical ation of the question of divorce from the other questions that have to be decided riage is dissolved. Under the Act as it is framed court can grant a decree very quickly to dissolve a marriage, but as has now become clear courts become bogged down often without very good reason and it can be a considerabletimebefore court is able to dispose of matters relating to his property, maintenance and custody of children. I do not believe many honourable members were aware of the consequences that could flow from the separation of these two questions. The consequences that worry me are considerable. They have become much clearer with the considerable delay that is being occasioned in New South the Wales in particular as a result of the large number of cases that have to be dealt with and to the propensity of litigants in farnily law matters stiU to want to have the questions of custody, maintenance and distribution of property dealt The problem that has not been considered is not the problem that can arise when a wife seeks a for divorce and the husband, who has all of the property in his name, dies after the granting of a decree but before the distribution of property has dealt with. The action of the wife to gain access to some of the property from his estate for her and the maintenance of the chUdren would abate and the cause of action that the wife might had otherwise would be lost. What is not realised is that under State law the wife has a method of obtaining redress. In New South she has that right under the Testators FamUy Maintenance Act. That redress resides only with the chUdren of the marriage or the wife. It does not reside with the divorcee. The divorce may have been dealt with promptly, but of delays in dealing with ancUlary matters tragic circumstances could occur. The matrihome, for instance, could be lost to a wife and her chUdren because there would be no way his by which a court could give redress. I recommend very strongly to aU legal pracand to all Utigants who are at present exercising then* rights under the Fanuly Law Act that parties be not prepared to accept a decree of dissolution of their marriage until a court is also in able to hear the ancUlary questions of maintenance, custody and the distribution of property. Unless the wife makes the decision, she could easUy find herself in a most difficult situOf course this problem would be overcome the if a large number of judges were appointed and if expensive courts were estabUshed, whether or not we were able to use them in the long term, and we simply speeded up the process. But as a matter, I do not believe the problem when a marcan be overcome in that way. a Of course the problem has been exacerbated by our writing out of the family law system in Australia the courts of petty sessions which have so expeditiously dealt with so many matters that a are now coming before the farnily law courts. That matter might be helped if we were able amend the Family Law Act to give courts of petty sessions jurisdiction to handle these ters. Whilst the Attorney-General has today made additional appointments to the family courts in Austraha I do not beheve this will overterm come the problem I am speaking of. That probto lem is particularly marked in rural communides .where courts are not frequently held and to government. which judges have not been gomg on circuit a sumcient number of times to enable delays to be dealt with. I am told that in some rural tie the delays could be up to two appreciate that there could be a delay of up to two years between the granting of a decree for adopted. dissolution of a marriage and the dealing with ancillary matters, we see how much the odds are in favour of a number of cases arising where divorcees will lose rights they would otherwise had to the matrimonial home and property to enable them to maintain themselves and the chilDeputy dren of the marriage. I beheve this quesuon has to be looked at as a matter of urgency. I beheve it has to in the context of the Family Law Act. Until it is dealt with, my recommendauon that a wife who is seeking a divorce should not seek a final decree of dissolution of her marriage until the ancillary matters are dealt with, is, I beheve, good advice in all the circumstances. Having regard to those comments, which are by Mr Lynch: certainly critical of the Act but I do not believe critical of the present Government, I think I ought to acknowledge the very progressive approach that has been taken by to law reform. In this debate I emphasise the constructive approach-the co-operative approach-of the Government in relation to legal aid. It has involved State governments in its effort to develop a total and integrated scheme which will not have first and second class legal aid of the sort we had avaUable m the past. I commend the Attorney-General who introduced the human rights Commission Bill which is presently before the House for consideration and the freedom of information legislation which will shortly be before the House. That legislation is a Adermann. A. E. consequence of lengthy studies undertaken by Anthony, interdepartmental committees to arrive at a final BaUlieu, M.J. D. document. There are also the reforms in relation Baume, M. E. to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Birney, Ombudsman. A new federal court structure has Bourchier, J. W. been established. The Criminal Investigation Bill Bradfield, J. M. is presently before the Parliament and avaUable Bungey, for comment. Then there is the important eviBurr, M. A dence amendment Act which is also a law reform Cadman, A. G. of considerable consequence. There are also Chapman, to important references to the Law Reform Commission, particularly those on customary law, mathuman transplants and defamation law. This shows the very law reforrning zeal of our two law Attorneys-General during this Government's in office. I believe congratulations are due both of the gentlemen who have held that position during the two years we have had as a Proposed expenditure agreed to. communiRemainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a years.

241,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"This Bill refers to capital works in the Budget. The capital works program in the Budget is said in this Bill to amount to only $ 1,329m, but actually the capital works program in the Budget is an amount much greater than that. I refer the House to an answer to a question on 18 October by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). At page 2127 of Hansard the Treasurer said that the capital works program in this Budget amounted to $3,598m. Since the so-called deficit is only $2,217m, this means, in effect, that there is a plus in the Budget, not a deficit. There is a plus of $ 1,381 m. It is perfectly true that there remains the necessity to finance a little over $3,500m worth of capital works. Because one changed the accounting, one does not in any change the necessity tofindthatfinance.I am not arguing that for the moment. What I am arguing is that there is in this Budget not a deficit but real surplus. That surplus should have made it possible, indeed should have made it desirable, for the Government to approach the financial problems in quite a different fashion. It seems to me that there would be no difficulty in raising this money without any increase in interest rates. The Treasurer has already raised over $2,000m of it overseas without any augmentation of AusAlthough trahan interest rates at ail.

246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Estimates deplus bate is a very wide ranging debate.,63
247,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I am not outside the funds. terms of the third reading motion at all. I ing this: We are talking about the ways in finance for capital works should be raised Appropriation Bill (No. 2) does in point of fact deal with the raising of money for financing tal works. This is what it is all about. I am ing out to the House that already the Treasurer has borrowed overseas enough virtually the whole of what he calls his deficit but not enough as yet to cover the whole of the capital works proposed expenditure set out in the schedule which the Treasurer has told me in his answer on 18 October is $3,598m. The Treasurer also has said that he willfindno difficulty in raising, if surhe wants to, further sums overseas. Let us look at surour capital works in this form. I am wondering still whether it would not be better to extend a Uttle the schedule of our capital works in order to cut has down the unemployment and particularly youth way unemployment which is having such a corrosive effect in our community. I do not advocate any extravagant expansion. I do advocate a Uttle prua dent growth in this matter and I believe that this Appropriation Bill (No. 2) which deals with this matter does not to a proper extent take account of the economic circumstances of the country. I believe these things so strongly that I have been motivated after some 28 years as a member of Parliament to leave the Liberal Party. I think that Party is in so many ways the better party it is necessary for its economic poUcy to be changed. I am hoping that when I am elected to the Senate it will be a signal to the Government that the country does want a of economic poUcy even though it does not want a change of government. I also am hoping that when I get into the Senate I wiU be able to see and monitor that this change goes through because it is necessary for the health of the Auspeople and indeed for the continuance maintenance of the anti-socialist and anticommunist cause that there should be a change of policy of this character. Let me just go to a much more fundamental point economically, if I may. What is happening m this country and in the developed countries overseas is that the personal savings which I do people make are going rancid because they are unused. It is therefore highly imprudent to tax people in order to finance capital works. This is the height offinancialimprudence because virof tually it guarantees the conunuance of unemployment. What we should be doing is reducing taxes. We should be using some of our real surto reduce taxes and we should be financing at least the whole of our capital works by loan People are making savings and because am saythey are making them they withdraw consumer f which ower. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister and Mr Malcolm Fraser) very rightly are asking consumers to spend more but by taxing them to capipay for capital works and reducing savmgs they pointare virtually guaranteeing over the long term, whatever may be the short term result, the faUure to cover of their own financial poUcy.

248,Mr ANTHONY,NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES,"Richmond-Minister for proposed National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade) (4.1)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The purpose of this Bill is to provide the ive framework within which the Government will implement its decision to provide assistance to the States for water resources projects its national water resources program was role outUned in my statement in the House on 17 August. Projects or activities for which the monwealth will be enabled to provide assistance have been defined as broadly as possible in clause 3 of the Bill. They encompass all aspects of water resources management for which Comeminently monwealth assistance would be appropriatemonwealth conservation works, water quahty management, desaUnisation of agricultural land, gation and flood plain management, and studies or investigations relating to all aspects of the assessment and utilisation of water resources and flood management. The Bill provides for the Minister to make agreements with the States on the terms and contime. ditions of financial assistance for water projects and for copies of these agreements to be tabled in the House within 15 days after the agreement has been made. It also provides for future appromove: priations of funds by Parliament to meet the Commonwealth's commitments under these agreements. Clause 7 of the Bill provides an apThe propriation out of the ConsoUdated Revenue Fund of $lm. This will be used to provide assistthe ance to New South Wales to meet the Commonsub-section wealth's commitment for urgent flood mitigation works on the coastal rivers during 1977-78. should point out that since 1964-65 the Comcurrent monwealth has provided $ 17m in grant funds New South Wales to implement the coastal riversfloodmitigation program on a 2:2:1 fund-provides ing basis-Commonwealth , State and local government authorities respectively. The Comresulted monwealth has always accepted a contingent commitment in respect offlooddisasters, and chosen this particular program has without any doubt considerably reduced the destructive effects these recurring natural hazards. It also has contributed significantly to the security of Ufe in flood prone areas. This Bill marks a significant departure in respect of enabling legislation for Commonwealth assistance to the States for water projects. is our view that a continuing legislative vehicle of this nature is more appropriate to the Second Reading requirements of a long-term program than single purpose Acts as has been past practice. The Act will reduce the legislative load in the House without in any way restricting the flow of information or opportunities for debate regarding Commonwealth commitments to the States for the assessment, planning, developlegislatment and management of the nation's water resources. I was very heartened to hear in the course of a recent debate in the House of wideunder spread concern regarding the Commonwealth's in the development of our water resources. I would sum up the essence of the debate as being Combipartisan support for a more active Commonwealth role. The Bill before the House is the first requirement towards this objective and the continuing nature of the proposed Act lends itself to sustained initiatives by the Comto ensure the most effective utilisation of Austraha's water resources. I commend flood mitithe Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Innes) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1977 Bill presented by Mr Street, and read a first Second Reading",64
249,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL," I That the Bill be now read a second time. purpose of this Bill is twofold. In the first place, an amendment is proposed to section 25 of Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to repeal (4). The second purpose is to put beyond question the vaUdity of the existing redisI tribution procedures insofar as they affect the redistribution of the State of Western to Australia. Honourable members may recall that section 25 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act for a redistribution when the Chief Australian Electoral Officer's determination has in an alteration in the number of members of the House of Representatives to be for a State. It also authorises a redistribution whenever in one-fourth of the divisions of a of State the number of electors differs from the quota by one-tenth more or by one-tenth less; and at such other times as the Governor General thinks fit. Sub-section (4) provides that after tribution has been put into effect in a State a period of seven years must elapse before a further redistribution can be made by virtue the one-fourth and one-tenth circumstance to which I have just referred. The current redisappointment tribution in relation to Western Australia has proceeded on the basis that section 25 (4) would not prevent a redistribution within the year period if there were other reasons for doingthat so such as that redistributions were in hand in other States. A legal challenge has now made to the vaUdity of the current redistribution of Western Australia. Broadly, it appears to be claimed that in the factual situation as it appUed in Western Australia, where one-fourth of the divisions differed from the quota by one-tenth more, it was not possible for the Governorspecial General to direct a redistribution in 1977 cause, as there had been a redistribution in ern Australia in 1974, the seven-year barrier must apply. It was made perfectly clear during the debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment of Bill in February this year that the intention that the Governor General, acting on the advice of the Executive Government, would reserve the option of proclaiming a redistribution at time he thought fit despite the seven-year vision. Nevertheless it does appear that there may be some doubt as to whether the legislation as currently drafted reflects this intention. Our advice is that the most appropriate way to overbacking come any problem which may exist is the seven-year provision contained in subsection (4).

250,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Corangamite-Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in PubUc Sera redisvice Matters) (4.10)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. of Last July, the Government took a major initiative in the international trade sphere with the of a Mmister for Special Trade Negotiations to be responsible for high level trade negotiations with the European Economic sevenCommumty. The new anangements envisaged the Minister would lead a smaU negotiating allteam, consisting primarily of officers seconded been from other departments. However, the requirements of section 64 of the Constitution and of the PubUc Service Act are such that it was necessary to formally create a Department of the Special Trade Negotiator and a position of Secor retary to that Department. In recognition of the relationship between the new Departbement and the Department of Overseas Trade, the West-Secretary of the latter Department, Mr D. H. MCKay, OBE., has been also acting as Secretary to the Department of the Special Trade Negotiator. After the selection procedures in section54A the Public Service Act had been foUowed, it was was determined that Mr MCKay-wh o is an 'established candidate' in relation to the vacancy, within the meaning of section 54 of the any Public Service Act-should be permanendy proappointed to the new office in addition to continuing to hold office as Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade. It is considered desirable that there should be express legislative for this course of action, m order that the to repeal legal position is beyond doubt. The Bill provides that the person for the time holding the office of Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade may also hold or act m the office of Secretary to the Department of the Special Trade Negotiator, and for a person acting in the office of Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade to also act in the office of the Secretary to the Department of the Special Trade Negotiator. Provision is also made that, a person is holding or acting in both offices, no remuneration will be payable m respect of the second office, and that if a person who holds both offices ceases to hold thefirstoffice, that person also ceases to hold the second office.

251,Mr NIXON,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill now before the House continues and further extends arrangements for the provision of assistprograms. ance to the States for land transport planning and research. Honourable members will be aware that the Government has included a sum of $8m in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) for transport planning and research assistance in $8m 1977-78. The Bill now before the House provides Schedule standing legislation specifying the conditions provided on a matching and arrangements covering the use of these funds and funds to be appropriated in subsequent years. At the Australian Transport Advisory Council the future arrangements concerning the planning and research program have been discussed with my State colleagues. There has been unanimous support for the continuation of the program and the structure of the arrangements proposed has been influenced by the views of the States. general introductory comments are appropriate. The Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1969 provided assistance for road research. The transport (Planning and Research) Act 1974 extended aspropose sistance to urban pubhc transport as well as roads. The present Bill further extends assistance to cover planning and research into all forms land transport as well as into areas involved the relationship of land transport and other modes. The transport planning and research program has achieved its objectives through effective Commonwealth-State co-operation. It has 3 promoted an integrated approach to planning and research, to the sharing of results and avoidance of duplication. Commonwealth assist House ance to more than 500 projects has totalled over $23m since 1974. Examples include large studies such as the south west area study in Western Australia, the north east area transport study South Austraha, the Koonung Creek corridor This study in Victoria and the Newcastle, Gosfordand Wyong and Wollongong urban studies. There are also many smaller projects such as area trol of traffic in Hobart and crew rostering computer in Queensland which are directed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of existing facilities and infrastructure. With to the Bill itself, I should say that several changes from previous legislation have been introduced BILL 1977 to simplify administrative arrangements while preserving the essential features of a Commonwealth-State co-operative program which has developed successfully to thistime.A change Second Reading from former arrangements is that State programs will now be approved rather than individual projects. This is to allow States greater flexibility in implementing and managing their planning and research programs and at the same time encourage the development of balanced I turn now to nnancial aspects. In 1977-78 the Government has proposed an appropriation of for transport planning and research and the to the Bill indicates the assistance to be given for each State. The 1977-78 grants will be basis of two Commonwealth dollars to one State dollar in line with previous legislation. However, after 1977-78 the Government proposes to contribute to the program on a dollar for dollar basis. We recognise that continuity of funding is very important in a program like this and we have already told the States that for 1978-79 and 1979-80 we are prepared to contribute our share on a dollar for dollar basis of a total program maintained at the Some 1977-78 level in real terms. The explanatory notes I have circulated describe the main features of the Bill and I do not to deal with individual clauses in detail. The important points covered by the Bill include definitions, arrangements for approval, details of of grant entitlement in 1977-78 and in later years, in provision to cover planning and research projects carried out for the States by research organisations and details of nnancial administration and provisions for delegation. Honourable members will recall that on 24 August 1976 and May 19771 tabled reports of progress on projects under the Transport (Planning and to Research) Act 1974. The Bill now before the provides for continued communication of results through annual progress reports and final project reports. The transport planning and research program to date has provided a good in example of Commonwealth-State co-operation. Bill will enable this co-operation to continue ensure effective use of resources. It will encourage planning and research relating to land con-transport, will allow for emphasis on new inby itiaties and for the avoidance of unnecessary duplication. I commend the Bill to the House. regard Debate (on motion by Mr Morris) adjourned. AIRLINE EQUIPMENT (LOAN GUARANTEE) BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Nixon, and read a first time.",66
252,Mr NIXON,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND," I move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. The purpose of this Bill is to seek authority for the Treasurer to guarantee on behalf of the Aus727-200 tralian Government, loans raised by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd tofinancethe purchase they of one Boeing 727-200 series aircraft. This will estic be the eighth aircraft of its type in the Ansett aircraft fleet. The company also operates four Boeing 727-100s and twelve DC9s. The Australian National Airlines Commission, Trans-Australia Airlines, which operates the same number of craft of each type as Ansett, has informed me that it intends tofinanceits eighth Boeing over 727-200 from its own internal resources. The need by both Ansett and the Commission to seekretire additional aircraft to incorporate into their fleets,also is to meet the strong growth in traffic that been evident throughout most of this year. The industry is optimistic that these trends will tinue through 1978. During 1976 both carriers experienced relawith tively depressed market conditions with a situcraft. ation of no growth in some areas and only mar-fore ginal gains in traffic being made in other areas. By comparison to 1975, when very high rates growth were achieved, 1976 was indeed a most difficulttimefor both airlines. However, statistics indicate that for thefirstthree quarters of 1977, the number of passengers carried was 4 per cent pohcy. higher than for the comparable period m 1976. Average load factors, or the number of seats cupied compared to those available, have also improved. Aircraft utilisation, or the number hours flown by each aircraft in the fleet, has alsopresent increased. Ansett and TAA have achieved levels of utilisation which are amongst the highest the world. This facet must be considered as of the more beneficial features of Austraha's two-airline policy. The achievement of such levels of utilisation ensures that the aircraft are flown to their fullest capacity, of course within the strict margins dictated by safety. This in turna assists to keep fares down by avoiding the cost surplus capacity within the fleet. Earher this year both airlines introduced new routes on to their network. For thefirsttime there is now a weekly direct jet service between Canberra and Adelaide. Similarly, there is weekly service offered between Sydney and Alice Springs. On this route, the service is provided by each of the airlines on alternate weeks. These developments, I beheve, reflect the airlines initiative and their willingness to explore new markets and break new ground. Apart from these Second Reading factors which are contributing to atighteningof capacity within the fleets, there is another matter which also should be mentioned. For some years now both operators have been As going through a process of upgrading their fleets. I mentioned earher, in addition to the Boeing s and the DC9s that each airline operate also have four Boeing 727-100s. This particular aircraft was first introduced onto the domnetwork in 1964 and in fact was the first jet Austraha.type to operate regular services in During 1976, both airlines sold two of the airBoeing 727-100s overseas and I understand that they intend to continue the retirement program the next few years for the remaining units of this aircraft type in their fleet. The decision to these aircraft is based not only on age, but on the fact that this aircraft is somewhat has smaller and relatively noisier than the Boeing 727-200s. On the general question of fleet expanconsion, the domestic operators have been watching with interest the experience of overseas operators the new generation of a wide-bodied airOf course, it would be some years yet betheir introduction could be expected on the domestic network. Network expansion and fleet of re-equipment are matters most pertinent to Austraha's two-airline pohcy. Indeed, I think it can be said that most forms of air transport in this country are to some extent influenced by this Whilst the pohcy has both its supporters and ocprotagonists, I do not beheve it can be denied that it has nurtured Austrahan aviation through of its relative infancy of the early 1950s, to its position. In fact, it has enabled Austraha to develop afirstclass internal aviation transport in system which has been the envy of many nations. one Nevertheless, even though the two-airhne system has served Austraha well, we should from time totimereview and test that pohcy to ensure it still meets the community's needs to the fullest. Accordingly, I announced m July of this year that review of domestic air transport pohcy is being ofconducted and being directed by a steering committee of senior officers from my Department. two The terms of reference are expansive and will include such topics as: The role of the Commonwealth and the States in the Ucensing of air sera vices; the possibUity of improving the Commonwealth air service Ucensing arrangements; the possibility of up-dating the two-airline pohcy rangements; seeking to clarify the role of smaller airlines and commuters; and the dual scheduling arrangements engaged in by the major operators on trunk routes. All interested parties from both private and future aviation government sectors together with the aviation Department, industry and major users have been invited to Wales forward submissions to the study group. These manpower views, where appropriate, will of course be taken that the optimal into consideration in preparing Similarly in thefieldof international have also directed my Department to undertake aviation facUities and infrastructure. a major review of air pohcy. Like the domestic this raises the thorny issue of who should review it will be a comprehensive study of all tors affecting international air travel. At the present time, there is considerable interest in the possibihty of lower international air fares to and from Austraha. While such fares would benefit certain sectors of the pubhc and the tourist industry, the effect frequency of schedule services must also be taken into account. It is essential that the Government's regulatory pohcies do not prevent such benefits being available to Austraha. At the same time, however, the Government must The ensure that our air links with other countries are not placed in jeopardy by those who may only wish to 'cream the trade'. Further, this study of the international situtributable ation will assist the Government in making proper contribution to the work of the InterGovernment national Civil Aviation Organisation which will be preparing studies over the next three years help the world aeronautical community to find solutions to the problems affecting the industry. am sure that the outcome of both of these studiesline will offer sound and positive guidelines for the continued development of both Austraha's domcosts, estic and international air transport system. While on the general issue of developing future guidelines for air transport, it seems propriate that I mention the present study m progress on the planning of future aviation facUiprograms ties in the Sydney area, namely the MANS Study. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport is only the centre of Austraha's domestic air transport network, but it is also the major national airport in Austraha. In the last seven years the number of persons moving through Sydney Airport has increased by 16 per cent, from 4,214,322 to the year ended June 1970, an estimated 4,869,000 for the year to June 1977.contributed It is expected in future years that the number passengers handled at Sydney Airport will conup tinue to increase at a substantial rate. arIn a joint statement, in October 1976, the the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier announced the estabhshment of a committee two of senior Commonwealth and State officials to recommend a suitable strategy to cater for the demand in the Sydney area. My and I understand other departments, mcluding those within the New South Government, are making a considerable commitment to the study to ensure solution in every sense, is future pohcy. achieved. In the long aviation I such as this, involves term the the outcome of studies sinking of capital into Of course pay. facOne would be foolish to deny the contribution that aviation makes to our economy; yet this can also be said of other forms of transport. We would aU Uke to see air fares kept as low as possible; however it must be borne in mind that this can only be achieved at considerable cost to the on the level and taxpayer. As I have said in the past, it is the Government's objective to ensure that Austraha's overaU transport system is the most efficient possible. general issue of cost recovery in the aviation field is certainly not new. In fact, in the AirUnes Agreement Act of 1961 it was stated that the Commonwealth would implement a pohcy of full recovery of the cost of facUities properly atto civil air transport. Of course, die a poUcy received notoriety under the previous when it announced its intention to increase the level of recovery for the costs of civil to aviation to 80 per cent across the board by 1978-79.1 beheve the Government has taken a I responsible decision by deferring the very harsh of the previous Government until the industry has been properly consulted on the levels of revenues and services. These discussions are continuing and proving to be a most fruitful exercise. apDeferral has also been made to facUitate proper studies and comparisons of cost recovery of other transport modes to be made. These studies are being carried out by the Bunot reau of Transport Economics and are now well advanced. Estimates by my Department for the interyear ended June 1977 show a total outlay of $212m on civil aviation in this country mcluding both capital works and overheads. Revenue estimates for the same period show a return of to approximately $124m. Of this $124m, half is by air navigation charges, 20 per of cent by aviation fuel tax, the balance being made by airport rentals and concessions. This gives an overaU recovery position of 59 per cent. When it is considered that, for the year ended June 1969, the percentage of revenues covering costs was only 44 per cent, this is a considerable achievement. Considering the same estimates ended June 1977, a clearer picture emerges when considering the the overaU recovery position is looked at on a operators serving sector basis. For mternational operations full recovery of costs is being achieved. For domestic trunk operations, namely those routes over northern which Ansett and TAA operate, the recovery the State Government position is approximately 76 per remaining sectors, rural airlines and general aviation, the recovery situation is somewhat less. Although this situation is recognised, the abUity of the industry to pay has to be considered. are also the needs of persons in remote areas Austraha who rely almost entirely upon air transport to meet their everyday needs. I would now like to mention a number of nouncements the Government has recently made on this general theme, in respect of subsidies air services in remote areas of Australia. Honourrational able members will know that it has been the Government's position that the ing areas of Austraha should enjoy the best possible air services while at the sametimekeeping the cost to the taxpayer, of subsidies, to a reasonable level. To this end, the Government last year estabUshed an inter-departmental committee to assess the demand for air services in the area served by time. the Northern Territory airiine, Connair Pty Ltd, and to recommend to me how that demand might best be satisfied. The Committee comprised representatives of the Department's of the Northern Territory, Aboriginal Finance and my own Department of Transport. The Committee placed considerable importance on conducting its inquiries on the spot and sought to obtain the widest possible range of comment and opinion from all sections of the community. The decisions recently taken by the Governwith ment were not solely based on the recommendatween tions of the Committee. I myself had a number of uite frank discussions with the Chairman of ary ? onnair, Mr E. J. ConneUan. The proposals which are now to be implemented were to some extent developed during the course of these disfamiliar cussions. These recent decisions by the Governexempt ment provide for the continued operation of Connair Pty Ltd as a viable enterprise. The airternational line will continue to meet the air transport needs of the people in the area who depend so much national upon it. The Committee also made a number of recommendations in respect of certain new initiatives, which the Government has implemented or will implement shortly. These too will assist in caterto the year area,forinthe ing air transport needs of the people in the the most efficient manner possible. In general question of subsidies to remote areas, the Government did have the benefit of simUar studies concerning Western Australia and northern Queensland. These studies were undertaken by authorities in conjunction cent. For the with my own Department. Honourable members will appreciate from this brief resume of the aviation industry that the Thereresponsible attitude taken by the present of Government has been an influencing factor upon the re-establishment of a stable climate within which confidence is being restored, and which is enabling industry growth. The reviews which are anat present underway wiU enable the Government to continue to be well advised and to respond to for the needs of the people of Austraha in the development of air services which are so vital to our general well being.

INCOME TAX (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS) AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Viner, and read a first Second Reading",67
253,Mr VINER,TRANSPORT PLANNING AND,"Stirling-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) Affairs, (4.34)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will provide legislative authority for two double taxauon agreements entered into with other countries. One is with Greece and appUes only to profits derived from mternational air transport. The other is with Belgium and deals aU substantial forms of incomeflowingbeAustraUa and Belgium. Neither of the agreements can enter mto force until all necesslegislative processes have been completed by both Australia and the other country. The Umited agreement with Greece is of a now kind and provides that each country is to from its tax profits derived from international air transport by the other country's inairhne. In effect, each country will have the sole right to tax profits from intertraffic derived by its international airline in the other country. The agreement with Belgium was signed by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) earher in the month and is along the hnes of Austraha's modern agreements, that is, those seven agreements negotiated or renegotiated since 1967. That being so, I think that I need not detain the House with an exposition of the purposes that are served by comprehensive double taxation agreements. Suffice it to say that the agreements provide in ordered ways for the two contracting countries to share in the revenue that is generated from income flowing between them. Under the agreement with Belgium, Austraha is to reduce its withholding tax on dividends flowing to Belgian residents from 30 per cent to 15 per cent of the dividends. Conversely, Belgium is to reduce its rate of withholding tax on dividends-currentl y 20 per cent-to 15 per cent. I mention that profits out of which dividends are distributed by Australian companies to foreign shareholders now bear a company tax rate of 46 per cent so that, with withholding tax at the rate of 15 per cent, that total Austrahan on each $ 100 of distributed profits is a not stantial $54.10. The agreement specifies a Umit of 10 per cent on each country's tax on interest and royalties flowing to the other. For Austraha this will mean no reduction in our interest withholding tax of 10 per cent. For royalties flowing to Belgium, the Austrahan tax hmit of 10 per cent of gross payments may operate to reduce the ordinary tax at general rates of net royalties. Belgium will reduce its withholding tax rate on interest and royalties from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. The agreement contains measures for the formal rehef by the country of residence of double taxation of income that would otherwise be taxed by both countries. These measures supplement the relief that is available under the ordinary domestic law of each country. GeneraUy, income which is taxed in M l in the country of source will be exempt from tax by the country of residence while, in the case of income that is taxed at reduced rates in the country of sourcedividends, interest and royalties-the country of residence will tax the income and allow credit for the tax of the country of source. Apart from the provisions I have mentioned, the agreement with Belgium contains the usual provisions-commo n to double taxation agreements-relatin g to the taxation of business profits, visiting businessmen and employees, pubUc entertainers, students and pensioners and so on. These and other aspects of the arrangements with Belgium are explained in an explanatory memorandum that is being made avaUable to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.

254,Mr VINER,TERRITORY AUTHORITIES,"StirUng-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (4.38)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is to provide certain complementary legislative provisions to overcome technical problems encountered in the legislation for statutory authorities established by Territory ordinances. During the drafting of the Darwin Commumty CoUege Ordinance 1973, it became apparent that provisions for the payment of budget appropriations, which are normally tax included in Acts constituting Commonwealth insubauthorities, were beyond the power of a Territory ordinance. The Territory Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act 1973 was therefore enacted as complementary legislation to make E revision to overcome this deficiency for the col:ge and for any other Territory authority estabhshed by ordinance in the future. Since then it has become apparent that certain other provisions concerning loans and taxation normally included in Commonwealth authorities' Acts are also beyond the powers of an ordinance. Accordingly, this Bill will re-enact the 1973 Act with additional provisions to allow the Treasurer to determine the terms and conditions of Commonwealth loans to prescribed Territory authorities, and to enable him to give Commonwealth guarantees on other borrowings by prescribed authorities. Clause 8 of the Bill provides that certain non-commercial Territory authorities sepcified in Part 1 of the Schedule to the Act are exempt from Commonwealth and State taxation, unless regulations under the Act make a particular authority subject to a specified tax. Clause 9 provides that certain commercial Territory authorities specified in Part II of the Schedule are subject to taxation under the laws of the Commonwealth, but not subject to taxation under any law of a State unless the regulations make a particular authority Uable to a specified state tax. The taxation provisions are in terms simUar to those included in Acts constituting Commonwealth authorities passed by this Parhament. Because of the importance of taxation, provision has been made for the schedule of adopted, authorities to which the taxation provisions for'Lawson'. apply to be amended only by subsequent ment of the Act. Specific provision is also made in the Bill for Speaker, the Canberra Commercial Development Authnate ority to be hable for income tax and sales tax, in Can order to comply with the intention Authority was established in be hable to all taxes and charges normally cable to private commercial Authority is to be made subject to income tax retrospectively from the date of its estabhshment so that it may benefit by offsetting any trading losses incurred in its early years against taxable income, in the same way as developer. Because of administrative difficulties that would be involved in attempting sales tax on past transactions, the authority be subject to sales tax from the date of comopponent, mencement of this Act. In view of the Government's decision last July concerning the advance toward self-government for the Northern Territory, there will be sultation with the Northern Territory Executive before any Northern Territory authority is is prescribed under this Act.

Whilst we accept the proposed redistributions in respect of the other states, we beheve that there are minor objections to them. I dealfirstlywith full conthe proposed redistribution for Western Austraha. What I want to say about that matter this: I think it is a clear illustration of people to being denied theirrightsto object to electoral redistributions, in the hght of what happened today. The Government rushed into this House a Bill validating a proclamation relating to a subdivision in Western Austraha because a citizen in Kalgoorlie wanted to exercise hisrights.He did so by instituting proceedings in the High Court. legislation rushed into this House this afternoon will deny him therightto pursue that matter. This shows the incompetence and bungling of this Government. The distribution in Western this Austraha is obviously illegal. It should never have been allowed. When a citizen of KalJoint Comgoorhe, who has therightto protest, commences a an action in the High Court, the Government uses the whole process of the law to rush into the A Parhament today a Bill saying the distribution and disposal'presented to been before the House will be validated. It is an insult disto the House. It has certainly denied therightsof a person in Kalgoorhe. Why was he not allowed to pursue the matter and perhaps show that the law was invalid and incompetent and did not give him hisrightsbecause he had another The number of people who will come within divthe Kalgoorhe electorate has been increased. and The electorate has been enlarged. It is about the purpose largest electorate in the world now, and it has repon been increased in size again. Aboriginal people in the in the Kalgoorhe electorate do not always enrol. be That does not alter the fact that they exist there and that the honourable member for Kalgoorhe has a responsibihty towards them. No considerand ation has been given to that fact. If they were enrol, as they may, before the writs are issued the forthcoming election, the Kalgoorhe electorLiberal ate would be out of all proportion to what would be deemed fair and reasonable. The Distribution Commissioners have analysed this situation in manner to suit the pohtical concepts of the present Government. The permissible maximum number of people in a Western Austrahan eleccally torate is 67,387. Everybody knows that the population of the Kalgoorhe electorate entitled to vote together with the Aboriginals there would be in excess of that number. A private citizen challenged the report of the priate Western Australian Distribution Commissioners because it was made in accordance with a proclathat mation which he says is invahd. He is to be nied his right to sustain that challenge. He titled to sustain the challenge. He argues that if issue the existing divisions are adhered to, the goorhe division would be smaller and that the position would not be as it will be as a result the validating legislation introduced today. One wonders how in the name of fortune the Prime was Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was able to conanybody vince His Excellency the Governor General that he should grant a dissolution of Parliament when the proposed new electoral divisions of the submitted. nation have not been approved by the ParUato influence the ment. One is the subject of a challenge in the that area. High Court. What happens if it transpires that we do not approve the report in respect of the divisions applying to Western Australia? As it perfectly entitled to do, this House could disapwere E rove of the report, but a dissolution of the Partitled ament has been granted already because the Prime Minister asked for it. Are we to run a maps, democracy in this nation on the basis that whatPress reportsas ever the Prime Minister wants is granted whenpropositions ever he wants it irrespective of the the Parliament? Why are therightsof Kalgoorlie being denied and interrupted by the decision of the Commissioners urgent legislation from an incompetent Govern the ment? It is for these reasons that the Opposition proposes to oppose the report of the Comthe seat of Lowe. That was on 11 October. On missioners in respect of the Western Australian divisions. Let me deal with another matter which is just as serious and important-the proposed redisWhat tribution in New South Wales. As a result of objections when the first maps were pubhshed, the divisions have been substantially altered suit the poltiical advantages of the Liberal Party. No other point of view could be expressed. I that make this point very clearly indeed. on New South Wales deals with the suggestions objections lodged following the pubUcation to of the first maps. Pages 220 and 221 set out a letfor ter from Mr Carlton, the General Secretary of the Party, clearly stating out what he thinks should happen. Speaking about Lowe, he said: 'We do not want the division that has been a foreshadowed. It is not in accordance with what we think is reasonable'. He forgot to add: 'It is not in accordance with what we think is potitiadvantageous'. He said: 'We object to it and we want the Commissioners to do something about it'. The Commissioners have done something about it. We have the incredible situation that what has now been put forward as an approdivision for Lowe is virtually the same as what was put forward by the Liberal Party when it first made its submissions. What transpired convinced the Commissioners that they deshould agree all of a sudden with the Liberal is enParty's submission that was made before the of the first maps? The Commissioners took Kalthree or four months to examine those submissions. They made a vahd determination. The of only thing standing against their determination an objection from the Liberal Party in the seat of Lowe. We now get the result, without else being consulted, that Lowe is virtually the same as what the Liberal Party first I very much doubt whether anyone can say that Commissioners were not subject as to what should be the decision in is Let us look at some other factors. Objections lodged by therighthonourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon). Fine. He was ento object. Following the pubUcation of the he made the point that he would object. state that Mr Carlton described the foreshadowed unacceptable to matters before another interesting and the Liberal Party outrageous. There was a citizen in Before the objections had by action the Liberal Party. been considered and announced Liberal Party called for nominations preselection but did not call for nominationsfor for 18 October, still before the distribution results were announced, the Liberal Party said that it was calling for nominations for the seat of Lowe. transpired in the mind of the Liberal Party between 11 October and 18 October to convince it that it could then go ahead and call for nomito nations for the seat of Lowe? Did it know that the proposed distribution was to be the same as they had asked for in the first place? It looks The report very much Uke it.

Mulgoa sub-division was raised. Lo and behold, because an objection was raised that objection was sustained and the sub-division of Mulgoa is to go into the division of Lawson, which of to course will suit the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Giliard). This is the Talk about the Commissioners making an impartial decision. Why is it that when the Liblaughter. eral Party first submitted that Mulgoa should be in the division of Lawson the submission agreed to. It was only after the first maps were published, objections were invited and objecIf tions were received from the Liberal Party that the objection was acceded to. If we look at the preliminary position of map 5, that is the Liberal Party's own proposals wefindthat after objecthat tions have been dealt with the Commissioners are in agreement with the Liberal Party's origwas inal proposals. It smells to high heaven of pohtispht cal corruption. There is nothing worse.",71

Under secuse tion 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the matters to be taken into consideration by the Distribution Commissioners include community of interest, including economics, social and economic, regional interests. What happened in the case of Kingsford-Smith? Firstly, the Liberal Party subproposition. mitted that the subdivision of Kensington should be incorporated in the division That submission was not sustained. As a matter of interest, the subdivision of Kensington was put into the division of Phillip, another Liberal seat. The honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney) objected saying: ' I do not want the division of Kensington. It should be given to somebody else'. He was partially successful. Half the subdivision has been taken out of the proposed electorate of Philhp and given to the electorate of Wentworth. I now represent these people. Can any Government supporter imagine saying: 'Well, on one side of the street you are going to be in an electorate which is 5 miles away. There is no transport, there are no schools and there is no community of interest'? Government supporters interjectingmentioned Mr LIONEL BOWEN-How silly is it?

But the people on the other side of the road are in a different electorate. The facts are the people on the northern part of the subdivision vote Labor. That is the position. There no submission that the subdivision should be in half. I do not know too many cases where a subdivision has been split in half to suit the convenience of the Liberal Party. Here we find Kensington divided in half: The part that votes Labor is given to Wentworth, miles away, while people on the southern side who vote Liberal part of a continuous zone of the Phillip electorate. Does this not smell to high heaven? Yet Government supporters laugh. They laugh at corruption. The people in that area go to the same churches, the same shopping centres and the same transport and their children go to the same schools, but those people have different Federal members. So where do we get this consideration of section 19-the consideration of social and regional interest? It is a blatant hypocrisy for anyone to say that this is a fair It has been carried out to sustain the seat of Phillip for the Liberals but we will win of Wentworth. despite the unfairness. The local member, who happens to be myself, was not consulted at any stage. I agreed that the subdivision in to to should be removed, but to subremove half of it on the basis that it is known which way the people will vote is a blatant discrimination against the people in that electorate. You would have tofirea 25-pounder gun from that area to try to find Mr Elhcott. He has never seen the area. Now he is going to be the local member. Yet Mr Birney is going to represent the other side of the road. It is just soridiculousto think that the Government can say to the people in the Kensington subdivision, that from now on their affiliation is going to be with Vaucluse and Point Piper. That is where they have been put purely on the basis that they happen to vote Labor. The eleaorate of Wentworth is so Liberal dominated it can absorb some of the saturation of Labor voters. Where is the continuity of interest? Where is the affiliation of sociotheir economic zones. Where is the affiliation in normal community of interest, from the point view of schools, shopping centres and the like? What provision will be made for them to equately represented?

Goodness me! the When we hear aU these complaints about maof nipulations and gerrymanders let us remember the redistribution that the Labor Government be adbrought down in this House. In New South muWales the five seats with the largest numbers of voters happen to be enormous country electorates. The Labor Government lowered the for the city electorates which are only size in any case. What could have been more of a gerrymander than that? Thank goodness the Senate was prepared to throw out the redistribution proposal and not accept it. While I cannot say that this redistribufills me with much satisfaction it is a darn sight better than that brought down by the Labor The National Country Party will not try to prevent these proposals being adopted. However, we take that attitude only with the greatest reluctance and with serious misgivings. To say we support the proposals would be to put the matter Ausin the wrong perspective. We believe that they grossly unfair to countiy people. They are based on a principle which is wrong, one which not even apply. I have no doubt that within the Parhament, particularly on this side, there is a a degree of understanding of, sympathy with and for the point of view put forward by the National Country Party-that there needs to be a degree of tolerance to try to compensate for aU disabUities of the large country electorates. to We say that all Australians wherever they live, to should have the opportunity of at least some centre. I supequaUty of representation. parties, Labor, Liberal and our own Party, until recently supported provisions which would have allowed the electoral laws which have apphed since Federation to be maintained. They provided for a tolerance of 20 per cent above and one below the quota for electoral enrolments. Today it seems that only the National Country Party supports that provision. So far as we have been able we have endeavoured to have the 20 per cent provision restored. We beheve that it should We will continue to try to have it resIt is fair and reasonable and it has apphed for a long time. The proposals which appUed were based on rules which allowed a degree of equity. However, they have now been circumscribed so that the discretion of the Distribution Commissioners is exercised in a way does not apply to any other democratic country in the world. I shaU Ulustrate this point in a moment. I think that the claim we have heard so often, that Austraha is now blessed with a tem of one vote one value or close to it, should exposed for its hypocrisy and nonsense. Under the electoral laws as they now stand, and as they were drawn up by the Whitlam gave Government, Austraha's smallest electorate contain 45,048 voters and the largest electorate can contain 81,457 voters- a difference of 36,400 voters. That was brought down under Labor's rules. What hypocrisy, what humbug for these self-styled champions of democracy to claim that they have prevented the destruction of democsense racy in Austraha, that they enshrined the sophed. called sacred principle of one vote one value our laws. Labor's rules, which have not been changed, allow for one electorate to contain per cent more voters than another. What is the maximum tolerance in enrolments? Is it really per cent? The average enrolment in Australia's 124 electorates is 68,906 voters, electorate with only 45,000 voters and another which can have as many as 81,000 voters. That a departure from the average not of 10 per cent but of 35 per cent below the average in one case and of 18 per cent above it in the other. Thesefiguresare based on the enrolments the Northern Territory compared with the missible enrolments in electorates in South Austraha. Even if we regard the Northern tory as a special case and base the comparison electorates in Tasmania and South Austraha stiUfindthat, under Labor's rules, there can be as few as 47,162 voters in a Tasmanian electoris ate and as many as 81,457 in a South Austrahan electorate. That is a difference of34,000 voters.",74
269,Mr YOUNG,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,That is not Labor's rules. That the Constitution.,75
270,Mr ANTHONY,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"The honourable member this says that it is in the Constitution, but if the ciple is so great, why do honourable members opposite not work towards constitutional see change? They will not do that. Of course, the principle is not great enough! It is quite aU right for httle, compact electorates in Tasmama have smaller numbers but big electorates elsement where have to have the normal numbers. We point-o know how phoney the Opposition's proposals are. They are nothing more than a pohtical frame of mind. device to try to concentrate pohtical power and votes in the city areas, at the expense of country should people. I said that there could be a difference of34,000 in the number of voters in electorates. This means that there can be 73 per cent more voters in one electorate than in another electorate under Labor's rules. So much for Labor's principle of sys-one vote one value. It means there can be a debeparture from the average of 32 per cent below and 18 per cent above. Yet Labor Party has hoodwinked many people into beUeving that it Australia one vote one value. What a fraud! can What we have in Austraha is a system which allows a far greater tolerance in electoral enrolments than the great majority of people beheve is provided under the law. So why aU this humbug about one vote one value? The trouble is that the tolerance is not appUed when common and fairness require that it should be apThe system requires that the tolerances I in have described apply in a back-to-front manner. The result is that the relatively smaU electorates 80 in Tasmania can have very small enrolments and that the large mainland electorates must have 10 higher enrolments. It should be the other way around if honourable members beheve in that yet we have an principle so strongly. I said earUer that the Commissioner's disiscretion is circumscribed to a greater extent than occurs in any other countiy which can claim to have a democratic tradition such as ours. Let me mention two examples. In Britain in 1974 the larin est enrolment was 118,000 voters in Antrim perouth and the smallest was 23,000 voters hi Western Isles- a difference of 95,000 voters. In TerriCanada in 1974 the largest enrolment was on 125,000 voters in Yorke-Scarborough and the we smallest was 12,300 voters in Yukon- a difference of 112,000 voters. The British example especiaUy significant. Britain regards her electoral laws as being based on one vote one value but appUes that principle, even in such a small, compact country, in ways that take greater is account of factors such as remoteness, communication difficulties and distances, than we do in vast continent of ours. Britain, in other prinwords, does not adopt therigid,unthinking, mathematical approach that we do, but tries to that voters in every part of the country have some opportunity for equaUty of representation. I think it is about time we did the same. The to National Country Party is in complete agree with the Leader of the Opposition on this r at least with the views he expressed a few years ago when he was in a more rational Speaking in this House on an occasion which be recorded in the history books, he said the 20 per cent tolerance above or below the quota was 'perfectly reasonable'. Let me repeat that: the Leader of the Opposition is on record in Hansard as saying that the 20 per cent tolerance is 'perfectly reasonable'. He emphasised that he was speaking impartially. 'I am speaking tially and without party pohtical bias on this matter', he said. He went on to say on the same occasion that the principles enunciated in Electoral Act should be 'preserved and racy enshrined in the Constitution'. So what we have is the Leader of the Opposition saying, when speaks impartially and without party political bias, that the 20 per cent tolerance is perfectly reasonable and should be preserved-in fact, should be enshrined in the Constitution. I suggest that all those people who have been conned intosafeguard seeing the Leader of the Opposition as the great saviour of the principles of democracy ought look at what he says when he speaks circumstances. The fact is, of course, that a 20 per ance is perfectly reasonable-for all the reasons and others have described over and over again, in this House and elsewhere. A 20 per cent toler Mr ance is absolutely necessary if the commissioners are to be able to draw boundaries that go even some of the way towards providing some opporshould tunity for equality of representation. But we are told that it is far more important to see are more or less equal numbers of people in each electorate than to try to ensure that each elector enjoys at least some equality of representation with his fellow citizens. No one, except the National Country Party, is prepared to say the rights of people, the mterests of people, should come before theories based on numbers and an irrational attachment to an allegedly that, sacred principle- a principle which, in practice, not apphed. What we have is a situation in which hypocritimainland. cal hp-service is paid to a principle while proval is given to a practice which ignores that E rinciple-and in fact turns it upside down. We ave a situation in which people are told that there is a 10 per cent tolerance, while in fact a per cent tolerance is actually perpetrated in current redistribution proposals; but, of course, cannot be apphed in a reasonable and sensible way, whereby the big electorates can get the erance that should be given. It is abouttimethere was an end to all the nonsense and hypocrisy about one vote, one value. It is abouttimethere was some attempt made to understand the real difficulties faced by countiy people in gaining adequate and fair pohtical representation.",75

That, of course, is what the Constitution already ensures in deciding the number of members there shall be between the States on the The number of members in the House apof Representatives between the States on the mainland is determined by their respective populations.

That is democracy. There could be adjacent electorates, one with half as many electors again. The right honourable member for Richmond quoted years something I said at the first distribution I spoke on in this House in 1955. He at least might had the grace to admit that, in the Consututional Review Committee's report of 1958 and 1959,1 was the one who insisted that the margin should be reduced to 10 per cent. The two Country Party members of that Committee, Mr Drummond lows: and Mr Hamilton, supported that recommendacent; tion. Twenty years ago decent Country Party men said that a 10 per cent margin was all that was needed. I take up the right honourable gentleman in the case of the electorate of Kal68.2 percent. goorhe which is the largest in area in the world. This distribution enlarges that electorate still further. From the report which we are debating, it would appear that the enrolment in Kalgoorlie is the smallest of any division in Western If, however, Aborigines in Western were encouraged to enrol, as distinct that from being deterred from enrolling, it would have an enrolment in excess of the 10 per cent margin-in fact, in excess of the 20 per cent 10 per The Western Australian redistribution enshrines the most serious and dehberate discrimination against Aborigines in Austraha. The result is not only grave injustice against the Aboriginal people but also unfairness for the electors of Kalgoorhe as a whole. As a result of this discrimination against Aborigines, the new electorate of Kalgoorhe is larger in size and larger in poputhan it need be if all ehgible Aborigines were enrolled. Discrimination against Aborigines has diluted the vote of all other Austrahans in the Kalgoorlie electorate. There can be now doubt about the source of that discrimination. It is the Liberal Party and the Liberal Government of Western Austraha. Further, the Federal is failing in its obUgation to encourage Aborigines to enrol and exercise their democraticrights.Evidence given in the Western AusCourt of Disputed Returns last month on an appeal in relation to the electorate of Kimin the State election in February puts that beyond doubt. It is clear that the Liberal Party has engaged in a dehberate campaign to discourage and deter Aborigines from enrolling and from voting. a 20 The existing electorate of Kalgoorhe had the highest population over the age of 18 of all the 10 Western Australian Federal electorates at the a time of the census in June 1976; yet it had the lowest enrolment. The Kalgoorhe popunot lation over 18 years of age at the census was 86,743. The enrolment at June 1976 was only 59,161-68.2 per cent of the population over 18 of age. By contrast, Forrest, with a population over 18 years of age of 59,936 at that time, nave had an enrolment of 58,719-97.96 per cent of those 18 years of age and over were enrolled. The proportion of those enrolments to the population over 18 years of age at June last year in the other electorates in Western Austraha was as folCurtin, 95.51 per cent; Moore, 92.28 per Fremantle, 91.91 percent; Swan, 91.36 per cent; Canning, 91.25 per cent; Tangney, 89.20 per cent; Stirling, 87.46 per cent; Perth, 84.93 per cent. But the proportion for Kalgoorhe was only The percentage of the ehgible population enrolled for the State, other than for the Kalgoorhe division, was 91.09 per cent. The Western Australia quota is now 69,443 electors. The new Kalgoorhe has 65,070 electors. On the old boundaries, Kalgoorlie would have been 14 per cent above the new quota if 91 per cent-the State average-ha d been enrolled. Instead the new Kalgoorlie has had to be even further extended to come within the new quota. If the Aboriginal population had been properly enrolled, Kalgoorhe, already the world's largest electorate, could have been reduced in size. Instead, it has been enlarged. Even when allowance is made for the number of itinerant workers in the electorate of Kalgoorlie there remains one overwhelming reason for the huge discrepancy between population and electors. Plainly, Aboriginals are not being enrolled and, if enrolled, are being discouraged from voting. The extent of discrimination against and intimidation of Aborigines has been fully disclosed in the Court of Disputed Returns over the last few months. Evidence was given that five lawyers, acting on behalf of the Liberal Party, had flown to the electorate, purportedly to act as scrutineers. In a letter written by the Liberal  of Ruby Plains Station it was stated: You are possibly aware that on polling day we had five young solicitorsflyup to the Kimberley region to work as scrutineers for us at places where there was a large Aboriginal population. As a result of their activities I believe that we now have enough evidence to try and convince people of the necessity for amending the Electoral terate voters. If this is not done I would anticipate that by the next elecuon there could be in the order of 3,000 to 4,000 Aborigines on the roll and under such circumstances the Liberal Party would be doomed to failure. In another letter tabled in evidence, Mr Ridge wrote to an earth moving contractor at Derby, Jeremy O'Driscoll, who had acted as a scrutineer for the Liberal Party and said. I wanted you to know also that I didn't underestimate the value of your 'trick' at GoGo station on 19th. We could have been in real trouble without the services of a person such as yourself as scrutineer and I am extremely grateful. Evidence was given that 34 Aborigines had been deprived of their right to vote at that polhng booth alone by this 'trick'. Evidence also was given that the Liberal lawyers deliberately humiliated and confused Aboriginal voters. Aboriginal elders were asked: 'Are you over 18?' Others were asked: 'Are you a natural born Austrahan?' Others again were asked: 'Are you a subject of Queen Elizabeth II?' Only Aborigines were asked these questions. One of the five Liberal lawyers, Mr Haydn Wesley Dixon, told the judge that he had decided that 'any lawful means could be used to stop illiterate Aborigines from voting'. He said that 'he had regarded illiterate Aborigines as being invalid potential voters because of the pressure he was told was being applied to them'. The Constitution defines the grounds for disfranchisement. Illiteracy is, of course, not one of them. It is a monstrous suggestion that there should be a Uteracy test for electors. It would enable the wholesale disfranchisement not only of Aborigines but also of migrants and indeed scores of thousands of handicapped Austrahans. Literacy in what? Why limit it to EngUsh? Literacy tests are the most notorious weapons against civil Liberties in South Africa and right back to the days of the post-bellum deep south. Not all forms of discrimination are so blatant as that practised against Aborigines in Western Australia. The question we can legitimately ask now is: If in Kalgoorhe, the largest electorate in the world, the electorate in Western Australia which already has the largest population but the smallest enrolment, we find that Aborigines who have exercised their option to enrol are being deterred from voting might we not assume that they have also been deterred from enrolling? That is why this electorate is being made stUl larger-becaus e Liberal lawyers and other Liberals have deterred Aborigines from exercising their right to vote as Australian electors. I want to mention one other form of discrimination, and that is the discrimination against persons who are Commonwealth citizens, in particuAct in relation to illilar citizens from Cyprus and Malta and who therefore, under our laws, are not only entitled to vote after they have resided in Australia for six months but are compelled to vote. This matter has been raised by Senator Mulvihill and others in the Senate and by some of us in this House. On 5 October this year I asked: Will the Government make it known that Commonwealth nationals are not only eligible to be enrolled as voters but also required to be enrolled and that, under Australia's system of compulsory enrolment and voting, they are subject to the same penalties as Australian citizens for failing to enrol and vote? On 11 October the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Withers, wrote to me saying that steps had been taken to ensure that the correct information was given to the divisional returning omcers and to persons seeking to obey the law. He sent to me the provisional notice which is to go in post offices in Australia. I hope you can see it from there, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is a foolscap sheet listing over three dozen Commonwealth countries. No emphasis at all is given to the fact that Cypriots and Maltese who reside here are entitled to vote. In fact they are obliged to enrol and to vote. Yet we find from information in letters to the Sydney Moming Herald, for instance, such as the one from Dr George Paxinos",77

277,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"The happenings of redistributions should never imagined to be accidental. They are calculated and they occur in that way. The fortunes of tributions also are not accidental. That is clear when one looks at the results of redistribuhas tions over a long period of time. In any redisthat tribution half the members ought to be disadvanThose taged and half the members advantaged. pluses ought to balance out the minuses. Yet an examination of what has happened in redistribuprevious tions over many years shows that with a governand ment side of 65 or 70 members, 20 of whom are Ministers, no Ministers are even in danger. Their seats are never put atrisk.They are never sigconcerned nificantly disadvantaged in a redistribution. Were the commissioners to be totally unaware the pohtical consequences of their decisions, would be an impossibility. So, I begin by making the veryfirmpoint that it is a statistical fact distribution commissioners are aware of the polinterests itical consequences of their decisions. The history of Austraha since World War II verifies that fact absolutely and overwhelmingly. One's fate redistributions is not a random number in the wheel of fortune. I turn now to the redistribution as it concerns Queensland. The distribution commission in Queensland consisted of three people-tw o only Commonwealth public servants and one State public servant, who is a statutory officer, the State Surveyor-General. It is a widely in that State that the non-Commonwealth officer has been desperately unhappy about what occurboth red in the redistribution. That has been made known to people. It is known to honourable members in this place-honourabl e members nary who are not scheduled to speak-and it is not redistribution known indirectly. It is quite clear that one of commissioners felt that the minds of the other commissioners were not open in respect of the redistribution and he desperately considered making a minority report. That information been conveyed directly and indirectly to a number of people, and some honourable bers in Parliament House who are not scheduled to speak are aware of it. So, the circumstances a redistribution immediately become obvious and the nature of the commissioners becomes obvious. I have referred elsewhere to the manner which recommendations are made for people become distribution commissioners. In tions Queensland two such appointments were made relatively recent times. One person appointed was the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, who was new in that State, and the other was a Commonwealth public servant in be Queensland. Both were appointed to their positions very recently. Mr Coleman, the Commonrediswealth Electoral Officer, who must take the quite blame for what has happened in Queensland, to bear the brunt of any criticism. I beheve that is quite reasonable and ought to be so. two people represented a majority of The those who would make the decision. I was always desperately unhappy about a redistribution through which I lived, for thefirsttimeI make a criticism of it. The last redistribution went through this House in 1968, and one of the people in my State who was with it was a senior Minister, a Postmaster-General. One of the commissioners of appointed was the Director-General of Posts and that Telegraph in that State. I always maintainedthis is the first time in 10 years that I have stated that it-that there had to be a very severe clash of in that redistribution. It is for that reason that I have said that the composition of many of the distribution commissions in 1975, in in which Commonwealth public servants did not constitute a majority, was correct. The 1975 redistribution could not be impugned because of the honesty of the commissioners. I said that in the House at thetime,and I admit that it was out of party loyalty that I voted against that redistribution. But the principle remains and it ought to be adhered to. That redistribution was known fact impeccable in its procedures. I turn now to the events of this redistribution, as it concerns myself and as it concerns a wider sphere. I deal with my own casefirst,in terms of the principles involved. An extraordiselectivity of principle was involved in this in respect of the seat of Lilley. An the area had to be added to the seat, and the only area added was one which had the greatest separation from the seat. The key principle was the attitude of the commissioners to what are known has as freeways. The area added to my seat is separated from it by both a railway line and a memproposed freeway. No other area was so separated from the seat by clear, continuous and of complete boundaries. Yet that was the only area added to the seat. It also happened to be an area which was rather disadvantageous to my own position. That was not unknown to the comin missioners, as I indicated from the evidence to which can be adduced since 1945. No suggeswere made for a change. A change was not contemplated. It was the only area on the border which would have been somewhat disadvanWere tageous to my position. I am puzzled when alise that the commissioners went out of their way to make freeways the boundaries between electorates on the other side of Brisbane. possible they made freeways the boundaries tween the Griffith and Moreton electorates and between the Bowman and Moreton electorates. In no other way did the boundaries exist The New South Wales commissioners went out of their way to make freeways the legitimate boundaries of electorates where they could. Freeways separate the electorate of Prospect the proposed new seat of Macquarie and the electorates of Robertson and Hunter. In Victoria, the commissioners also used freeways on the north and south of the Yarra River as boundaries wherever it was possible. I am puzzled that commissioners when drawing up boundaries one side of the Brisbane River should think differently from what they did on the south side of the river and differently from the comHouse. missioners in New South Wales and from the commissioners in Victoria. I am overwhelmingly convinced that they were aware of the conseany quences of what they were doing. Not for moment do I retreat from that position. Given the composition of the tribunal, the comsection missioners obviously felt that they could adopt that course. I come to the final changes that were made the redistribution proposals in Queensland. I find some of these the most fascinating of the lot. Two changes were made between the first publi-the cation of the maps and the second pubUcation of the the maps. One change was made in north objections Queensland between the electorates of Dawson and Kennedy. It was also a proposed change. was put forward by way of an objection. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr lodged Braithwaite) would immediately agree with In south-east Queensland, the commissioners made a change. They changed the electorate of the Gold Coast to the electorate of MCPherson and changed the electorate of MCPherson to the electorate of Fadden. I am fascinated as to caused them to make those changes. I say to theerror. House: I am totally convinced they acted on dence other than that presented to them in publicticularly documents. In Queensland the names of electorates important. If an electorate changes its name a person contests that electorate, the seat is for challenge by another party because of the three-cornered contest atmosphere that operates in Queensland. We know that. It does not matternowhere. whether one agrees with what has occurred. the name of an electorate changed from, I re-say, MCPherson to the Gold Coast, the Gold Coast electorate becomes open for chaUenge by another party. Miraculously the electorate names Where were changed by the commissioners, but nobewhere, as I look through the voluminous document entided 'Redistribution of Queensland into Electoral Divisions' can I see that such a change was proposed. The commissioners, like St Paul on the road to Damascus, obviously had a vision and felt that they could make that change. They felt that they could make that change with and impunity. They felt that they could make that change with confidence. The poltiical consequences of that change ought to be known to the House. The pohtical consequences of a name change are greater in Queensland than in any the other part of Austraha. Names of electorates for were changed in Queensland. They were not changed elsewhere in Austraha. The changmg of names of electorates in normally left to this The Fox report of 1969 made it quite clear that the authority to name electorates lay with this House, and yet out of the blue, without suggestions under section 21 of the Electoral one Act for such a proposal, the commissioners changed the names of electorates. I shall read 21 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act because that is the section which governs the final changes between the first pubUcation of the maps, the 30 day period for objections and the to final pubUcation of the maps. It states: Suggestions or objections in writing may be lodged with Distribution Commissioners not later than 30 days after advertisement referred to in the last preceding section, and the Commissioners shall consider au suggestions and so lodged before making their report. It It is quite clear that the commissioners considered some other objections which were not before they made their report. I believe that. an explanation is required from the commissioners. I am not happy with the position. No reasonable person could possibly be happy with the position. I believe tracks have not been covered very well. It was an error not to propose what a change. What the commissioners did was an It is widely known in the House that over evi-recent years commissioners have not been parinterested in naming electorates. They have shied away from taking upon themselves are the precise naming of electorates. They have and tended to give electorates merely geographical opennames and leave it for the Parliament to decide. That is what has happened in this case. The decision in the instance to which I refer came from I am puzzled by it. I am also disturbed by it. The House can well understand why I find myself unable to vote for the proposed redistribuuon.

278,Mr STEWART,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS," I move that the following words be added to the motion: And the name Lang be substituted for Grayndler. My reason for doing that is that in the new electorate, or should I caU it the new, new electorate of Grayndler, the constituents are made up of 11,384 from Grayndler, 2,485 from Blaxland, 35,181 from Evans and 22,208 from the seat of Lang. Yet the commissioners have proposed the name of Grayndler. Apparently the Government has accepted the name of Grayndler. Mr Neil-Why not call it Evans?",81
279,Mr STEW ART,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"Yes, it should be called the seat of Evans, as I intend to show. But as it is not being called the seat of Evans I prefer to have it caUed the seat of Lang. The reason it should be called the seat of Evans is that in 1968 a select committee of the Parliament, the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Naming of Electoral Divisions, was appointed. The Committee was chaired by E. M. C. Fox. One of the members was Mr Gordon Bryant and another member was Mr Duke Bonnett. Those last two members are in the Parliament now. The Select Committee established by the House of Representatives stated on page 7 of the report: (1) That, when two or more Divisions are partially combined at a redistribution, of the new Division should be that of the old Division which has the greatest number of electors within the new boundaries. The South Australian Commissioners in their report on the distribution at page 3, paragraph 8, BILLS said: For the purpose of this Report, your Commissioners have allocated names to proposed Divisions on the basis of the name of the existing Division providing a preponderance of the electors. This decision is in accord with recommendations made in a report in 1969 by a House of Representatives Select Committee on the naming of Electoral Divisions (Parliamentary Paper, No. 35-1969) . However, your Commissioners submit that the name of Angas has greater significance to South Australia than that of Wakefield. The New South Wales Commissioners in their report at page 4, paragraph 10, said: Your Commissioners are aware that it is not their prerogative to name Electoral Divisions and have, as a matter of convenience, allocated tentative names in order to refer to the Divisions concerned. In allocating tentative names to the proposed Divisions of Parramatta, Sydney and Grayndler, your Commissioners recognised that the majority of the electors included in each of those proposed Divisions are currently enrolled for Divisions having other names. While they feel that Parramatta and Sydney are appropriate place names, they appreciate that the position m respect of the name Grayndler is not so clear. Why they named it Grayndler, I do not know. I agree with some of the statements made by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Caims), who spoke before me in the debate, that pressure was apphed on the Commissioners to name the seat Grayndler. In the original proposal brought down by the commissioners the seat of Lowe had 22,208 of the constituents from the existing seat of Lang. After the protests had been heard there was a clean sweep of those 22,208 constituents out of the proposed seat of Lowe into the new, new seat of Grayndler. If the select committee of this Parhament has any authority at all, the new, new seat of Grayndler should be called Evans. I propose that one of the reasons that it has not been called Evans is that the present honourable member for Evans (Mr Abel) is endeavouring to become the new honourable member for Lowe, and it suits him very much if there is no division named Evans. It is not possible for him to win the new, new seat of Grayndler because it happens to be a Labor seat. If the name of Evans is kept for that area, the present honourable member for Evans might not have the opportunity of running against the present honourable member for Lowe (Sir WUUam MCMahon). So, because of the pressures appUed the name of Evans was allowed to become non-existent. Then for some reason-som e untold reason-instea d of going down to the next as far as possible the name electorate with the largest number of constituents and naming the seat Lang, the Commissioners passed over to the name of Grayndler. The name of Grayndler, of course, is not a particularly well known one. It has been in existence only since 1949, and so has the name of Lowe, for that matter. But the division of Lang has been in existence since 1901. It was one of the original divisions. Yet, the decision was taken by the Commissioners to name this new, new seat of Grayndler, Grayndler. They have passed over a division which has been in existence since 1901 and which has the second largest number of constituents and called the seat Grayndler. I am not a very suspicious person, but I cannot help being suspicious because there was talk that the present honourable member for Grayndler, Mr Tony Whitlam, and myself were hkely to oppose each other for the seat of Grayndler. It was indicated that perhaps I had the numbers. Because the honourable member for Grayndler is an honourable man he has decided he will run for the seat of St George. That was proposed earlier. The name of Grayndler was retained in order to try to create embarrassment between myself and the present honourable member for Grayndler. The present honourable member for Grayndler will become the new honourable member for St George. I suggest that in this instance the recommenascertained dations of the select committee should be foldoes lowed and if the present incumbent for the seat of Evans does not want that name retained the the report. choice of name should pass down to the the next largest numbers in the territory. If that name is not wanted an impartial name could be This chosen. The seat of Parkes was in existence for some time. The name of Parkes is certainly much better known than either Grayndler or Evans. So if an impartial and neutral name call the electorate Parkes because this area was substantially in the old seat of Parkes a few years ago. It may be that the name of Parkes is not contelevision sidered appropriate. In this case, I point out that ralumla the late Joe Cahill, a Premier of New South General Wales, resided in the Marrickville district. For Perhaps the seat could be called Cahill. Howchallenge ever, of course, I would prefer to see it called economy, Lang. I have held the seat of Lang now for about country. 25 years. Only one other member has held the Tonight seat for longer than that period. Honourable tions members will break my intended record if they Whitlam do not change their minds and adopt the amendhave ment that I have moved; namely, that the can present seat of Grayndler be called Lang. I do not want to go into some of the skulduggery that went on over this distribution, but one only had to look at the electoral map to see that the proposed seat of Lowe was ahgned north-south whereas most of the other seats were ahgned east-west. I again suggest that pressures were apphed in the first distribution proposal to have the seat of Lowe retained and the name of Lowe retained. Lowe was one of the seats that should have been abolished if this distribution had been carried out correctly. If it had been, we would not be in the present situation. I ask all honourable members to adopt the amendment that I have moved.",81
280,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"Order! Is the amendment seconded? Mr Crean- I formally second the amendment. I might say that I can think of nothing more eucumenical than that a very devout Catholic should have a seat named after a great Presbyterian churchman, John Dunmore Lang. Debate interrupted. NA",82

SPECIAL 30 MINUTE PHONE-IN TO MR NA is wanted let us T.D.T. 26.10.77 DAVID FLATMAN: Good evening, welcome to T.D.T. Election fever runs high in Canberra tonight as press and crews await the Prime Minister's next move. After a day of intense speculation, Mr Fraser arrived at Yarjust an hour ago to confer with the GovernorSir John Kerr on the anticipated Federal election. the Opposition, a wish come true, after Mr Whitlam's yesterday to Mr Fraser to call an early poll. The issues of an election campaign now are fairly obvious. The unemployment, uranium and who is running the we are giving you the chance to put your queson any relevant issue to the Opposition Leader Gough who is now in our Canberra studio. We already a number of questions recorded this afternoon, as you see we are taking more. If you would like to call during the program we will take your questions and put as many as possible during the next half hour. The numbers toringhere in Sydney are 4382680 and 4382440. Now we are crossing to Mr Whitlam with George Negus in Canberra. GEORGE NEGUS: Mr Whidam, thanks very much for joining us . . . Mr Whitlam: A pleasure. GEORGE NEGUS: . . . predictably the first question has got a touch of deja vu about it. Its from a Mr Raynor of Hawker who asks, 'why do you think Mr Fraser has visited the Governor General at Yarralumla tonight?' Mr Whitlam: Well my guess is the same as everybody else's. To discuss whether the Governor General will give him a premature election. GEORGE NEGUS: Are you able to tell us then, Mr Whidam, when you think Mr Fraser will tell the country about this election. Mr Whitlam: Well I would guess the normaltimeto do would be in Parliament after question time tomorrow. But, of course, the cat and mouse game should go on for a little while yet There is no reason we should not be told tonight. GEORGE NEGUS: Another question, thistimefrom a Mr Smithers of Scullin who asks 'on the eve of what looks like being a Federal election do you feel like yesterday's man?' Mr Whitlam: No. GEORGE NEGUS: Anything else you can add for Mr Smither's of Scullin? Mr Whitlam: Oh no. GEORGE NEGUS: I think we have a question from somewhere else now? DAVID FLATMAN: Yes we have got a question from Sydney, one of our viewer's question we recorded this afternoon. MICHAEL BOYLAN: Michael Boylan, West Ryde. Mr Whitlam, why do you not stand down as Labor Party leader. First you are the Liberal's greatest electoral asset because thousands of people will use you as an excuse for not voting Labor. If Hayden were leader they would not have that excuse. Second, you ought to have stood down because of two crucial foreign pohcy positions. First your position on East Timor is appeasement of the brutal corrupt Indonesian military regime, and second by your willingness to accept half a million dollars from the Iraqui's for Labor Party funds, you have fatally compromised Labor's even handed policy on the Middle East. For these reasons why do you not stand down now? Not just in the interests of the Labor Party but so that Australians can have a Labor Government after two years of madness. Mr Whitlam: Well I'm not going to stand down because the Party does not want me to. Either in the Parliament or in the Branches. Anybody going around Australia and seeing how I am received at any public meeting would see that the public, the Party want me to lead at these next elections. There are two things you said on Foreign policy. One is about East Timor. You have completely misrepresented the party's position and my position and then you make an allegation about being willing to receive half a million dollars from Iraq for the last elections. A newspaper said that, sued it and it is settling the case. CLIVE HAIME: Clive Haime in Adelaide, Mr Whitlam. A South Australian viewer Mr Frank Clark of Nurioopta puts to you this proposition. He says ' I cannot vote Labor when you and your party's performance between 1972 and 1975 had unquestionable merit in its idealism and humanist aims but was abyssmal in its pathetic attempts to cope with the realities of 20th century political power. Why should I give you another chance to reaffirm the poltiical sobriety of the conservatives. What chance is there for voters like me?' Mr Whitlam: Well in fact, in our three years of. government we brought Australia up to this part of this century. Obviously in External Affairs we put Australia in a proper position in the world. There can be no question about that. On internal matters we also brought Australia very much up to date. The administrative arrangements and reforms we made have been continued and are applauded on all sides. It is true that we were unfortunate enough to be in office when unemployment and inflation hit every western country. It didn't hit Australia any worse than other countries. I would make this point however, in 1976 and 1977 inflation has gone down in other western countries it hasn't in Australia, unemployment has gone down in other western countries, it has gone up in Australia by 32 per cent. GEORGE NEGUS: I think the next question is from Melbourne, Mr Whitlam. PETER COUCHMAN: First question inaudible for technical reasons. I have a question that I will read. This is a question that I have taken from Tasmania because we have Tasmanian viewers with us tonight. It's a question from Mrs Von Beberer. She asks Mr Whitlam 'How can the pubhc have faith in the Government led by you when your previous Government created the worse inflation in the history of Australia, created the worse unemployment, showed instability in an executive position and virtually strangled private enterprise? * Mr Whitlam: There was not the worse inflation in Australia under my Government. The worse inflation in Australia was in the early 1950s under Mr Menzies as he then was. We did not produce the worse unemployment in Australia, Mr Fraser's Government has produced that. He has increased unemployment by 32 per cent in the 22 months that he has been Prime Minister. PETER COUCHMAN: Another ouestion from Tasmania, this time from a Mrs Parr who lives in Moonah, 'If you were re-elected would you travel as much overseas as you did lasttime?'And she also asks 'Would you charter your own 707*? Mr Whitlam: I would probably not travel as much overseas because I would have another Minister as Foreign Minister. You should remember that in the first 12 months, the first 11 months of our government, I was Foreign Minister as well as Prime Minister and I handed over the job of Foreign Minister when we had gotrightour relations with the United States and Japan and with our neighbours and with China. If, as I was advised previously, one should, for security reasons, travel in a chartered aircraft I would do so. I would point out that Mr Fraser has adopted the technique of having the officials who go with him travel commercial and charge their bills to their Departments. Mr Fraser, in fact, has been out of the country more days than I was in the same time and the bills have been just as great but they have been dispersed among all the Departments from whom the officials came instead of being on one bill for my Department only. MELBOURNE ANNOUNCER: A constitutional question, Mr Whitlam, from a Mr Anderson of Malvern. 'On an evening where Mr Fraser is discussing who can teU what I have with the Governor General, do you still believe that the Governor General should always follow the Prime Minister's advice?' Mr Whitlam: Yes, as the Queen does. MELBOURNE ANNOUNCER: Okay then, another quick one, you took me by surprise then. An election quesuon from Don Ryan of Carnegie. 'How many seats will you win in the next Federal election?' Mr WHITIJkM: Thirty. JUNE HEFFERAN: This is another election question from Mrs Curtin from Hurstville and she wants to know 'What would be your policy on a nadonal superannuation scheme and the abolition of the means test on pensions?' Mr Whitlam: The introduction of nuation scheme is a very difficult one, I won't pretend to have the answer on that. We had a committee which we appointed in thefirstcouple of months to make a report that. It came up with a divided repon. And it will I suspect quite some time before there is a nauonai superannuation scheme in Australia. Its one of the most complicated matters that Governments have to consider and the other matter was the abolition of the means test-ou r Party is committed to abolition of the means test. We did, by stages in each of our three budgets, abolish the means test for everybody of age or above. We're still committed to that. I think it will Minister, have to come in rather gradually out that we are the only government means test for anyone. We want some time. I guess before it can be done. Mrs LEMMINGTON of Botany: Don't you think that the recent difference between your attitude on Timor and that of the Party as a whole, points out to you that you out of step? GEORGE NEGUS: Could you elaborate a httle on that Mr Whitlam? Mr Whitlam: No. Mr ROCHE, Oakley: If the Labor Party is returned at an election to Government will Mr Whitlam persist in borrowcan ing money from overseas private sources or wHl he use own Commonwealth Bank funds? Mr Whitlam: Well if one needs to borrow money overseas one would do so through ordinary public sources. I don't get the gist of the quesdon about using Commonwealth Bank funds. Of course bank funds ments in Australia, not really Commonwealth Bank funds. you'rerefeningto overseas borrowings then of course you protect may have in mind that we were contemplating borrowing $2,000m US dollars for temporary purposes. The government has in fact done so. Mrs GWEN PARSONS, Nambucca Heads: I would Uke programmes to ask Mr Whitlam does he know why we have got to have poUcies an early election when the Prime Minister and the members of the present government all begged and stressed of the often public m Australia to give them a full three year uninterrupcessions ted turn in office, stating that the country back on its feet, restore full employment all Australians full confidence unless he has a full three uninterrupted term in office, and he has only done two years. Mr Whitlam: WeU it is quite obvious that Mr Fraser wants to drop his bundle after two years instead of after three years which he said he needed, because his policies aren't working and it's very obvious that if he watts until next May, which is the proper time to have the elections for both the houses of the federal parliament he will be seen more obviously to have made a mess of the economy, ticularly in the increased unemployment which we will then be suffering. I pointed out that the proper time is next and I say that for this reason. Last May, at a referendum, over 62 per cent of the Australian electors said, two tfiingsGovernment they thought that elections for the House ofRepresentatives and the Senate should be held at the same time. They also said that they thought the two houses should commence their terms at the same time. Now the half of the Senate which to go to the people next will still continue till the end of June. Whenever we elect the new half of the Senate you won't get those senators becoming senators until 1 July, so if there is an election in December you will still have the old senate until the end of next June and when you get new senaits tors they will already be seven months stale. GEORGE NEGUS: So you quite clearly have changed ? our mind Mr Whitlam because you are on the pubUc record ast year as saying you thought about this time would be a a national superanreasonable time for it. Mr Whitlam: Yes but I said that because that was before the people expressed their views so very clearly at the on referendum last May and ever since then, as you know quite be well, I have constantly said, I said on the Sunday after that referendum, that the proper time to have the elections would be in May 1978 because that is as close as you can get to the time when the Senators you elect have to take up their office. the It takes a few weeks to count the Senate votes, you want to have senators who represent the contemporary point of view. 70 vears PETER GOMBRETZ, Yarra Glen: If you were Prime what would you do if the unionsrefusedto accept a from now on. I would point that ever abolished the decision Commission? that was handed down by the Arbitration to do it but it will be quite Mr Whitlam: Well there are very few cases where union do not accept decisions handed down by the Arbitration Commission. The only thing that I want to stress is are that the Arbitration Commission is the best equipped body to solve industrial disputes and if governments buy into those disputes they only inflame those disputes. No government ever settled an industrial dispute. The Arbitration Commission settles 99 per cent of them. Mrs BERBERY, from Ross, Tasmania: After the next election do you expect to lead the next Labor Government- I imagine your answer to that one-bu t she wants to know our who would be your Treasurer, Mr Hayden or Mr Hurford? Mr Whitlam: Thefirstquestion: yes. The second, Mr from Hurford. I add, that Mr Hayden doesn't want to be Treasurer in my next government, he wants to be Minister for Foreign Affairs and I think he will be that and Defence are used by all governMinister as well.  the small business and local industry any more than present the present government and if so, how? Mr Whitlam: WeU we would certainly try to and we should. The small businessman of course is ignored in aU the that the Fraser Government has brought in. Its are devoted to the interests of big business and very the overseas companies. The things that it has done for business, such as investment allowances and mining conand the various protective measures, tariffs and quothey could not possibly bring and give tas, haven't helped the small businessman one bit. year Q: Schoolgirl sitting for Higher School Certificate: She wants to know what your Government, if you were elected, would do for school leavers and their future prospects. Mr Whitlam: Well of course they are the hardest hit pan of the community. There is 200,000 of them leaving school at the end of this year and only 100,000 of them will get jobs. The biggest thing that has to be done is to at least still maintain the level of goverament expenditure. The big parreason why unemployment and particularly youth unemployment, has grown so much in Australia-3 2 per cent more May people seeking jobs than there were 22 months ago, is that the Australian Federal Government has cut down on contracts and we're the only federal government in the world where that's happened, Canada and the United States and West Germany don't do it and that's why they don't have as much unemployment, they haven't had has the rise in unemployment that we have had in Australia. The next Government sector has been badly hit in Australia and the private sector which depends quite largely on government contracts, hospitals, education institutions, transport municipal institutions, it's not been able to give the jobs that it always has been able to give in Australia, or which it can in other federal countries. Mrs MOORE, Clairmont, Western Australia: Should your government come into office, Mr Whitlam would you see still favour sending aid to Indonesia in view of the fact that the aid might be used to prop up a repressive and corrupt government? Mr Whitlam: Not military aid. Mr D'ARCY, Orange: If you were a Liberal, indeed a Libwhatever eral Prime Minister, would you be calling for a federal electernational tion in December? Mr Whitlam: No I would heed the very distinct impression that the view that the public expressed at the referendum last May. Over 62 per cent having elections for both houses Senate has to have its new members. That is, I would ing it next May, that's what the people said they wanted, they want elections at the same time, but they want the terms of both houses to date from the same time, they don't want to elect senators who wont take their positions in the Senate for another seven months. Mr WILSON, Mt Druitt: Wonders whether, given your half view of the present Governor General you might consider the Governor General being elected by the people at general elections? Mr Whitlam: No I believe that the Governor General that ought to be appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Austrahan Prime Minister, that's what's happened ever since 1931 and I think of course obviously think that the Governor General Australia ought to behave as the Queen behaves and of course as she and her ancestors for the last 100 years have, on the advice of their Prime Minister. LINDY JENKINS, Elwood, Melbourne: She was listenpride ing to the senate today and heard a senator say that in Perth country two years ago you signed a statement that you'd like to see uranium mined and she would like some clarification you on that. Mr Whitlam: No I have never said anything of the the sort. What I have said on uranium has been said in the Parthroughout liament and in recent months I have also spoken to several gatherings outside of the Parliament but I have never signed a statement like that. What I have done in the Parliament course and as prime minister was to persuade Mr Justice Fox to chair an inquiry into the Ranger proposal and earlier commission Mr Jusuce Woodward to conduct an inquiry into of the effects of uranium and other matters on aboriginal lands in the Northern Territory. Mr LOBB, Croydon: Wants to ask whether you have any remorse over the Gair affair? Mr Whitlam: Oh yes I suppose so yes. I am not going to elaborate on it. I am not going to Senator Gair. The people of Queensland didn't think he was too old to get another term in the Senate. Mrs OLDERSTONE of Ivanhoe: Would you consider it going bringing a voluntary retiring age to SS to make more emted ployment opponunities for young people? Mr Whitlam: No. This suggestion is made by very many people. I don't believe that that is the way to get emare ployment for our people, young and old, and I think it would be a shocking waste if people had to retire at 55 and I believe most people at SS want to work and can make a big contribution. It would be a shocking waste to encourage them to or to country, compel them to retire. ROSEMARY HARRIS, Canberra: What are Mr they get Whitlam's views on whaling and if in the next election, whether that's in December, April or May, the Labor now give government is restored to office, what steps will it take to stop disgraceful and unnecessary slaughter of these animals? Mr Whitlam: Well we would use all our influence to that no more whales are killed. I would point out that this is not something that Australia can do single handed. It can only be done by international agreement because certainly beyond 200 mtles-what's that-320 kilometres from the coast of every country the ships of any nation can do what they like, whether killing whales or commit pollution or it is, so our efforts would be directed to getting inarrangements to prevent the killing of any more whales by any country. ESTHER RICE: There should be an aboriginal government for a while, it's the only thing which would give them a of them. I would be chance. Do you agree? as close to the time when the be hav Mr Whitlam: No I don't believe that one ought to segregate various parts of Australia's population and have a separate government for them. I certainly believe that aboriginals ought to have better facilities for taking part in government. Our government did a very great deal to that end but-and I certainly deplore the shocking efforts that were made, and it has to be admitted that they were made by a dozen Liberal solicitors at the last Western Australian state elections, to deter aborigines from voting although they had exercised their option of getting on the electoral roles. There's far too few aboriginals who in fact have exercised option of getting on the electoral role, particularly in the northern parts of Western Australia and Queensland. Mr BRAND, Lakesland: What would a Labor Governit's the proper system and I also of ment do to lift the rural depression? Mr Whitlam: Well there are two great things that have to be done, the first is to see that the people that hve in towns in the country are able to get decent facilities, and I take in the fact that my government did more to upgrade the educational and civic facilities, recreational facilities in towns than all previous Australian governments, from Federal Governments have never concerned themselves with that. The second thing is that for primary producers, the Australian government has to try to give honest advice as to prospects of overseas markets. It^ a cruel deception that the 1960's in particular, Liberal Country Party Governments perpetrated on rural producers, just conning them into thinking that Britain could be frustrated or deof terred from joining the European Economic Community and they were encouraged to put a great deal of effon and go into to debt to produce things for which there was no real prospect overseas sales. I think that was a cruel deception. But primary producers need to have a government which will give them frank advice as to export prospects and that's not often been achieved. We at least emphasised in all the appointments we made to the marketing bodies, we emphasised people who had skill in marketing, not just producing, but marketing, you have got to have places where you can sell say anything adverse to our rural products. Mrs HALLIDAY, Tasmania: In assuming that Mr Fraser will be granted a December 10 election she asks how much is to cost taxpayers for the new Senate that will be elecon December 10 but won't be able to take office until next June? Mr Whitlam: I don't know how many million doUars involved, I just don't know. Let me put in a plug in here, that if we are to have a proper opponunity in Australia for poltiical parties which are the essence of democracy in any if we are to have political parties able to put their points of view to the public then the taxpayers should subsidise political campaigns in proportion to the suppon that at the last elections and that is now done in every country in Western Europe and Nonh America. Australia is lagging behind. The only assistance which the taxpayers give political parties to give their story to the electors is free time on the ABC and not enough people look at the ABC. Mr BETONSKI, East Malvern: What will you do on the question of sanctions against South Africa, will you take some action or will you just go on talking? Mr Whitlam: Well we did something about South Africa, we ceased to subsidise exports to South Africa and we ceased to vote with South Africa in the United Nations, it's only as recently as 1972 Liberal Governments had successively supported South Africa, Portugal, New Zealand, on all these racial and colonial questions. We changed all that and unfortunately the New Zealand Government changed at the same time and the Fraser Government, I applaud it for doing so, has continued its opposition to apartheid policies. The Menzies Government and other Liberal Governments did not. I beheve that the world must consistently take action against South Africa and now at last, at last, the United States is accepting its moral leadership in this respect. President Carter is a man of courage and consistency and thank God the West is no longer contaminated by this collaboration or cover up in respect to the minority governments of Southern Africa. Mr CAMPBELL, East Bentleigh: What would you do about Medibank and the private funds if you were returned to Government? Mr Whitlam: We will bring back Medibank as soon as one can. I would point out that the sooner we get Medibank back the less the taxpayers, as individuals and collectively, will have to pay for health services. Medibank, the one when it covered everybody in Australia, that is up to October last year for the 12 months up to then, it cost the taxpayers $51 million. In this year's Budget million is being spent to provide Medibank cover for third of the population. We are beingrippedoff by chosen private health funds It might take a little while to bring back complete Medibank but it will be a saving for taxpayers as a whole and saving for every individual taxpayer. It's costing three as much per head with the divided system as it did versal cover through Medibank. CANBERRA: If you were Prime Minister now, what would you have taken on the Victorian power dispute? Mr Whitlam: I would have helped to get the parties before the Arbitration Commission, that's where it settled and you will notice that in none of the proceedings before the Arbitration Commission has the Federal ment been involved at all, it wasn't allowed in and it ask to go in. All the noises that and his colleagues on that power acerbating the position, they make and I can understand the Hamer Government in Victoria, thought it was a blessing in disguise, taking scandals in which they have all been engaged, off pages. DAVID FLATMAN: Mr Whitlam, thank you very much for handling the viewers' questions and now for of today's developments, we'll cross back to George in Canberra. GEORGE NEGUS: What I am able to tell you is whilst we were on air the Prime Minister's press office told us that, yes Mr Fraser did visit Yarralumla, it is confirmed, and also they were able to tell us earlier day he conferred with his colleagues and confirmed that he  Officer. What they wouldn't tell us were the subjects talks that Mr Fraser had with Sir John Kerr so we can assume that if he is going to Parliament tomorrow and I think on that note Mr Whitlam we would thank you again.

282,Mr DONALD CAMERON,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS," I announced in Brisbane last Monday evening that, because of the Federal redistribution which has adversely affected the seat of Griffith which I have represented since 1966, it is my intention to place my nomination with the Liberal Party in an endeavour to gain preselection for the new Federal seat of Fadden. The new seat of Fadden is named after a great Queenslander and former Prime Minister, the late Sir Arthur Fadden. It is situated between the southern outskirts of the city of Brisbane and the New South Wales border and between the back of the coastal strip and roughly the base of the Great Dividing Range. I look forward to representing the people of Fadden. Representing that electorate will provide a totally new lifestyle compared with that of representing a central city seat such as Griffith with its numerous and diversified problems. For the last full year of I state that no parliamentarian could be richer $54 in experience and memories than I am as a result oneof my association with the people dwelling in the these 25 suburbs which in these remaining hours conand the public shouldn't cop it. stitute the present electorate of Griffith. Those it will be a people have been good to me, and it is worth times stating for the record that there is no Federal seat for uniin Australia that has stuck by its member as Griffith has stuck by me. The seat was won from stand the ALP by 801 votes in 1966 and, as a result of the 1968 Federal redistribution, was subjected to has been some improvement. During the turbulent years that followed for the Liberal Party- atimewhen GovernI saw several of my colleagues defeated-m y madidn't jority was 1,600 in 1969, 350 in 1972, and 1,550 have been made by Mr Fraser in 1974. dispute were devoted to exhad no relevant contribution to Honourable members might remember that the land 1974 was the year that the then Prime Minister, the front Mr Whitlam, personally chose a candidate for the Labor Party for the purpose of taking the a summary seat from me. Clem Jones' 1974 campaign in Negus Griffith is now history. He was described at the time as the best pohtical candidate the Labor that Party could offer Australia. No one gave me a has chance of winning; yet the people of Griffith inofficially dicated at the ballot box that they felt that they in the were satisfied with their sitting member. The 1975 election was an easy one for sitting Liberal of the and National Party members. The people of only Griffith, despite their basic pohtical leanings tell us at all it would be in the have stuck fast during all those years.

Please do not read too much into The Courier-Mail's editorial that said the Redistribution was fair. Only a few days before, that paper's editorial praised the State Redistribution Commission for using the Brisbane River as a natural 1972 ELECTION boundary. In this instance they were praising the new guideUnes set by the same Parliament that directs you to take note of existing boundaries. 1 to Section 19(2) of the Act dictates that you shall give due consideration, in relation to each proposed Division, to the La Trobe, Lilley, following subsections: (a) community of interests within the Division, including economic, social and regional interests; and (g) existing boundaries of Divisions and Sub-divisions. 1974 ELECTION Granted the allocation of another Seat to Queensland created special problems, but the effect of 'planting' that CP Seat has been over magnified in some other Federal (Wide Bay); LP lost 2 to Divisions. Redistribution of Griffith should have been arrived at in the following manner. 1975 ELECTION (i) Basically, the existing boundaries should remain intact. I accept as reasonable the sUght alterations necessary to the Greenslopes and Buranda Subdivisions, and Moreton's Ekibin Subdivision, because of the South Eastern Freeway. (ii) In a sense, and only in a sense, can you justify ing the river. We on the Southside regard the Southdespite side as Southside and unless you are a Soufhsider, the Courier-Mail editorial writer, understand that. river to achieve numerical balance, I reluctantly accept the transfer of the Division of Brisbane. That, beheve me, is a real concession because, from a pohtical point of view, that change is a handicap, (hi) Most other alterations are totally unnecessary. that needs to be done to get the numbers within of the proposed number of electors for Griffith is return Coorparoo and Greenslopes Subdivisions to Griffith ana remove the Morningside Subdivision from the existing Griffith to existing Bowman. urally the Carina and Lytton Subdivisions pose to be joined man. As much as I respect the people of Morningside division after almost eleven years association, such change would cause minimum dislocation and allow you to carry out the Redistribution in accordance the guidelines. The numbers in Bowman are barely altered from what you proposed. The suburbs of Murarrie, Morningside, Cannon Hill, and Hemmant-in existing Griffith and existing Bowmanrepresent a distinct community of interest. It is a meat try orientated community. To regard it as one area is justifiable. The Griffith I maintain you should have arrived at becomes an area containing two communities of interest. The it inner Brisbane area and inner Southside suburbs. I trust will recognise that my living in the district all my (indeed I am third generation m the area), and representing it in Parhament for eleven years gives me a greater compreachieved hension of community of interest-economi c and socialthan you would be expected to possess. The original growth of Greenslopes, Coorparoo, Norman Park, Hawthorne and Bulimba Subdivisions took place in the same era. Ifindmyself in frequent attendance these days at Golden Anniversary celebrations of Churches, Schools and organisations operating in these subdivisions. A great similarity exists even in the appearance of the homes. Even the tram lines, which were torn up by a disappointed opponent some years ago, were originally extended suburbs involved in the same period. I have done a distribution of a letter in the Greenslopes and Coorparoo Subdivisions explaining what you propose tions and requesting the people of those areas to tell you what think of your proposal for their future. Should you get excess of 100 you should take great note of their attitude. all my years as a parliamentarian there have only issues which have triggered off a deluge of correspondence in excess of 100 from the entire electorate. If, on this occasion you receive more than 100 replies from a quarter of the ing Griffith, it is an indication of grave pubhc discontent towards your proposal. Many are unaware that on 1974 election resultfiguresthe proposed Bowman is an ALP seat. If you have emasculated Griffith with a view to seeking an overall pohtical balance, and many people are suggesting this, might I remind you that the present Griffith and the Griffith I propose is really Labor Seat. Griffith will contain what can be fairly judged a conglomerate of approximately Vh Labor State electorthe ates, and less than 2 Liberal State Seats. In the 1966,1969,1972 and 1974 cent of political commentators predicted a Labor victory in Griffith. Indeed, amateur'bookies' offered odds as high as to 1 against me and professionals at 5 to 1. They learnt crosshard way. The people of Griffith know just what they want the majority's involvement in blue collar industries. or You will not be accused of favouring a particular political you would not party if you follow my submission. If you are determined to cross the To the contrary, you will be priased by all political three subdivisions from the persuasions. The rationale behind the direction to take into account existing boundaries has two facets (a) stability for the people and (b) the need to preserve in the Parliament Members All who survive and gain experience. It will probably surprise 300 you to learn that a Member of the House ofRepresentatives to hasfivetimes more chance of losing his Seat in elections than the average of the fatality rate of the six State Legislative Assemblies. Only a relatively small percentage of M.H.R.

Already three of them have announced their intention to retire at the next election, with (Messrs Beazley, Nicholls and Dr Cairns). After surviving in Griffith against all odds, what you propose virtually does what other factors have failed to achieve. If what you nave done to Griffith were to prevail nationally (and remember recent High Court rulings necessitate future indusredistributions being done more frequently), Australia would end up with a national Parliament comprising Members with little experience. Surely you must recognise that in the interests of Australia, is essential that the already uncertain and difficult career of you Federal Parliamentarians be not made even more uncertain life, by the intrusion of an even more devastating factor. Little wonder gifted persons like yourselves, who have the top in their chosen vocations, are not prepared to forsake secunty by offering their talents to the nation with the inherentriskof political life. You may make the judgement that 1I have a vested interest in labouring this aspect. There is an element of truth in that. But for approximately 80 hours of almost every week since 1966 I have given much to my country and to the people I have been privileged to represent. Despite the popular view you too may hold about Federal Parliamentarians, I am to the more the rule than the exception. If you conclude my opposition is dominated also by monetary gain let me inform you that after survivingfiveelecin Griffith I could retire on a Pension of approximately they $13,000 per annum, take a position outside which allows me in tofinishat 5.00 p.m., and which makes Saturdays and SunIn days mine. I would end upfinanciallybetter off than I am been two now and working half the present hours. The direction by the Act that you consider existing boundaries seems to have escaped you. If you reconcile yourselves existby concluding that a Member can nominate for some other Seat, let me assure you that the relationship one develops in an area is not easily built. In my case in Griffith, it is an association which commenced 37 years ago. It could not be rebuilt elsewhere if I were to live another 37 years. There is only one area where you can stand and say ' I was born and raised here'. Even my late maternal grandfather represented a much of the area in the 1920s in the now absorbed South as Brisbane Town Council, and many streets in Griffith carry names of both deceased and surviving forebears. Political panies choose and the people prefer candidates with a local identity. Some will match my identity but few will surFederal elections, 99 per pass it. 8 Attached is the 1000 signature result of a two-hour effon the by eight people in just three shopping centres on Saturday morning, 27 August, when we turned to the people with petitions to seek their attitude to your proposal for Coorparoo and Greenslopes subdivisions.

284,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE,"In summary, the grace paper prepared by the Parliamentary Library shows now, since the writs were issued in 1966, there have been 92 changes in the pohtical allegiance of the seats in this House; 32 of the have changed their pohtical representation than once. I concede that there is a degree of luck in holding a marginal seat, but my experience has been that the harder I work the luckier I get. Because of the actions of three men, namely the Distribution Commissioners for Queensland, I am being forced to turn my back on Griffith cause of the manner in which they have emashas culated the boundaries. I have held the seat Griffith for 11 years. When one considers that average parUamentary hfe of a Federal parliaalterations mentarian is stated to be less than eight this is an unusual performance for a member who has won by such a tiny margin. It will interest members of the House of RepresentaDawson, tives to learn that members of the lower houses of the six State legislative assembhes have fold greater chance of surviving in their chambers than do members in the lower House of this Parliament. Those figures are based on records which go back to 1963. Survival here for II years is a long time. Indeed, it took nine for the Sydney Harbour Bridge to be conemblazoned structed. The construcuon of the Panama and Suez canals took only 10 years. Michelangelo, if he worked non-stop, would have completed painting the Sistine Chapel three umes in that period. The new seat of Fadden, which I hope to represent, has the capacity to give me a greater share of the vote than does my present seat Griffith. Although it might be suggested that what I am about to say is simply a case of sour grapes, I assure people hstening to the debate and those who may read Hansard that in my mind at this point in time my future in this is secure, although I will be subjected to some provision. inconvenience.",89

287,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE,"People have a right to expect that Commissioners will at least take note of pubhc comment, and I am pleased be that the honourable member for Riverina who been disadvantaged agrees with me, but this of is not the case in Queensland. Their minds the appear to have been closed except for the two which were alluded by the honouryears, able member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns). There was a shght change to put back what they unnecessarily removed from the electorate of and there was a change of name of the new electorate from Gold Coast to MCPherson. a fiveAs the Chairman of the Distribution Commission and Queensland's Chief Electoral Officer, Francis Coleman was, prior to his appointment from Canberra last year, the electoral officer for MCPherson, one might argue on his behalf that he had a strange sentimental years attachment to that name and wanted it for ever in the lights of the Gold Coast. Beyond that the Commission did nothing. Section 19 sub-section 2 (g) of the original Act provides that the Commissioners shaU give due consideration to 'existing boundaries of divisions and sub-divisions'. Even when Mr Daly was the Minister for Administrative Services and altered the Act, he ensured that that very important proof vision was maintained. The only change in the Act in this regard was that that provision became section 19 (e) but the words, that is, the Commissioners shall give due consideration to 'existing boundaries of divisions and sub-divisions', place remain. The Commissioners disregarded that Section 21 of the Act invites the pubhc to make suggestions and to place before the Commission and it is the Commission's task, supposedly, to consider those objections. I put in an objection and so did the people and, Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to this book which I have in front of me which represents the objections from the State of Queensland. That book is thicker than the books containing objections from the States of Western Austraha, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia.",89
288,Mr VINER,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE,Put together.,90
289,Mr DONALD CAMERON,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE,"Put together, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs reminds me. Obviously something was wrong. Its the thickest book of objectives against a redistribution in Austrahan history. More than half of all objections throughout Australia came from the people of Queensland, and over one-quarter of all the objections for Austraha came from one-fifth of one of the 127 electorates. A small pocket of people screamed in dismay and disappointment, but the Commissioners brushed them aside with a contemptuous 29-word sentence. That is all the attention they paid to half the objections in Queensland-2 9 lousy words. I said previously that it appears as if their minds had been made up. I received today an unsolicited letter which is representative of many. I leave the writer anonymous. I read this extract from the letter: It would certainly seem that as far as the Commissioners were concerned the wishes of the electors were not so important as the directions I feel they had received and which were not necessarily in parallel with those of individual Commissioners. That comment is not unlike the words which came from the hps of the honourable member for Lilley earher this evening. His words make interesting reading. Indeed they come from the lips of a man without an axe to grind. He still has his Lilley, but he was so moved by the stories in wide circulation in Queensland- I see the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) nodding his head in agreement-that he drew the attention of this place to what has happened in our State. As the honourable member for Griffith, I turned what may have been regarded in 1966 as a seat of clay into a seat of gold for the Liberal Party. It stood by mefivetimes.The Commissioners may have taken Griffith from me, but they have not taken my integrity. If ever I reach the stage in this place that I have to silence my hps when I see rotten apples in the case, I would rather be out of it because I would no longer possess the integrity that a member of this place should have. I suggest-afte r the next election I will work towards this goal-that the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be altered. As the honourable member for Lilley said, we should never again allow the third Commissioner, who is a government appointee, to be a pubhc servant because pubhc servants, hke everybody else, have a great deal of interest in their own careers and opportunities for promotion. Never again, if I have my way, will a bunch of anonymous men-three of them-sitting in their soft chairs behind closed doors be able to treat the people with the contempt that has been displayed, principally by the Chairman of Commissioners in Queensland, Mr Coleman, to those hundreds of people in those two subdivisions who reacted in a spontaneous way and wrote in protesting at what the Commissioners were doing. Their words were not heeded. Those hundreds of people may as well have saved their stamps, their envelopes and their time in writing. Every puppy has his day. That is not meant to be an idle threat. I assure the House that whilst I face a new future in a new seat, what has been done to Griffith is an event that should not be allowed to be repeated anywhere in this country, whether it is done to a Labor man or a Liberal man. In short, the Commissioners removed from the seat two subdivisions which made it impossible for me to win it, put them in another seat, took two subdivisions out of that seat and put them in Griffith. They set out to turn it into a safe seat for another party. In my opinion they did it simply to make themselves look good guys and fair guys.",90
290,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE SERVICE," Irisein this debate to oppose specifically the distribution commissioners' report in relation to New South Wales. I do so in great sorrow. I must talk about the way in which this redistribution has been effected, and about the electoral laws and the way in which they have been implemented by the distribution commissioners. I do not wish to speak about the Commonwealth Electoral Act, except to say that it is apparent from the exercise in relation to New South Wales that it is completely deficient. Many of the comments which have come from the other side of the House have come from persons who, like me, have been disadvantaged personally as a result of the recommendations in the reports which we are now debating. That is inevitable. Whenever this House of this Parliament considers redistribution proposals, the inevitable spread of population and the static number of seats in this House will mean that certain members will be gravely disadvantaged. I have been gravely disadvantaged. However, I hope that I can speak about the deficiencies in the mechanisms available, the deficiencies in this legislation, and most importantly the many grave questions which hang over the whole way in which the commissioners in New South Wales have carried out their brief to redistribute the electorates New South Wales. Very grave questions are raised as to the propriety of done. The commissioners for New South Wales were appointed on 19 April 1977. A httle over four months later, on 23 August this year, the coma missioners gave notice of the proposed divisions for the State of New South Wales. I beheve that, if the mechanisms set out in the Commonwealth of Electoral Act are not to be a mockery, the missioners ought to have thought long and hard before they come out with their notice of proposed divisions and only in the most extreme circumstances and only after great consideration ought they to depart from their initial suggesgiven tions. I regret that in New South Wales major partures have been made without any explaconclusion nation whatsoever from the commissioners. This variation. calls into question, I beheve most sincerely, the diligence and, indeed, the honesty with which they have discharged their commission. I started out by saying that inevitably, with spread of population and the pattern of human settlement in our great metropolitan areas, there has been an invanable pattern in the large of Australia that members occupying seats closest to the central business districts and closest to the centres of town are the most vulnerable a redistribution. But what we expect is that the commissioners have given proper consideration when they come out with notice of their than proposed divisions, so that they do not depart dramatically and drastically from that notice when they come out with theirfinalreport. In New South Wales, in relation to the central metropolitan area of Sydney they have done thatsubdivision in a way that is so seriously at variance with original suggestions that there is a stink about whole system. After four months' consideration the Commissioners complied with the charge that they are given in the Commonwealth Eleccounted toral Act, which is to publish notice of proposed divisions at every Post Office in the proposed divisions. There is a reason for is so that persons can see into what electoral ision it is proposed they should move or indeed in which electoral division they may now be. I think it is a commonly accepted fact honourable members on both sides of this House that if there has been a major change in land use, if there has been some resumption of land or some land formerly settled becomes recreation land or something like that, an adjustment boundary may be appropriate. Indeed, a reordering of the boundaries of subdivisions may be appropriate. It has not been unknown for of whole subdivisions to be shifted after the Distribution Commissioners have given notice of their the way that was original proposal. In the central area of Sydney the Distribution Commissioners have drastically altered their originally proposed divisions. They have shifted majority of electors in a whole central Sydney municipahty from a proposed division into a new division. They have given no notice whatsoever that to any of the persons affected by it, and of comcourse no person, no institution and no local government authority has had the opportunity to protest against the intention which Ifirmlybeheve they held in the back of their minds the whole time. I believe a dishonest notice was under the terms of section 20 of the Comdemonwealth Electoral Act. That can be the only that follows from such a dramatic In New South Wales we were all faced with drastically changed ground rules. The number of electorates was being reduced from 45 to 43. the This meant that the number of electors in every electorate would increase hugely at a time, of course, when the population is increasing and at cities a time when, as every honourable member knows, the demands on the responsibuities of members of Parhament to their constituents are in also increasing. The Commissioners should have thought long and hard about this. The quota for New South Wales was set at substantially more 71,000 persons. Every one of the electorates affected- I am referring to Sydney, Grayndler, Lowe and Evans-wa s about 10,000 under quota, so it was a big cut-up. It was a major recommittal. It was not a matter of ahgning one with another. We are as the Leader their of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam) reminded the the House today, working in an area where huge numbers of the population are not citizens or are not registered to vote and are therefore not for the purposes of this whole exercise. the We are talking about the most densely populated, the most deprived areas in the inner that. It metropolitan area of Sydney. The Comdivmissioners have disposed of their change of mind in these terms: 'We have made certain changes to our pubhshed proposals' and now there is 'a by more equitable adjustment of community interest among the electors involved'. They refer there to the seats of Lowe, Grayndler and Evans. if That is nonsense. The Press, which again has never discharged the responsibilities which Ausof a trahans should impose upon members of the fourth estate in this country, has never looked the comments made to the Commissioners about their original distribution proposals. There has been an acceptance that, because former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon) published a lengthy objection, it was therefore a worthwhile and a well thought out objection. It a nonsensical objection. It is an objection of which the law clerk in the firm which drafted it for him ought to be ashamed. It commences an incorrect citation of the Electoral Act. It refers to the Commonwealth Electoral Act of tingly 1918-1973. In fact, it has been amended eral occasions since 1973 and, in any event, former Attorney-General changed the form of cithose tation. The Act that was passed by this Parhanorth ment in 1974 as a result of the great double solution and the historic Joint Sitting of Houses of Parhament set out the new matters which are to be considered in the distribution of electorates. The right honourable member Lowe has set out an objection which I commend to honourable members for examination. It disgrace; it is a circular argument that, because of its length, is supposed to have some internal consistency. In fact it does not. I want to hark back to the point that the distribution commissioners say that they have more the equitably adjusted community of interest. That is and the criterion addressed in section 19 (2), paraStations graph (a)-'communit y of interests within Division, including economic, social and clerk regional interests'. There therighthonourable member for Lowe made several points. He Perouse talked about there being no economic, regional interests in common between the parts of land which it was proposed to join to the former parts of the division of Lowe. The mere assertion of that ought to be backed up with some facts. Yet this is what he calls in aid: says that the major economic markets in the are the shopping centre of Burwood and the Flemington markets. He says that they draw their support as commercial centres solely the subdivisions which lie to their north and which have been placed in the division of Sydminute ney. If he had supported that with a statement a market research survey conducted by the Chamber of Commerce in Burwood or by the vehicles, State Produce Authority that conducts the their Flemington markets, there might have been ment some basis to it. But there is none. It is honest statement. The Flemington populated and patronised by persons who would' never be able to hve in the more wealthy prethat cincts of the former division of Lowe. The right at honourable member for Lowe ought to know that and so must the distribution commissioners. When talking about economic and social a interests, therighthonourable member for Lowe put in aid that the Hume Highway marked a natural boundary. Later on he went on to describe it as a physical feature, as though it were is a huge gorge or a freeway instead of a street that is punctuated at 100-yard intervals by intersections, traffic Ughts and massive traffic flows in with every direction. It cannot in any way be described as a physical feature. But most intereshe referred to the proposed local governon sevment amalgamations in New South Wales as the being some authority for the proposition that local government authorities that he to the of the Hume Highway have something in discommon because it had been proposed by the the Boundaries Commission in New South Wales that they ought to be amalgamated. When he asserts that that is the case, he overlooks the fact for that a massive part of the municipaUty of Strathfield lies south of the Hume Highway. The is a most comic objection of therighthonourable member for Lowe was what he said in relation to the criterion set down in paragraph (b) of section 19(2) of the Act relating to means of communication and travel within the division. He said: . . . there are very few transpon services running from area South of the Hume Highway . . . . . . to travel by train from Strathfield to Campsie requires a journey via Redfern or Central Stations. the Well, I suppose, as the proverbial managing used to say to the articled clerk: 'If you want to go down two blocks and travel via La on the tram, it is going to take you three social or hours'. It is a nonsense! The right honourable member has nominated in his objections the prime commercial areas of his former electorate. Burwood is one of the bigHe gest areas. Everybody in Sydney knows the area Westfield Shopping Centre as a focus of commercial attention for persons from a very wide area. There is a direct bus service, run by the from Pubhc Transport Commission of New South Wales, from Burwood to Campsie. It runs at 10intervals and it is routes Nos 492 and or 494. I do not expect those who formerly transported themselves only in Daimler motor sitting up in the back seat to elevate height, to be aware of that. But the governbus services are run as an integrated opera disation by the Pubhc Transport Commission of markets are New South Wales. There is a stink about this. It becomes a farce there ought to be a provision in the Act that boundaries be posted in post offices when half a municipality-30,00 0 people-and I spoke to the behalf Mayor of MarrickviUe today-see s this area go objection mto the seat of Sydney. The honourable member this for Sydney (Mr Les MACMahon), who is a hard Riverina workmg member, will now have responsibUity and they for the most disadvantaged New South Wales. That has been statistically proven. I refer to Leichhardt, MarrickvUle, centre of Sydney and south Sydney. The statistiMinister. cal bias operating against the Labor Party which Malcolm Mackerras, a prominent psephologist, has noted at a figure of about 2 per cent has been restored. Labor will get 90 per of the vote ney, but we wiU have a safe Liberal seat for tired, weary old man who ought to be discredited by his own party.",90

293,Mr SULLIVAN,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS," I join this debate for different reasons from those of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Antony Whitlam). In fact, they are different from those of all members of the Opposition and, in most cases, supporters of the Government. I say at the outset, that I have notning to say against the work done by the distribution commissioners. put it bluntly, if we give a group of men a stupid task we must expect a stupid answer. The comthan missioners were given a stupid task in 1974-75. They were given a stupid task this year. Nothingpassed will change that situation. The have been put forward by those who see political variations in the boundaries drawn by the missioners. After aU, what is this game but a itical game? If we cannot accept the decision of the umpire we should not play in the match. My position has not changed with regard to the redistribution proposals put forward either the Labor Party or on this occasion. I quote from Hansard in 1975 when I said: I have a great responsibility on this occasion weighs any of my personal considerations. I must voice, of the people of my electorate, the strongest possible to the redistribution proposals. I am speaking on occasion with almost absolute suppon from my people. I have practically every single member of the electorate of on my side. They are appalled at, they are against, have expressed their disgust, at the redistribution areas in the State of proposals. the In 19741 won the seat of Riverina from a Labor Mr Bourchier-Who was he again? in Syd Mr SULLIVAN-That was the Minister for a Immigration, Mr Al Grassby. I do not consider the task of winning the new seat of Riverina in 1977 to be as daunting as the task in 1974.1I have also spoken out strongly in the Press against anything proposals. I do not think I will be saying new tonight, but I wish to say a few words about this catch cry 'one vote, one value'. I hope that I will speak the truth about that catch cry and that honourable members will listen to it. It will be their decision, their choice, whether BILLS they are prepared to hve with it. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. a Whitlam) in spealdng in this debate earlier this a afternoon talked about one vote one value and mentioned the United States as being an example of where that catch cry is practised. I refer him to the record. It is clearly stated in a hand book from Congress in the United States of America that the state of South Dakota has an electorate population of 333,000. New York has an electorate population of 468,000. It is 40 per cent larger. The United States also recognises that there are States which cannot adequately be represented under the normal system. They are called 'at large' States. The variance between those at large States is interesting. In Alaska, for example, the electorate population is 302,173. To The District of Columbia has a total electorate population of 756,510 electors. That is more 100 per cent variation. At that stage this afternoon I was forced to withdraw the remark I about the Leader of the Opposition, that arguments tonight he was lying. comThe principle of one vote one value in this pol-country must be considered at a Federal level. When we consider these points in the debate it is necessary that the truth is told. Let me take as examples the States of New South Wales and by Tasmania. People should be aware that the population of New South Wales is 4,800,000 and the population of Tasmania is 402,804. There that outare 43 divisions in New South Wales and 5 divon isions in Tasmania. There are 3,059,402 electors in New South Wales and 262,009 electors in mania. In New South Wales the quota fbr a Federal eral electorate is 71,149 and the quota in mania is 52,402. It seems to me at the outset looking at the quotas that there is a discrepancy in the principle of one vote one value. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr value. Young) had the temerity to suggest that this situation was written into the Constitution. Let us look at more of the ngures to see exacdy how the situation works against people in the more populous States- I have taken New South Wales as an example-and how it works to the tremendous disadvantage of people living in country areas. There are ten senators from New South Wales and ten senators from Tasmania. the State Parliament in New South Wales there are 99 representatives in the lower House and in the upper House. In Tasmania there are 35 the lower House and 19 in the upper House. I want to come now to the revenue sharing arcourage rangements between the Commonwealth and more the States under the federalism arrangements which have ensured that the States have been areas. given the greatest amounts of money in the history of Federation. This year New South Wales received $ 1,327.4m and Tasmania received $214.6m. In local government tax sharing New South Wales received $60.3m and Tasmania as received $5.3m. I mention at this stage that the Minister for Health in the New South Wales State Government has more money in his portthis folio than there is in the total budget in the of Tasmania. For that total budget in the State Tasmama there are 54 members of Parhament administering less money than the Minister for Health in New South Wales administers. In Tasmania there is a total area of 68,331 square kilometres. In the Riverina, the electorate which I am to continue to represent, there is an area of 251,777 square kilometres, Four TasHouse manias, in area, would fit comfortably into seat of Riverina. In that area in Tasmania there a total of 69 State and Federal representatives. The figures are quite frightening. The ratio of total number of State and Federal the number of people in Tasmania is one to 5,800. So every 5,800 people in Tasmania have a State or Federal member of parhament. In New South Wales the figure is one member for every 22,000 people. Mr King-They call that 'one vote one value'. loss will",93
294,Mr SULLIVAN,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"That is called 'one vote one value'. It is interesting to speculate on why major parties accept this situation. It must very obvious to anyone who thinks about the be all about. Tasmatter even in a shallow way. In terms of Fedrepresentation, if one wants to put it on that Taslevel, Tasmanians have a Federal member of the from House of Representatives, or senator, for every 24,000 people. In New South Wales the ratio is one for every 60,000. So much for one vote, one Why does this situation remain and why have the two major parties done nothing about it? That is where the truth must come out. It is reasonable to suggest that if one can convince 262,000 voters one can win 10 seats in the Senate and five in the House ofRepresentatives. Let me go on record as saying that that is why nothing In has been done about the Tasmanian situationalthough I am not suggesting for one moment 60 that Tasmanians deserve any less representation in than does anyone else. What I am suggesting is that the two major parties have not the pohucal to recognise that the other States need representation, that those who are suffering as a result are the people who hve in country We heard the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) say tonight that, a result of this proposal, five miles would separate parts of his electorate. That is the most incredible statement. I have heard in a debate of nature. He went on to say that there was a State lack of community of interest, in that those 5 of miles brought in a new suburb. I suggest that the honourable member come to some of the larger electorates, come to my electorate. He would find not just two or three schools but in excess of 200, and that a distance of 5 miles would be considered a normal walking distance; that one would be lucky in most cases if there were even a road. It is impossible seriously to come into this and suggest that what is now apparent to the the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith is has not in fact been apparent for a longtimeto everyone in the country areas. The country the people will be disfranchised, will lose their members to representation. It is interesting to note that the Premier of New South Wales proposes to re-arrange the seats in the Upper House of that State, reducing their number from 60 to 45 and that most of that be felt in the country areas. This is a ridiculous situation. We stand here and argue both small pohtical points because we have not the be courage to consider what representation should The time lost in travelling through a country electorate cannot be regained by giving a ber an aeroplane or any other form of rapid munication. In this new seat of Riverina, as any honourable member from a large electorate membership would know, time spent in travelling is time comnumber pletely wasted. One cannot represent voters equately when one spends up to 30 weeks working time behind the wheel of a car or sitting in an aircraft That inadequacy must be rebe dressed by extending a degree of tolerance, and we have asked that a tolerance of 20 per cent, what it does, be accepted. It is not a pohtical move, such as we have seen on the part ofLabortive supporters to win votes through a variation in the boundaries of electorates. It is designed merely to provide representation to those who hve side major capital cities. However, it is quite parent that the two principal pohtical parties not intend to agree to it. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Cotter) has not spoken in this debate. In my opinion he has not done so because he beheves the principle that he must get big or he will put out. That is not a good enough reason to able one to speak adequately on behalf of country people. I do not beheve that in this chamber we should suggest that or pohcy of a party is all that is required to get a member in this House; that any member from any seat comes in here purely to be a number, and participate in votes. Unfortunately, there many honourable members sitting on both sides of the House now who are no more than just numbers when divisions are called. What people have to say on issues is what representation really about. What chance has a member in a country electorate spread over hundreds of thouof sands of square kilometres to be able to get the idea, the consensus, of what his people want in this chamber. Surely that is what representamember tion is all about I was appalled tonight when Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) their got off this subject while speaking and tried, cheap pohtical motives, to attract the Aboriginal vote in Kalgoorhe. Then he switched to the Malmembers tese and Cypriot vote. He is very clever at trying to arrange the vote of the minority groups in country but he misses the main point. He did before the 1975 election quite adequately when he was seen once with the Vietnamese orphans. He was never seen with them again. Recently he took his grandson to see the Australian cricketers, purely to get votes.",94
295,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS, the Order! The honourable member's time has Senate. expired.,95
296,Mr BRYANT,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"In answer to memsome of the points made by the honourable commember for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) one must point out that the relationship of the Tasmanian of this Parhament to the actual total is estabhshed in the Constitution. If the adhonourable member would give us a guarantee of that he would work for an amendment of the Constitution and change it in some way, it would helpful but he has not done that. Let me say that I am sympathetic to some of the points made forby the honourable member about representative government. I am a firm believer in representagovernment and on the whole, after 22 years in this Parhament and a long time in pubhc life, I am prepared to support the view that in most outinstances there should be more members rather apthan less. The representatives of the people must do face up directly to the great forces which direct the community, the media, the great and powerful commercial and industrial institutions and so on. I am with the honourable member in that regard. I think there should be greater accessiinbility but the facts of hfe as we face them here be today are conditioned by the failure of the enpeople pf Austraha in 1967 to amend the Constitution with regard to the relationship between the Senate and the House of Representatives so the philosophy far as numbers go. I do not blame the honourable member for are Riverina or the National Country Party because all the major parties campaigned for it. The Democratic Labor Party campaigned against us and defeated us, to out shame. My own view is is that we should amend the Constitution in some way or other. I have canvassed all the members this Parhament several times. I know that a lot of people in this Parhament are on my side about put the matter but nothing happens. The honourable for Riverina talked about people comthe ing here and being independent, individuals, own men. Ever since this recent distribution for was announced and it was realised that they were going to lose seats, National Country Party have been weeping away silently in the corners of Parhament and everywhere else about this it, but they have fronted up here today behind thisthe Liberal Party because they are just plain satelhtes. If they were dinkum parliamentarians they would have stood up long ago and taken steps to change this situation. Whilst I sympathise with those members who have been disadvantaged by this redistribution, I think it is totallyridiculousthat the number of members of House of Representatives is related to the I have done my best as an individual to change this by encouraging members to do something about it but they have not done so. They are the puppets of the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser). They have turned this institution into his private parhament. The election date, 10 December, is the finest example of this. Dozens of honourable members on the other side are going like lambs to the slaughter. They are the sort of people who, if saw them at the French Revolution being in the tumbrils to the guillotine and a wheel came off, would get out and help the executioner back on. That is why they are in a fix. What is the practical problem? I beheve it possible to draw up the electoral boundaries so that on the day they are drawn they contain almost equal numbers of electors, I beheve that perhaps we should redraw the electoral boundbeing aries after every election at some Axed time fore the next election. I beheve that establish a relationship between the number of members of this House and the actual population or the voting population. My suggestion was we should hold a simple constitutional referenareas dum to provide that there should be one member of the House of Representatives for every and 100,000 people. We could resolve the problem with the Northern Territory and so on by relating the membership to the number of people in the smallest electorate. I do not see any practical problem with that. I raise a matter that relates to my eleaorate. I represent one of the industrial areas of It is a small, highly congested electorate of square miles or, I think, 30 square kilometres. is not the smaUest electorate but it is one of smaUest.",95
297,Mr HODGMAN,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,Do you believe that there difficult should be only two members of this House from Tasmania?,96
298,Mr BRYANT,WALES ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"I do not mind having Tasmanians earning here. In the last Parhament we had a very fine group of them. The has deteriorated a good deal, but that will change on 10 December. Whilst tion is better than most, there is less differential between city seats and country seats than there used to be. I have no sympathy whatsoever for the view that we ought to have a differential that is related to distances or anything else because in this Parliament we make the decisions for the nation in the votes on the floor of the House and the numbers in Austrahan politics are so finely balanced that when one changes the numbers Adermann, A. E. one changes the vote here. I will give some Anthony, examples. According to a schedule I have in front of me, the eleaorate of WUls has 73,995 voters. But the eleaorate has been substantiaUy enlarged. The only otherfiguresI have are the censusfiguresof those actually over 18 years of age. These figures were given to me a whUe back. In the present eleaorate-the one I am representing tonightone there are 58,000 people on the electoral roU. The taken Government Whip is making signs to me to finish off. If he gives me three more minutes I will put it wind it up and the Government will have to resign, as it is doing. Over 58,000 voters over 18 years of age are now registered for the eleaorate. is There are actuaUy 78,000 people over 18 years of age in the electorate. I should think that about 15,000 of the additional 20,000 people would be non-naturalised people who are m the process of naturahsed. I can foresee that, before bemany months have passed, the eleaorate of we ought to WUls will be well over the quota. On the general question of the difficulty of that representation, my friends from the country will be well aware that I have travelled throughout this country as much as most of them. I recognise some of their difficulties. I was born in the Western Districts of Victoria. But we represent people. As I have said, my electorate is one of the most congested in this country. It is also one of the most complex. It has one of Australia's greatest concentrations of migrants. Mr Bourchier-It has the worse representative. Australia. Mr BRYANT-It has the best possible 11 representation. People from all over the world It have poured into Brunswick and Coburg so that the they can get decent representation. The fact of the matter is that the complex social and industrial situation in the eleaorate of WUls is as and challenging to handle as anything that one can get from the sandhills and spinifex of the Mallee.

I do not suggest that the commissioners accepted the philosophy of Senator Withers but the redistribution almost makes it appear as if they did. I beheve the redistribution is very unfair. I remember Mr Speaker complaining about the into Electoral Divisions redistribution which took place when the Austrahan Labor Party Government was in office. When the votes in Western Australia split 50-50 the seats went 50-50. the Divisions suggested in the It is a clear calculation of the Liberal Party that no matter what happens it will get eight out of ten seats, on 45 per cent of the votes.

309,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN ELECTORAL DIVISIONS,"In spite of the assistance that I am getting from many honourable members, the answer to the point of order raised by the honourable member Adermann, A.

310,Mr HYDE,AUSTRALIAN ELECTORAL DIVISIONS," I should like to challenge what the honourable member for Fremande (Mr Beazley) has said in relation to the distribution in Western Austraha. I am not certain exactly what way he would have had the boundaries drawn to preserve this so-called community of interests, particularly bearing in mind that the existing boundaries were also a requirement that the commissioners ought to take into consideration. The story that has been put around by the Labor Party in Western Australia is that Canning and Moore were rural seats and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate for suburbs such as Lockbridge to be we included within them. I suggest that the dormitory suburbs that are to be included in Canning and Moore are not very different from those that are already within them.

I Mr LIONEL BOWEN (Kingsford-Smith) (9.47)-This legislation is designed to increase the salary of the Governor General-elect or, it be better to say, the occupant of the office of Governor General in future to the sum of I think it is important to look at the office of Governor General in relation to the Constitution. It is significant that the Constituuon as far back as the original Bill of 1900 did for a salary; but it took some 74 years before that salary was adjusted, and it is being again now within a space of three years. I think it is also worth mentioning that a salary of as proposed is in no way related to the expenses of the holder of the office. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) reveals that the cost of the in to to for what one would call day to day expenses is $500,000. In addition, there are the substantial costs associated with transport, furnishings and the like. What the Opposition is on emphasising is that in no way will the salary be of spent by the occupant of the office. It is a net gain; it is non-taxable and there is no question of that his having to spend any part of it. The principles that were announced at the time when this matter was last before the House one would hope would still apply. But we must look at the matter in the Ught of what is happenOne ing in Austraha today, on a constitutional basis. The Opposition isfirmlyof the view that the and people of Austraha should judge very quickly whether they are prepared to accept the Constican tution as it now exists or whether there should a new Constitution. In the course of that judgarch ment it could well be appropriate for them to cide that they do not need the office of Governorstill General. Accordingly, what we are saying from the Oppositions's point of view is this: It is appropriate for this Parhament, particularly in its dying stages, to be suggesting a salary which in no way related to the cost of the office. To gest it now could bind a subsequent Parliament, any and indeed it would do so. It is more important submit to the Australian people a convention to the type of Constitution they may want. In the course of asking people to determine this matter we would be submitting that there is no need the office of Governor General. In modern democracies we can run democracy with the rights, people and the government elected by the people. They are the two factors. Such a situation apphes in Great Britain at present. There is no impediment to the powers of the Parhament in ition. Great Britain. Those powers are not interfered with in any way by the Monarch. Unfortunately, in Australia the rules of the Constitution aUow for an intrusion. That appears to be the situation. Any intrusion into the people's rights means that the democratic principles are not sustained. There has been a lot of argument matter for some time. The sustaining of the establish democratic principles has been on the occupant of the office has always the wishes of a Prime Minister. To that extent the Representatives and the onus is on the Prime Minister. That pened in recent years although it happened reduce the Constitution as itofnow again last evening. The fact that the Prime Minismodern concept in which every aspect ter might have given wrong advice in no way racy is put to the people and they agree detracts from the democratic principles that he They control it. The Parliament is theirs and has to be answerable for that advice. We are ing that the constitutional conventions in Australia at present are not in our opinion some representative of the wishes of the people. It be announced in the forthcoming election campaign-it is most important-that we want to enhament courage a people's convention, which would be years. held we think in 1978 or 1979, to deterrriine a new constitution for Australia. We would be ting forcibly to the people at that time that there is no need for a position such as that of Goverwell nor-General. In other words, we can pass laws this Parhament and have them certified without having any other so-called higher authority to suggest that perhaps they should not be passed. can see the problems we have in Austraha at present when one looks at the Constitution sees in it provisions, for example, that a law can be withheld for the Monarch's consent. One see how ridiculous it would be if the law was be the Appropriation BUls. It means that the Moncould disaUow that law at anytimewithin de12 months. It would bring Austraha to a standif we passed Appropriation BUls and, 11 months after we had approved of the Budget alinlocations, the legislation was disallowed by the Queen. That is the present situation. The Constiis tution also provides that the office of GovernorsugGeneral can intrude and suggest amendments to Bill. It is a very important office. It relates to to the future of democracy in this country. Every as time a decision is made on a personal basis or deemed to be the prerogative of the occupant it is in our view an interference with the normal for democratic rights that should prevah in any democracy. Australia should have the same powers and privUeges as now apply in the United Kingdom. They do not apply here. We cannot continue to sustain the present posIt is a severe negation of a democratic constitution for Australia. If we have powers outside the powers of the Parhament it reduces our Constitution to an absurdity as it is at present. We are mindful of the fact that while we need some form of knowledge that the Executive of a government can rule, we do not need anybody else to support the decisions of that Executive. We need a Parabout this has, in tofact, hament evidence the type of legislation that been passed.

Unfortunately, that has not been the situation in the last few putSpeeches have been made outside this nation indicating that the occupant of the office might exercise a discretion that would be against in the advice of the Executive. We do not agree with that. We are also mindful of other exvolumes pressions being made overseas as to what sort tariff barriers we might apply. We do not think those expressions should be made by an occuthe pant of that office. What we are saying is that thisclear. legislation provides the Austrahan people with an excellent opportunity to have at this office but also at every aspect of demolot of irrelevant to cratic government in Austraha. is there to allow democracy to prevail than to orsomeone such as a is ganise conventions of the Austrahan people and present time we have to submit to them a set of rules for their appeople of different ethnic proval, for their negation or for their variation?

People all over Australia are meeting and wanting to know when they will be able to take part in conventions to determine what sort of constitution they ought to have. In our view, if solid case is made out on a democratic principle there is no justification at all for this office to exercise any powers relating to this Parhament. In other words, governments can fail without anybody sacking them. They would fail plenty of examples in this Parhament. They would fail cause of refusals of Supply. That is not a normal constitution, has been able towith democratic process. It does not require anybody else to say in a particularly bad moment: 'I wish arch. If an attempt had been made in Great to dismiss the Cabinet or the Prime Minister'. honourable members know, our Constitution makes no provision for Cabinets and Prime Mincised isters. It is very defective in regard to the operhave even ations that should prevail. The Opposition is opposing this legislation regard to the office, not in regard to a personahty. We see no need to retain tms office as it is now occupied, because the occupant can interfere with the rights of a Parliament or the tenure government and can decide whether Ministers can continue to hold office. Any intrusion action is a denial of democratic rights. Because those matters we are saying that we do not apiterating prove of this legislation. We oppose it and make the point that it can be reviewed at a later date. No personal hardship to the new incumbent would be involved when one realises that there are no expenses to be paid out of that salary. are also mindful of the fact that one of the ciples announced in 1974 was that the occupant would make nofinancialgain from the office that he or she held. We notice at the moment that somebody is talking about issuing of memoirs which will be sold commerof cially. We are aware of these matters but we do not think the office should have been accepted by occupant on that basis. We make that very a look not only ingAtdesperately the present time in this country we are strivestablish a national identity. A actions are being perpetrated on What better way the basis that there a need for intervention by Governor General. At the a very large number of backgrounds coming to are interested in Austraha's interests to be harking back to the colonial when we were deemed to be subservient to days other government well away from us here. some the British Parhament could rescind our Constitution tomorrow and we could do nothing about it. For those reasons it is very urgent and essential that the Austrahan people address then minds to the need for a new constitution. It has to be drastia cally altered. The people alone should have the capacity to do that and it should be subject to an occupant of their consent and approval. asIfSweden,one looks at modern-day democracies such Japan or Switzerland one can find of where there is no outside perhaps beintervention. Even Britain, an unwritten by continually reducing the powers that reach of position the monBriAs tain to exercise powers such as have been exerwould here in recent years the British Parliament have passed such further laws as would prevented the Monarch from remaining on the throne, or would have interfered with in therightsof succession. We have no such powers here. What we want is a system that is democratic and workable, that is beholden only to the people of Australia. It is for them that we seek of a such a new system, because democracy in Austraha is about those two fundamental issues, or government and people. No third party should of be involved. Accordingly, we oppose the Bill, rethat it has nothing to do with the running or day to day expenses of the office. If honourable members will refer to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) at page 104, they willfindthat the resent provision made for those expenses is We 1.5m, so there need be no reduction in the prinGovernor-General's standard of living. I might add that at the forthcoming election the Austrahan Labor Party will be proposing a people's convention to draw a new Constitution. We at least three oppose the Bill.",102
345,Mr LUSHER,NOES,"This legislikes lation is not complex. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has inAustraha dicated that his Party will oppose it for particular reasons. The Government obviously will ensure that it passes. It is a fact of history that the salary paid to a Governor General is not increased durposed ing the period for which he is in office. Therefore, the only opportunity presented to a government to ensure that more reasonable remuneration paid is when a change of office holder is being contemplated. I wish to pay my respects to a man who has, I beheve, fulfilled his office with a great degree responsibihty. The present Governor General one who has understood the importance of the Austrahan Constitution, something that cannot be said for a great many members of the Labor Party in this country and this Parhament. The Constitution which we in Austraha have accepted over a period of 76 years involves the Queen, her representative in Austraha, the ate and the House of Representatives in legislatwhich ive acts on behalf of the people generally. The present Governor General protected that Constito tution and, as a result, was subjected to more derision than probably any other individual has suffered in the history of this country. Millions citizens will never forget the actions of former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and his colleagues, and in particular the statement in which he called upon his supporters to maintain their rage and express it against the GovernorAll General, who had acted so responsibly and great courageously in the interests of the country. Governor General had exercised great judgment in an extremely difficult situation, one which been exacerbated by a Prime Minister prepared torideroughshod over a Constitution that had been accorded due respea for 76 years. The Governor General had ensured a continuation of parUamentary democracy. His action was dicated in the subsequent election by an oversincerely whelming majority of Australians, and that supoperate port spoke for itself. I respect the right of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, and of other Australians, promote discussion on the form the Australian Constitution might take in future years. It worth mentioning that the Governor General has himself encouraged discussion of the role his office and its relationship to the Constitution. AU I would Uke to say at this stage about proposition is that if we ever accept and adopt another Constitution in this nation, I hope sinnow cerely that that Constitution wdl provide a lar system of checks and balance to control the of Prime Minister Whitlam who may foist themselves upon parhaments and the people of at some future date. The experience of October and November 1975 is, I beheve, burned into the minds of Austrahans, and rightly so. The fact is that a Prime Minister, who is supto hold a responsible position on behalf of Austrahans, who takes an oath of office, who sits in this Parhament on behalf of Austrahans, was is prepared to reject the Constitution, to ride roughshod over that Constitution for his own short term poltiical gains. of We have in Australia a system which provides is for a Parhament to operate. The Senate has the samerightsas the House of Representatives in all respects other than the amendment of financial Bills. The Senate has an equalrightwith the House of Representatives to reject a financial Bill. The Senate was rejecting a financial Bill. The Senate has the authority to reject a financial Bill if it so chooses. The fact that a Prime MmisSenter was prepared not to accept the situation is in the Constitution, and was prepared to exercise every means that he could find avaUable him to govern without Supply, tofindany situation to perpetuate his own ume in office, proves that the Constitution of Australia is still a very of workable document for aU Australians. There the were checks and balances within that system which the Governor General had the courage to exercise. As a result of that we have a maintenance of parUamentary democracy in this country. Australians owe the Governor General a debt for that. It is almost impossible to conThe template the system that might be operating in Austraha today, late in 1977, had there not been had that restraint exercised over Prime Minister Whitlam in November 1975. All Australians will remember, and if a new Constitution is ever being contemplated, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith vin- (Mr Lionel Bowen) and others, I would hope that simUar checks and balances will in that Constitution, as operate in the present Constitution. The lessons of Oaober and November 1975, when a Prime Minister was to prepared to flout the Constitution and throw the Constitution out the window for his own ends is must never be aUowed to happen again in this country. I am not concerned with the arguments of that are being put forward by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. I am concerned that with the role that Sir John Kerr played in preserving the Austrahan Constitution as it exists and as it existed in late 1975. The GovernorsimiGeneral acted courageously and responsibly in an intensely difficult situation and deserves, and I believe has, the respect of responsible Austrahans. On my own behalf, on behalf of the National Country Party and, I am sure, on behalf of the entire Government and most Austrahans, certainly responsible Austrahans, I want to place on record our appreciation of a great Austrahan.",105

All his rights and privUeges will be maintained should he return to his office as a judge of the court in the Australian Capital Territory. We are going to suppon the Bill to that extent. One point that I think is worthy of comment is that His Honour is a judge of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court, which is a very court. It is thought that the Territory should have at least four judges. At persent only one judge is avaUable to carry out the enormous work load that now exists in the Austrahan Capital Territory. His Honour Mr Justice Connor is to have a breakdown, in our opinion, unminless he gets some help. His Honour Mr Justice Blackburn has a year's leave due to him, and he is taking that leave. We would have thought that the Government would have been aware of the problem that exists in the Australian Capibetal Territory. The Attorney-General (Senator be Durack) would be entitled to do something about this matter, but there is a convention that judges are not appointed once dissolution of Parliament has been announced. Accordingly, nothing can be done by way of intermediary rehef after the writs are returned following the election.

I point out one great difficulties that the Labor Party has mount. The National Times of out on page 28 the amount of money spent by the Liberal and Nauonai Country Parties on television and radio advertising during the 1975 elections. The Labor Party was able to spend only $808,442 which enabled it to purchase 249 hours oftimeon radio and television. The Libamount eral and National Country Parties spent $ 1,219,713 and occupied 414 hours on radio and television. In the same newspaper the broadcasting timesmovement allocated by 13 television stations throughout nation are listed. In my view, a very unfair cation of televisiontimeto the major pohtical parties-tiia t is the Austrahan Labor Party and the Liberal and National Country parties-i shown.

My party advisers inform me that in the Hunter electorate, which is one of the truest Labor electorates Austraha and which is the electorate that I have the honour to represent, the National Country Party of Austraha spent $5,000 during the 1975 election campaign.

I know that it would be impossible to convince the National Country Party of this, but many people in my electorate beheve that the National Country Party should make a contribution of the or half the amount it spent last time and the Labor Party should make a contribution of the amount it spent, if there were no contest, and that the money should be donated to some worthwhile organisation such as the Boy Scouts which is in dire iinancial straits in my the electorate.

I am advised that the Mmister has caUed for a careful investigation. I the hope that a proper and reasonable solution can of be obtained so that offensive matter will not appear in these types of pubUcations in future.

372,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept your advice. I intended to quote two other passages in which the Leader of the Opposition praised the honourable member for Oxley and said what a great man he was on economic matters; how he had saved the country previously; how the country owed him a debt of honour; and how the country could look forward to taking his advice for many years to come. Of course it came as a very great surprise to Austraha and, no statedoubt, the rest of the world when last night the of the ParLeader of the Opposition, in answer to a direct of the question, which incidentally emanated from a nation is Tasmanian, proclaimed that the doctor, 'Dr of a major capital outflow predicHayden, the doctor of economic recovery in this sought to country had been deregistered and had been in the banished from economic matters.

It might be an indication that, on this matter, the Leader of the Opposition has recognised the wisdom of the decision of House of 4 October to censure the honourable member for Oxley. I suggest that there is a clear and demonstrable link between the Parliament's censure of the honourable member for Oxley and seriousness. his removal from the post of economic man for the Labor Party.

Canned Meat as Food Aid (Question No. 1520) Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Foreign to Affairs, upon notice, on 20 September 1977: (1) What quantities of Australian canned meat are provided by the Australian Government as a food aid item. (2) To which countries, and in what quantities to each, has canned meat been provided as a food aid item. (3) What positive action is the Government taking to encourage more canned meat being used as a food aid item.  Airline Sysmember's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The quantities of Australian canned meat provided to developing countries in the past three years under bornethe Australian food aid program are detaUed in the table hereunder.

While small quantities of rice or coarse grains can be substituted for wheat or flour under the terms of the FAC, it is not possible to substitute non-grain foods such as meat, vegetable oils, milk powders and so on. It is generally acknowledged wheat, are the most cost effective means of transferring nutrition to developing countries. The requests which Australia receives for food aid assistance reflect this realisation. On occasions, however, canned meat is requested by potential recipients, in which case Australia attempts to oblige by providing quantities consistent with current funding capacity, and provided we are satisfied as to the proposed usage. The Government recently decided to include non-grain foods regularly as part of the Australian aid program in future years. We expect this to provide some opportunities for greater utilisation of canned meat. Actual purchases will, however, be related to the requirements of specific nutritional impact projects Australia agrees to assist. There has been some success in shipping canned meat as part of Australia's commodity pledge to the World Food Program (WFP). Australia's ability to supply canned meat in quantity has been formally notified to the WFP for many years. The selection of commodities, however, is at WFP discretion. In this context it is somewhat unfortunate that after sive representations to WFP, on a general plane, concerning the avaUabUity of canned meat from Australia, Australian producers were unable to fill a WFP order for 646 tonnes of canned pork. In fact 165 tonnes was all that could be suppUed within the three months quotation period. The Government is keenly conscious of the position of beef producers and will seek to make use of Australian within the aid program as appropriate, bearing in mind constraints imposed by dietary preferences, shelf-Ufe factors, cost disadvantages and, of course, funding limitadons on the aid appropriations. Adelaide University: Biohazards Committee 1977-78 (estimated) (Question No. 1537) Dr Klugman asked the Mmister representing 35 the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 21 Sep681.4 135 tember 1977: (1) Has a Biohazards Committee been established at Adelaide University. (2) If so, who are the members of this committee. (World Food Program) (3) Is the Australian Government represented on the (tonnes) committee. 1977-78 (4) WUl the Australian Government make submissions to the committee. (estimated) Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has 6 provided the following answer to the honourable 343 member's quesuon: 165 (1) My understanding is that an interim biological hazards 5 committee is being estabUshed by the Council of the University of Adelaide. 519 (2) I have been advised that the Vice-ChanceUor of the University is to chair the interim committee. The member681.4 654 ship is to be drawn principally from the University of Adelaide and is proposed to include: a biochemist, a microbiologist from the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, a geneticist, a physical scientist, an agricultural scienust, an environmentalist, a senior technician, a lawyer, that grain foods, particularly a clinical pathologist, three members of the university councU who are not members of staff, three senior members of academic staff from the arts or social sciences, and a post graduate student. (3) The Australian Government is not represented on the Interim Committee. (4) I see no need to make submissions to the University of Adelaide's interim committee but expect that the advice of that committee, as with the advice of the Standing Committee on Recombinant DNA Molecules of the Australian Academy of Science would be taken into account in the deliberations of government granting bodies. The committee is comparable to the ethical committees established by various hospitals and universities to monitor certain types of research. In this regard, it is a matter for the university and not one for the government. At present, the responsibiUty to determine the conditions for the safe performance of this research rests with the Ausextentralian Academy of Science and it is anticipated that the potenual University of Adelaide committee would liaise with the Academy. Airport Runways (QuestionNo. 1544) Mr Kevin Cairns asked the Minister for beef Transport, upon notice, on 21 September 1977: (1) Is it a fact that Laker Airways, in order to offer cheap air fares, must operate their aeroplanes to full loading capacity in respect of fuel, freight and passengers. (2) If so, does this requirement oblige an economically operating airline toflya minimum number of airline stops. (3) Is it a fact that to enable the Laker DC 10 aircraft to operate economic long distance stopovers from Brisbane Airport, at least 100 passengers would have to be offloaded. (4) If so, would this disability Brisbane Airport runway is the shortest capital city runway in Australia. (5) Would the Government be satisfied if the main runway at Tullamarine Airport was only 7760 feet in legnth. (6) Will he inquire whether Qantas and the other international carriers to Australia would be content to have the main runway at TuUamarine Airpon 7760 feet in length. (7) Which genuine international have main runways of less than 8000 feet. (8) Is it a fact that greater runway length is required to achieve adequate aircraft performance in tropical and subtropical airports. (9) If so, why is Brisbane sub-tropical climate with a runaway shorter than Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin or Alice Springs Airports. (10) Would it be fatally incorrect to claim that no disability exists because of the length of the runway at Brisbane Airport. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) In the absence of full details of Mr Laker's plans at the presenttime,an answer would be speculative. However, it is usual for aircraft operators to plan for high load factors so as to provide the economies to offer lower fares. (2) Not appUcable. (3) No. (4) Not appUcable. (5) A runway of 7760 feet in length at Tullamarine Airport would not be adequate for all of the operations currently being undertaken at that airpon. (6) 1 cannot see how any useful purpose would be served by asking Qantas and the other international carriers such a hypothetical question. (7) I have not had an exhaustive study made, but I am aware that the runway at Wellington in New Zealand is considerably shorter, and the available take-off distance at Christchurch is less than that at Brisbane. (8) All other parameters being the same, greater lengths are required at higher temperatures. The adequacy in any particular set of circumstances is clearly related to the demand. (9) Runway length is not the only parameter involved. For example, although the runway at Alice Springs is longer than that at Brisbane, limiting take-off at Brisbane at the same temperature, because of the elevation of Alice Springs. In determining the specific needs for any given location, the Government is guided by advice given by the operators concerned. In relation to Brisbane, the operators have indicated that they consider the existing runway length is adequate to meet their needs until at least 1980, perhaps longer. (10) As I stated previously, the operators of services to Brisbane have indicated that the exisung runway at Brisbane is adequate at this time. Water Hyacinth Control (QuestionNo. 1550) Mr FitzPatrick asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 22 occur particularly because September 1977: (1) Is the experimental program using a South American beetle to control water hyacinth still conunuing. (2) If so, is the beetle proving a success in controlling river weed. (3) What contribution has the Commonwealth Government made in funding this particular project which is under the charge of Dr Ken Harley of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Brisbane. airports to his knowledge (4) What other experiments are taking place. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Airport expected to function in a (1) Yes. (2) The weevil released to promote the biological control of water hyacinth is becoming well estabUshed at its liberation sites. Liberations began in September 197S and should be completed by early 1978. However, spread from the liberation sites has not been rapid, because of the length of the weevil's life cycle. It is thus still too early to assess its impact. (3) The project, which began in 1974-75, was initially funded by the Rural Credits Development Fund. However in July 1976 the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian State Governments, agreed to finance joint action to control water hyacinth in the Gingham watercourse near Moree N.S.W. As pan of the Commonwealth contribution, CSIRO increased its consoUdated revenue expenditure on hyacinth control by $15,000 in 1976-77. This level of consolidated revenue support is being maintained in 1977-78; there is also a contribution of $23,369 from the Rural Credits Development Fund this year. (4) CSIRO is examining other insects that may contribute to the biological control of water hyacinth. In recent weeks a moth (Sameodes albiguttalis) was liberated near Gatton in south-eastern Queensland. A mass-rearing program is now under way and further liberations will conunue during the summer. A second moth (Acigona infusella) is under consideration for introduction into Australia for evaluation under quarantine. Other, insects may follow as part of an expanded program on the biological control of water weeds. In order to ensure that the biological control program will be as effective as possible, suppon research is being undertaken into the biology and ecology of water hyacinth. Pan of this work is an investigation of seed germination requirements, in collaboration with the Seeds Laboratory of the N.S.W.

The first grade is known as a standard, followed by recommended practices and by guidance material. The capability of a rescue and fire service to be provided at an airport is not the subject of a ICAO standard. In deterrnining the fire fighting capalowsbUity to be established at an airport Australia generally folICAO recommended practices. Note is taken of the material of ICAO and the advice of Australian experts. (2) and (3) The service provided at Sydney and Melbourne meets ICAO recommended practices and ICAO guidance material. The services at Brisbane, Darwin and OperPerth only fall marginally short of some of the guidance material. At domestic airports the provision of water and foam capacity and the capacity to discharge this extinguishmaterial m accordance with the prescriptions of ICAO recognised as the primary objective. These prescriptions revised at the end of 1976 and maximum effort has made to utilise existingfireappliances and improved agents to meet these revised specifications wherever service is provided.

The department is nowfinalisingan analysis of returns from sheltered workshops which will help to identify requirements for upgrading services. Improved techniques for evaluating programs for handicapped persons are being developed by the depanment with the assistance of the Educational Research Centre of the University of Queensland. The department also works closely with the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled in promoting acceptable standards for sheltered workshops and is developing methods of improving the performance of workshops. However, restrictions on the types of work undertaken by there sheltered workshops do not seem to me to be commensurate to with the aims of the handicapped persons assistance program. Indeed I believe it would be undesirable to discourage initiative and self-development generated within the sheltered workshop movement, as this would operate to the detriment of handicapped people by reducing employment opponunities. (QuestionNo. 1879) As most production undertaken by sheltered workshops is a contract or sub-contract basis, a high degree of selfregulation is inherent, since failure to meet specifications and schedules militates against the future viability of the workshop.",123
