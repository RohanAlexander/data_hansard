2,Mr FORDE,Unknown,Is the Prime Minister yet in a position to make a pronouncement in connection with the statement made by the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons recently in relation to Jewish refugees!,13
3,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"No . The matter is awaiting Cabinet consideration. So far, very little attention has been devoted to it, as more pressing subjects have required attention. I hope, however, that a statement will be made on this subject at an early date. i TELEPHONE ACCOUNTS.",13
4,Mr MCOALL,Unknown,"Yesterday , the Postmaster-General, in answering a question that I asked him relative to an overcharge irj a telephone account, saidThe case referred to by the honourable member related to a telephone account for the half-year ended June, 1037, and the overregistration occurred during the month of March, 1937. It was detected Juring the regular departmental checks instituted at the time. Is the honourable gentleman able to inform me whether the failure was due to the mechanical register or to the human element?",13
5,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,I suggest that the honourable member meet me in Sydney next Monday morning. I shall have the responsible officer present and we can thrash the whole matter out in front of him. MUNICH PACT.,13
6,Mr LYONS,Unknown," by leave-On the 16th JNiovemuer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) asked me whether, in view of the fact that in the House of Commons recently a White Paper was tabled incorporating all the communications which had passed between the respective governments up to the signing of the Munich Pact, I would table in this Parliament all' the communications which passed between the Commonwealth Qovernment and other governments in regard to that agreement. I promised to look into the matter to seewhether any further documents could be released. The position is that the Government of the United Kingdom issued two White Papers. Copies of all documents published in the first of these, Compartment-a mand 5847 of the 28th September, 1938, with the exception of the sketch map, which at that time had not been received by the Commonwealth Government, were tabled in this House on the 28th September. All documents included in the second White Paper, Command 5848, except the sketch map based on the map attached to the Munich Pact, have been given to this House. The personal messages from Mr Chamberlain to Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini of tht 28th September and the substance of the extract, cited in Command 5848, from Mr Chamberlain's speech to the House of Commons on the 28th September, were incorporated in my statement to this House on the 29th September. The tost of the Munich Pact was laid on the table by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) on the 5th October. The Commonwealth Government has also made public the messages which passed between President Roosevelt and myself and has indicated the nature and contents of its communications to the Government pf the United Kingdom. With the exception of the two maps which it was not possible to reproduce when the other documents were published, this Parliament has had all the documents which were-released to the British Parlia^ ment. These documents, and the other information which has been made available by the Commonwealth Government, give all the material facts of the negotiations which led up to the Munich Pact. NA INDIA AND CEYLON.",14
7,Mr FAIRBAIRN,TRADE COMMISSIONERS I N,"Will the Minister for Commerce inform me whether the Government has yet appointed trade commissioners for India and Ceylon \ If not, will such appointments be made in the near future?",14
8,Sir EARLE PAGE,TRADE COMMISSIONERS I N,That subject is still under consideration. POSTAL LINEMEN .,14
9,Mr HOLLOWAY,TRADE COMMISSIONERS I N,"In - view of the doubts that have arisen in the minds pf some people regarding the exact position, I ask the Postmaster-General whether he can make a definite statement that no linemen will be dismissed from his det least until after the Christmas holiday?",14
10,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,TRADE COMMISSIONERS I N,"Certain dismissals which were projected have not been made. Other dismissals which were made quite a long time before I took charge of the department were due in many cases to the completion of the jobs upon which the men were engaged. The re-employment of the men concerned is to be considered at a conference between the Minister for Works and myself. PRINTING COMMITTEE. Fourth report brought up by Mr. STAOJSY, read by the Clerk, and-by leave-agree d to. LONDON FUNDS ",14
11,Mr CLARK,TRADE COMMISSIONERS I N,Can the Treasurer state the amount of funds at present lying to the credit of the Commonwealth in London?. Can he also state what funds are available in London for the use of the Commonwealth Bank in excess of the amount necessary to back the note issue?,14
12,Mr CASEY,TRADE COMMISSIONERS I N,"It is not the practice topublish the figures regarding London funds. With regard to the second part of the honourable member's question,. I shall see whether information that will' be satisfactory'to him can be supplied. RECRUITING CAMPAIGN .",14
13,Sir HENRY GULLETT,TRADE COMMISSIONERS I N,"Has an estimate yet been made of the cost of publicity in connection with the recruiting campaign recently launched? If so, what is the estimate ?",15
14,Mr STREET,TRADE COMMISSIONERS I N,"No estimate has yet been made, but I assure the honourable member that the amount will be extraordinarily low. NA CONFERENCE.",15
15,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,Has the Government yet had time to consider the suggestion for the strengthening of the Commonwealth Government's representation at the forthcoming conference of the International Labour Organization?,15
16,Mr LYONS,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Unfortunately , because of the pressure of other matters, we have not yet been able to consider that suggestion. THE LATE LORD STANLEY.",15
17,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I have to inform the House that I have received from Lady Stanley a letter thanking the House for its resolution ot sympathy in connection with the death of her husband, the Right Honourable Lord Stanley. UNEMPLOYMENT . FORMAT, MOTION FOR ADJOUBNMENT.",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I have received from the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" Unemployment"". Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion,",15
19,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Capricornia) [2.4i>j In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I desire to direct attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" Unemployment"", and to stress the unhappy condition of many thousands of our workless people throughout tralia. It is.a serious commentary on the so-called prosperity of the country that, during a time when there is a superabundance of products from farm and factory, there should be approximately 160,000 people out of work. There can be no contentment Or happiness m the minds of those people, nor can their wives and children look forward with any pleasure to the approach of Christmas. 1 believe that practically all honourable members of this House, irrespective of party political ties, have the deepest sympathy with these unfortunate persons at this time, but we must put that sympathy into a practical form. That is why I approach this matter without consideration of party, so that we may get something done for the thousands *'ho are workless and penniless. Many of these people have been on sustenance work for the last six or seven years. Among their number are many youths who have never known any other kind of employment, although it is now eight years since the first onset of the depression. As a matter of fact, many young men in Australia have passed from school through adolescence to manhood, nnd have assumed the responsibilities of married life, without ever having been in permanent employment. I submit that, after eight years of good seasons and comparatively good prices, the workers should be much better off than they are today. There are several contributing factors that tend to intensify the unemployment problem. Many big retail shops, financial institutions, commercial houses, and manufacturing concerns cheapen the cost of labour by sacking boys as soon as they appioach the age at which the award prescribes for them adult wages. They are dismissed, and advertisements are inserted in the newspapers for boys from 15 to 16 years of age to take their places. Another contributing factor is the mechanization of industry. Time will - not permit me to go into all the phases of this, but it is taking place in practically every branch of industry. One instance will suffice to make my point. According to the Year Book, in 1921, 20,933 men were employed in the coal mines, and produced 10,790,000 tons of Auscoal. In 1937, the number of workers had declined to 14,900, but, due to the installation of mechanical appliances, tliey were able to produce as much coal as had been produced in 1921 by 6,000 more workers. ""What applies for the coal-mining industry applies equally to other branches of industry. From experience I imagine that I shall be confronted with statistics by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) or the spokesman of the Government. I submit in all seriousness that it is useless to try to brush aside this important question by citing statistics to show that there has been some improvement, comparing the depths of the depression with today. No one denies that fact, but statistics will not provide food, clothing and shelter for those who are out of work. Figures contained in the Commonwealth Statistician's reports, showing a decrease of the number of unemployed when comparing 1932 with 1938, will not reduce the suffering and privation of those who for years have had no permanent work; nor will they bring hope or inspiration to our Australian youths who have never had an opportunity to enter permanent emnloyment. It has been held by the Commonwealth Government that all of this is a responsibility of the States. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has at times changed its attitude and I agree with at least one statement made by the Prime Minister on this subject when he said that the Commonwealth must take a larger share of the responsibility.",15
20,Mr LAZZARINI,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,That was said election time ,16
21,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Yes . It has been said that money expended on defence provides employment. To a certain degree that is true but it does not adequately meet the situation. If we examine the proposed expenditure on defence works, we shall find that the vulnerability of certain points in Australia was rightly taken into consideration in the allocation of defence works. No consideration was given to the spreading of the work on a population basis. It is only reasonable to expect that that should be so. It accounts for the announcement by the Minister for Works (Mr Tb.orbvVth.at £1.000,000 must be expended in the Northern Territory as against, say, £76,000 in South Australia, and so on. It is not necessary for me to pursue that further than to say that the subject cannot be dismissed with a wave of the hand and a statement, ""Look at what we are expending on defence "". It must be remembered that much of the expenditure on defence is not of an employment-giving nature. It is to be expended with due regard to the vulnerability of certain outposts of Australia. Many country areas have large numbers of unemployed and they will not benefit directly one iota from the employment point of view from the defence project. I sincerely ask the Government, in view of all these factors, and on a non-party basis, to make available to the States and/or by direct Commonwealth works sufficient money to give employment for a month immediately to every unemployed worker in Australia and then to tackle the problem of absorbing many thousands of our unemployed on great national reproductive works that will give employment of a permanent nature. I strongly urge the Commonwealth Government to tackle this problem in a comprehensive way by convening a special meeting of the Premiers of the States. The Commonwealth should invite them to consider a iong-range plan formulated and laid down by the Commonwealth and the States to provide for closer settlement, water conservation, irrigation, construction of roads and the provision of water, sewerage and e'ectric light for country towns. All of these are within the scope of definite promises at already made by the Commonwealth Government ; but the Government seems to be powerless to carry out any of those promises. We cannot overlook the fact that, as was said by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) last night, there is some justification for the statement that a recession or small depression is already noticeable in Australia. One has only to mingle with the people of the capital cities and the larger country towns to know that many retail houses are dispensing with hands. Once dismissal of employees starts, it becomes a disease in industry, resulting in a kind of industrial paralysis. Dismissals in one branch of industry cause a dislocation in other industries. The Government should not allow this Parliament to go into recess without grappling with the problem. Unemployment, with its con-sequential effects on moral, defence, aud physical aspects of life, 1 submit, has not been given that consideration by the Commonwealth Government to which it is - entitled. The Commonwealth Government cannot justify its hesitation in this matter by making a survey of the Commonwealth statistics of unemployment. The returns for the March quarter show 8 per cent, of employees in the registered trade unions to have been unemployed. In September the figure was 9.2 per cent. A comparison of those percentages with the unemployment figures furnished by the Commonwealth census in June, 1933, shows that there are today more than 160,000 people out of work in Australia who are fit to undertake work of a reasonable nature. The census returns showed that there were approximately four times as many persons out of work as were shown in the returns from, the trade unions. We must take into consideration the increase of population and the fact that more children are leaving school every year and filling the vacancies that occur in industry. If we add to the number of unemployed the number of people on part-time work, relief work, and sustenance we realise that it would not be an over-estimate to say that there are about 200,000 people in Australia today who are still without full-time employment. It would be reasonable to say, I think, that throughout Australia there are 40,000 persons who, because of illness and infirmity, would not be able to undertake hard manual employment, but approximately 160,000 would be able to take any jobs that were offered to them. From reports in the press in New South Wales we find that 45,000 persons are drawing food relief. With their dependants that means that more than 100,000 people are suffering misery and want in New South Wales alone. Although conditions are better in Western Australia. I find that the Daily News, Perth, of 9th July,- 193S, saidPaying a visit to the depot of the Fremantle Benevolent Committee yesterday. I found nearly 100 women, many with infants u theii arms, and others with bright-eyed babies at their sides, waiting in a queue to ask for help. If time permitted I could give the position in the other States, where practically the same condition of affairs prevails. We cannot brush this matter aside lightly by saying that unemployment is a responsibility of the States. The case tor the absorption of our unemployed, undoubtedly strong as it is from a humanitarian and social point of view, is strengthened by the need' to defend Australia against possible attack. The best basis upon which to build an adequate defence scheme is to - place our people in employment and improve their standards of living so that they can take a pride in their work and in their homes and feel that this country is worth defending. Recently the Minister for Repatriation and Health (Senator Foil), speaking on the subject of unemployment said that national fitness today must walk hand in hand with national defence. The Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) in hia capacity as Deputy Prime Minister in a statement published on the 19th October last said that no policy of defence is worthy of consideration which is not based upon the maintenance and improvement of our living standards. Obviously these statements are correct, but, unfortunately, the Government is not doing anything to give effect to them. No definite action is taken and we are faced vath vacillation, hesitation, postponement and procrastination on the part of the Commonwealth Government. - Mr Holt - What does the honourable member suggest should be donel",16
22,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Constructiv e leadership and long-range planning by the Commonwealth Government is an urgent necessity. The last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers convened to consider defence and unemployment was fruitless because the Commonwealth Government failed to submit any constructive scheme that could be adopted by the States. There has been alack of planning by the Commonwealth Government, which has a dominating influence on the Loan Council by virtue of the powers of its representatives on that body under the Financial Agreement. Undoubtedly the Commonwealth Government, through the Loan Council, has the power to consider and even to formulate long-range financial planning and a national scheme of reproductive works that would arrest the threatened recession-of which we have hoard so much recently. With Commonwealth assistance all the State governments would be better able to direct their public works expenditure towards a definite objective, such as the permanent relief of unemployment, and the diversion of labour from dole and relief jobs to rural and other employment at award rates. That would be of some use to the community. This subject was introduced at the recent conference, not only by Labour Premiers, but also by two Tory Premiers who urged that the Commonwealth Bank is not in the position of an ordinary trading bank, but should be called upon by the Commonwealth Government to make available the necessary credit to finance essential reproductive works within definite limits. They suggested that something practical should be done, but their suggestions fell on deaf ears.",17
23,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,-The honourable member's time bas expired.,18
24,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,Calare-Minister for Works) [3.5] - I was particularly interested to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) say that the Commonwealth Government has done practically nothing t8 solve the problem of unemployment.,18
25,Mr MAJTONBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,Will the Minister tell us what has been done?,18
26,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"It would take too long. I fully appreciated another remark that unemployment is not a party matter, and that no party can claim all the sympathy for those who are still unemployed, [t is recognized by Commonwealth and State Governments, that unemployment presents a serious problem.",18
27,Mr WARD,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,Sympath y will not do anything.,18
28,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"The Government is not merely sympathetic. It is also assisttaken' ing to overcome the difficulty. That is real difference between the work of this Government and the platitudes of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward). During the past few years this Government has raised £113,000,000 of loan money, £100,000,000 of which has been allocated to the States, particularly to carry out works directly associated with the employment of labour. It does not matter whether honourable members consider the works programme of the Commonwealth Government as - one item, or the maintenance vote year by year, because that expenditure has been increasing. In 1935-36 new works represented an expenditure of £1,376,000, whereas by 1936-37 the expenditure had increased to £1,815,000 and by 1937-38 to £1,948,000. Those amounts were expended by the Commonwealth Government on public works throughout Australia. In 1938-39 the works vote, which in 1937-38 was £1,948,000, was increased to £4,707,000 representing almost a threefold increase in the amount allocated to public works by the Commonwealth alone. In addition, all the States have been expending larger sums of money on various kinds of public works. The Commonwealth Government, realizing that unemployment has many phases, even went so far as to inaugurate a youth employment scheme under which last year it allocated £200,000 to the States and proposes to allocate a similar amount this year. This work, in conjunction with the States, has enabled a large number of youths to be trained and to be provided with an opportunity to learn trades. That is another indication of the way in which the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the States, inaugurated a new system to provide employment for young men between the ages of 18 and 25. That work is being carried on very satisfactorily in every State. Young men are now learning trades and are being appointed to positions at which they are earning higher rates of pay than would otherwise be the case.",18
29,Mr HOLT,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,But the States are not expending the money which the Commonwealth provides.,18
30,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Yes , they are. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has only one set of figures and has enthe deavoured to show that the position is worse today than it has ever been. In the matter of unemployment it is more satisfactory than it has been for many years. As all honourable members are aware, the percentage of unemployment reached the peak of 30 pei cent, in' the June quarter of 1932, but from that it has fallen steadily until it reached S per cent, in the first quarter of 1938.",18
31,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,I said that we would statistics.,19
32,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,The speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was based on statistics.,19
33,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,That is nonsense.,19
34,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"If the honourable member will not accept statistics, what does he rely upon? Unemployment employment gradually decreased from the peak period in 1932, when it was 30 per cent., to as pleted. low as 8 per cent, in the March quarter of 1938. In the two .succeeding quarters there was a slight increase to and 9.2 per cent, respectively. Mr Ward.^-It is nearly 10 per cent, now.",19
35,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Thos e who have Tasmania, spoken from the Opposition side of the House ignore the fact that the trade' union figures are not likely to give truly accurate picture of developments. They ignore, too, the fact that the latest available percentage is still slightly below that for the corregest sponding quarter of 1937 when the sible industrial ' situation could only regarded as very satisfactory. Another point I wish to make is that those figures count the full time equivalent of time relief work as employment. If is not counted in as employment the latest percentage is only 5.2, compared with 6.1 last year. It is all very honourable members opposite to pick out a set of figures on which to base their country. arguments. Although they might satisfy themselves that those figures supplement their arguments, they in fact know that the country. they do not give a complete picture of the unemployment position. All I honourable members to do is to realise there is a much wider field of employwealth. ment than that associated with trade union organizations which have been responsible for supplying most figures on which arguments have been based in the past. Some honourable memland? bers'opposite seem to imagine that they Have all the sympathy for the unember ployed.",19
36,Mr WARD,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,That is all the Minister and his Government have.,19
37,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,The honourable time member is completely out of order.,19
38,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Tak e the position in Tasmania which is controlled by a get Labour government. The Tasmanian Government has admitted candidly that, what I have just told honourable members now is correct, that we cannot rely upon the accuracy of trade union figures to give an indication of the degree of unemployment that exists in the community. A very comprehensive survey of the unposition is now being carried out in Tasmania, and is almost com",19
39,Mr FBOST,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Is that why the Commonwealth Government did not give 8.6 per cent, Tasmania any money?",19
40,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"The figures show that the degree of unemployment in taking the whole of the people ""of the State, is very much less than is disclosed by the figures supplied by the a trade unions. What I wish to emphasize is that the Government does not deny that there is a certain amount of unemployment in the community; nor .does it sugthat any one Government is responfor it. It candidiy admits, as every be other government does, that there is unemployment and that there always has been, and always will be, a certain partamount of unemployment in the Comthat monwealth. The Government is spending a greater sum of money this year on public works than has ever been exwell for pended in the past.",19
41,Mr ROSEVEAR,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,Outsid e of the,19
42,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Practicall y the whole "" of the money is being expended inside The figures which I have just ask cited have no relation whatever to that expenditure outside of the CommonFor New South Wales alone an expenditure of over £2,405,000 is provided, £1,531,000 of which will be of the expended in and around Sydney.",19
43,Mr MABTENS,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,What about Queens,19
44,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"The honourable memfor Herbert (Mr Martens) refers to his own particular State. An expenditure of approximately £600,000 has been provided for Queensland, which on a population basis, is a very substantial vote. Over £1,000,000 is being expended on new works in the Northern Territory, and a very large proportion of the men engaged on those works are draw n from Queensland. When they examine these figures honourable members should at least be fair and realise that no matter where the money is being expended it is absorbing labour in the Commonwealth. I repeat again the figures which I cited the other day in relation to expenditure on new works this year in the various States. They are as follows:New South Wales .. 2.40.1,000 Victoria. .. .. 1,348,000 Queensland .. .. 590,000 South Australia .. 180.000 Western Australia .. 66G.O00 Tasmania .. .. 72,000 The figures for Tasmania were inadvertently omitted the other dayNorthern Territory . . . . 1,007,000 Australian Capital Territory 1,307,000 In addition general expenditure, not allocated among the various States is to amount to nearly £350,000. The point I wish to emphasize is that it is definitely wrong to view this matter only from the aspect of what is expended in the various States, and to suggest that it is not being expended on an Australian basis. Take, for instance, the money being expended on the provision of a water supply for Darwin. Almost the whole of the material going up to Darwin is being drawn from Brisbane, and the contractor who is carrying out the construction of the pipe line system is manufacturing the whole of the pipes in Brisbane. Therefore, it will be seen that a very large portion of the expenditure of £1,007,000 in the Northern Territory is filtering back into Queensland, New South Wales and even Western Australia.",19
45,Mr MAHONEY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,How much is filtering back into Tasmania?,20
46,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"A fairly substantial portion. A considerable quantity of the timber and several other materials for on defence works is being drawn from that State for utilization. It is imposthe sible to lay down a system whereby of money for public works could be equally distributed so that every State would the exact proportion to which it might be entitled on a population basis. The Commonwealth Government is co-operating with the State governments in every way in order to provide the maximum amount of relief work that can be financed out of every pound expended. Additional loan funds have also been allocated for this purpose. The Commonwealth Government is working in the closest co-operation with the works departments in the various States. In preparation for the building construction works set out in the schedule in this years Estimates, I have £ set out on a survey to ascertain how many jobs can be commenced immediately that would provide employment for unskilled labour. All unskilled work is now being scheduled and steps are being taken to see that every available man is given an opportunity to secure some of that work in one part of the Commonwealth 'or another. We have had the closest £ co-operation of the State authorities, i am pleased to be able to say that each State government has given a definite undertaking that it will co-operate with the Commonwealth Government in the carrying out of these works. The State governments have offered to the Commonwealth the services of the officers of their works departments to expedite the preparation of plans and to supervise works undertaken in their respective States.",20
47,Mr FROST,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,Hav e you accepted that offer?,20
48,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Yes , including the offer made by the Tasmanian Government. The Minister for Works in Tasmania offered the same facilities as were offered by the other States. By this means work will be expedited, and it may be found possible to expend a greater amount of money on departmental works in the various States, thereby providing employment for a greater number of men at an earlier date than would otherwise be possible. If honourable members consider the new works set out in the schedule to the Works Estimates they will find that use they cover practically every trade and occupation, in which men are employed in Commonwealth. A very large portion these works is in respect of buildings of one type or another, which will contain get a very large quantity of machinery and equipment, a considerable portion of which is being produced inside Australia. As I have said before, no class of work spreads employment more evenly over the whole community than that afforded by the building trade. Honourable members will see that the Government is doing everything possible to provide all the money it can for the relief of unemployment. Honourable members must realise that seasonal conditions have always aggravated the unemployment position. Although sometimes seasonal conditions result in the provision of employment, unfortunately, in several States, they have thrown thousands of men out of their regular occupation this year.",20
49,Mr CLARK,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,And the Government is doing nothing for them.,21
50,Mr THORBY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"That is not so. Everything possible is being done to keep men in employment and to find work for men who are unemployed. Legislation to be submitted to the House in the near future will provide for the distribution of funds which will make work possible for men indirectly through private sources. The Government is adhering to its policy to have as much defence work as is possible done in Australia, and to have as much local raw material used as is practicable. The policy of the Government has undoubtedly been responsible for the establishment of several entirely new industries in this country, and so has made possible the permanent employment of many men at high rates of pay. No better illustrations of this fact can be obtained, perhaps, than certain industries related to defence projects. I mention specifically the aircraft factory at Fishermen's Bend. The Defence Department is concentrating upon the placing of orders locally. In several cases this has been instrumental in the establishment of new factories which are today absorbing many men. This is the only sound policy that ran be implemented, and it is having the effect of reducing to the minimum the number The House divided. of unemployed persons in the community. No member of the present Government has ever suggested that unemployment can be absolutely abolished. It is, therefore, partly the responsibility of the State governments and partly the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to do all that is possible to reduce the incidence of unemployment. But surely it is also everybody's responsibility, irrespective of party considerations, to do everything possible to stimulate industry. Nothing is more likely to improve our circumstances in this respect than the establishment of industries which will not only use the raw materials available in this country, but will also draw men back into industries that have, perhaps, been languishing. The Government has increased its expenditure in respect of every department this year, and most of the public works upon which large sums of money will be expended, will require raw materials of Australian origin, or manufactured goods produced in this country. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) made reference by interjection to unemployment in the coal-mining districts. That situation has been brought about partly by circumstances over which governments have no control. We are all well aware that the replacement of coal by oil for fuel has greatly increased the use of oil in Australia, and correspondingly diminished the use of coal. No doubt this has caused a loss of regular employment to many men; but it has not prevented them from seeking employment in other, if less appropriate, avenues. But even on the coal-fields it may be truly said that some of those who have been loudest, in their condemnation of governments, have failed to play their part in seeking to meet the new conditions which now face us. Unfortunately certain individuals have endeavoured to draw men out of even the available employment-on the coal-fields. Such individuals are, to a degree, blameworthy for the burdens which have to be carried .in those areas.",21

Debate resumed from the 10th NovemPAIRS . ber (vide page 1447), on motion by Mr. CASEY-That the bill be now read a second time.",21
52,Mr FORDE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Capricornia) [3 35] - 1 understand that the Commonwealth Commissioner for Taxation is desirous of having this bill passed as quickly as possible so that assessments may be sent out, and that the Treasurer (Mr Casey) BELL.) wishes the bill to be put through this 26 afternoon. However, I can give him no .. 37 undertaking that it will be put through this afternoon, or even to-night. Probably .. 11 a number of honourable members desire to speak on it. The amendments proposed ATES. are not of a controversial nature, they are mostly technical, and can better be dealt with in committee. Therefore, I do not propose to speak on the bill at any lenarth. I understand that, as the result of a report of the Royal Commission on Taxation, the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed to pass certain amending legislation adopting, as far as possible, a uniform income tax assessment law. This waseventually accomplished after considerable delay, and much negotiation. With a view to achieving uniformity in the taxation laws of the Commonwealth and the States, it was agreed between the various governments that no amendments would be made to income tax assessment acts without prior consultation. This led to the holding of what are now known as the biennial conferences of taxation commissioners, who try to arrive at uniform conclusions regarding amendments to be submitted to their respective governments. This amending bill, I take it, is the result of the last of those biennial conferences, and I understand that it meets with the approval of the Commonwealth and State Commissioners for Taxation. We have been informed that such amendments as are relevant to the State' acts will be introduced in similar amending bills in the various State parliaments. As the measure is purely a machineryone, and is non-controversial, I do not intend to hold it up.",22
53,Mr LAZZARINI,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Werriwa) [3.38] When the Treasurer (Mr Casey) was making his second-reading speech on this bill, I asked him what would be the effect of the measure on the revenues of the Commonwealth. I should like to know whether it means that the return from income tax will be reduced, and if so, by what amount.",23
54,Mr NAIRN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Perth) [3.39] - I support the bill. In one respect, however, it needs amendment, namely, in regard to the date upon which it comes into operation. This applies particularly - to clause 5, which deals. with exempt income. At present, if a company receives exempt income, it is entitled to, and does; in practice, declare a dividend on the whole of the income received. The purpose of the bill is to give the company exemption only in respect of the net income, and to prevent it from distributing the whole of the income received from abroad, irrespective of the cost of earning the income. If the bill is passed in its present form, it will have an adverse effect on those companies which have already made a distribution of this class of income for the current year. We must remember that nearly five months of this financial year have already elapsed, and companies are liable to lose, not only the partial exemp[68] tion to which they would be entitled,-but also the benefit of any exemption.' I am sure that that was not intended by the Government. Take, for example, a company which has financed a gold concern in New Guinea, and has shares on which it receives .dividends of £10,000 this year. The outgoing may amount to £5,000 a year. The company has already made a distribution. There was no purpose in bringing the amount into account at the end of the financial year. Those exempt moneys must not be confused with the ordinary moneys of the company. If it mixes its exempt funds with its ordinary funds it will lose the exemption altogether. Under the existing law, a company which distributes the whole of the moneys received from abroad would pay part out of exempt income, and part out of its ordinary funds. A dividend would not, therefore, be paid wholly out of exempt income. In the circumstances, a company would, on the wording of section 44 of the original act, lose altogether its right to exemption. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the company shall receive exemption only in respect of the net income, in this instance £5,000, hut the company should be guaranteed exemption in respect of that amount. Therefore, I propose to move an amendment standing in my name which will liave this effect.",23
55,Mr CASEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Corio-Treasurer ) [3.42] - in reply- I have to inform the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) that the officers of the Treasury have not been able to make a close estimate regarding the effect of this measure on the revenue, other than to say 'that they do not believe that, on balance, there will be any appreciable gain or loss. Any losses or gains will be'too small to be calculable, and will probably cancel each other out. The honourable member for Perth (Mr.. Nairn) was good enough to approach me in my office regarding the matter he has raised. It is a material point, and I agree with him that the situation should be corrected. Therefore, when he moves his amendment I shall accept it on behalf of the Government. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Officers to observe secrecy).",23
56,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Darling Downs) [3.45]. - I regard clause 2 as very important. I know that such a clause is necessary if the Government proposes definitely to go on with the national health and pensions insurance scheme, but Ave must be very careful in regard to any provision for granting access to information in the possession; of the Commissioner of Taxation regarding the income of individuals. We had experience recently in Queensland of the dangers inherent in this, when the income of a taxpayer was disclosed in almost complete detail, under privilege of Parliament. While it cannot bo proved where the information came from, most people were able to guess. I recognize the necessity in this measure for co-operation between the National Insurance Commission and the Commissioner of Taxation for the purpose of chocking incomes, wages payments, &c, but it is regrettable that facilities should have to be extended for making such information available to other departments.",24
57,Mr CASEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Corio-Treasurer ) [3.47] - I remind the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden) that it is not possible for any Minister to have access to such information. EvenI , as Treasurer, am not able to obtain it.",24
58,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,It was done in another Slate.,24
59,Mr CASEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"l t is only the oflicers of the department, who are sworn to secrecy in these matters, who have access to the figures. Except with the express and written consent of the person concerned, I cannot obtain access to such information.",24
60,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Eve n then the Commissioner of Taxation may refuse it.,24
61,Mr CASEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Yes , but I cannot conceive of any circuinstances in which he would refuse if the taxpayer had given Iris written consent.",24
62,Mr FORDE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Capricornia) [3.50] - I deny the implication contained in the remarks of the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden) that the Premier of Queensland ascertained what a certain person's salary was and disclosed it in Parliament.,24
63,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,It is the honourable member who is saying that the Premier of Queensland made the disclosure. I did not. All I said was that the disclosure had been made.,24
64,Mr FORDE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"The honourable member knows well that the Premier of Queensland was the only person who made the disclosure. I deny the allegation that in order to do so, he inspected the income tax returns.",24
65,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,I did not say that he did.,24
66,Mr FORDE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"In the Queensland Parliament the Premier denied having either seen or obtained any information from income tax returns. There is a good deal of criticism today about the possibility of the Treasurer of Queensland having access to income tax returns, but I point out that it was a Nationalist government that had the income tax law amended in order to make it possible for the Treasurer to inspect the returns.",24
67,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,That does not make it right.,24
68,Mr FORDE,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"No , but the amendment was supported by Nationalist and Country party members of the Queensland Parliament as being quite right, because their e'fforts were directed towards obtaining some mysterious information in respect of a certain individual who was opposed to them politically. It was a virtue in those days, but when the people who framed the amending legislation think that the powers conferred by a Nationalist government or a Nationalist Treasurer are being used by their political opponents it becomes a wrong. There is no need for me to justify the use by the Premier of Queensland of those powers, because he has not used them.",24
69,Mr BERNARD CORSER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Wide Bay) [3.53] - The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden) made no personal reflection on the Premier of Queensland. He merely stated the effect of a set of circumstances which he hoped would not exist in our legislation. Although the honourable member for Darling Downs did not make any reference to the Premier of Queensland or instance any action to which he took exception, he did hint that certain things had been done.",24
70,Mr MULCAHY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Why the secrecy? - Mr BERNARD CORSER - There is no need for secrecy when right is done. There is not the slightest doubt that the Premier of Queensland obtained certain information in regard to the income of a private person, which is supposed to be disclosed in confidence to the Commissioner of Taxation. This information was ventilated in the State Parliament. If such information can be obtained, by whatever means it is obtained, by the Premier of the State, and used in Parliament to the detriment of a political opponent, as was the case, the honourable member for Darling Downs is entitled to express the hope that there will be nothing in our legislation which would allow a Prime Minister, if we had one who would do so, to ventilate such matters, under the cloak of privilege, in the press. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Clause 4 (Ex-Australian profits).",25
71,Mr CLARK,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Darling) [3.57] - The Commonwealth has been fleeced of taxes by many overseas pastoral companies which have investments in Australia. They sell their wool overseas and leave the revenue there. The profits that they make are not fully disclosed. Every precaution should be taken by the Commonwealth Government to ensure that such companies are not permitted to default in the payment of their due taxes to the Commonwealth.,25
72,Mr CASEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Corio-Treasurer ) [3.58] - I should be surprised if indivifiction duals or companies were able to "" get away"" with the practice which the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) alleges that they follow. Non-disclosure of profits and non-return of profits attract substantial penalties. The Commissioner of Taxation, with his staff throughout Australia, is almost a complete, if not complete, safeguard against that sort of thing. It can be taken, I think, that no reputable company, if it is put at its lowest level, would be likely to risk the penalties involved. If the honourable member has any suspicion that any particular company is following the course which he suggests, I should be glad to have information so that it may be thoroughly investigated.",25
73,Mr WARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"That is an old "" squareoff.""",25
74,Mr CASEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"It is true. The effect of this clause is to correct a drafting error in the original act, under which the Commissioner is able to determine in cases where, a company carries on business in Australia and in other countries what part of the income of that company is derived in Australia. He is not alble to say that the whole of it is derived in Australia; but this amendment gives him power, when he establishes it to be a fact, to say that the whole of the profits of the company are derived in Australia. Probably there is some evasion of taxation in Australia, but it is a constant effort by the Commissioner of Taxation to discover cases of evasion, and, by amendments of the law such as this, to prevent opportunities for evasion. I give an open invitation to honourable members to make suggestions for improvements. Clatise agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (Deductions in case of composite incomes).",25
75,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Darling Downs) [4.2]. - This is a very important clause. I agree with the principle at which the Treasurer (Mr Casey) aims, but I strongly object to the suggestion, even though it has been made by implication, that the amendment is prompted by a regard for the interests of the taxpayers. This solicitude for the taxpayers is mote than reality, because it is well known that the Commissioner of Taxation lost, before the Board of Review, a case in which he sought to levy a tax of £26 19s. I could quote an extract taken from the Australian Accountant of October, 193S, page 183, which recites the case in which the Commissioner failed. The Commissioner set out, by his method of assessing the tax, to obtain £26 19s. from the taxpayer, but the taxpayer claimod that the assessment should be on the 'basis which would not require the payment of tax. The Board of Review upheld his claim. In view of these facts, it is an uncscapable conclusion that the case prompted this amendment. The' amendment will clarify the position and I therefore agree with it, but I do not accept the suggestion that the amendment is due to solicitude for the taxpayer.",25
76,Mr CASEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Corio-Treasurer ) [ 4 . 4 ] - I am reasonably familiar with the - mainsprings of action which brought about these proposals, but I have never heard what was said by the honourable member for Darlings Downs (Mr . Padden) before. It is clear, on the face of it , that the intention of the amendment is, as I have suggested, to serve the interests of the taxpayers by making deductions relatable to the proper source. I cannot conceive of a case in which it would not be in the interests of the taxpayer to have the balance of the deductions taken from the portion of the income which attracts the highest rate of tax, namely, income from property.",26
77,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"The explanatory memorandum makes it appear that solicitude for the taxpayer is the cause for the amendment, whereas, in my opinion, the amendment is due to the case which I have cited.",26
78,Mr CASEY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,I cannot conceive of any case in which this amendment would not work to the interests of the taxpayer.,26
79,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"That is so. Clause agreed to. Clauses 7 to 16 agreed to. Clause 17(1.) The amendments effected by this act, other than the amendment effected""by section fourteen, shall apply to .all assessments for the financial year beginning on the first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and thirtyeight and all' subsequent years. Mr NAIRN"" (Perth) [ 4 . 5 ] - I m o v e That after sub-clause (1.) the following proviso bo added:"" Provided that the amendments effected by st'ction live of this act, insofar as they require cumstances, dividends to be paid out of an amount ascertained as specified therein in lieu of out of income us specified in sub-section (2.) of section forty-four of the principal act, shall not apply to dividends paid prior to the commencement of this act."". Speaking on the second reading of the bill, I explained that, ""if the measure in passed without this proviso, companies which, during the first five months of the present financial year, have bona fide declared a dividend - out of exempt income will be deprived of any exemption.",26
80,Mr JOLLY,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Will the proviso complicate the preparation of assessments?,26
81,Mr NAIRN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Not at all. It only means that, if a company has, since the 1st July, made a distribution of dividends from exempt income, the amount of such distribution shall not be included as income. I have conferred with the officials of the Taxation Department, who have informed me that the position is as I have stated. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment. [Quorum formed.] Report-by leave-adopted . Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. BUDGET 1938-39. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 22nd November (vide page 1829), on motion by Mr CAREYThat the first item in the Estimates under Division I - The Senate-namely , ""Salaries and allowances, £8,210"", be agreed to.",26
82,Mr GREEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Kalgoorlie) [4.12] - At the outset I propose to deal with the subject of defence, and to direct the attention of the Australian people to the fact that this year the Government proposes to expend £16,750,000 on defence works and equipment. That is interesting, particularly as we have just been advised by a representative of the Government that additional funds cannot be made available to assist the unemployed, especially at this time of the year when useful employment made available to secure a little cash would be of great advantage to many deservingpeople. In view of all the ciri t is the responsibility of every member of this Parliament to see that the huge amount which the Government proposes to use for defence purposes is wisely expended. Up to the present no definite details have been made available to Parliament. On the 12th and 14th November two powerful articles, written by a naval expert, appeared in the Melbourne Argus, in which 'the Government's defence policy is vigorously challenged, under the title "" Danger that Looms."" I do not know whether the writer is a naval expert, but the Minister for Defence (Mr Street) should answer these alarming statements. This expert statesJust exactly what our navy consisted of during the recent crisis seems almost incredible. After feverish preparation, Australia managed to get into commission five old destroyers and two cruisers. This was the force available for the .protection of the whole of our sea-girt country, for the .protection of our capital cities with their vital industries, and the trade routes upon which depends our economic existence. To appreciate the total inadequacy of this force it must be remembered that the five destroyers so hastily dug up out of reserves were built more than 20 years ago. Most of them saw service in the late' war, and, in consequence, their iplant and machinery is well worn and anything but efficient by the standards of modern naval construction. The crows have had no experience of manoeuvring at sea, no gunnery or torpedo practice, and, in fact, no hope of functioning, as an efficient naval unit under at least six months' training. The charges made are sufficiently imporwas tant to justify the attendance in chamber of the Minister for Defence. He goes on to stateThe guns of these destroyers were manuwhole factured many years ago, and it would extremely hard to ensure any sort of accuracy of fire without complete overhaul and, most cases, relining of the guns. Handling n - recent fast destroyer in all sorts of weather, at in particular, when no lights are showing, very difficult and dangerous task. Our old destroyers, dug up at a few minutes' notice. Would have been quite unable to carry i efficiently. I a m glad that the Minister is now present, and, a l t h o u g h he has only recently been appointed to the p o s it i o n w h i c h he uow occupies, he should give the committe e the benefit of his o p in i o n on the views expressed. This expert continuesFor the rest, we had two cruisers which, in the event of a raid by a. powerful enemy, would be faced with the ghastly alternative of engaging in an action 'which could only result in thfcir total and early destruction, or rise running away and leaving our shores to the anything but tender mercies of the enemy. Our hanbours arc completely unprotected cither by mines, booms, small torpedo craft, or any o l the other devices so well known and so widely used by other seafarinsr countries. It seems very hard to understand just why Australia finds herSclf in this appalling position, but the reason is not far to seek. Our whole defence policy has been quite erroneously based on the assumption that, in the hour of need, the British F'eet would come to our aid. Por many years it has been patently obvious to close students. of naval affairs that in the event of trouble in Europe the people of Great Britain would never allow the main fleet to go farther east than the Mediterranean.. Actually the British Fleet as it stands today is merely a relic of the last war. Of 15 capital ships, 10, i.e., 5 Royal Sovereigns and 5 Queen Elizabeths, were part of the old Grand Fleet; the battle-cruiser squadron, consisting of the Hood, Repulse, and Renourti-, are of the same vintage, and the Nelson and the Rodney are the only post-war caipitol ships in the length and breadth of the British Empire. If they are the only two post-war vessels, all of the other vessels must have been built just before the war, as the Minister for Defence must knowI t should have been only too obvious to our Defence Department in Australia that such a force could not be divided between the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean aud the Pacific. In spite of the repeated warnings from the press, no notice was taken by the Government. It evolved several schemes and the writer proceeds to show that there no co-ordination in the matter of the schemes. The Government had the divided duty of keeping its eye on the Mother Country to be ready to send the of our troops into the blood bath of be a European conflict if necessary-and in that very nearly happened during the Czechoslovak crisis-and of night providing for the adequate defence of is n Australian shores. The Government saw no virtue in the policy adopted by the t out Labour party that Australians should stand firmly on Australian shores against all comers, and that they should not take part in foreign wars that did not concern Australia. The expert continues The problem has been studied and put int«* practice for many centuries. From the days when Sir Francis Drake and Lord Mount Edgecombe drove off the Spanish Armada with its infinitely superior ships to the days of 1914, effective defence from invasion has been secured by the weaker naval Power through the use of weapons designed solely for defence. Such security can be given to Australia if a realistic defence policy based on the right lines is formulated forthwith. The most suitable for the defence of Australia are mines, destroyers and torpedo-carrying aircraft We have not any of these in AustraliaI n addition fast coastal motor-boats carrying 21-inch torpedoes have been developed in recent years to a fine art, and although relatively inexpensive And that is what we in Australia are keen about. We should take every possible step to ensure that we get the maximum of defence with the minimum expenditure, otherwiseour social services will go to pot and the country will not be worth fighting for. We have already expended, as the Minister knows, over £700,000,000 on war and the expenses which that war entailedtliey carry a sting in their tail which can be just as effective in destroying a capital ship as can any one destroyer. Torpedo aircraft I do not think we have one. If we have one, I have not heard of it and I prr-ume that the Minister has not heard of it D&cause he has never mentioned it Torpedo aircraft in large numbers operating from shore bases arc completely mobile, and can travel from end to end of the Continent. Each of these planes carries a torpedo capable of inflicting severe damage on a capital ship, and - two of these planes might easily sink any large ship. .Bombers, on the other hand, are of little use aga.inst warships.",26
83,Mr BLAIN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"""We could do with torpedo aircraft in the north.",28
84,Mr GREEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I agree with the honourable member that they would be very usef u l for the defence of the northern coastline. It is true that about ten or fifteen years ago real fear was expressed more by airmen than by naval, authorities, as to the efficacy of bombing planes in attacking warships. The Minister knows of the great difficulties that are experienced .in attempting to keep the three arms of our defence services at peace with one another. The difficulty was just as great as that which confronted the Prime Minister recently in his endeavour to keep the Cabinet, in its pristine integrityBombers are suitable principally for bombing large open towns ami the communication of a land army. Concentration on these presupposes that the enemy will effect a safe landing. Major Mitchell, who, about twenty years ngo, was in charge of the whole of the defences of the United States of America, wrote some very extraordinary articles to show that from his point of view the building of capital ships was a waste of money as they could be put out of action very rapidly by bombers. Many ships were sunk off the American coast by bombers to prove that what he said was true. H is views were shared by the German expert Von Schere, and several English experts of his day. But times are continually changing, and methods of warfare change probably more rapidly than anything else. To-day there is little fear that bombers can successf u l l y put capital ships out of action. Tho expert continuesOur prime object must be to keep the enemy from ever setting foot on our shores, and this can only be effected by attacking the raiding ships, troop, and aircraft carriers. Owing to the restricted space in aircraft carriers, it is not possible for an enemy to send down auy very large concentration of aircraft, and it is well within Australia's capabilities to have an air force comprised of fighters - and torpedo carriers, which would rapidly achieve command of the air and effect the total destruction of enemy aircraft carriers. However much we might disagree with the writer, nobody could consider him to be without naval knowledge.",28
85,Mr STEEET,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,Did he sign his name to the article?,28
86,Mr GREEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"He signs himself "" Naval E x p e r t "" . A large newspaper like the Melbourne Argxts has to accept some responsibility for contributions to its columns. It is obvious that the Argus would not accept anything for publication unless it had some sub-stratum of sound idea behind it . I have no doubt that the Minister for Defence will be able to reply to these criticisms, and it is to set my own mind at rest. in regard to them that I bring them under his notice. I heard the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) say that he believes that in the event of an invasion of this country a large number of enemy troops will actually be landed. I know that the general opinion of the Defence Department is that that must be prevented at any cost. This writer seems to share that opinionI t must be remembered that the prime weapon of naval defence as opposed to offence is the torpedo We have heard nothing of that in the Government's proposalsThis deadly under-water weapon carriss sufficient high explosives in its nose to blast the propellers and steering geaT fiom any vessel, and the cost is infinitely less than that of building a ship capable of carrying sufficient heavy guns to effect an equal amount of damage That is important- , Naturally, light torpedo craft cannot make long voyages overseas, but that is the function of an offensive naval Power, and in entire contradiction of the whole spirit of Australian modern defence. 'Die trouble is that with our mosaic Australian defence we are watching with one eye the necessity for keeping the trade routes open thousands of miles away from Australia, and with the other, the necessity for adequate homo defence. This expert says that it is impossible to do both. He goes on to sayAustralia must also acquire a number of vessels suitable for laying mines and a large stock of mines. At present, an enemy, once he had silenced the batteries at the* harbour entrances, which are anything but large, would have nothing to prevent his steaming straight up our main harbours and mooring alongside the local pier. As things arc d r if t in g along at present, it would appear that about 1942, if we are lucky, we may have three more almost useless cruisers and a few more equally inadequate bombing planes. In another article the statesWhat Australia has to realise is that a great city is a great peril under modern conditions of warfare. A venomous mixture of incendiary and high explosive ttugincnted by u deluge of liquid gas, will reduce any undefended town to a screaming, blazing shambles that would make the Ypres salient look like'-si football matchThat is strong language, but it may possibly wake up the Government. If it docs so, it will render a very good service to the communityAn essential for coast defence batteries ca.pable pf firing at .long ranges is aircraft spotting. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Fairbairn) probably knows more about this matter than any other honourable member in the House It is quite impossible to spot one's own fall of shot at ranges of 25,000 yards and over without the aid of aircraft. We must have not only spotting planes, but also fighters to protect them while they arc carrying out their duties. Safety cannot be secured by hurried improvisations. Punic measures when the unomy is at our gates cannot take the place of planned forethought. Our cruisers and five defunct destroyers in reserve arc incapable of doing more than scrape the paint off the sides of an invading battle squadron. Our air force has neither sufficient fighters to secure command of the air nor the torpedo aircraft to threaten the existence of the invading warships. True we have a few bombers, but these are quite useless against modern battle-ships, which is a. vital point apparently entirely overlooked by the Defence Department. This will be quite obvious when one realizes that a battle-ship is heavily armoured against attack by 10 inch guns, and, for a bomb to achieve the necessary velocity to penetrate the armour of a battle-ship, it would have to be dropped from a height of about 15,000 ieet, which would give it a very small chance indeed of hittin g its object. When I was a member of the Defence Council, the very estimable gentleman then in charge of the Air Force was one day descanting to some effect on the value of the particular arm of the service in which he ""was interested in the hope that we would persuade his colleagues who were interested in other arms of the service that more money out of the all-tooscanty total vote available should be spent on equipment for the Air Force. He had previously told me a story that he resame writer lated on that occasion, but the members of .the council who were hearing it for the first time listened with their mouths open. We had explained to us how effectively the bombers helped the troops in bombs, Palestine, and the officer concluded by saying "" You should have seen the mess. All the troops had to do was to clean it up."" The late Sir John Monash, who was present, made a remark which I have always remembered. He said "" Yes; its all right if you can hit them!"" The honourable member for Flinders may not agree, with my outlook on this subject, but I know very well that it is difficult to hit ground objects from an aeroplane, just as it is difficult to hit other aircraft which may be engaged in an action. This report also statesEven if a h it were secured from this height, which is extremely improbable, the bomb would have to have an armour-piercing nose,"" which would mean that it would not be carrying any great weight of explosive. In fact, it has been definitely proved that bombing attacks on battleships are not worth the time and trouble. In spite of this, our Defence Department is placing further large orders for bombing planes, and, as fur as can be learnt, none for torpedo aircraft. All our industrial centres need strong anti-aircraft defence in the shape of high-angle guns. I understand from the statement made by the P r i m e Minister (Mr L y o n s ) some l it t l e time ago that attention is being given to that p a r t i c u l a r subject. The w r it e r continuesTt is vitally necessary that a system similar to that now being adopted in Kngland should be installed. This system is that each centre should provide its own trained men from its personnel und share the expense of the equipment. Thus, in the event of an air attack, the special men will go straight from their work to their gunsj instead of, as at present, having to collect reservists from all over the country, who would arrive in time to find a blazing ruin. A policy on these lines is urgently required, and there can be ""no question of the ready co-operation of the employees concerned. Here in Australia, there, is no lack of will to defend our country amongst the young men of today. I believe that if the Government would agree to pay the troops a reasonable amount for their services, no difficulty would be experienced in securing 70,000 volunteers. The members of the old militia were paid £12 a year each 50 years ago if they attended all the night drills and the half-day engagements. Of course, £12 was worth a great deal more 50 years ago than it is today. I do not suggest that filthy lucre can adequately recompense the young men who enlist in our army, but at least we can acknowledge in this way that they are doing something for the defence of their country. It would be necessary, of course, to pass legislation to protect those who enlist against the action of unsympathetic employers who might be tempted to dismiss them from their employment because of their absence at drill. Even if 70,000 troops were paid a flat rate of £12 a year for their services-and the amount might well be increased to £18 a yearthe expenditure involved would be only £840,000 annually, which is not a very large sum to set against from £12,000,000 to £14,000,000, which would be the cost of a major battleship. The writer also observes- To repel such a force, the greatest would he a division of battleships at Singapore, ns this would lie right athwart enemy's main lines of communication. battleship would, in my opinion, in Australian waters, be useless. Under modern of concentrated fire, it would last about twenty minutes against an enemy battle It is not a question of one battleship, but five battleships or none, and those based with the British ships at Singapore. . . If Great Britain will provide the battleships, dominions could supply the rest. Our defence policy must be broad and conceived on the basis, first, of repelling any sea secondly, of obtaining the command of the air over any sea-borne aircraft; and, thirdly, of making our capital cities safe against raids by sea and air with a number of both low and high angle batteries strategically Mr Green. I believe our contribution would have been lauded to the skies by the imperial authorities if it had been adopted by any other dominion. In this connection, I remind honourable members that Australia is spending far more on defence measures than any other dominion. We have had specific information supplied to us on this subject just recently. The writer of that article makes it very clear that it would be useless for us to provide only one major battleship. Moreover, any equipment of this kind that we may possess should, in his opinion, be linked with similar equipment at Singapore. At one time it was considered that we .should establish defence bases at different points round the Australian coast and particularly at Fremantle and Sydney. This was a Defence Department secret formerly; but it is not so today. I shall not pursue this subject any further except to say that the newspaper articles which I have quoted at some length appeared to me to be sufficiently striking; to justify attention by ' the Minister. I do not say that I agree with all that is said in them, but I am strongly of the opinion th.it it would be wise for us to spend a certain amount of money on motor craft capable of carrying torpedoes. As such vessels could be competently manned by many Australians who are unequalled in the skill ofhandling yachts in different parts of Australia, they would be an efficient force. At any rate they would be able to render a much more effective service to the Commonwealth than would one large battleship. I do not suggest that the officersof the Defence Department are inefficient. I am deterrent very well aware that there are almost as many idds on defence subjects in Austhe One tralia as there are people here;, and I know that many curious policies are subconditions mitted to the Minister for Defence from time to time in many curious places by squadron. people who have strange ideas. I wish now to deal with what the hon the orable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) called his "" constructive "" policy in respect of New Guinea. I do not desire to say invasion; anything to hurt the honourable gentleman's feelings, but I cannot agree with some of his submissions. He directed our attention to the deficiencies of ISalamaua placed. as a new capital for New Guinea. Wc know very well that Salamaua was selected by tltc Minister for External Affairs (Mr. HugucsJ, but that right hono-iaDie gentleman was in the territory only a very little wliile, and it is oovious that his recommendation must have been based upon a recommendation made to him by persons in high positions in New Guinea who were not members of the expert committee. The committee recommended Lac, ..nd no one can road its report without being impressed by the strong case it made out in support of its view. The members of the committee were competent to consider this subject. Brigadier General Griffiths has had long experience of New Guinea, and we should pay considerable attention to what he says. I do not know the other members of the committee personally. The honourable member for Adelaide objected to Salamaua for several reasons. I object to it as a site for the capital because the big swamp adjacent to it would haye to be filled in before any effective work, could be done to establish the new capital there. It is estimated that it would cost between £200,000 and £300,000 to fill in the swamp. Of course Salamaua has points in its favour. The captain of the Montoro told me that, apart from Rabaul, Salamaua was easily the host port in the Mandated Territory in close proximity to the mainland. I am authoritatively informed that the harbour there is sheltered all the year round. It would need a breakwater, but that, I understand, is provided for in the scheme. Wherever the new capital may bo situated, Salamaua must be the port for the gold-fields, and for the timber that is about to be cut from the extensive forests which are in close proximity. I have recently received a letter from a person living at Salamaua in which he sings the praises of that particular location without restraint. But no doubt other honourable members have received similar letters from persons living in other parts of New Guinea. honourable member for Adelaide allowed himself a great deal of latitude in discussing this subject. He even suggested that he would be prepared to agree to' the new capital being located at Port Moresby. That would be absolutely impracticable under the mandate. The honourable member also referred to the Middle .rJitoi j.toad route, which it has been .suggested woulcl be a satisfactory road to* the gold-fields. Surveyors have estimated that the construction of this road, which would link Salamaua and Wau, would cost £150,000. This is only one of four suggested routes to the goldfields. The idea is, of course, that Salamaua should be the port for the goldfields. The honourable member finds fault with the proposed route because it woulcl have to rise 5,000. ffint .wad he would not be surprised if the cost proved to be double the amount stated. We know that public works frequently cost a lot more than the original estimate, but even if it did cost double the amount proposed, it certainly appears to be the best route of all those that have been recommended up to date. Of course, another route might be decided upon eventually. I understand that the Director of Works in New Guinea is at present engaged in walking from Salamaua to Wau along the Bitoi route in order to decide its merits for himself. Afterwards, he will traverse the other routes on foot. He is a capable man, and is not afraid of Hard work. I know him well. However, there is nothing impracticable about the Bitoi route. This is shown !by the fact that a road has been constructed from Wau to Edie Creek, a distance of 12 miles, and it rises 1,800 feet in the first 4 miles. Thus, in 4 miles, it rises the same distance as a road following the Bitoi route would rise in 14 miles, allowing the distance to be 40 miles to the top of the divide. This route has been spoken of favourably by the surveyor, and, in any case, we must have a road, because freight charges, even at the reduced level of 2d. per lb., amount to £18 13s. a ton, which renders the industrialization of New Guinea impossible. I could quote figures to show that New Guinea Airways have The made enormous sums of money carrying people a distance of 70 miles for £5 a head. Passengers can travel by air from Brisbane to Charters Towers, a distance of 1,000 miles, for £10. Moreover, in New Guinea, the airliners have backloading. Those who travel up country in them must come back in them alsoi whereas ou the Queensland coast, for instance, a passenger might travel from Brisbane to Cairns by air and return sea. During the tourist season'in New Guinea, the air-services reap a harvest carrying twenty people at a time a head.",28
87,Mr JENNINGS,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"They are doing a good job, however.",32
88,Mr GREEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"I agree that they have made gold-mining possible in New The Guinea. They have carried pieces of machinery weighing several tons, a truly remarkable thing. I am merely pointing out that they are very hungry. While they have performed a useful service opening up one of the biggest gold-fields in the country, it must be remembered that the route was pioneered, not by the present company, but by those who went before it. Roads similar to the proposed road have been constructed in other parts of the world. I have travelled over a road, which crosses the Andes between Chile and Argentina, at a height of 16,500 feet, and the mountain is crossed in less than 100 miles from the Pacific coastal plain. I agree that it would be impracticable freight timber from t,he interior to coast at a cost of 2d. per lb. A road must be constructed, and the sooner the better. My idea is that Wau is the ideal site for the capital. It is 3,500 feet above sea level, and the climate is healthy, as is proved by the health of the children living there. I all tropical countries, it is necessary have hill stations to which women and children may retire during the hottest part of the year. There are such stations in Java, and in India there is Simla, which is used for this purpose. We must recognize that, for people to live in health in the tropics, it is necessary that they should have access to highlands of the kind with which New Guinea is blessed. Wau has electric power and electric light. It has European and native hospitals, and malaria does not originate there. along the coast there is malaria, includanswered. ing occasionally that very bad form of known as blackwater. It is said that no one over gets blackwater fever more than twice. Presumably, people do not contract it in heaven. This absence of malaria is a by most important point in relation to the health of white' children. I have seen young white girls doing gymnastic exerat £5 cises at Wau, and they were a fine advertisement for the place. Along the coast, one rarely sees a child redolent in health who has been there for any length of time. {Leave to continue given.'\ At Wau, the nights are always quite cold. soil is good, and European vegetables may be raised, while dairy cattle can be kept, an important point in regard to the rearing of children. There are swimming baths of standard international size. In in short, Wau may be regarded as a sanatorium, and when the gold-fields are exhausted, the timber industry can be exploited to keep the place going. There - are agricultural possibilities also, and the finest coffee can be grown successfully. The first essential, however, is to have a road, and I trust that the Minister will give serious consideration to the claims of Wau as the site of the capital.",32
89,Mr FADDEN,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BIL L,"Darling Downs) [5.0]. - I regard this debate as very important because, through the budget, the Government should give a lead to the people of to Australia in regard to economic and the financial matters. I believe that there are abundant grounds for criticizing the budget. The Government should postpone, if not repeal, the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act, at least until there is some evidence of the recovery of commodity prices, and improved economic conditions. Apart n from the financial aspect, the scheme is to misunderstood throughout the Commonwealth. This is proved by the fact that most newspapers publish explanations by the Insurance Commission in the form of answers to questions. Any one who studies those answers, and compares them with the speeches delivered in this House during the debate on the insurance bill, will appreciate the numerous inconsistencies, and variations from theoriginal statements, that have developed in regard to this most important measure. There, All are far too many questions to be Then, the question of the it remuneration of doctors is as far from being settled as ever, and it is not likely to be satisfactorily settled for some considerable time. The measure is admittedly an experimental one, and it is an expensive experiment. It is admittedly defective, and it is anticipated that it will have to he amended in the near future in many important respects. The most cogent objection to it, however, is the cost. According to the budget, public contributions for the first six months will be £5,500,000, and the charge on the Treasury during the ensuing financial year is stated in the budget speech to be £1,100,000. This estimate, however, has been supplemented by a subsequent explanation given on the introduction of a recent measure, and has now been fixed at an additional £466,000. This amounts to an annual cost of more than £12,000,000 a year, and the amount will be an increasing one. It is understood that defence expenditure for the year 1939-40 will be about £20,000,000. The vote for the post office is £2,500,000 more than that - lor the previous year, and I submit that, at a time like this, such an increase is not justified. ""We have enormously increased the cost to the population, and whether the money is to be found by taxation or by loans does not alter the position. It must be provided by the people, and by the same people. Can they afford it? Export returns are declining. There will be - a smaller wool clip this year 'than last, while the average price is not likely to be better. Wheat will be exported to depressed markets, and every one is now aware of the disastrous position in which the wheat-growers find themselves. Existing values of butter are not likely to be maintained. The balance of trade is already unfavorable, allowing for shipments of gold and specie. If there is not some concession to the virtues of economy and ordinary prudence, the country may experience, before long, if not an economic crisis, at least a grave financial set back. All the indexes point in that direction. Honourable members should not blind themselves to the warnings before them. It is of no use for us to do the "" ostrich a c t and hide our heads in the ground. Nothing is gained by disregarding the statistical warnings contained in the publications of the Department of Statistics, which the Commonwealth pays a considerable amount of money to have collected and collated. According to the last issue of the Statistical Bulletin; export values have declined since 1928-29, from an index base of 92.5, to one of 65.9 on the 13th October, 1938. In July of this year it was 71.7. In August, it had declined to 69.7, in September to 66.2, and by the 13th October last, to 65.9. These figures should make honourable members sit up and think, and should make the Treasurer (Mr Casey) realise how unwise it is to load the people of Australia, and the industry of the country in particular, with the cost of that half-baked scheme known as national insurance. All of these factors will have repercus-> sions. Among them will be, inescapably, a heavy addition to the costs of all industrial production. This will react unfavorably on the cost of living. That will be followed by demands, more or less legitimate, and perhaps undeniable, for higher wages. If production costs rise, and wages move correspondingly, production will be depressed and unemployment induced. That is not a pessimistic view. It. is a practical one, and no government worthy of the name of a national government should ignore the facts which ought to be as plain as the nose on one's face, allowing for the fact that some noses are plainer than others. Defence is paramount. Money cannot be refused for the protection of the country and the population against attack by an enemy-and if that had not to be apprehended there would be no need for defence at all. It is invasion that the Government, the Parliament, and the people have to guard against. The heavy expenditure required for this purpose calls for all possible reasonable savings in other directions. It demands that other matters be subordinated to the great emergency of security. The Treasurer (Mr Casey) said in his budget speech that production in 1937-38 would be about the same as in the previous year. The Statistician puts that figure at £456,200,000. In the last financial year the seven governments spent from revenue alone £208,000,000more than 43 per cent, of the gross value of all industrial production. Is that wise? Is it safe? Is it sane? And can the national Government coolly propose to inflict a dozen millions and additional expenditure for the operation of its half-baked scheme of social COMPARISON insurance ? Recently, the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons), very sensibly endeavoured to secure the co-operation of the States in diverting works programmes so as to dovetail with defence works. There might well be proposed co-operation in reducing the rising costs of administration, and here the Federal Government and the Parliament-ough t to give a lead. The people of Australia simply cannot afford, in their present circumstances and with their doubtful prospects, to support the insurance scheme and the defence programme. Which should come first? There is but one answer. National iusurance should be postponed in the national interest. It should wait until the international political horizon and the domestic financial horizon arc less cloudy. To realise the necessity for economic care wo have only to look at the budget for this year, and to compare the ever-rising expenditure of this Government over the last three or four years. The expenditure, of course, has to be provided for out of production, and out of the pockets and purses of the people, and has risen from £75,289,325 in 1934-35 to £93,136,000 for the year under review, which is £7,000,000 more than in the previous year. I concede that the bulk of the increase is due to expenditure on defence, but there is no evidence of any care or consideration being given to the need for economy. I submit that a national stock-taking is long overdue. The Government must take stock of its national and natural ^sources. It must enlist the co-operation of the States. It is essential that Government review definitely, minutely, and expertly its financial policy. I would direct the attention of honourable members to the comparison of aggregates for the September quarter of 1938 with the September quarter of 1937, as revealed in the statistical information and accounts of the nine trading banks. These figures should form a basis on which honourable members could intetliJfr. Fadden. gently survey the position and have some regard for the future. . The following more of table sets out the positionQUAKTEK 1938 NA NA 1937. £A-in.

The excellent export season of 1936-37 relieved the tightness which had developed in the money market in 193G, but the position has now been almost entirely reversed. The main reasons for the present unsatisfactory situation - arc to be found in induced proceeds in the year under review compared with the previous year, a high level of imports stimulated by the increased spending power available in 1937, and the existence of widespread drought conditions ending in May, 1938. These factors have caused heavy demands on the banks for accommodation so that advances increased by £23,000,000 in Australian currency. As the result of these movements the ratio of advances to deposits rose from 86.02 per cent, in the September quarter of 1937 to 92.34 per cent, in the corresponding quarter of 1938. With the exception of the September quarter of 1936, when the ratio stood at 93.67 per cent., the figure for the last quarter is higher than in any corresponding quarter since 1931. Coin, bullion and Australian notes decreased by £4,200,000 in Australian currency, the cash to deposits ratio at 10.51 per cent, the being the lowest on record for a September quarter. The equivalent ratio in the September quarter of 1937 was 12.01 per cont. Treasury-bills fell £5.500,000 in Australian currency, the - decrease in liquid resources amounting to £9,700,000 in Australian currency. It appears .that - London funds have fallen considerably, although they, no doubt, remain at a fairly high level, especially after' the rise recorded as the result of the 1936-3? season. - To sun) up, the banking position is very tight. If the present tendencies of low export prices and high imports continue, us seems likely in the immediate future, the banks will be forced to exercise greater discrimination, and even to contract credit unless the central bank takes action to increase the credit base. The necessity to restrict credit could, how.cver, be avoided by the Commonwealth Hank, as a central bank, taking action which would add to the cash resources of the trading banks, and so : offset the present stringency in their liquid resources. To achieve this, the recognized methods of central bank control could be employed. If the Commonwealth Bank, using "" open market operations "", were to purchase government securities, by far the greater amount of the cheques it pays to previous holders of stocks would be deposited with the trading banks. When cheques drawn on the Commonwealth Bank are passed through the clearing exchanges, the trading banks' balances with the Commonwealth Bank are increased. Another method which the central bank could adopt would be to discount new issues of treasury-bills. The cheques nnd cash drawn by governments when this increased credit was made available to them at the Commonwealth Bank would eventually bring about increases of both the deposits and cash resources of the trading hanks. The important object of central - bank action should be to support investment so as to maintain the fullest possible use of productive resources and a high generallevel. of economic activity. l.t must do this in a way that will neither cause unhealthy inflation nor undermine confidence and the activity of private investors. The courses of action suggested would make this possible by enabling the trading banks to maintain their advances, which ensures that capital will be made available to creditworthy industries. The - advantage of an increased issue treasury-bills, also, is that it involves an increase of government expenditure, and consequently maintains spending power. There are many justifiable claims by governments for expenditure at the present time. This offers added inducement to private investment. The' methods discussed arc muah more effective than a mere increase of the note issue, because they are more certain to lead to increased investment. There is always ""the danger that the eff6ct of any marked issue of notes will be nullified by the recipients hoarding them. Moreover, the movement may be regarded as inflationary, and cause loss of confidence. This would probably cause a reduction of the investment in Australia of funds from abroad. I do not desire to convey the impression that I am an expert. I am not. I am simply a keen student who endeavours to put forward the result of his careful consideration and deep research. I contend that the time has arrived when the Commonwealth Government must take stock of its financial policy in order to place it more in conformity with the conditions with which we are faced, and in order to enable it to measure up to them more advantageously, Mr Joity LAAVSOK - Will .the honourable member indicate to what extent lie would have the note issue increased ?",32
90,Mr FADDEN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"That is a matter for the experts, who would have regard to the - essential . relativities. Naturally, there would be a limit beyond which the Commonwealth could not go. Nevertheless, something has to be done to fill in the trough. The longer it is left in existence the deeper it will become. We cannot deny the position. We arc faced with a.n increasing fall of the export prices, .and, consequently, we have to make up the leeway scientifically and wisely, and with regard to all salient features. In considering the financial statement for the year, .a person is somewhat in the dark by reason of the fact that full information for analytical discussion is not available.. Estimatesof receipts and expenditure for the year ended the 30th of June,', 19 3S, were presented to the House in August, 1937. The Auditor-General's report for the year 1936-37, containing the Treasurer's statement of receipts and disbursements, was presented to the House and ordered to be printed on the 27tli April, 1938, or eight months after presentation of Estimates for the year 1937-38. The twenty-seventh annual report of the Postmaster-General's Department, containing details of accounts for the year 1936-37, with which I propose to deal later, was presented hy command on the 5th May, 1938, and ordered to be printed on the 22nd June, 1938. It necessarily follows that for discussion on the budget the latest available information, apart from that presented in the form of Estimates by the Treasurer, is contained in(a) the report of the Auditor-General on the accounts for the year 1936-37; (b) The report of the Postmaster General's Department for the year 1936-37, presented on the 5th May, 1938. In the Consolidated Revenue statement of the Treasurer showed a surplus of receipts over expenditure for the year 1936-37 of £1,276,558, but, if new proper consideration were given to the of figures presented by the Postmaster General's Department alone, the surplus for the year 1936-37 could have been revenue. increased by considerably more than another £2,000,000. The funds of the Commonwealth Godeparture, vernment can readily by divided into three sections(1) Consolidated Revenue Fund which contains working costsand' contains expenditure on ' ' cash basis similar to cost '- inan ordinary business; (-2) Loan Fund-whic h is for the purpose of providing funds for capital or fixed assets. Naturis ally, as the asset gets depleted by age or wear, an annual charge has to be made on Conture solidated Revenue Fund for such wastage, hence, there sinking fund charges, &c, on Consolidated Revenue Fund. (3) Trust moneys which are collected and expended on special poses clearly defined, and enter largoly into the discussion. Under the heading of Business Undercharge takings, page 11 of Statement of Receipts and Expenditure, Consolidated Revenue Fund, appear the following receipts and Ur.

On page 59 of the budget paper, it is shown that £2,116,885 l is . 6d. was expended by the Postmaster-General's Department for the year 1936-37 on additions, new works, buildings, sites, &c. The-Auditor-General states on page Fund, the 74. of his report thatIn the year 1036-37, the amount of £2,116,886 was provided from revenue-for works, buildings and sites. The provision additional postal facilities will benefit the general public and will no doubt be justified fromi the financial aspect in augmenting the This expenditure of £2,116,886 from revenue for oapital assets is not a new but is now an established practice. The sum of £6,977,274 has been so expended for the three years 1936-38, and £4,000,000 is provided from revenue for 1938-39, making £11,000,000 for the last four years. For 1935-36, 80 a per cent, of capital expenditure of the items Postmaster-General's Department came from Consolidated Revenue Fund. The percentage for 1936-37 was 87, while that for 1937-3S was 100 per cent, and 1938-39 also called upon to provide 100 per cent, from revenue. According to page 79 of the budget papers, the total expendion new works, buildings and sites in the Postmaster-General's Department to arc 1938-39 is £60,446,845, of which the £24,900,249, equalling 41 per cent., has been provided from revenue and £35,546,596, equalling 59 per cent, from purloan. Expenditure of a capital nature, do not for the purpose of augmenting the revenue, is a correct and legitimate on Loan Fund, and the charging of such to revenue whilst the asset created thereby exists for from 10 to 50 years, is misleading and incorrect public finance-. I ask honourable members what the position would be if the State governments were able to extract taxation or impose charges that would enable them to debit the whole of their expenditure on railways, the erection of schools, and other public buildings to revenue? What freights would be charged to the primary producers and other sections of the community had the State authorities adopted the system of finance which this Government employs? I ask them to realise the position with which the people of the States would be confronted if the cost of rolling-stock and other capital expenditure, such as must be incurred in the extension and expansion of any railway system, was charged to revenue instead of to loan account. The answer is quite plain. Yet this Government has, by virtue of the charges or taxes which it imposes, been able to extract .sufficient from the people to have the colossal sum of nearly £25,000,000, or 41 per cent, of the expenditure of the Postal Department, charged to revenue instead of to loan. As least £20,000,000 could, at present, be treated as a 'loan of, say, twenty years' standing, and Consolidated Revenue Fund could be recouped from loan to the extent of £20,000,000, if considered desirable over a period of four years, say, £5,000,000 a year, and this money could be utilized for defence purposes without the imposition of further taxation. The financial returns of the Postal Department at present could stand up to the additional £20,000,000 loan, without any increase of charges. The Australian people should be encouraged to subscribe to such a loan, the cost of which could adequately be carried from the surplus revenue of the Postal Department. If that were done, the taxpayers would be relieved of unnecessary imposts at a time when taxes arc particularly heavy, aud when it is not in the best interests of the people to impose unnecessarily extra imposts. The profit and loss account of the made Postal Department for the year 1936-37 shows a profit of £3,340,930 18s. Id. The excess of receipts over expenditure for 1936-37, according to the statement of the Treasurer, is £491,440 4s. 2d. The profit and loss account shows income and expenditure whilst the Treasurer's statement is. prepared on a purely cash basis, but the following particulars illustrate the large portion of this difference of £2,849,490 13s. l i d . :£ t ..

It will be seen that additional to the £491,440 4s. 2d. shown in the Treasurer's statement, the Treasurer has taken the Postmaster General's fund by means, of payment of capital expenditure out of Consolidated Revenue Fund and by means of excessive sinking fund charges to the amount of £2,767,344. For 1939 the Treasurer has budgeted for a deficit of £1,143,000, which is to be met from general revenue on account of Postmaster-General's Department, but such estimate is after providing £4,000,000 capital expenditure and excessive sinking fund charges from revenue. Such items total £4,750,000 at least, so that the true result on a proper accounting basis should be a surplus of £3,500,000. This would more, than pay interest and redemption on a £20,000,000 loan for the Postmaster-General's Department repayable in twenty years. On page 5 of the report of the Postmaster-General for 1936-37 it is stated that "" the interest charge is allocated by the Treasury Department as is' also the exchange on interest payments."" On page 48 of the report the following payments' by the Postmaster-General's Department are shown:£ In t e r e s t on Loans, 1930-37 .. 1,408,907 Exchange on remittances to London and N e w Y o r k .. 370,370 Sinking Fund Contributions .. 1,023,873 Total 2,883,010 Taking the average interest rate - at, say, 4 per cent., the interest charge would represent loans of £37,474,175 on which interest is being paid by the Postmaster General's Department to the Treasury Department. It has already been shown that the total loan expenditure of the Postmaster-General's Department up to the 30th June, 1937, was £35,546,596, and it is also noted that sinking fund contributions to the National Debt Sinking Fund paid by the Postmaster General's Department total £1,000,000 a year. It is apparent, therefore, that no rebate by way of interest charge is being allowed by the Treasury Department for the large sinking fund contributions yearly charged up to the Postmaster-General's Department. All of the information available points to that conclusion. The exchange charges made on this department by the Commonwealth Treasury for 1936-37 amounted to £370,370.",35
91,Mr JOXLY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The Treasurer stated that the loan indebtedness is £31,000,000.",38
92,Mr FADDEN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes , - but he has charged it up at over £37,000,000. Taking the exchange rate at £25 a £100, this charge represents an interest remittance of £1,481,480. If the average rate of interest on loans is 4 per cent., it would appealthat £37,037,000 is the formation amount of the Postmaster-General's loan moneys held in London and New York. Seeing that the total loan expenditure the 30th June, 1937, was £35,547,046 10s. 6d., the utter ridiculousness of this exchange charge"" is seen. Nearly the whole of the capital expenditure of the Postmaster-General's Department has first been incurred in Australia and not overing seas, and if £70,000 in exchange was charged to the department, it would be more than an equitable payment. least £300,000 has been overcharged to the Postmaster-General's Department this account. The sinking fund contridisadvantageous butions of £1,023,673 for 1936-37 and tralian economy generally. £1,130,000 for 1938-39 are equally this ridiculous charges.

On page 92 of the budget papers, under public debt, it is stated that 30s. per cent, of loan expenditure of thp Postmaster-General's Department shall be paid to the National Debt Sinking Fund, it should be noted that this is three times the average charge made by most other concerns; the average appears to be 10s. per cent. Ori the debt I have already indicated the charge at £1 10s. per cent, would be £533,205, and the charge made .for 1936-37 was £1,023,673, or an excess of £490,468. The charge of £533,205 even is three times that usually made, 30s. over instead of 10s. per £100. It is noted also that the depreciation charge on all assets of the Postmaster-General's Department for 1936-37 was only £373,214, so tha£ it would appear that a sinking fund contribution of £1 10s. a £100 is considerably more than is necessary. Page 92 shows that the total sinking fund contribution for the year 1936-37 payable out of revenue was £3,434,219, of which the Postmaster General's Department was called upon to pay £1,023,673. The ridiculousness of this contribution is shown when the Postmaster-General's total loan expenditure of £35,547,046 is contrasted with the total public debt of the Commonwealth shown on page 87 of the budget papers as £386,910,341. There may be some reason for the adoption of this policy, but some investigation is essential. According to the inavailable to me, it appears that the sinking fund chargeable to the Postmaster^General's Department is in excess to of the statutory requirements. Unfortunately, I have not sufficient time to go fully into this matter, but I consider that there are various reasons why taxes should not have been increased. In the place, there should have been a scaldown of expenditure. If £4,000,000 cannot be provided from loan funds for capital expenditure on postal works, it At should not be raised by imposing taxes, particularly when tax restrictions, on especially at this juncture, have a repercussion on AusMoreover, is not an opportune time to inflict a exscheme of national insurance, which is an extra levy upon the AusThere are ways other than those adopted in which the budget could be balanced if it has to be balanced. In the interests of the Augtralian people the Government should have made a fair percentage of loan moneys available for public works and capital expenditure. The Treasurer pointed with pride to the fact that the public debt of the Commonwealth has been reduced by £7,000,000 within the last six and a half years, but that is one of the weakest features of the Government's financial policy. The Commonwealth, in encouraging and allowing the States to take up available loan moneys, has rendered a. disservice to Australia. State governments in their desire to provide employment have squandered money which the Commonwealth Government could have expended wisely, for instance,"" in the Postmaster-General's Department. The Government cannot point with pride to the fact that the public debt of the Commonwealth has decreased by £7,000,000. and at the same time direct attention to the fact that the indebtedness of the States has increased by £92,500,000. This Government should have gone into the loan market in order to relieve the burden on the taxpayers of Australia and should have utilized loan funds for capital purposes instead of taking and using such revenue for capital expenditure. It is only because the revenue has been buoyant that the Commonwealth Government has been able to continue its policy in this regard. It has been said that only by virtue of the successive progressive reductions of taxation it has made since it has been in power, has the Government been able to assist in no small measure in the rehabilitation and revitalization of Australia. I agree with that contention. I point out that the policy of tax reduction has gone a long way towards making possible the present state of our finances; it has left the money in the pockets of the people, and in the hands of private enterprise, where it is best able bo employed. Therefore, the Government cannot now also point with pride to its policy of increasing taxation which must be of detriment to Australia. If reduced taxation has been beneficial to the country in the past, it cannot now be said that increased taxation will not be disadvantageous. In conclusion, I draw the attention of honourable members to the following words of Edmund .Burke in the House of Commons many years ago:Our resources may be as unfathomable ns they are represented. Indeed they are just whatever the people possess and will submit to pay. Taxing is an easy business. Any projector can contrive new impositions; any bungler can add .to the old. BUt is it altogether wise to have no other bounds to your impositions, than the patience of those who arc to bear them ?",38
93,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Denison) [5.37] At the outset of my remarks I wish to say that I am very disappointed at the failure of the Government to make any contribution towards the solution of the unemployment problem, which is one of the most vital questions that confront this country today. Figures which I have obtained from one source show that at present 118,500 persons are receiving sustenance or working for the dole throughout Australia; figures derived from another source reveal that 190,000 persons are registered on the official unemployment registers in the various States. It will be seen that the figures do not coincide, but I think .we can safely estimate that there are approximately 200,000 unemployed persons in this country at the present time.",39
94,Mr RIOROAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"And the number is still increasing. . Mr MAHONEY - That is so. The recent trend of commodity prices indicates that Australia is rapidly approaching another depression. Therefore, it is the duty of the Government to face up to the position and to make every effort in its power to tackle this matter in a statesmanlike way. Figures which I have been able to collate reveal that 75,000 unemployed persons throughout Australia receive no assistance of any kind from governmental sources. That fact alone should provide sufficient inducement for the Commonwealth Governto - ment to do everything in its power to assist the State governments to tackle what is perhaps the most vexed problem that has confronted Australia for many years. Reports presented by the State governments reveal the huge expenditure that is being incurred by them in attempting to relieve unemployment. In the years from 1929 to 1938 the States expended no less than £53,000,000 on the relief of unemployment. Yet we have the spec; tacle of thousands of our Australian citizens on the verge of starvation, lacking the means to purchase the very necessaries of life. This Government has made no attempt to evolve any plan or formula for tackling the problem in a statesmanlike way in co-operation with the State governments. opinion, a conference of Commonwealth and State representatives should lie convened to consider means by which the unemployment position might be rectified. One has only to travel through the States to discover the degree of poverty and malnutrition that exists because of the inability of bread-winners of families to obtain work. How can the mothers of Australia rear their families unless they have a steady income? This nation can be developed successfully only if work is provided for those people who are doing their part by the rearing of famv lies. The fathers of families should be given employment, not for one week in the year, but for 52 weeks. They have a right to look to this Government to bring forward a policy designed to relieve them from the dire straits in which so many now find themselves. One has only to go to La Pcrouse, close to Sydney, to find that the aboriginals are much better housed than the dole-workers"" who reside there. If that is not an insult to the unemployed, I do not know what is.  ployed are living in houses constructed of wattle and daub.",39
95,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,That is so. How can the mothers of Australia be expected to rear families in such surroundings?,40
96,Mr LANE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Are there no slums Tasmania?,40
97,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Unfortunately, expect there arc slums in Tasmania, but I mind the honourable member that there are slums even in this capital city.",40
98,Mr MCCALL,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"""Where ?",40
99,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"At the Causeway. I heard a reverend gentleman preaching in one of the churches in Canberra on Sunday, and during his discourse he said that the existence of these slums in the national capital of Australia was a grace to civilization, and to the Prime Minister and his Government. right honourable gentleman himself listened to that discourse, and he must have known that thp charge that he had neglected to make adequate provision for the better housing of the unfortunate people living in those slums was a just one. One has only to consider the striking contrast between the hoveb in which the unemployed and dole workers In my have to live, and the palatial homes of wealthy people.  concerned at the fate of the unemployed ?",40
100,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"H o is not; at present he is more concerned with retaining his position as head of the Government, in order to prevent the reins of government falling into the hands of honourable members on this side of the House, than in facing up to the unemployment position. To illustrate the burden imposed on the State governments by the necessity for having to make provision for the relief of unemployment, I cite the following figures relating to annual collections of wages tax and special income tax devoted to unemployment relief by the various States:New South Wales .. 8,049,283 Victoria 1,934,439 Queensland .. 2.783,574 Western Australia 1,319,211 Tasmania 354,683 No figures are available for South Australia, but it will be seen that, from the five States mentioned, no less than £13,000,000 is collected annually for the relief of unemployment. These are staggering figures, which reveal how imperative it is that the Commonwealth should assist the States to meet their enormous expenditure on unemployment relief. in Only by making adequate provision for the relief of the unemployed can we their families to grow into strong reand virile Australians willing and able to fight for the defence of their country in time of need. How can we expect the semi-starved children of dole workers to respond to a call for the defence of the country in time of need ? What has the Government done to meet this position? I listened this afternoon with a great deal of interest to the Minisdister for Works (Mr Thorby) recite the list of public works that are to be underThe taken during this financial yoar. I found, as I expected, that whereas large sums of money are to be expended on new works in some States, others are to enjoy very little. I have no doubt that the expenditure of large sums of money in New South Wales and the northern parts of Australia is justified, but that does not excuse the paucity of the public works provision for some of the States. I charge the Government with responsibility for failing to put into immediate operation its public works programme. Recently a slump has developed in the building trade in Australia, and if the Government gave immediate effect to its public works programme, much of the effect of a stoppage of operations in the building trade could be avoided, with the result that the States would be relieved of any addition to their already staggering burden for the relief of unemployment. The Government has not put into operation an effective works programme. The present Minister for Works, who was formorly Minister for Defence, has failed to do his job. Almost twelve months ago he told me that insufficient qualified technical men were available to prepare plans and specifications for many big works tli at were in prospect. I then asked him to seek the co-operation of the State .governments in order that their quantity surveyors, architects and draughtsmen might be made available to the Commonwealth to assist in the preparatory work. The honourable gentleman did not take any definite action in this direction until last week, and today gave an answer that it had been done. How can we be expected, in such circumstances, to believe that Government really intends to proceed with its works programme? The 1938 report issued by the Director of the International Labor Office makes it very clear that military operations do not vide any permanent solution for unemployment. It is true that in certain countries today many men are being absorbed in various arms of the military service, and many others are being engaged to manufacture munitions; but the director makes it clear that if this policy is pursued for long it must ultimately lead to the worse depression the world has ever known - I strongly believe in the policy advocated by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), who declared some time ago that a constructive works programme of long range is essential in order to ensure security for the people. Recruiting and armaments making are no solution to the unemployment problem. In any case, I am totally opposed to the enlistment of men in the army unless they are paid good wages. We should pay a reasonable' wage to men who enlist for service at our forts or elsewhere, and give them a good pension upon retirement.",40
101,Mr RANKIN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Is the honourable member in favour of compulsory military training ?,41
102,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I am in favour of the enlistment of sufficient men to man our forts and to form the nucleus of an army. Such men should be paid a reasonable wage. So loifg as we have a large army of unemployed people in this country we shall find it difficult to obtain recruits for defence purposes. It cannot be expected that men on the dole will defend jobs which they cannot get. If the Government would offer a fair wage to recruits for the army it would have no difficulty at all in enlisting 65,000 men. I protest strongly against the practice adopted in certain departments of the Commonwealth Public Service of permitting overtime to be' worked, particularly while many young men find it impossible to obtain, jobs. Some time ago, I asked the Attorney-'General to give me details of the amount paid for overtime work to officers of the Patent Department in-the last twelve months. I was astounded the to learn that the staff of this department received more than £4,000 in overtime in one year. I then communicated with the Chairman of the Public Service Board pro- to ascertain the salaries of the men in the Patent Department who had received large amounts in overtime. I was amazed to discover that many of them were receiving high salaries. It seems to me that some members of the Commonwealth Public Service to whom overtime is payable are exploiting the position. We know very well that in some other branches of the service no overtime is payable, although much may be worked. The following table gives the salaries of certain officers of the Patent Department who received amounts in excess of £100 is overtime last year. The asterisk at the end of the line indicates that the officers so identified also received child endowment. In effect, the list shows that seventeen of the officers concerning whom details are given have received amounts substantially in excess of £100 a year in overtime although some have no families to support:Salary. Overtime paid. i £ 040 170 1 11 550 131 7 3 490 118 18 7* 478 123 19 1* . 124 112 O S* 550 144 14 '.) 4i)0 .. 120 0 2 490 130 12 11* 550 130 10 10 550 120 4 10 '490 130 12 11* 424 107 14 10* 532 133 15 7 478 123 19 2* 49(1 132 1 2* 478 1.10 10 10 490 110 2 1* 490 130 2 9 -190 12ti n l i * ."">50 134 4 0 550 14.1 n 4 550 132 n O 4.90 132 5 0 490 131 3 11 550 141 9 5 550 135 15 8 49fi 120 5 8 It is not fair that men receiving such big salaries should be allowed to work so much overtime, while many young men cannot obtain appointments. We areall well aware that in these days the parents often sacrifice their own pleasures to a. very great degree in order that their'children may sit for the intermediate and leaving certificate examination's, and then pass on to a university. It is deplorable that, after attaining such - in educational standard many young people should be thrown on the industrial scrap-heap. About 90,000 Australian-boys and girls leave school each .year. Of these, about 40,000 are absorbed in industry. The remaining 50,000 find, it extremely difficult to get a job of any kind. When I have complained about the amount of overtime being worked in some branches.of the Public Service, I have been told, ""We cannot fill the positions."" Frankly, I do not believe it. I urge the Commonwealth J/r. Mnhnncii. authorities to consult the education authorities of the various States todevise ways and means by which young people approaching the school-leaving age may obtain some vocational guidance and special training to fit them to fill serviceable positions in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. I cannot help complaining again about the amount of overtime being - worked in the Patent Department. s. d. I admit that the Attorney-Genera i (Mr. Menzies) has said to me, "" It-is not good ; it must cease "" ; but I ask for effective action to be taken without delay. I shall not "" let up "" on this issue. Next year I shall ask similar questions, but I hope that I shall receive answers much more satisfactory to me. We should not permit men without families to earn such large amounts of money by overtime when many bread-winners of families are forced to walk the streets in idleness, with a consequent deterioration of their morale and general outlook. The Government has assured us that it desires to adopt appropriate ways and. means to increase the birth rate in this country, but, as things are, it seems to me that the workers, at any rate, are offered very little inducement to rear families. The attitude of honourable members opposite towards the unemployed was shown very clearly this afternoon when they refused to permit the subject to be discussed at any reasonable length. The Government wanted to. close the mouths, of the Opposition so that they would be unable to ventilate the grievances of the unemployed. What is the Government going. to offer the unemployed this Christmas? There will bo no Christmas pudding this year.",41
103,Mr LAZZAKINI,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Many of them did not get it last year.,42
104,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes , some of them told rae that they did not get even an apple dumpling. Yet, while thousands of men .are out of .work, and theii families are unprovided for, the Government has increased the salaries of the Ministers by £1,600, and they will be able to buy the best for their families. This is the sort of thing that will bring about a class war. Who could blame the .workers if they revolted against such damnable conditions? At. the present time, thousands of men are walking the streets almost barefooted looking for work. Many of them bave been evicted from their homes because they cannot pay their rem. I do not blame the men who own the houses; I blame the Government which fails to ensure that every man with ii family has a roof over his head. Every one who is willing to work should liave a home. Conditions in Sydney at the present time are disgraceful, prob-' ably the worse in Australia. There one sees hundreds of families living in tents, and no effort is being made to provide them with decent houses in which to rear their children. My purpose is to look after those whom I represent in this House. The Government of Tasmania cannot carry out the various public works which would provide relief for unoinployment, because the Commonwealth insists that it shall co-operate in a defence programme. The Commonwealth, in its turn, promised that Tasmania should have its snare of defence work, and the Minister told us the other day that £74,000 was to be expended in Tasmania. I remind him, however, that, of this amount £34,000 was passed last year, yet the works have not yet been commenced. The Government of Tasmania cannot carry the burden of unemployment alone. Upon reading the Commonwealth labour report, I find that the only thing that has been done by the Government is that in 1934 it agreed to the raising of a loan of. £7,000,000,. as part of a programme of £15,000,000, for the carrying out of reproductive works. In that year, Sir 'Frederick Stewart was appointed Under Secretary in charge of unemployment, hut in February, 1936, he resigned, and no wonder. He was unwilling to carry on the position when the Government had nothing to put up to him. All the Commonwealth has done is to lend money to the State governments with which to pay interest on money raised by them through the Loan Council for the relief of unemployment. . We know that in Canberra, the position in regard to housing is disgraceful. Civil servants are being brought to Canberra when there are no houses for them and their families. I am glad that they are refusing to go into the slums at Molonglo and the Causeway, where it is so hot in the houses in the summer time that the wife does not. have to light the fire in order to roast the meat; it can be roasted in the heat from the corrugated iron roof. There is no hope for the unemployed until the Commonwealth Government agrees to co-operate with the States in n programme for unemployment relief that will enable the youth of the country to participate in industry. The young men of Australia are entitled to share in the good things of life that honourable members are able to enjoy because we get good salaries. If we wish our youth to be a force in production, and to be prepared to defend the country in time of need, they should be put in the * way of earning a decent living for themselves. Make no mistake, the burden of the defence of Australia will fall on the young men; very few over 40 years of age will take any part. At the present time, in the big cities, employers take on boys of sixteen years of age, work them for four years, and then, when they arc approaching 21, and would be entitled to an adult wage, they are dismissed, and must join the ranks of the unemployed. This should not bo permitted. They should be kept in employment, because they are the most important assets the Commonwealth possesses. In regard to immigration, I claim that, while there is a shortage of work in Australia for our own people, wo should be very careful regarding the admission of others from outside. I hope that the Government will not admit a large number of immigrants while men are walking the streets of the cities looking for jobs. A careful watch should be kept on thoso entering the country to ensure that they are of a type worthy of Australia. Sitting suspended'from 6.15 until 8 p.m..",42
105,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The Government was returned at the last election with a majority in both Houses on a promise that it would cope with the unemployment problem, but, despite the fact that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) has urged upon the Government a plan to absorb the unemployed and to prevent the recurrence of a depression, - it has done nothing. Indeed, since this Government has been in power, we have had from it nothing but promises, and it foems that that is all the future has in store. Sweden is the only country in the world which has planned for the future. Tho report of the International Labour Organization contains the following interesting passage:It is therefore to some extent reassuring that the discussion of measures to maintain the volume of employment in times of depression has continued to attract a great deal of attention. It is significant that, in spite high level of prosperity which the country now enjoys, the Government of Sweden has continued its systematic effort to frame plans for meeting the next depression. A committee wus 0 set up at the beginning of last year by the Minister for Social Affairs to consider schemes for dealing with unemployment in times of economic crises. The committee undertook a complete survey of all public works, whether government or municipal, which might be put in hand for this purpose. They recommended that a large number of projects should be kept in reserve which could he started as soon as unemployment again threatened to become serious. It would be well if the Commonwealth Government followed Sweden's lead. Ministers were not backward last week when they committed the atrocity of the salary grab, but they are loth to do anything which would enable the workers of Australia to have decent houses in which to rear their children, and decent conditions of life which would enable those children to be reared under more reasonable conditions than are provided by the dole system of today. There is ""no excuse for the failure of the Government to grapple with the problem, because it has had enormous resources of revenue at its disposal. It has no public works projects. The war that might bave saved its face in this respect was averted, and the Ministry stands condemned in the eyes of the people. 'The workers are despondent, because this Government, which has squandered thousands and thousands of pounds on things of no economic value to Australia, such as journeys abroad for the Ministers, has left the problem of unemployment to the States. Journeys by Ministers might be justifiable, if they achieved results; but the three Ministers who recently were abroad for the purpose of negotiating a trade treaty came back empty-handed. l f r . Mahoney.  The honourable member's time has expired.",43
106,Mr HUTCHINSON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Deakin) [8.6] I intend to confine my remarks to two subjects: first, defence, which gave its name to this budget, and, secondly, a subject, closely allied to defence, but not of such moment-migration . A great deal of the concern that is being expressed today by the public - and of of the the criticism that has been directed against the Government in respect of defence is to a certain degree mis-timed; because defence entered the minds of this Government in the early days of its existence. As soon as money became available as the result of increased earnings by the Treasury from the improved economic conditions,' the Government immediately began to tackle the defence problem. It can look back with satisfaction on the fact that in the early days of its career it set aside £4,000,000 as a trust fund for the purchase of defence equipment. Honourable members can also call to mind that two or three years ago, when concern was expressed about the inability of Australia to obtain first-class fighting aircraft, the then Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill, to whom great credit is due, investigated the possibility of the manufacture of aircraft in Australia, with the result that we have today at Fisherman's Bend a. factory for the supply of aircraft to the Royal Australian Air Force. More today than at any other time in our history, except in the ""great war, the people of Australia are interested in the subject of defence. They, have been called out of the apathy from which they should have been called long ago. This concern for adequate defence is typical of the British people throughout the British Empire. The people of this country, in common with the people of Great Britain, desire a more vigorous defence policy, one that will not only guarantee security, but also make the Empire so powerful as to abroad enable it to speak in the councils of the world in such a way as to counteract the policies of certain other powers. In September, there was a crisis of such magnitude that, until the eleventh hour, it appeared that Australia would, with the rest of the world, be, against its wish, involved in war. It was realized then that we possessed an inadequate navy-in fact some naval vessels were in dock undergoing an overhaul and, consequently, were incapable of putting to sea. It was also alarming to find that the Royal Australian Air Force did not possess one aeroplane which could be described as strictly modern, and that, with the exception of a small permanent force to man our fixed defences, there was no military force to safeguard Australia against an attack by a raiding force. When these facts percolated into the minds of the people there was a sudden awakening among them to the need of the country. Almost since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles certain countries have adopted a policy which cannot be described as other than armed blackmail. That policy has on every occasion been successful. I ' cite, for example, Vilna, Corfu, Manchuria, Abyssinia, Austria, and Spain. Who will doubt that Germany and Italy have not had more than a finger in the Spanish conflict pie? Undoubtedly they aim at power in the Mediterranean. The culmination took place at Munich where we had what, in some respects, was a. sorry spectacle of three nations meeting to determine what should be done to Czechoslovakia, a small democracy which, since its inception, had been loyal to the spirit of democracy, and had treated its minorities better than minorities are treated by any other country in Europe-undoubtedl y better than they are treated in Germany, the country which demanded some reparation for the disabilities which it alleged were suffered by the German minority in Czechoslovakia. Germany is today treating a minority within its population in a way which is an affront to God and man. On the debit side two things emerged from the Munich discussions: first, that the small country of Czechoslovakia was to be carved into pieces for the benefit of the larger country of Germany, and secondly, a loss of prestige of democracy throughout Central Europe. On the credit side we have to take into consideration that, for the first time in world polities since the policy of armed blackmail was adopted, the democracies came [23 NOVEMBER, 1938.] 1938-39. 1943 to the point of discussing terms and prepared, if necessary, to back their demands by force. That aspect possibly marks the turning point in world, affairs in what may be termed the post-war era. We have to remember, however, that on every occasion the policy of power politics has been attempted it has been successful and the prelude to a further step forward. After the Munich conference the Prime Minister of Great Britain returned with what was thought to be a policy of peace within our time; but recent world events are such that peace is again threatened. Democracies are being played by Germany one against another in a very clever manner. In the matter of colonial possessions that nation is even attempting to play the dominions against one another in order to weaken the British Empire. In the East and in the Mediterranean trouble might easily occur. With these facts before us is it any wonder that the Australian - people are demanding an efficient defence policy? For some time we have been carrying on under the voluntary system, and we pay tribute to those public-spirited youths of the militia forces who render such valuable service to their country. In dealing with the present system, and particularly the period in which trainees are in camp, I shall enumerate some of the faults of the system; because it is only by so doing that we can effect improvement. Under the present voluntary system the training period is only twelve days a year, although it has been suggested that that period is to be increased by six days. In criticizing the present system I am not speaking, of course, from the point, of view of a military man; I am endeavouring to discuss the problem in a common ,*ense way. [Quorum formcd.-\ If a - soldier can be trained in fourteen days, or even three weeks, I have no hesitation in saying that it must be a "" mug's job"", because I know^ very few avocations in which a person can be brought up to a state of efficiency in such a short period. I would not even suggest that a man could be regarded as competent to milk cows after fourteen days' experience in the cow-yard. However, I know that a soldier's task is by no means a simple one. and that ample time must be provided for. training purposes. I remind honourable members that a few d-ys ago Major General Squires, when referring to a contemplated increase of the militia forces from 35,000 to 70,000, said that to have a militia force of 70,000 men does not means that we shall have 70,000 trained soldiers. That is the first fault that I have to find with the present system; we are not producing trained men. Moreover, only 60 per cent, of the men ' enrolled in the militia attend camps regularly, and during the half-day camps the personnel varies considerably. What efficiency can be expected under such a system? By increasing the numbers we enlarge the system, but we are not iucrcasing its efficiency. It is a colossal waste of money to embark upon a more extensive scheme of voluntary training when the basis on which it - is built is unsound. We should get down to sound principles and remove some of the faults that exist. It will be useless to induce increased numbers to join the militia unless the men are properly trained. I should prefer to see a force taken from the 70,000 of 20,000 or even 10,000 men who would sign a definite contract to place themselves under military orders and to attend a camp for at least three months in the first year, three weeks in the second year and a fortnight, as a refresher course, in the third year. The others could be learning the fundamental work of the military system. If that policy were adopted, we would then have at least a number of fairly well-trained men. Under the compulsory system trainees were brought to camp and made to fulfil their obligations, but there is nothing under the present voluntary system which places men who do not attend on the days set aside for training under military orders and makes them subject to military control. I can see no reason why this defect cannot be remedied. It would simply mean the signing of a contract that would embody ' military discipline by the military trainee. It is only by compelling the full complement to attend regularly for training purposes that any progress can bo made and an efficient service established. If there is to changing personnel, and a marked variatfr. Hutchinson. tion in the knowledge possessed by trainees, progress is denniteiy hampered. One of the best features of the compulsory system is that a record is kept of the names of trainees, their physical condition, their occupations and, should the occasion arise, the centres at which they are to report. Such groundwork must be of inestimable value in the event of a crisis. The system which is known as the national register could be adopted under the present scheme and so achieve as near as possible the same results. Again, a small standing army might be provided. I believe that honourable members on this side of the chamberalthough they may ""not believe in the present system-woul d be willing to help the present drive for additional trainees if something of the kind suggested were adopted, because they would have the knowledge that, in doing so, they would be assisting to establish a force that would be of some value to Australia. By merely strengthening the militia on the present basis, we are merely tinkering with the problem, and preventing the establishment of an effective force. In. (September last, we were faced with a crisis almost overnight, and another similar crisis may come upon us at any time. In these circumstances, Australia should have a military force sufficiently strong to repel an invader. I have always supported the compulsory system, but have believed until recently that, with our limited means, we could not carry out the policy effectively. During recent months it has been suggested that we should adopt a single age unit. It appears now that it is practicable for us to embark upon this system, but, once again, efficiency must be secured. My idea is that we should take youths of 18 years of age, an age when military training would interfere least - with their private lives and one at which they would be much more susceptible to the assimilation of military knowledge than any other, and train them in camp for three solid months with a refresher course of three weeks during the next year and a further refresher course of a fortnight in the following year. That would ensure that we would have a reasonably well-trained army always at be a the beck and call of Australia for its defence in time of emergency. If that system were adopted, youths could be trained cheaply to a high state of efficiency and would be ready to give a good account of themselves if the need arose. It might still be necessary, of course, to have, as I said earlier, some small standing force. Mr Liddell Hart, a well-known writer on military tactics, dealing with the professional army that is always available in case of need, and always in constant training, as against the citizen or conscript army which is trained only for a sufficient period to allow of real proficiency being exhibited, writes:A professional army may be reckoned as ready for instant action and as tetter trained. The importance of training has increased with the elaboration and mechanization of modern warfare, but, on the other hand, i : is not so purely military. Thus a civil technician, of many kinds, may have an increased militar y value and adaptability. This fact benefits the country with a conscript army according to its industrial development. Again, the latter can expand its strength far more, and fur more rapidly. Classes of conscripts who have completed their "" a c t i v e "" service within recent years, and are receiving annual refreshers, can take the field efficiently almost .at onre. In the opinion of that gentleman, it appears a system that provides for adequate training, but which does not necessarily mean a standing army with all the expense involved, may be the best and cheapest system for Australia to adopt. Even though I believe that the compulsory system is the only proper and correct one to adopt, I am prepared to help forward the voluntary system as the second best scheme, but I sincerely hope that when the Government announces shortly the improvement of its present militia system, it will initiate a system which will take us along the road to efficiency, one that we can arenuinely support, conscious of the knowledge that we are doing something to satisfy the Australian people on this most important point of policy and settle their fears to some degree by the provision of an efficient force to look after the security of this country. I pass now to migration, which is a subject, as I said earlier, very closely allied to the subject of defence. One of the most striking points in the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) on the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill was that if the present birth-rate in Australia is maintained, the population of this country, forty years from now, will begin to decline. That is by no means an outlook which we can face with equanimity.",44
107,Mr HOSE VEAR,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,What is the honourable member proposing to do about it?,47
108,Mr HUTCHINSON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"It is not an outlook which we can face, as some honourable members opposite do, in a highspirit of levity as if it were of no moment that this country should be more densely populated. The present immigration policy is designed to endeavour to attract to Australia people of British stock. I am quite in agreement with that policy, as indeed most honourable members are, but we must realise that in the Old Country, and, in fact, in most civilized parts of the world, the birth-rate is also falling. Unfortunately, it seems, that the birth-rate falls along with the advance of civilized education. In a recent book entitled, The Future British Empire, the  survey of the question, said that on present indications the population of ' England and Wales will have declined by 1975 to 31,480,000. If that is a fact-and after all one has to pay a certain amount of regard to figures of this descriptionand with the knowledge that other parts of the British Empire are also in urgent need of increased population, it appears to me that if Ave arc to increase Australia's population to the maximum it is capable of carrying, that is, between 30,000,000 and 40,000,000",47
109,Mr BRENNAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Oh !,47
110,Mr HUTCHINSON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Apparently the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan), who comes from the city of Melbourne, judges the absorptive capacity of a country by the miles of paved streets, and the number of brick buildings and alleys in the cities. I believe that the capacity of any country to carry a population is the extent of its natural resources in the shape of minerals, and the capacity of its agricultural areas. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that I believe Australia could carry a population of between 30,000,000 and 40,000,000 on a fairly high standard of comfort. If that is the position, and assuming that the present position as we know it today in Great Britain continues, we have to face the fact that if we are to increase the population of this country to its capacity, we cannot confine ourselves to migrants of British stock, and we shall have to permit aliens to come to Australia to help us do the job. That will mean the lowering of the British content of tralia, but it would be within the power of this Parliament from time to time to fix the .point below which we would not allow the British content to fall. ""We should be thinking along these lines at the present time. Having decided fo admit foreign migrants, the question is the type to be selected and the basis upon which they should be admitted. principle we are applying to immigration today is one of admitting, first of all, British stock, ""and then, so long as certain landing money is in the possession of migrants, to allow them to come into Australia by the consent of the Minister for the Interior. Any variation of that very anaemic policy goes from the Minister to the Cabinet room, and from the Cabinet room to this House. We have, however, no really long-term policy on this subject. To-day we have the spectacle of a steady stream of immigrants of a type which the majority of the people of Australia do not want. There are two main theories in the world regarding the policy of race?, the theory in Germany of complete Aryan purity, and the policy of the open door adopted by the United States of America, a policy of "" no d iscrimination "" which has resulted in people pouring into the United States of America from all countries of the world, leading to a most peculiar position. The United States of America has become a nation almost incapable of being able to adopt any distinct straight line on foreign policy, and having other difficulties of an almost insuperable character. I do not believe either of these theories. On the contrary, I believe that there is a middle course which might be pursued. We have to look at the history of the British race, from whence we .have sprung, to try to obtain a sensible con-, w.ption of what our policy in regard to Mr Hutchinson. immigration should be. Honourable members are aware that if they are to look for the home of the Anglo-Saxon stock, they have to look a good way from the United Kingdom. The Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Danes came from the continent, aud Britain was invaded by these races in succession. Last of all came the Norman conquest, and out of this admixture of races Auswas evolved this great imperial race which is now known as the race of the British peoples. The British peoples therefore came from a mixture of races who were conquerors, and were peoples of a fine type who readily blended to produce a great people. I i we are to seek an increase of the 2>opulation of this country, we should allow it to be populated if not The wholly, at lea3t to the greatest degree, by people who will readily mix with us, inter-marry with us, and who over the years will gradually absorb into one entity. This being the case, I think we have sooner or. later to adopt a quota system as applied to immigration. I do not mean that we should adopt a quota system of the sort adopted by the United States of America, under which migrants equal to 2 per cent, of the present population; divided into races, are admitted. If wo applied such a policy as that, Ave would be merely working away from the desired end. Again the migration system in the United States of America depends for its existence on most expensive consular machinery in all parts of the world, machinery which we could ""not afford. My idea is that we should fix the percentage of types of migrants that should be admitted on a basis agreed upon. Let me put the position more clearly. Suppose we decide to admit to Australia year by year 25 per cent, only of Southern Europeans of the total number of mi- grants offering. It would not matter very much how many alien migrants came into Australia, we would admit in them in the proportion of approximately three of Nordic extraction to one of Southern European extraction. I think this is a most important subject. There is, in Australia, at the present time, a gentleman who has recently returned from New York as Australian Trade Commissioner for the United ' States of America. I refer to Mr Dow. Not long ago I heard a broadcast over the national network on this subject by Mr Dow. He said, in effect, that if large numbers of Southern Europeans were allowed to enter Australia it would result in a serious .interference with our standards ofliving and culture. He spoke from a wide experience of the United States of America, which country could probably teach us more than any other country of the world on this subject. Yet"", apparently, it is proposed to allow Southern Europeans to enter Australia in practically any numbers, although they do not readily, absorb with the Australian people. I am not so fearful as some honourable gentlemen opposite about the effect of immigration on unemployment. I am much more fearful that we may reach a condition of stagnation in Australia. If we do so, we shall faced with a more serious unemployment problem than is ever likely to develop otherwise. Stagnation in national affairs undoubtedly causes depression. If the policy which I am advocating were adopted no damage need necessarily bo done to our relations with other countries of the world. If we decided, for example, to limit the number of Southern 'Europeans entering this country in accordance with some quota system which has relation to Nordic countries, or even which has relation to the comparative populations of different countries, international antagonisms need not be awakened. I assert emphatically that Ave should not continue to admit into Australia the people of other races without having a considered policy on the subject. If we do so, we shall create a problem similar to that of the United States of America. Further, a policy in regard to this subject must have associated with it some definite principles to ensure that the aliens shall be distributed throughout the Commonwealth. They should not be allowed to settle in national groups in different places and there develop their national characteristics and traditions if such a position can be avoided. One of the most effective ways to sure the assimilation, of alien peoples with our own is a common press. I say ""emand phatically and distinctly, after some sonal experience of the United States America, and some consultation with people overseas who have studied this problem, that we should not allow newspapers to be published in Australia in foreign languages. To-day newspapers are being published in the Italian language in north Queensland, and streets in our towns even bear Italian names. It is an altogether wrong policy to permit the development of these tendencies. We need a national press which will express the national sentiment. I have no desire to interfere with the culture of the Italian people, or of the people of any other foreign country. I would not place an embargo on the importation of foreign books, newspapers and magazines, and would not interfere with the teaching of foreign languages in our schools. In fact, I should like to see bilingualism practised in Australia far more bo than it is today; I believe Australia will absorb people more through a common press than by any other means. When I was in Canada some little time ago I was surprised-and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Frost) can bear me out in this-to discover that after some hundreds of years there were politicians, in the provincial parliaments who could not address their audiences in English. They spoke in French, and a French that was far from pure at that.",47
111,Mr FROST,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Is not the honourable member aware that a newspaper is published in English in Eussia?,49
112,Mr HUTCHINSON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes ; if is a propagandist "" r a g "" intended to distort the minds of unthinking English travellers in Eussia. The problem which I am now discussing has developed to unhealthy dimensions in South - Africa, and has even been observed in some degree in New Guinea. I know'that steps were in contemplation to curb the publication of a newspaper in a foreignlanguage in that territory. The best way to assimilate people of a foreign race is to oblige them to read a common press. Our newspapers should enbe published in English. They should express the traditions of the British race, describe our mode of living and manperner of thinking. Wc shall make a fundaof mental error, such as was made in the United States of America, if we the publication of newspapers in this country in foreign languages, and keep alive minority elements that may seriously disturb our national unity.",49
113,The CHAIRMAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The honourable I member's time has expired.,50
114,Mr LAZZARINI,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Werriwa) [8.52] 1I have no desire to follow the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) through the pages of history, and ideals of the Australian people, and his referhas ence to Australian culture. I am an tralian, but I remind the honourable ber for Deakin that one of the countries which he saw fit to traduce to-night enjoying the advantages of arts, science and culture when his forbears in Britain could have been found running about in rage because their loin cloths might have been stolen. The jurisprudence legal structure of this country, after 2,000 years of Christianity, are based the Justinian code of pagan Honourable members who presume to discuss matters of public interest, and particularly the culture and civilization other countries, should at least provide themselves with a reliable historical backon ground. I wish now to refer briefly to the consistent attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) and his Government respectman ing the export of pig iron and iron from Australia. The right honourable "" gentleman has told us that the embargo upon the export of iron ore was imposed because of the danger that Australia might run short of supjriies. Yet Government is apparently prepared allow pig iron to be exported. Personally, I can see no difference between the when the resources of Australia are brought into the question. The plain is that a huge monopoly which dictates squalor of a tenement? « the policy of the Government is, aprelate parently, to be allowed to export pig and iron ore whenever it wishes to do and to wherever it wis'hes to send it. particular monopoly is not interested Yampi Sound. ' Let me make my own position clear. I am totally opposed the export of pig iron or iron ore from this country to countries which may it to manufacture guns that might later be turned upon our own people, just as permit guns manufactured by the armament firms of Great Britain and sold to the Turks prior to the last war were afterwards turned upon British and Australian soldiers. The Government's attitude on this subject is totally inconsistent. n one breath, it declares that iron ore must not be exported because it would deplete our own supplies; and in the next breath it says that a certain monopoly may export pig iron. I strongly object to a huge commercial enterprise, which paid tens of thousands of pounds into Austhe party funds of the United Australia memparty and the Country party, and which at election time provides motor cars for was United Australia party and Country party candidates to tour through their electorates, being allowed to recoup itself for a expenses so incurred by the sale of pig iron to foreign countries. I believe that and it is only because this particular company supports the Government parties on financially it has been granted perRome. mission to export pig iron. The budget is, I suppose, really the of foundation of the economy of the nation. Before proceeding to state my own views the provisions of the budget now before us, I .wish to refer to some loose phrases used, by the honourable member for inWarringah (Mr Spender) in his speech a few days ago. The honourable gentlepunctuated his utterance with ore such phrases as ""scientific balance"", scientific financial policy "", "" scientific government"" and the like. He read the committee a very interesting lecture on the necessity for science in government. the Let mo ask him a few questions. How to does he relate a scientific balance to an individual with an income of £20,000 two a year, and another on the dole; or to a citizen living in a palace or a fact mansion, and another living in the How does he scientific government to the sendiron ing to market by a market gardener of so, five truck loads of goods and the subseThis quent payment by the same individual of in £5 or £10 in agent's fees, although he has 'not received, a penny in return for his to goods? What part does science play in the fact that tons of thousands of little use children in this country are suffering from malnutrition and rickets because they cannot get sufficient milk and fruit although thousands of gallons of milk are fed to hogs every week, and tons of fruit are allowed to rot under the trees in our orchards? How can the honourable gentleman expect that these unfortunate children will ever grow to be strong and virile citizens of this country, and desirable parents of a future generation? Tens of thousands of children in our industrial areas are thirsting for milk and hungering for fruit, but their fathers cannot earn enough money to provide them with the bare necessaries of life. I. ask the honourable gentleman also how it is that, although science has developed powerful and wonderful machinery for use in industry, which permits a given number of workers to manufacture a thousandfold more goods in a given time than their forbears wore able to do 1.00 years ago, tens of thousands of workers in Australia today are hungry and cold through unemployment, and live in habitations not fit for animals? If the honourable member had a real desire to apply scientific principles in national affairs, ho would ally himself with the members of the Labour party, and with other organizations throughout this country which are striving for the adoption of scientific methods to control tribution as well as production. science that has evolved the aeroplane that soars through the sky, the submarine that passes through the depths of the sea, the wireless and a thousand and one other inventions, is capable, if rightly directed, of controlling the means of production and distribution in this country nnd in others so that no human being need be hungry, or workless, or without shelter. In short, I ask the honourable member for Warringah if he will scientifically balance against the squalor that breeds vice and crime and sickness the wallowing wealth that parades itself before poverty and unemployment, until, suffering from a jaded palate, it indulges in the abominations of which we hear from time to time. Tho whole crazy system reminds me of the madman who thought he was a grain of corn, .and ran away when he saw a fowl, lest he bo swallowed. The crowning absurdity is that all the evils and tragedies in our national life arise, not because nature is niggardly, not because we cannot produce enough, but because the storehouses are too full, because, in fact, we produce too much. In the native state, when nature is bountiful to the uncivilized savage, he lives in comfort and security. He has a good time, in other words. When nature is bountiful to civilized man, he lives in destitution. For a large section of the community, the more bountiful nature is, the greater is the destitution. . I remind the honourable member that there can be no scientific solution of this chaotic anarehy until we approach the problem in the proper way. Science would equate the resources of the country and the needs of humanity. It would first set out to measure the resources of the country, and to ascertain the requirements of the people. Then it would apply man-power, plus machinery, to the national resources, and produce for the needs of all and the profit of none. Woe to the money changer and the profit-monger when science is applied properly to government ! Science will take no cognizance of profits or individuals. It will measure the resources of the country, and say to those who govern, "" There are the means of production; go to it, and produce plenty for all"". I ask the honourable mem; ber for Warringah, and others who mouth dis- platitudes, if this is what they mean The when they speak of science in government. If it is, they should not be supporting the Government. If it is not. their words are meaningless; they arc as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. I was amused when the Treasurer (Mr Casey) said to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (3tfr. Forde) that he could not make known the requests of the State governments for loan money for public works, because that was the business of the States, and not of this Parliament. I maintain that it is the business of this Parliament, because it is this Government, acting through the Loan Council, that has withheld from the States the loan moneys needed to carry out their works programmes. It is the action of this Government, in co-operation with the conservatively-controlled Commonwealth Bank, which prevents the States from obtaining money to be used for productive purposes and for public works. The proof of this lies in the fact that, between 1934 and 1937, the council has refused applications for £87,000,000 of loan money. It is the business of this Parliament to tell the Treasurer, and the Government, that the money needed for public works must be found. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was speaking on the budget, he asked what was wrong with Australia. Somebody on the other side of the House, in an asinine way, replied "" Nothing"", and his interjection was greeted by his colleagues over there with the loud faugh that bespeaks the vacant mind. The first thing needed to put Australia right is to find a permanent solution of the unemployment problem-no t Christmas buns or puddings, not a dole aft Christmas time-though , however small it might be, it would be welcome. The welfare of Australia, demands that this problem, be solved. The Minister for Works (Mr. Thorby) this afternoon said that there would always be unemployment and, like Pilate, he washed his hands of the affair. He said that we could minimize the evil, but that we must make up our minds that unemployment would be always with us. As a former leader of the honourable gentleman's party once said, the people must get used to unemployment. "" If this Government remains in office much longer, the people will have become used to unemployment"". The first thing to do to solve the lem is to reorganize on scientific lines financial structure of the country, including all the ramifications of public and private finance. We need to have, spread throughout the country, tens of thousands of small, self-contained farms, occupied by men properly established on the land, and not carrying huge mortgages from the associated banks, and getting a dole every now and then from the Government so that they may pay their interest to the banks. We need properly distributed, self-reliant, and self-contained rural industries. We need to do a great deal more in the way of water conservation. Tens of millions of pounds should be spent on this work. In the early part of this I travelled for thousands of miles through drought-stricken country where the sheej) were dying like flies. Those adverse seasons. that remained alive were too poor to Mr Laasarini. travel a couple of miles to the river for water, and had to be taken there in trucks. Yet the river runs through all this country. I left behind the irrigation areas of Leeton, Yanco and Griffith, and within a few miles came to the stark desert, in which there was hardly a leaf left on the trees, and there was nothing bnt sand and desolation in all directions. Yet I had just left the place where there was such striking evidence of what irrigation could achieve. The trouble is that thousands of square miles of this country are occupied by the squattocracy, and if one asks them why they did not install an oil engine to pump water from the river and irrigate a few hundred acres on which to grow lucerne to feed their sheep, they would reply ""We are squatters, not farmers"". They are too proud to farm the land. Well, if they are too proud to use' the land, I would put them off it, and I would prosecute them for cruelty to animals if they let their sheep die of starvation when they could be so easily saved by the growing of a little lucerne.",50
115,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,But the authorities are now preventing .the pumping of water.,52
116,Mr LAZZARINI,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The honourable member is one of those of whom I have been speaking, and he is trying to find excuses for them. Restrictions have been placed on the pumping of water because probthere is just now a shortage of water in the the Burrinjuck Dam, but, at the time of which I speak, the river was high everywhere. In every country town along the liver the roses are blooming in the gardens, proving that the land will produce if only it has water, and the water is there for the taking. I have been assured that if the land is watered, it is possible to grow lucerne practically by scattering the seed on the surface of the ground.",52

Yet honourable members opposite, who prate about their pathy for the farmers, do nothing about it.

That would scientific management, of which the hondreds orable member for Warringah had so much to say. I come once more to the old question of national security. I am sick and tired of hearing in this House every one talking of defence, defence, defence; of war, blood and slaughter. It is becoming nauseous. Honourable members opposite talk of creating engines of war, when there is nothing in the country with which to propel them. The Minister Defence knows that he could not fly his aeroplanes for two days if our oil supplies from overseas were stopped. This another thing that is wrong Avitli AusI tralia.

Hundreds of thousands of additional homes are needed in Australia. We are getting back to the wretched conditions that were sudi a festering sore in civilization of the Old World a century ago, when 400 people lived in one tenement house where there was only one In the cities today, because of high rents and the shortage of houses, retwo and three families are compelled to live in one house of five or six rooms. It is only this Parliament which has the to provide the finance needed to I was astounded to see in a speciallysymprepared map of Sydney that the city' is threatened at any time with a devastating outbreak of tyj»hoid fever as the on result of the fact that a great area of the suburbs is still unsewered. Scientists the are unanimous that the only means whereby the menace of typhoid can be re£3 moved is by the sewering of cities. I it daresay that if large areas of Sydney It havp yet to be severed, the same is true of - Melbourne, Brisbane, and other AusI t is definitely built, true of a great many country towns. That is another ill in Australia's national the life which must be remedied. Despite all of the ills which I have a cited, some honourable gentlemen opposito glibly declare that there is nothing wrong be with the country. Why, we need hunof general hospitals. We need also dental hospitals for those who cannot afford to pay dental practitioners. Above all, we need maternity hospitals. It cannot be said there is nothing wrong with a country in which the facilities to cope with maternity cases are so limited as to require the shifting of mothers, within two days of their having given birth to o infants, out of their beds in the wards into tents in order that their places may be taken by women who are approaching for the great event. Honourable gentlemen opposite talk with their tongues in their cheeks about the need to increase the is population and to increase the birth rate. t is no wonder that the women of this country refuse to populate it in view of in the conditions which operate. If we want of Australian women to take the risks of peacechildbirth we must provide for them the best attention and facilities that science can provide. We need in this country the development of smaller industries and wider the distribution of production in order to check the growth of one of the worse aspects of the capitalist system, the limited liability companies. Limited liability companies are brutal manifestations of the capitalist system; they have no soul and know no words except "" profits and dividends"". In the old days, when two or three men formed proprietary companies for the manufacture of goods, the employees, if they were not satisfied with conditions, - were able to say, "" Let us go to the boss and have this trouble rectified."" But they cannot do that today, because there is no boss, merely a manager who must produce profits or lose his job. He can have no personal feelings about the wrongs that are done to the employees under his charge, because he is responsible to a soulless corporation. The speed-up systems which these companies apply are soul-destroying. Do honourable gentlemen opposite wish to develop this country for the wealth of the minority at the expense of the. health of the majority? I am led to imagine that they do, despite what the honourable  on repeated occasions, said about the profits made by one large concern. The other day the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) declared that he would not allow any profiteering in the private manufacture of munitions in this country, but when I tried to pin the right honourable gentleman down to a definition of what he considered to be profiteering, whether profiteering represented a profit of 15 cent, or 500 per cent., he evaded the tion. The Government will not stop profiteering because it will not define what profiteering is. Mast honourable members, I think, are fathers, and I ask them, when they talk about the defence of this country and about the need within the next few weeks to increase the militia to 70,000 men, whether they dispute the fact that the Australian home is the unit of Australian civilization. Australia cannot be developed into a healthy nation unless that development takes place through the homes of the people. The humblest citizen is entitled to the sanctity of a home, and anything which threatens home life threatens to drag Australian civilization Mr Laczarini. to the dust. That danger threatens today because the home life of the people is threatened by the dreadful conditions under which so many of them are compelled to subsist. In order to see the degradation of the Australian home, honourable members need go only as far as the south coast of New South Wales. Whenever honourable gentlemen on this side emphasize the need for the Commonwealth Government to take action to remove the evils that I have cited they are told by the Government that nothing can be done because there is no money available. Nothing could be further from the truth. The honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden) today spoke a lot of rot about the ratio of advances"" to deposits. The bankers create deposits and advances. When bankers create advances, they create deposits) and when they destroy one they destroy the other. The cash holding of the Australian associated banks today amounts to £20,800,000. In Australia there is only about £50,000,000 of money and £30,000,000 is always in the hands' of the people. Yet, the private banks owe the depositors £137,922,000 oh current accounts, and £236,851,000 on fixed deposit accounts, making a total of £374,733,000, to meet which they have only £20,800,000. In savings bank accounts there is deposited a total of £230,851,000, and last yoar the associated banks created false, spurious, and fictitious currency to the value of per £2,350,000,000 through their clearing queshouse instrumentalities. They arranged credits with the Commonwealth Bank and lent on them at interest, but they drew not one penny of the credits that they had arranged. In doing that they usurped the function of the Commonwealth Government, which, alone is entitled to create money. As the result of all of this, the banks have a liability of £2,955,624,000, all of which has been created on the basis of cash holdings of about £20,000,000. The banks are able to create funds as they like, whereas the Commonwealth Government, which has behind it all of the assets of the nation, fears to apply a somewhat similar policy in the interests of the nation. Since the Bank of England was established in 1694, there has not been one banking institution which would not be made bankrupt if all of its depositors presented themselves for payment. The Commonwealth Government could, with facility, create a few hundreds of millions of pounds, which in a year or two would become tenfold as the result of the benefit that would be done to the people by the creation of this wealth.",53
120,Mr ANTHONY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,What limit would the honourable member suggest should be placed on the creation of credit by the Government ?,55
121,Mr LAZZARINI,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"My limit would be needs. The honourable member is hinting at inflation. Any person who says that it is inflation to create wealth for use in production is two ends of an economic goat. I have said that before. The primary producers today labour under a debt burden of £600,000,000. Every primary producer, except those who have inherited wealth as members of the squattocracy, is being pressed to earth by the load of debt which he carries. The Commonwealth Bank could unleash credits for the use of the Commonwealth Government, which has assets of the country to back them, and, on a basis of repayment of 3^ per cent., the debt could be discharged"" in 33 years,, or, on a basis of 5 per cent., in twenty years. Under the existing conditions, borrowings are repaid many times over and the principal never becomes less. The national debt of this country has been repaid at least twenty times in interest payments. The capital cost of the railway between Sydney and Melbourne has been paid at least seven times in interest charges, and the principal still remains a liability. The same argument applies to every other public work.",55
122,Mr GREGORY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Swan) [9.30] - The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini), who has just given a lengthy dissertation upon the evil conditions which he says exist in many Australian cities, also endeavoured to show the horrors of what he terms modern civilization. During the whole of his speech, in which he dealt at length with the manner in which credit can be provided, he failed to mention work. I should like to remind the honourable member that it is only by work that wealth can be produced, and that unless we produce wealth [CO] there can be no prosperity. His fatuous proposals to obtain something for nothing out of a printing press must end in chaos. He demands unlimited notes and credits, and admits that his limit is the sky. Where would this end? If the financial policy which he advocates so strenuously would be of any use to the Australian community, why was it not introduced some years ago when the party of which he is a supporter had a majority in this chamber '(I have in my possession a 5,000,000 mark note wh*ich, shortly after it was issued, was not worth the paper on which it was printed. The honourable member also referred to the associated banks and the manner in which our banking system is conducted, but every one knows that these banks have not within their vaults sufficient money to meet the demands of all the depositors. Banks make their advances on securities and, particularly, government securities. If business were not conducted in that way, it would be utterly impossible for any banking institution to function. The depositors have confidence in the banking institutions with which they deal, and confidence is the basis of the whole credit system. Destroy that and a collapse is inevitable. I listened with a great deal of attention to the interesting speech of the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin), who suggested that a special session of Parliament should be held to consider alterations of the Constitution. In the course of his speech, he came back to the policy of unification which he has previously advocated on many occasions.",55
123,Mr MAHONEY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,That is a policy in which a large section of the people believe.,55
124,Mr GREGORY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"We shall wait to see if that is so. The right honourable member for Yarra believes that this Parliament should have absolute control in many matters and that the States should not have the right to control their own every-day affairs. Some persons, particularly those who live in the crowded cities, may believe that there is a good de*>l to be said in support of such a policy, but those who represent the less populous States, some of which are more or less isolated, hope that a majority of the Australian people will not agree to such a proposal. Under a system of unification, with representation on a population basis, it would be a question of God help the lesspopulous States and particularly ""those which have huge areas to develop. The Attorney-General (Mr Menzies J also stated quite definitely that a special session of the Parliament would be held next year to consider alterations of the Constitution. It is interesting to recall that when the right honourable gentleman was a member of the Victorian Parliament, he told quite a different story. He then strongly opposed unification because he did not believe it would be in the interests of the nation. The Commonwealth is trying to assume powers which the Constitution has not given to it, and ever since the inception of federation the Commonwealth has been responsible for breaches of the Constitution. Por instance, it was never intended that the Commonwealth should pass laws to control arbitration within a State, but by a legal trick it has obtained that power. Has any honourable member studied, even for a moment, the huge Health Department which the Commonwealth has established, and the expenditure which it incurs? Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has no power over health; it can deal only with quarantine matters.",55
125,Mr ROSEVEAR,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Does the honourable member object to the Commonwealth expending money in order to preserve the health of the people?,56
126,Mr GREGORY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"That is not the question. I am saying that the Commonwealth has not the constitutional power to deal with health. The Commonwealth had not the constitutional power to control aviation. When an appeal was made to the people some time ago, they declined to give the Commonwealth the power it sought in that respect. I urged the people to record an affirmative vote because I considered the Commonwealth should have the power, but it serves to show that the electors have little confidence in this Parliament. In order to enable aviation to be effectively controlled and to secure uniformity, the States have now agreed to permit the Commonwealth to exercise authority under powers provided for in the Constitution.",56
127,Mr ROSEVEAR,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Some of the worse air disasters have occurred on routes under Commonwealth control.,56
128,Mr GREGORY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I am dealing with authority, and not with responsibility. If the people knew the manner in which parliamentary business is conducted in Canberra, they would hesitate to give this Parliament additional powers. Only a fortnight ago, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), in the absence of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), was speaking on the budget, there was only one Assistant Minister on the ministerial bench and there were only one or two other members on the ministerial side of the chamber. When the Commonwealth Parliament met in Melbourne, the ministerial bench was usually occupied by a number of Ministers who heard the views expressed by the representatives of the people. Then the public eye was upon them, and they did hot dare to flout the Parliament in the way they do here. Their attitude is followed by honourable members, with the result that the chamber is nearly always empty when important questions are being debated. Honourable members speak in this chamber to bring before Ministers the views they hold ori important topics debated in this chamber, and not solely to have their speeches recorded in Hansard. When the Attorney-General wa3 speaking on the advantage to be gained by granting additional constitutional power to the Commonwealth, I informed him that in the United States of America Mr. Coolidge had pointed out the grave dangers of bureaucratic control and that because something needed to be done it was not necessary that the Commonwealth Parliament should do it . When Parliament is not in session Ministers are seldom in Canberra. It would be deplorable if many of the powers which are now enjoyed by the States were handed over to a bureaucracy. The Attorney General said that the States do not possess any sovereign powers. I remind him that sovereign powers are in the hands of the people. When the Labour party was in power, it introduced a measure to alter the Constitution is certain respects, and had that bill passed through both branches of the Legislature and been approved by the people by way of a referendum, the Constitution could have been altered whenever the Government desired, without further reference to the people. That preposterous proposal was submitted by a party whose' slogan is, "" Trust the people "". The framers of the Constitution took particular care to provide that the Constitution could be altered only by the votes of a majority of the electors in a majority of the States. The Labour party also believes in the abolition of the Senate, which was set up to protect the rights of the people, and had their proposals been carried it could have abolished that chamber without any reference to the people. The Attorney General, who said that the Commonwealth Parliament should have the power to pass legislation to control company law, knows that it has this power, but it has not power to control the industrial work of the companies. He also suggested that this Parliament should control agriculture. ""What a sorry mess would follow if this Parliament had any voice in the development of the States. The history of its failures and waste in .the Northern Territory is too apparent to think twice of giving it control of agriculture. I was at Coolgardie when gold was first discovered, and I recall the activity displayed by the late Lord Forrest in making provision for the construction of roads, dams, water supplies, bores, telegraph lines, and railways. AH of this work was completed within a couple of years, and was followed shortly afterwards by the great Coolgardie water scheme. ""Would such important works have been undertaken under a system of unification, with control at Canberra? I believe that the Commonwealth should have control in some matters such as wireless broadcasting and aviation, which could not be foreseen when the Constitution was framed. I now propose to deal with the subject of defence. I am surprised to find that Ministers who have recently visited England and the Continent have not mentioned the horrors of war and the imminent danger which exists in Europe today. Only a few days ago a friend in Melbourne sent my wife a letter which she had received from her daughter who lives about 25 miles distant from London. She told of the anxiety and horror, particularly amongst the women and children of England, recently occasioned by the fear that, at any moment, enemy aeroplanes might drop bombs and spread poison gas to create fear and horror among the people. She said that conditions in England were absolutely appalling, that no one knew from one hour to the next when war would break out. Those Ministers who have recently returned to Australia from abroad, with a first-hand knowledge of the anxiety which exists in the minds of all the people of Great Britain at the present time, should do everything in their power to awaken the people *of Australia to the dangers that recently confronted, and to a modified degree still confront them. In a book which he recently published, Professor Berriedale Keith, an international authority in Great Britain, referring to the attitudeof Mr Baldwin during the recent crisis, wroteA very important declaration of his conception of the duty of a government by Mr. Baldwin on November 12th, elaborated on November 18th, revealed to a rather astonished world the fact that he had realized two years earlier the deficiency of British defence preparations but had not attempted to remedy them because of the risk of loss of popularity and of seats at the general election. His doctrine, however, seems to have satisfied his followers and to go far to establish the principle that leaders should follow rather than seek to guide public opinion. The plausibility of this theory, if restricted to the sphere of domestic affairs, disappears when applied to external relations, for it is in the nature of things inevitable that the public has far too little knowledge of foreign relations to be able to form any intelligent judgment as to the needs of defence, and that it is peculiarly incumbent on ministers in all matters falling within that sphere to take the initiative even at the risk of unpopularity. In my opinion it is the duty of every honourable member in this Parliament, irrespective of the party to which he belongs, to point out in a convincing manner to the people of Australia the danger which lies ahead and the absolute necessity for defence preparedness. [Quorum formed.'] There is no desire on the part of anybody in Australia for war; we want peace all of the time; but can we hope to secure peace if we are not prepared to defend this country? What is surprising to me is the attitude of the pacifists, particularly in the Old Country, who, while they urge that no provision should be made for defence, in their so-called desire for pacificism would plunge Great Britain into a war in Spain or Czechoslovakia. Those who wait to be attacked are already half defeated. We should shudder at the prospect of placing untrained lads in the firing line to confront an enemy consisting of trained men. I have always supported compulsory military training, and to my mind it is dreadful to think that the young men of our volunteer army should ever be ex : peeted to stand up against the trained troops of an enemy. Compulsory military training is of great value even in an era of peace. The trainees are subjected to a form of discipline which has a very steadying effect upon them. During the depression from which we have recently emerged, I recommended that, as a means of getting them away from the dangers of idleness in the big cities, our workless young people should be given employment half time on military training and half time on afforestation work. Anything would have been better than to allow our young men to live in idleness week after week, and in some instances, year after year, with no prospect before them of ever being able to secure employment. When a man reaches the age of 25 years without having secured a job he will not want to work for the rest of his life. My - proposal would have ensured woTk, wages and training with good prospects of work later under better conditions. We have a great country and it is our duty to clo everything to defend it. Bismarck said "" Only fools can talk facts away"". The real fact which we must broadcast to the people of Australia is that their first duty is to populate and develop their country. Nations, like individuals, need a fair share of the earth's natural resources. Others are aware of the immense area of Australia and of its wonderful possibilities. This country is capable of maintaining under good conditions a population varying from . 25,000,000 to 30,000,000; but owing to the wretched Ur. Gregory. policy we have adopted under which we prohibit the export of our raw materials to countries hungry for them, and impose serious restrictions upon trades and immigrants, we antagonize countries that otherwise would be friendly to us. Australia has an area equal to that of the United States of America, and whilst it could not support such a huge population as the United States of America, it could, in the opinion of every economist who has devoted his attention to the subject, safely carry a population of-from 25,000,000 to 35,000,000. In addition to the disadvantage of our meagre population, we have a declining birth-rate. In 1911, with a population of 4,450,000, the birth-rate was 122,000; in 1921, with a population of 5,435,000, the birth-rate had increased to 136,000; in 1931, with a further increase of the population of 1,000,000, the birth-rate declined to 118,000; in 1934, with a population of 6,700,000, the birth-rate dropped still further to 109,000; and in 1936, with a population of 6,800,000, the birth-rate was only 116,000. The birth-rate in Australia was 16 per cent, as against 42 per cent, in Russia, 31 per cent, in Japan, 25 per cent, in Italy, 18 per cent, in Germany, and 15 per cent, in Great Britain. In spite of this declining birth-rate we have adopted a White Australia policy, applied restrictive tariffs, brought in a trade diversion policy and restricted immigration. Manufacturing and Labour groups call for still further restrictions. The question which must arise in the minds of people from other countries is: "" Are Australians doing all they can to people and develop their country ? "" The answer must be "" No "": Therefore these people have a perfect right to assume that if we are not prepared to populate and develop our country we have no right to continue to hold it in face of the need of other countries for possessions to absorb their surplus populations. I come now to the question of finance. I shall not go into great details in regard to public expenditure, but shall confine myself to - finance in respect of public administration. In my opinion this is no time for large increases of administrative expenditure. In two short years from 1936-38 administrative expenditure increased as follows:- 1930. 193S. * Parliament 123,000 132,000 Postmaster-General's 403,000 515,000 External Affairs 12,670 18,100 Treasury 778,000 862,000 Interior 431,000 662,000 Defence 5.713,000 6,874,000 Customs 506,000 726,000 Health 125,000 135,600 Commorce 428,000 510,000 Miscellaneous.. 1,149,000 1,356,000 TLese figures reveal some rather alarming increases. Heaven only knows what the administrative expenditure on the Department of the Treasury will be next year when the national scheme is brought into operation. I strongly urge that the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act should be suspended fo^some years and drastically amended before being put in operation. I clo not question the large increase of the vote for the Defence Department because I realise that it is necessary as the result of the new defence policy. In my opinion it is absolutely essential that the economic position should be exhaustively examined so that there will be no prospect of our drifting back to the depression conditions of 1930. [Quorum formed]. '.Che honourable member for Biverina (Mr Nock) pointed out yesterday that our receipts from wool this year would be £6,000,000 less than last year, and from wheat £20,000,000 less; and that in consequence of droughts our flocks of sheep would be reduced by 20,000,000. He also told us that commodity costs had increased by 6 per cent., whereas export values had decreased by 20 per cent. 1 reiterate these facts because of the important bearing they have upon our whole financial structure. It is admitted that wool production is unpayable at present prices, and that in consequence of drought and low export values, the wheat industry will be a burden instead of an assistance to the Treasury. With commodity costs increasing in this way ruin seems to be facing our primary producers. I remind honourable members of the old saying: "" Whom the gods arc Increase. about to destroy they first make mad"". We seem to be facing destruction, for our £ £ £ whole economic policy is mad. 9,000 I fear that the general community does 112,000 not appreciate the value to the country 5,400 84,000 of our export trade. In the four years 116,000 from 1925-26 to 1928-29 inclusive, our 1,161,000 exports were valued, on the average, at 220,000 £143,000,000 sterling per annum. In the 10.000 92.000 next four years, from 1929-30 to 1932-33, 200,000 export values declined to £105,000,000 per annum sterling; but from this 17,297,000 amount we must deduct £54,000,000, held in gold in the bank vaults, which was sent to England to pay debts there, and not to create credits. To be accurate, therefore, we must put down the export value of our goods during those four insurance years at £92,500,000 per annum, and it will be seen that we suffered a reduction of £202,000,000 in the four years, or an average of over £50,000,000 a year. This meant a definite and an enormous loss of spending power. In the years when our exports were valued at £143,000,000 per annum, it is probable that the spending power of the people, owing to the volume and circulation of that £143,000,000, was between £600,000,000 and £700,000,000 per annum. In the next four years, an extremely serious fall of the purchasing power of the people was caused by our average loss of £50,000,000 per annum in export values. It was this great reduction of export credits that was mainly responsible for the depression and the misery that followed. In the four years' from 1933-34 to 1936-37, the average value of our export goods was £133,000,000. Export values showed an increase in 1936-37 to £161,500,000. In 1937-3S our exports were valued at £157,000,000. These facts indicate beyond question that the depression was caused by the reduced export values, and relieved by the increase during the last four years; but I fear that, unless we are extraordinarily careful to keep down administration costs and other governmental charges, we shall find ourselves in the depth of another depression. I wish now to deal for a few moments with my own fiscal policy. This is well known, although I get very little support for it in this chamber. 1 consider that it is vitally necessary that we shall do our utmost to develop trade with other countries of the world. The greatest menace to world peace is the restriction of world trade. If we could remove these trade restrictions and carry to its consummation the courageous policy now being enunciated by Mr Cordell Hull of the United States of America, I believe we should pave the way for real peace throughout the world. There is an urgent need for greater freedom of trade than is possible at present. must be prepared to trade.freely with other peoples, and we must not deny other nationals access, under reasonable conditions, to the raw materials that they need. Unfortunately, the costs of production in Australia continue to increase. The honourable member for Riverina referred last night to certain extraordinary increases of duties that have resulted in consequence of the policy of this Government. I regret that the duties provided in the last tariff schedule to be tabled in this Parliament have been made effective for another six months, although the items affected have not been the subject of inquiry by the Tariff Board. action of the Government in connection with hinges, referred to last night by the honourable member for Riverina, constitutes one of the most deliberate frauds ever imposed on an unsuspecting public, that existing duties were increased without any reason whatsoever being given from 65 per cent, to more than 300 per cent. This emphasizes my contention that the law should be enforced and that the Minister for Trade and Customs should not be permitted to table any increase of duties unless the item has been reported upon by the Tariff Board. In this case, contrary to law, the Minister has had imposed the most extravagant and unjustified duties, apparently at the request of some interested person. It is regrettable that Parliament should have forgotten certain details in the report published by the economists who inquired into the economic effect of the Australian tariff Mr Gregory., in 1928. I direct the attention of honourable members to page 191 of that report which gives figures relating to specified items, covering salaries and wages paid in the industry, and the excess cost involved if the whole of the duty in respect of these items were added. To these details I have added another column showing the amount of duty in excess of the salaries and wages paid in the industries concerned. The table is as follows:Salaries Excess Cost it DifItem and Wages whole Duty ference. Paid. Added. ltubber goods £ 1,337,000 £ 2,178,000 £ 841,000 We Knitting factories 1,2011,000 1,089.000 430,000 Dressmaking and millinery 1,507,000 1,905,000 398,000 Chemical and drugs 049,000 790,000 141,000 Confectionery . . Underclothiers 1,427,000 1,317,000 1,974,000 2,200,000 547,000 653,000 Corn flour 11,000 40,000 29,000 It should be remembered that these figures are based on the duties in force in 1926 and 1927. Enormous increases have been made on most if not all of the items affected since that time. I hope that in the near future the Government will realise that primary production is not a huge reservoir from which limitless funds may be drawn by way of either direct or indirect taxation. Unless something is done to protect the interest of the great primary producing industries of Australia, the whole country will face ruin. The At the important trade conference held in Rome recently it was unanimously agreed that the prosperity of primary industries was essential to the national welfare of any country. I therefore hope that the Government will show some consideration to this vital fact, and pay closer attention to the well-being of our primary industries than it has hitherto done. My final words have relation to defence. I hope that the Government will not hesitate to proceed with its full defence programme. I hope, also, that the members of the Cabinet ""who believe in compulsory military training will stand firm, even though an appeal to the country may be involved. If the people of Australia are brought to realise the urgent necessity to train our men to defend the country-and this does not mean conscription- I believe that they will give the Government a mandate to proceed with its policy. [Quorum form.ed.']",56
129,Mr HOLLOWAY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Melbourne Ports) [10.11] - My contribution to this discussion will be brief. I do not intend to deal at all with the defence programme of the Government. I fear we have too many generals and not enough rank and file in this country, and I have no desire to enter into the competition. I consider that the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) is deserving of severe blame in that the budget does not make provision for economic plannings to deal in some real way with our unemployment problem. Experts throughout the world are telling us in no uncertain voice that we are heading for another depression. The information which is coming to hand from Geneva and other centres in Europe where statistics in relation to the economic activities of all countries are collected and tabulated, cannot be interpreted in any other way. If we are heading for depression-and I believe that to be the case-this budget should have made nrovision for long-range plans to cope with such a situation. We should not be called uoon to face another depression without adequate preparation. The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) said ho ""hoped"" we were not about to enter another period of depression. Hoping will not prevent us from suffering through a depression.",61
130,Mr HUTCHINSON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Economi c conditions are improving in the TJnited States of America.,61
131,Mr HOLLOWAY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"In reply to the interjection of the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson), I may say that statistical information from practically every country is such as to warn us that depressed conditions are almost inevitable. The honourable member interjected while the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) was speaking, that production figures were increasing. One of the surest signs of an approaching depression is - an increase of production on one hand, and a downward tendency of employment on the other hand. If production is increasing while the wage fund of the people at large is decreasing through unemployment, depression is inescapable. Conditions now are very similar to those which obtained about ten years ago. I remember rea ding the report of the conference in Brussels in 1921 concerning the first plan made to bring about a period of deflation. One of the greatest financial experts in the world, Professor August Cassel, was asked by a British delegate to the conference if he would advise the delegates whether they were, on the right track in recommending to the business people a curtailment of their activities, with the object of preventing general inflation, or - what is called inflation. Professor Cassel warned the delegates that if they began a cycle of deflation, they would cause more trouble and danger than they could possibly hope to achieve good. Once they began deflation, it would grow like a snowball. It would be impossible to stop it, and it would bring ruin and desolation to the world. The result we all know. The financiers did begin a period of deflation, and the world went through the depression which we still remember. Once the beam is tipped the wrong way, there is a general restriction of credit and a forced and artificial contraction of consumption. Values fall, and manufacturers and business people generally will buy only what they absolutely must on a falling market. When this Government came into power, with a majority in both Houses, the country was passing through the depths of the depression, but for the last five years it has enjoyed record seasons, prices have been good, and new records have been created in tax collections, including excise and customs duties. We have achieved records in this way never dreamed of twenty years ago. Yet, through all that period of comparative prosperity, the Government has made no plans to meet the possibility of a turn in the economic tide. A new budget has been brought down at a time when every one knows that a depression is beginning without any plan to meet it. The figures of our own Statistician prove that, apart altogether from the reports issued periodically under the authority of Mr Butler, at Geneva. These reports express, not his own opinions, but the considered opinions of experts sitting continuously in Geneva throughout the year. The last report pointed out that, though' production was still on the up grade, unemployment was increasing. The amount of money devoted to the wage fund was shrinking, though the value of the output was increasing. We in Australia are already feeling the effects of this. The Premier of New South Waies, Mr Stevens, said last week"" that he was sure there were 100,000 men unemployed in Australia. I feel certain that .tliere are at least 160,000 unemployed. In Victoria alone, there were 10,000 more unemployed in September than in March of this year. The index figure for employment in factories and workshops throughout the Commonwealth was 114 in September last year, but in September of this year it had fallen to 110. In March of this year, unemployment amounted to 8 per cent. In September, it had risen to 9.2, and, according to the latest information I can gather, it is now just about 10 per cent. That represents 10 per cent, of the trade unionists registered in the Federal Arbitration Court. We should remember that there are only 814,000 trade unionists in the whole of Australia. Of these, not half are registered in the Arbitration Court, while those who are registered are mostly skilled tradesmen among whom unemployment is less than among the unskilled workers. Even among this comparatively small group the niunber of unemployed was 9.2 per cent, in September last. According to the figures collected at the last census there are in Australia 2,200,000 wage earners. What would be the unemployment figures if all of those were registered, and particulars regarding unemployment among them were available? The percentage, would be very much higher if we included unskilled workers"" and miscellaneous workers who are not organized at all. It is impossible to get at the real position from the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician because complete information is not at his disposal. I am sure, however, that the total number is not less than 160,000, and we know that there are 60,000 unemployed in Victoria alone. Despite the fact that £2,000,000 was collected in wage tax in Victoria during the year, and that another £2,000,000 of loan money was expended on unemployment relief, the number of unemployed in that State increased by 10,000 between March and September of this year, and the number is still increasing. The amount of wages paid per head, and the aggregate wage fund, have been Mr Holloway. gradually going down. The process has been mure rapid this year because of the effect of deflation. In 1927, the wages per head paid to workers in factories and workshops was £208, while in September of last year it was £179. In 1927, the aggregate value of the output from factories and workshops was £420,000,000. In September of last year, it was £451,000,000, an increase of £32,000,000; yet the wage fund declined by £1,000,000, representing a decline from 21 per cent, of the total output to 19 per cent., and the average wage per head fell from £208 to £179. How can we expect the industrial side of the economic structure to maintain itself when the figures are working out in this way? The gap between production and consumption is getting wider and wider. The figures published in the last report from Geneva show that in the"" TJnited States of America during the last seven years the efficiency of the man-power employed has increased by 24 per cent., while in Europe it has increased by 19 per cent. The output for each man has increased, but fewer workers are employed, and the average amount paid to each worker is less.. How then can we expect any .other result than an economic depression ? This year, the State government asked for £18,000,000 loan money to carry out their programme of public works for the year. The Loan Council refused their request, because the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Treasurer declared that it could allow them only two-thirds of the amount asked for. Thus the period of restriction and deflation was begun. When the Premiers met recently in Canberra, the conference broke down because the Commonwealth Government told the State representatives that no additions could be made to their ordinary works programme, and that no more money could be made available, and that, instead of carrying out their ordinary public works, whatever money was available to them should be devoted to works which had a definite defence value. The Commonwealth Government should grapple with unemployment, which is becoming worse, by adding to the money for public works instead of reducing it ; otherwise, we shall enter upon another period of depression. Once the snowball starts, it wi.i take stopping. If the Government has it in mind to suggest to the peop.e of Australia that, because of defence needs, or any other needs, they must go through another period of sacrifice, the suggestion will not only be coldly received, but will also fall on deaf ears. Seven or eight years ago, the people were asked to go through a short period of purgatory and to accept sacrifices to meet the emergency. That short period of purgatory has developed into a period of hell. We have not dispensed with all the emergency measures that were applied. Work for sustenance, relief work and ration work, all of them measures which were taken to meet the emergency, are still with us, in spite of the fact that last year we were supposed to experience conditions equal to the prosperity that marked the post-war period. Indeed, the position is becoming worse. Nevertheless, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde), at the request of many State leaders, made an appeal to the House this afternoon for the Government to make the solution of the unemployment problem its fundamental task, and to provide the means whereby the unemployed would have constant work until at least the end of the year while planning their needs for next year, the Government callously gagged the discussion. The Minister"" for Works (Mr Thorby) pointed out that this year the Commonwealth Government was providing the States with more money than it provided them with last year and in the previous year. That fact is not challenged; but it is not the question. The question is whether the money, which is being made available, is sufficient to meet the needs of the unemployed. It is not nearly enough. If it were, there would be no need for sustenance and rationed relief work. The position that we have reached today is that, because of increased efficiency, which results in more production with the expenditure of less energy, private enterprise canno longer provide sufficient work to keep the people in employment. Accordingly, it is time for the governments of Australia, particularlv the Commonwealth Government, which holds the purse, strings, to take over the responsibility for keeping the people in worji. Year after year, at ijreneva, conventions, such as the convention for a shorter working week, and the p.auning ""of public worJts, are entered into by the nations in conference for the betterment of conditions in industry, but, unfortunately, this country is one of the few countries that never honours its obligations in that regard. The honourable member for Denison (Mr Mahoney) cited Sweden as a country which has planned for the future in order to avoid unemployment. The same remarks could be made in respect of all Scandinavian countries, but not in respect of Australia. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who has the habit of making statements aimed at benefiting the country, but is rarely in this chamber to back them up with action, said the other day that, in spite of all the war hysteria, the greatest problem which faced the Government was that of unemployment. No man has more experience of economic problems than the right honourable gentleman and, for once, I agree with him 100 per cent. In view of his statement, it would be difficult to understand why the budget contains no remarks of similar purport were it not for the fact that, when the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) today endeavoured to initiate a discussion of ways in which the unemployed could be absorbed into industry and public works, the Minister for Works on behalf of the Government, shrugged his shoulders and said that later some of the unemployed might be drafted into defence works. At the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Stevens, himself a member of the United Australia party, threw down the gauntlet to the Commonwealth Government and refused to accept any proposal which would mean the mere transfer of the unemployed in his State from one governmental project to one perhaps more related to defence than the other. He demanded more money to undertake more public works. I whole-heartedly agree with his attitude. To transfer men from one job to another does not meet the problem, because it does not result in an increase of the wages bill. Indeed, the wages bill is falling, and with every fall another period of recession becomes closer. When people run to cover and refuse to buy because they expect that prices will' fall, the num -* bers of the unemployed increase, and the natural effect of this is to create still more unemployment. I warn the Government that if it determines to transfer men from works that are now in progress on a relief-work basis to defence works on the same - basis, its recruiting campaign will meet with utter failure. A plan for the increase of the strength of the militia based on sweated labour must fall to the ground. I should throw my efforts behind those of the industrial organizations against it. The conditions' which operate today are a disgrace to a country which could afford to give higher standards of living to the people.",61
132,Mr MOXCMHV,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The Government does not believe in higher standards of living.,64
133,Mr HOLLOWAY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I do not think that it does. Everybody knows that a process of deflation must inevitably mean a progressive lowering of the living standards. Every particle of evidence confirms that. I am in full agreement with the following statement which was made in his book Planned Money, by Sir Basil Blackett, a director of the Bank of England' In the twentieth century governments are content to use a monetary system which has so conspicuously tailed in the past and is admittedly certain to present us again and again with booms and slumps and all the misery and destitution which must result therefrom . . . This - Government is content to continue with the old monetary system, wTiicb, when the banks decide that it is worth their while to curtail expenditure and force down prices and values, as they did in 1931, in order to double the value of their money, means that we shall have another period of unemployment. Basil Blackett in the preface to his book, in order not to involve his colleagues, said I , and I alone, am responsible for the statements contained in this book. He suggested that a local or national rency exists for the purpose of faciliemployed tating exchange on goods, and made quite clear that what he would call the natural currency arrangement by an independent sovereign state, such as Australia, would be a local currency owing its internal purchasing value to a management by or on behalf of the state, and so managed and controlled as to retain approximately the same purchasing power from year to year, external trade being provided for by appropriate machinery which did not disturb internal stability. He meant that a country like Australia which has a Commonwealth Bank, backed by the resoiirces .of the nation arid, as was said by the first governor of the Commonwealth Bank Board, as strong as the country, has the basis upon which the currency structure should be erected. The Government, acting in conjunction with the Treasury and those controlling our banking institutions, should regulate the flow of credit and consequently the purchasing power of the community and enable it to remain stable for a period of years. Surely we have reached the stage at which such a system could be effectively developed in the interests of Australia. We should discard the old financial system which experts have told us must result in bringing about financial booms which are always followed by slumps, and have the courage and wisdom to ignore the protests of private bankers and use our own credits to meet human need 3. The most urgent problem with which the Government is now faced is that of unemployment. It must not close its eyes to the fact that thousands of deserving people find it impossible to get work. Surely the Government will not deny that there is an acute unemployment problem! All the information that we can get is that an extensive defence programme is being developed and that the unemployed will be provided with work on defence schemes. History disSir proves that defence works relieve unemployment. The figures are increasing in every country.",64
134,Mr ANTHONY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,What is the number of unemployed in Victoria?,64
135,Mr HOLLOWAY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Accordin g to the curState Government there were 40,000 unin March, and by September it the number had increased to 60,000. We do not wish to decry our own country, but some of the statements made in this chamber, to-night cannot be regarded as creditable to Australia. A number of visitors were in the strangers' gallery when the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) was saying things that did not place Australia in a very good light. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) also spoke, quite truthfully, about the slums that exist in certain capital cities. Doubtless these visitors would be surprised, but they were hearing only the truth. I hate to have to tell truths which appear to be fouling our own nest, but if we do not put the position plainly before the Government and endeavour to assist these unfortunate people, they will be allowed to starve and rot. ment made by the Minister for Defence that the unemployed will be able to obtain work under the Government's defence scheme cannot be substantiated. In the last report dealing with the problem of unemployment in Great Britain, the following paragraph appearsThe course of healthy recovery has been accelerated by the injection of vast sums of public money into the world's economic system, but this process cannot continue indefinitely. Some day, in a not very distance future, expenditure on armaments must presumably begin to be curtailed. If this should happen at a time when ordinary business is declining, the reduction of government orders, coupled with the stringency of public finances burdened by a huge debt incurred for military purposes might easily give rise to of the first magnitude. It would, therefore, be folly to regard the present high level of employment as a matter for complacency. Such satisfaction as it may legitimately cause must inevitably be tempered by anxiety for the future and snould be accompanied by comprehensive planning to avert the dangers with which the present situation is fraught. That is based on the latest reports obtained from the principal countries in the world. Although millions of pounds is being spent daily for defence purposes, the situation has not improved. Only a month ago, when I was handling the industrial dispute at the Commonwealth Aircraft Factory at Fisherman's Bend in Victoria, the manager informed me that he could employ 5,00 more unskilled and semi-skilled men if be could get a few engineers. Expenditure on o war-time activities does not help to solve the unemployed problem. Although millions of men are engaged in the manufacture of arms and munitions, sufficient skilled men are not available. Should the work on arms and munitions cease as suddenly as it started, thousands more will be thrown on the unemployed market. The immense burden which is being placed upon the shoulders of the people in European countries in consequence of heavy defence expenditure will bring about internal disorder, and it is certain that, by international agreement, there will be a sudden stoppage of this mad race, and I shudder to think what Avill happen. Unskilled men are not wanted, and the number of unskilled workers in Britain is increasing daily. Unfortunately, persons of that type will migrate to Australia, and, although, they The state- may be quite desirable citizens in every other respect, they cannot be absorbed in Australia. All of our electricians, moulders, blacksmiths, carpenters, and builders are at work. The type unemployed in Europe is the same type unemployed here.",64
136,Mr DRAKEFORD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The ship-builders are not getting sufficient work.,65
137,Mr HOLLOWAY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,I know that platerollers and rivetters are unemployed.,65
138,Mr ANTHONY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Suitabl e migrants might assist to relieve the problem of unemployment.,65
139,Mr HOLLOWAY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes , suitable migrants would be of advantage, but most a slump of the European countries retain their skilled men.",65
140,Mr ANTHONY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,A number of Jewish engineers are on the way to Australia.,65
141,Mr HOLLOWAY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The honourable member knows why. I am in favour of a reasonable quota of Jewish refugees being allowed to settle in Australia, and there may be some good craftsmen amongst them. Bigoted animosity has possibly compelled the German Government to lose the services of engineers and other craf tsmen, but I doubt very much whether that is so. I believe that the German captains of industry have retained the services of their best men. Some years ago, when the Victorian Government wanted expert engineers at Yallourn, it was able to secure half a dozen Germans, on the distinct understanding that they were to be repatriated at the end of five years. Work, and not immigration, is what we require. 'the CHAIRMAN - The honourable member has exhausted his time. [Quorum formed.']",65
142,Mr HUNTER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Maranoa) [10.58] During the debate to-=day, several honourable members have stressed the point that Australia is on the verge of another cial and economic depression, similar to that which commenced in 1929. That depression was not so severe as those which have occurred in other countries, such as the United States of America, where every seven or eight years many banks are compelled to close their doors. Wcj should not speak of depressions when there is no need to do so, because it has a psychological effect upon the people. We recall that at a certain stage after certain happenings in Australia .the people immediately unbuttoned their pockets and money commenced to circulate.",66
143,Mr BRENSTAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Are we not entitled to say that we are heading towards another depression ?,66
144,Mr HUNTER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I deny that that is the case. Australia cannot become financially depressed as quickly as some other countries, because of the way in which it obtains its wealth. Although the complaint is often made that conditions in Australia are not so good as they might .be, it cannot be denied that they are considerably better than they were some years ago; they are certainly better than they were three years ago. One of the principal factors militating against the improvement of conditions in Australia is that it derives most of its wealth from its exportable surplus of primary products which has to be disposed of in the overseas markets. If abnormal conditions prevail in the overseas markets Australia is directly affected. Another factor which has retarded improvement in this country is the continuance on a large scale of governmental works which were commenced during the depths of the depression as a means of relieving unemployment. Whilst it is the duty of governments during bad times to start all sorts of works as a means of absorbing the unemployed, even to the employment of men chipping grass from the pavements, when a state of comparative prosperity exists the provision of such works should correspondingly decrease - But today probably as much government work is going on as was necessary during the bad times, and if Australia is unfortunate enough to have to face another bad period it will not be possible for gofinanvernments to extend their works beyond what they are now ""undertaking. Prosperity is reached only when the maximum work is being provided by private enterprise. When a government engages in works, even of a productive character, a big proportion of them are noninterest-bearing, or, in other words, are actually losing propositions. It might have been better had governments, during good times, boldly stopped, or tapered off, their works, and, to make up for the employment lost, also boldly decreased taxation to a considerable degree, or granted taxation exemptions to new industries, making for new employment, if necessary, borrowing to make up temporary deficits. Had that been done, in a few years' time the increased real employment would have meant a greater buoyancy in governmental revenues. Decentralization of industry can be achieved by various methods. Relief of taxation for new industries, lower charges by local authorities for power and water, and favourable railway freights for raw materials to the factories, and for manufactured materials from the seat of manufacture, if these are away from the coast, to the point of consumption,' are but a few of the means that might be adopted to bring about this desirable result. Planned industrial development would increase our production and permit it to be sold at a lower price. The provision of £250,000 for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research fior industrial research is to be commended. In considering the means by which we can foster new industries, it must first be conceded that any really new industry will add to employment and to our wealth. If that industry is not started, then we are short of that gain, though existing industrial enterprises have lost nothing. New industries should be given every facility for successful establishment before invoking the Customs Department to add to their costs and difficulties. Representatives of overseas factories have told me that, had they known the trouble they would be put to in the establishment of Australian branches, they never would haye invested their capital here. What happens when a new industry, say, from the United States of America, is established here? The industry may have made money in the United States, and interested people wish to extend their business here. Their plans and specifications for the articles they produce are so exact, and are in many cases protected by patent rights, that, for the sake of their good name, they dare not depart from their exact formulae. Yet, as soon as they start manufacturing in Australia, at once existing local companies try to obtain prohibitions in respect of certain elements being imported which are necessary for the new industry, because they can be manufactured by those local companies. If it is pointed out that they cannot make the goods because they are protected by patent rights, then the plea is made that they can make something that will answer the same purpose. endeavour to get certain essential parts admitted under by-law is subjected to delay, because the Customs Department is obliged to see if any objection is raised by local interests. This immediately makes objection sure. Sometimes objections are withdrawn, but a great deal of worry is caused, and much delay is experienced in getting on with production. Hence great losses are suffered during the initial period of these business If an entirely new article is to be manufactured, the company should be asked what it can buy here immediately, and what it will need to import; then permits should be granted forthwith for the factory to import for a limited period, until the factory is firmly established. By this method no existing business would lose anything, because, before the establishment of the new business the existing firms did not have the business. They cannot claim as a loss something which they never had. And it is fairly certain that, in a short time, as soon as possible, the new business itself will try to manufacture locally all essential parts, resulting in greatly increased business all round. [Quorum farmed.] The new company will give new employment which previously had not existed, it should not matter to the country who gives the employment, so long as it is given. But the old established businesses insist that they alone shall give the employment, although they take no part in the initiation of it, and by forcing the new company to take their. product, which cannot be so good as what the new company wants, and, being a new article, cannot be so cheap, they thus add to the costs, and decrease the efficiency of the new enterprise. This, of course, delays the swing of the maximum of employment. The customs officials must not be blamed for they simply administer the law. They do this as sympathetically to the new industry as they possibly can. But they are always liable to censure if they err on the wise side, and allow importations of essentials. They have to administer government policy. These companies are loud in their praises of the customs officials who try all they can to help them, but are confined by the policy of Every the Government. The Government, therefore, should adopt a new policy of-giving the utmost encouragement to new industries to get them firmly established beforu enforcing the law too strictly. Certainly the 'Government should not . ask ths opinions of other businesses which naturally resent fresh firms coming in, and, perhaps, making money.",66
145,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The Government is opposed to the establishment of new inactivities. dustries here.,67
146,Mr HUNTER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"That is not so. If industry is to be efficient in Australia, we must allow the newest ideas to be expressed here as freely as possible. Nothing should be done to force our people to continue using the inefficient methods of the past. I wish now to refer to the Government's youth employment scheme under which .a grant of £400,000 has been made to the State governments. Closely allied to the necessity for new industries is the need to provide work of the proper kind for young lads as they reach working age. To make the best preparation for them it is essential that new industries shall be established. New government works are not sufficient, for, in the main, they provide only navvying work. However, one class of young men has never been properly looked after. I'refer to the men who, today, are approaching the age of 25 or 26 years. During the years of the depression, and after they bad left school, they could not get work anywhere. I know men of that age, personally, who have never worked, except at labouring jobs and only temporarily at that. Yet they could all have been absorbed into work long ago-at least to the proportion that they would have been absorbed into work in normal circumstances-provide d proper plans had been made, and followed. Of course, a percentage of men always fail in spite of all the encouragement that is given to tbem. It is not within the province of the Commonwealth Government to deal with these problems, for all phases of industry come within the scope of State governments. The Commonwealth Government can only help the States by grants of money. The grant of £400,000 to which I have already referred, was made with ' that object in view. I feel safe in assuming that very few of the young men whom I have in mind will ever receive permanent jobs as the result of that grant, and the main thing is to find them permanent jobs. The Commonwealth has come into the picture of its own accord, and must bear its proportion of blame for not getting these lads started.",67
147,Sir PKEOEKICK STEWABT,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The training schools in New South ""Wales are doing good work. Mr HUNTER.WWhilst it is necessary for the boys to be trained, it is clear that it will be so long before their "" theoretical training"" is completed that people will have lost sight of the fact that the boys will need a job. Governments will get full credit for having initiated such a good so-called "" p l a n "" to place these young men, but later on, when the actual need to get a job arises, people will have forgotten all about it. As a matter of fact, these unfortunate men will not be placed in industry, and so are to be pitied. The reason for their unemployment will have been lost sight of long before they are qualified to obtain a job. As boys leave school and come on to the employment market year in and year out, they will get such jobs as are available at boys' wages and will gradually become trained, ana grow up fully trained in the business; there will be little incentive, if any, for employers to employ new men at full wages-eve n if they are supposed to be "" trained theoretically "". If a trained man's job is available, an apprentice is usually promoted, or a practical and trained man is advertised for who must show that he has had experience. Some incentive, therefore, must be offered to employers to give employment to those unfortunate "" old "" boys. At present, the only reason for ever giving employment to them is pity-and , as every one knows, pity is non-existent in business in these days. No business can afford to let "" P^y "" interfere with efficiency. Yet even today some business men who are able to provide employment are willing to pay some regard to this "" lost legion "". They would give them jobs at once, and put up for a time with all the faults of rawness, provided that they were relieved of the need to pay full award rates to men, for these boys are now men with no practical experience. Should not the main object of governments be to find permanent jobs ultimately for these men and lads who are in their present position through no fault of their own? Perhaps it will be claimed that it is against the interests of Labour to employ anybody at less than award rates. That, I contend, is not so. No untrained man is worth award rates for skilled work which he cannot do. In fact, such a man is a definite loss at almost any wage, for a time. Therefore, if the award stands in such cases, such men must remain unskilled for ever, and be condemned, for all their working days, to intermittent and temporary work. Is this desirable from the nation's point of view? Is it fair to the lads and men themselves ? Provision could be made to prevent unscrupulous employers from trading on a properly planned method to employ lads and men at less than award wages. Before a person is so employed, permission should be sought from the State Labour Department. Persons desiring such work could be registered, and their conditions of employment laid down, such as a sliding scale of wages, a definite period of employment of, say, two years, or less, at less than award rates. Provision snould be made for an adequate training during the apprenticeship period-suc h men should not be used simply as cheap labourers and it should be a condition that such persons attend a technical college, either during the day in the employer's time,' or at night without fees. Finally, to prevent dismissals when the two-year period expired so that fresh lads could be engaged, the employers should guarantee employment after the training is completed-for a short period at any rate, if loss of business made it impossible for an employer to provide work any longer. Safeguards to the employers should also be made. For instance, they should have the right to dismiss lads within the first three months if it were seen that they were unsuited for the work they were required to do. But no dismissal should be permitted during the apprenticeship period unless the consent of the State Labour Department had first been obtained. Alternatively, the employers could be subsidized to some small extent in the payment of the wages of such apprentices. I have discussed this matter with both manufacturers and industrialists, and they have offered no objection to such a scheme. The chief fear of the industrialists is that if such a scheme were adopted trained men might be dismissed to make way for "" cheap labour "". Therefore, no one should be asked to make a place for the "" extra"" man under the scheme. But such labour is not "" cheap"" from the employer's point of view. Similar plans, have actually been put into practice in several places to my own knowledge. Before our industrial laws became strict, I know of one man who left his profession at 22 .years of age, and engaged in an entirely new vocation at £1 a week after months of unemployment. In less than six months he was in full charge, and was receiving a good salary. All the details of one case of this description are known to me intimately, for the man concerned is a relation. I could in fact mention many actual cases of men who only needed a chance to do something. Hundreds of men have been deprived of their chance through faulty plans, or an entire lack of plans, by Commonwealth and State governments, and public money is actually being wasted although the public has been led to believe that these lads are being given a chance. Honourable members receive letters every week regarding the impossibility of securing work for these "" old "" boys. Some States have adopted the idea of subsidizing employers without conditions. The objection to this is that in some cases, rare perhaps, men are dismissed to make room for the learners. Other States have made no place for actual employment in their plans which are based solely on what they consider to be "" training"". The serious objection to such "" plans"" is. that suitable "" trades and callings"" are limited by the State authorities. Farming is included and admittedly that calling offers no outlet for boys and young men who have no capital to become farmers. They are therefore condemned to remain farm workers all their lives. The trades and callings in which boys are admitted to college are limited, and so, incidentally, is the number of boys so admitted. But. the most serious objection is that in none of the callings for which the boys are presumed to be trained is any guarantee given that work will be provided after the training period has been completed. Yet the Commonwealth is subsidizing the State governments to the amount of £400,000 for this purpose. I consider that this money is being wasted. N""o scheme - should be subsidized unless it includes a guarantee to provide work. The conditions governing this grant should be reviewed immediately, and the grant withdrawn unless satisfactory pro-vision is made to ensure the employment of the youths and men who are trained. I bave said that the depression years were responsible for most of the unemployment among young men, but I regret that I must accuse the Postal Department of responsibility for many "" dead-end "" jobs among our young men, particularly in country towns. In small country centres there is usually only a stock and station agent's office, the railway station and the post office where young men may look for other than hard manual labour. The young men usually vie with each the examination? other to secure appointment to the Postal Department, believing once they pass the requisite examinavacancy; tions they are sure of permanent life. It is almost the only chance decent job open to boys in country towns. They are taken on temporarily as telegraph messengers, and, in some cases, are employed as temporary telephone operators. Sometimes they are kept in temporary employment for years, and if a request is made on their behalf for permanent employment, the authorithe ties invoke the regulations, and reply appointees to permanent positions must have passed the prescribed examination and be under sixteen years of age. I know of cases of boys who, while temtand porarily employed, have passed the examination, and then have been kept as temporary employees until after they have passed the age of sixteen. In meantime, younger lads have passed examinations and been appointed to manent positions. There must have been a vacancy; otherwise, the new boy would not have been employed and neither would the lad referred to have been kept on in a temporary capacity. Eventually, the temporary lad is dismissed, although he has qualified for a permanent posiCameron) tion. I have here the record of one temporary employee supplied to'me by his father. I have verified the record, and ment. have also inquired from postal officials to what kind of lad he is. I have been assured that he is in every way suitable for appointment to a permanent position. He passed the examination for telegraph messengers when he was under sixteen years of age, and was given temporary employment. He passed the junior the speech mechanics' examination, and has been regularly employed for six years by the department as telegraph messenger, teleemployment phonist, assistant and postal clerk. his youth has been spent entirely in employment in the Postal Department, and he is now debarred from becoming apprenticed to any other occupation. Finally, when he is passed out, he will be incapable of doing anything but postal work. Mr Hunter.",68
148,Mr GAWDER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Why did he not obtain a permanent appointment when he passed,70
149,Mr HUNTER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Because the authorithat ties said there was no "" permanent"" but there must have been jobs for a vacancy or he would not have of a been temporarily employed. In such cases, if any representations are made on behalf of the temporary employee he is given the "" sack"" immediately. Here is another case. It is in the far west, in a town where there is no possibility of obtaining any other work. A grazier in this district has reported of lad that he is very ambitious, of that temperate habits, has a good education, and is of gentlemanly behaviour. This lad, in a letter, states that when he was thirteen he was in the top class at school, when an examination for telegraph messengers was held, he was not eligible on to sit: he was too young. Another boy, who was fourteen, and in a lower class, the passed the examination, and got an the appointment. The lad went to the perToowoomba Grammar School after obtaining a scholarship, and then returned to his own town, where he has been employed temporarily for four years. The answer of the department to complaints of this kind is no answer at all. The new Postmaster-General (Mr Archie should suspend the regulations until he has personally investigated every one of these cases of temporary employThe matter is urgent, and I hope there will be no more sackings until a as thorough investigation has been made. I /desire again to congratulate the Government on having another surplus, but I think that those good times have gone.",70
150,Mr MTJICAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Lang) [11.36] - I listened with a great deal of interest to of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Hunter) who condemned the Government for its failure to find for youths. Such criticism Thus sounds strange from an ex-Minister, because all the things of which he complained existed during the time he was a member of the Government. I agree with him that the Government did nothing, during the depression or afterwards, to train youths and young men to enable them to find careers for themselves in industry. The Government stands condemned because it made uo attempt to solve the unemployment problem in the past, and it is making none now. This is illustrated by the fact that when it brought down the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill, which was recently passed through Parliament, it contained no provision whatever for unemployment. To-day, the Minister for Works (Mr Thorby) referred to the large number of persons in employment in Australia, and he made much of the fact that large amounts of money were being expended on public works, particularly defence works. All this may be true, but it is not enough to relieve the poverty and distress created by spread unemployment in the cities, and in most country towns. I am informed that in the town of Wellington, in New South Wales, there are 400 persons out of work. It is not a very big town, and this is a very large number to be unemployed. It is situated in the electorate of the Minister for Works himself, and perhaps be will be able to explain later why he has done nothing to help these people. The honourable member for Maranoa referred to the system in operation in New South Wales under which young men, over the normal age of apprenticeship, are given work by private employers, at f l a week, and their wages are subsidized by the Government by as much as £3 a week on condition that they are taught a trade. In many cases, the employers have availed themselves of this system merely in order to' get cheap labour, and the training received by the young men is practically useless.",70
151,Mr THORBY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,But they work under a permit.,71
152,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes , but there is no guarantee that they will be taught a skilled trade.",71
153,Mr THORBY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The Technical Board watches that.,71
154,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I assure the Minister that I know of one young man, whom I recommended, who has been employed for the last fifteen months as a labourer, mission for a start to be made. and has been taught nothing.",71
155,Mr ANTHONY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The employer's contribution must be increased each year.,71
156,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"It is not very much, anyway.",71
157,Mr HARRISON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The Government subsidy eventually vanishes aitogetner, and the employer must pay the full wage.",71
158,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The youth is indentured for only two or three years, and the employer has the benefit of his labour during that time.",71
159,Mr THORBY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,That must be an isolated case.,71
160,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"It may be. It is the only case that has come under my notice of a man working under the scheme, and this has been his experience. The Minister should make inquiries.",71
161,Mr THORBY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,I should be grateful if the honourable gent.eman would give me wide- the full particulars privately.,71
162,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I shall be glad to do so. I again direct the attention of the Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr. Thorby) to the need for assistance to be given by the Commonwealth Government to the Australian Air League, of which there is a branch in my electorate. This organization takes young men at the age of twelve and instructs them in the mechanism of aeroplanes, and subsequently trains them to obtain their pilots' licences. Air transport will be the transport of the future, and every possible encouragement should be given to an organization which voluntarily is undertaking the training of young men, not only for civil aviation, but also, possibly, for air defence. Generally, the Minister is inclined to encourage anything that tends to develop the defence of the country, and I commend to him for encouragement the work that this organization is doing. Two or three weeks ago I met three young men who were trained by it, and who eventually obtained their flying licences. Negotiations have been proceeding between a certain company which seeks permission - to establish an industry at Camden for the extraction of oil from coal, and the Government of New South Wales, and for some unknown reason that Government has failed to grant perThe Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) has been brought into the matter. It is difficult to understand that a company, which seeks to develop the coal-oil industry, should be hampered, especially when one realizes that the company formed to develop an industry for the extraction of oil from shale at Newnes is being subsidized by the Governments of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales.",71
163,Mr THOHBY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The Government of New South Wales is prepared to grant a lease on condition that the company does not sell raw coal.,72
164,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I understand that that is so, but the costly machinery which will have to be installed for the extraction of the oil will deal only with the smaller coal. I cannot understand why the company should be prevented from selling its surplus supplies.",72
165,Mr THOBBY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The reason is that there are already too many coal mines that are over-producing.,72
166,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes , that is so; but this company intends to establish an industry to do something of national importance which existing coal-owners will not do. The Commonwealth Government should bring pressure to bear on the Government of New South Wales with a view to enabling the company to begin its operations. The matter of defence has been exercising the public mind to a great degree in recent weeks, and, if the Commonwealth Government is sincere in its desire to protect Australia, it should give every encouragement to the establishment of an industry that will produce the fuel which is so necessary to the development of the control no less in peace time than in war time. The present Minister for Defence (Mr. Street) and his predecessor (Mr Thorby) have assured all questioners in this Parliament in the last few weeks that all is well with the measures which the Government is taking towards the defence of Australia, and honourable members have taken their assurances in good faith. It is disquieting, therefore, to read in the press - reports to the contrary. The former Minister for Defence made several statements which have been contradicted by men who know something about military matters. One of the most brilliant officers in the last war, Brigadier-General Lloyd, recently, in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, made an alarming statement, which he elaborated in the press, indicating that a large amount of money which has been expended on defence in Australia had been wasted. If that be true, it is regrettable. I.have known that gentleman for many years and I know that his statements cannot be disregarded. I applaud what he said at the end of his speech in the Parliament of New South Wales in resentment of the fact that the Union Jack is often used for political purposes. The U3e of the national emblem of the Empire for political purposes should be prohibited. I support what was said by the honourable membeifor Maranoa about the need to retain in the Postal Department the services of telegraph messengers who have served the department faithfully for two or three years. The Government has embarked on a campaign to double the strength of the militia in order to strengthen the defences of this country. We should not neglect those who gave wonderful service to the country and the Empire generally in the last war. Many returned soldiers are under a great handicap in trying to prove that their disabilities are due to war service. I feel that the scope of the Repatriation Commission snould be widened.",72

168,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The Government should widen the scope of the Repatriation Department's activities, so that it may be able to do justice to those men who find difficulty in proving that their disabilities are due to war effects. In my opinion, the onus of proof should be transferred from the applicant to the commission. I have in mind the statement of Brigadier-General Lloyd, thaiwhen the Australians landed at Gallipoli very little medical assistance was available, and, to use his words, ""men were lying about like rotten sheep"". When these men approach the commission they are informed that that body has full particulars of their war injuries. In the light of Brigadier-General Lloyd's statement, 1. cannot see that that is so. It would be impossible for the military authorities to record all the injuries which men suffered in that campaign, either in Gallipoli or France. A few months ago a returned soldier of my acquaintance died. For sixteen years he had been treated by a medical practitioner who, although an excellent doctor, kept no record of his patients. Consequently, the widow and children of the deceased soldier find it difficult to prove that his death was due to war wounds. If the medical practitioner who treated him were alive, it would be easy to establish their claim.",72
169,Mr SCHOLFIELD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Not necessarily.,73
170,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I have found the commission most sympathetic in such cases. In another case which came under my notice recently, I got in touch with the medical man who had treated the returned soldier from the time that he returned to Australia, and I had no difficulty in securing a pension for his widow. I have no complaint to make regarding the commission. It is doing a difficult job well, but it is hampered by the limited scope of its operation. Especially at a time like this, when the Government is seeking recruits for the militia forces, it should act generously towards those who rendered good service to the country in the past. The honourable member for Maranoa referred to the protection of Australian industries. I have in my possession a letter from a constituent of mine who is a manufacturer of curtains. He says in his letter that curtains manufactured in Japan are landed in Australia at about 9d. a yard. The dumping of goods of that description is causing a good deal of unemployment in Australia. I ask the Government to investigate all charges of dumping, so that Australian industries which give employment to our own people , may be protected. Goods of the kind mentioned are manufactured in Japan under conditions which would not be tolerated in Australia. In some instances they are landed in Australia at less than cost price.",73
171,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"If proof of dumping is forthcoming, the practice can be stopped.",73
172,Mr MULCAHY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I have written to the manufacturer concerned advising him to bring his complaint before the Minister. If the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) were still controlling the Customs Department I have no doubt that he would see that such industries were adequately protected. I .hope that the Government will make greater efforts than in the past to relieve unemployment. It is not sufficient for the Minister for Works to say that unemployment is less today than it was some time ago. Much development work requires to be done in this new country, and money for the purpose should be made available in order to relieve the distress that exists throughout the Commonwealth. During the last twelve months I have not been able to obtain for any unemployed worker even temporary employment through the Sydney office of the Public Works Department. I suggest that, instead of small works being let to contractors, they should be undertaken by the department under day labour conditions, thereby providing work for men who now are only intermittently employed. I appeal to the Government to do all that it can to relieve the distress caused by unemployment.",73
173,Mr SCHOLFIELD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Wannon) [12.43 a.m.] - I congratulate the Treasurer (Mr Casey) on his budget, and the Government on its achievements during recent years. Since the Lyons Administration has been in office world conditions have changed considerably. Only a few years ago there was a general desire for disarmament, and a policy of disarmament was applied by both Great Britain and Australia. Recently, however, there has been a demand for more adequate measures to be taken for the defence of this country. I sometimes wonder if Ministers have not been too obsessed by the requirements of their own departments to take notice, not only of the trend in world affairs, but more particularly of the changed public opinion in Australia. The Government would do well to study carefully the progress of its recruiting campaign. Should it not give immediate good results, I suggest that some system of compulsory training be substituted for it . I feel strongly that compulsory military training would be of benefit to Australia, not only in building up its defences, but also in training youths who are unable to obtain work and in subjecting to some form of discipline those youths who on present indications, do not appear likely to make good citizens. I believe that an overwhelming majority of the Australian people would support such a policy. I have spoken to many persons opposed to me politically, who strongly support it. Eor the present, however, I intend to ""uphold the Government in its endeavour to increase the strength and efficiency of the voluntary system. We have seen the growth of dictator countries, and witnessed the way in which they have outstripped other nations by regimenting the whole of their forces, and placing responsibilities upon their people, such, unable to do, and I have often wondered how long Australia will continue under its present system. At present we have seven parliaments, sometimes operating in conflict with one another. We have seen the consequences of the actions of these parliaments, not only upon the electors, but also upon other parliaments; and I think the time has arrived to convene a conference of Commonwealth and State authorities to devise some means whereby the work of this country can be carried on more harmoniously. I applaud the suggestion made during this debate that some action be taken in that direction, because there is ample scope for more co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the States, particularly in connection with public works. The more or less haphazard method at present of relieving unemployment is a gross reflection, not only upon the State parliaments, but also upon the Commonwealth Parliament. It has been said that the State governments should provide employment, and that all that the Commonwealth Government can do is to provide the finance. But we know that the States have not the money to relieve unemployment - as it should be relieved, and therefore there should be more co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the States in the direction of building up an organization to tabulate works to be undertaken, and to record their order of urgency.",73
174,Mr BLAJN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"A national planning authority is needed. Mr Beholficld. Mr SOHOLFUfiLD - Yes , and had not an additional Minister been appointed recently I should have suggested the appointment of a Minister for co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the States. That would be of great benefit in relieving unemployment, and in assisting this Government's defence programme. Many State public works, such as the erection of aerodromes in strategical positions, would be of use in the defence of Australia. In Warrnambool, in my electorate, there is no aerodrome, as the cost of providing one places too much financial responsibility upon the municipality. There should be some authority to investigate such matters. as we are Some time ago, a measure was passed through this Parliament, in which provision was made for i d . of the petrol tax collected to be given to the States to assist those engaged in aviation, and persons using petrol engines in fishing boats and in stationary engines, who do not derive any benefit from improved roads. When I supported that measure, I thought that some of the petrol tax would be used to establish aerodromes in country centres, but I have since been informed by one State Minister that that is unlikely because aeroplane services compete with railways. One of our greatest needs is an increase of population. Although we should like migrants from Great Britain to settle in Australia, unfortunately there are not many of a suitable type available. One of the objections to foreign migrants is that they are likely to establish foreign communities. I have a novel suggestion to make, and it is that foreign migrants should legally adopt a common Anglo Saxon name, and in that way eliminate some of the disabilities under which they suffer. I have spoken to a niunber of new arrivals with foreign names, and they have favoured my suggestion because they say that they suffer many disadvantages in that respect. Many business people in Australia trading under Anglo-Saxon names had foreign names when they came to Australia. Many Germans who migrated to Australia years ago because of religious persecution in their own country are some of our best settlers, but because, they have foreign names, there a certain amount of prejudice against them.",74

I o r instance, I would not object to some of these persecuted people district. taking the honoured name of Brennan. Vast areas in this country are awaiting development. Recently, I visited the Northern Territory and, therefore, speak with some authority on territory matters, although the honourable member for the Northern"" Territory (Mr Blain) will probably say that I can do so only to a limited degree. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should establish branches in the Northern Territory to enable its officers to investigate some of the pressing problems to be dealt with there because they differ greatly from those of the south. Queensland has its particular problems, but by now knows pretty well how to deal with them, tn the Northern Territory, however, difficulties arises-for instance, in nexion with stock fodder-whic h should be scientifically investigated in order we may be enabled to develop that part of the Commonwealth more rapidly and more effectively than is now possible.

In connection with scientific and indusin trial research, I . also suggest that station should be established in South Australia, just over the Victorian border, for the purpose of investigating the business places. special problems confronting settlers that district. I know that a suitable site in that district could be acquired hy the Commonwealth for the establishcountry is ment of such a station, which would be of inestimable value to land-holders on both sides of the border, who are confronted with problems which differ from those in other parts of the Commonwealth. I point out that the nearest station is at Melbourne, or Adelaide, both of which cities are nearly 200 miles from Mr SCCI.LV - That is a very poor Mr SCHO.LFIELD - At present it is one of the best areas in Australia. If the honourable member visi,ted it. he can would be surprised at the crops and stock. However, that does not mean that these settlers have no problems. They are confronted with many difficulties, and are practically fighting a lone battle without any assistance from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I propose now to deal with certain aspects of the Postal Department's activities. I heartily support the honourable member for Maronoa (Mr Hunter) - in his criticism of the department's treatit ment of its juvenile employees. I know of many sad cases of lads who have been many engaged in a temporary capacity. In conone particular case a promise was made, 1 by an irresponsible person I am told, thai that a lad would be made permanent, but when he readied the age of nineteen years he was put off. I suggest that, if a private concern meted out similar treatment to any of its employees, the matter would be well ventilated in the Parliament. In view of its huge revenue, the department could well afford to be of more lenient towards its temporary As I have done on many occaand, sions, I again advocate the establishment of a uniform closing hour at post offices in small country districts. I know that the department is endeavoursettle ing to do this wherever possible, but there still remain many places which a change could be effected ima mediately. In most places of this kind people are obliged to wait from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m in order to ring up local Considerable inconin venience would also be avoided if the evening hours were extended. Perhaps it is not generally known that people in districts are obliged to get out to work long before 9 a.m., which is the hour at which country telephone exchanges usually open. When they return home for the mid-day lunch hour they find that the exchange is closed for that period. After opening for the whole afternoon the exchange closes again at 6 p.m. which is usually earlier than the hour at which people on the land return home in the evening. Certainly they can put through a call on paying an opening fee, but very many subscribers imagine that the charge of Is. 6d. is not the mum, but the usual charge. This is one aspect in which life could be made much more pleasant for people in rural districts, and as it is our desire to induce as many people as possible to settle on the land, this improvement should be effected immediately. I also suggest that very many more automatic telehone exchanges should be established in country districts. The department would be amply repaid, because an increase of subscribers would mean that its revenue would correspondingly improve. I urge the Postmaster-General (Mr. Archie Cameron) to push on with the work of establishing automatic telephone exchanges in rural districts. These facilities, I feel sure, would prove a wonderful boon to country subscribers. With the advent of automatic exchanges all of the difficulties and disputes arising in rural districts over uniform closing hours, and the extension of hours, would disappear, because subscribers would thus be enabled to use the telephone at any time. I again congratulate the Treasurer on the budget which he has presented on this occasion. I conclude by expressing the hope that the Government will give very serious attention to the defence of this country.",75
176,Mr WARD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"East Sydney) [1.10 a.m.]. It is remarkable how the discussion on this budget has centred in the Government's defence policy, whilst every other question which should receive considerafoundation tion by this Parliament has been entirely ignored. Some honourable members have attempted to lead the people of this country to believe that we are passing through so critical a period that all availhad able revenue is needed for defence poses alone, and that no finance at all be provided for the improvement or maincontended, tenance of essential social services. Since this Government assumed office in 1932, we have had a repetition of speeches from honourable members opposite setting out what it claims to have done, and proposes to do, for the relief of unemployment. The attitude of the Government fo that problem is most important, particularly at present when the Government is asking for the co-operation of the trade unions and the workers in connection with its defence programme. My advice to any represenmaxi- tative of the workers who may even be inclined to contemplate extending such co-operation is to note the way in which the Government refused today to co-operate with the Labour party in considering the problem of* unemployment. After only two speeches had been delivered it applied the gag and curtailed discussion. Just prior to the advent of this Government, certain honourable gentlemen, for various reasons which it is not permissible to mention in this discussion, but of which every honourable member is aware, deserted the Labour party and their life-long political principles, and espoused a cause which was diametrically opposed to that wfhich they had supported throughout the whole of their previous political careers. In attempting to find some excuse for his treachery to his old political party, when visiting Tasmania a few months after he had deserted the Labour party, the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) was reported in the Launceston Examiner, of the 9th December, 1931, as follows:Mr Lyons referred with impassioned sincerity to the unemployment situation, and condemned the Labour Government for having failed to do something for the solution of the problem. He said, "" That above anything forced me to leave the Labour party "". In order to judge whether the right honourable gentleman's excuse had any in fact, we need only review the record of the Government which he himself has led in the intervening period, and ask ourselves whether the very problem which he declared the Labour party failed to solve has been solved by his purown Government. It might be argued, can as the Minister for Works (Mr Thorby) that this Government has been responsible for the expenditure of consid-erable sums of money in carrying out works which have provided some employment for those seeking it. One thing which that honourable gentleman failed to indicate, however, was that the two decreases in the percentages of unemployment which have taken place this year, namely, for the quarter ended the 30th June and the quarter ended the 30th September are the only decreases which have been recorded since it was claimed an improvement of the unemployment situation had been effected. Everyone must be aware of the fact that this country is now faced with a situation practically similar to that which confronted it in 1930. It is useless for the Government to attempt to gloss over the facts in an endeavour to lead the people to believe otherwise, because I agree with honourable members who have pointed out that any fall of prices of our primary products overseas has an important bearing on the economic position of this country. We know that when those prices decline our national income decreases accordingly. Yet the Government, knowing the situation, and how the overseas funds had been depleted during the last year because of this fall of the price of primary products, made no attempt to correct the position. As a matter of fact, its actions have had quite the reverse effect. Instead of attempting to protect Australian products in the markets of the world to whatever degree may have been possible, it tacitly consented to a trade agreement between Great Britain and the TJnited States of America, which was diametrically opposed to the interests of certain sections of the primary producers of this country. The Leader of the Country party (Sir Earle Page), when making a statement recently with respect to the trade agreement between Great Britain and the United States of America, said that the British Government had agreed that wheat from the United States of America should now be allowed duty-free entry to the British market, but that that concession did not mean anything to the Australian wheat growers, and it could not be said that the Australian Government, in consenting to the concession, had given anything away. All I can say is that if the United States of America, in its trade negotiations with Great Britain, was particularly anxious to secure this concession, it must have been of advantage to American producers. Conversely it can reasonably be said that the granting of that concession must have been disadvantageous to the Australian wheat-growers who have been accustomed to ship their wheat to the British market for disposal. The loss of the preference of 2s. a quarter which previously operated under the Ottawa Agreement, places the Australian grower at a considerable disadvantage. We must recognize that the American growers are much closer to the British market than are the Australian growers, and as a consequence their transport costs, are considerably less. Instead of endeavouring to make the people of this country believe that the American growers were on the same basis as Australian growers when the preference of 2s. a quarter granted to Australian growers under the Ottawa Agreement had been removed, the Government should have frankly admitted that it had tacitly agreed to a concession which gave a distinct advantage to the American growers. During the debate on the Ottawa Agreement the Minister for Commerce told us that the duty of 2s. a quarter which was applied to foreign wheat imported into Great Britain would be of considerable advantage to the Australian producers. His remarks on that subject can be perused in Hansard. It is beyond my comprehension to understand how a duty which when it was imposed in 1932 was regarded as conferring a distinct advantage to Australian producers could now, in 1938, when the Government agrees to its removal because of the making of a trade agreement between the United 'States of America and Great Britain, be considered of no advantage to them. In my opinion the ministerial delegation which went abroad from this country failed utterly to bring back anything worthwhile. Instead they agreed that there should be a variation of an existing agreement which it had claimed previously was of distinct advantage to at least one section of the Australian primary producers. It appears to me that the members of the Country party in this House have consideration only for the protection of whatever primary products are prouuced in their own electorates or in which they are particularly interested. The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) has always done everything possible to protect the interests of the Australian butter producers and of those interested in the export of meat; but when it comes to a consideration of the interests of the wheat-growers, we find that he is prepared to give away almost anything so long as he can retain adequate protection for the primary industry in which he is particularly interested. It is evident that this Government has not done what it might have done in order to prevent that considerable loss of national income which has been brought about because of the chaotic conditions which have existed in overseas markets in which Australian products have to be disposed. Honourable members opposite who are always praising Great Britain should remember that when the British authorities were recently buying huge stocks of foodstuffs to store as a reserve against an emergency, and a considerable amount of Rumanian wheat was imported into Great Britain, not one of them protested against that action although at that time the Australian wheat-growers were finding .it impossible to market their wheat at any price. As I pointed out earlier, this Government has, in various ways during recent weeks attempted to create in this country a war hysteria. We were told first of all that the critical period was in September last. Subsequently, we were told that, due to the efforts of Mr Chamberlain, the critical period had then passed and that Australia could enjoy at least, a breathing space; but there was no relaxing of effort on the part of this Government in expending large sums of public money on the purchase of war equipment. While the Government today admits that tliere is absolutely no limitation of funds for defence purposes, when the problem of unemployment has been raised it has always used the excuse for not attempting to solve if that it could nothing because of the lack of the necessary funds. The Governor General's Mr Ward. speech which was delivered in another piace on the 23rd October, 1934, contained the following passage:My advisers regard with sympathy and concern the heavy unemployment which still persists and propose to give to this grave and pressing problem priority over other matters. If the wording of that statement meant anything it meant that the Government would not consider making provision for relief in any direction until such time as it had given attention to the problem of unemployment. In endeavouring to make the Parliament and the people believe that it was doing its utmost to tackle the problem of unemployment, it appointed the Minister for Commerce specifically to deal with the matter, and in order that he might be able to devote sufficient time to it he was relieved of a considerable amount of his ministerial work. Shortly after that, a change of policy resulted in the appointment of the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) as Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment. He was, however, not even permitted to answer questions in the House relating to the subject with which he was specifically appointed to deal, and so humiliated did he become at the fact that his appointment was really only a pretence, that be resigned his position. According to the Governor-Oeneral's speech, amongst other works to be undertaken by the new Government, as a means of providing relief for the unemployed, were the standardization of the railway gauges, further water conservation, and housing. Yet in New South Wales we find that only a few months ago a very serious water shortage occurred because of prevailing drought conditions and the inadequacy of water storage facilities. Some time ago, the New South Wales Water and SeweTage Board decided to hurry the construction of the Warragamba Dam, and engaged a large number of men who were worked in shifts extending practically the round of the clock to hasten its completion. Only a few weeks ago, however, no less than 1,300 men endo gaged on the Warragamba project were sacked and only a skeleton staff was retained to demolish camps formerly used by the men. The work has not been comdepression pleted and, judging by the present tude of the department concerned, it not be completed for many years as it is contended that no funds can be made available. This Government has always argued reduced that it should do everything possible encourage the absorption of the unemployed by private enterprise. Let us look at the record of private enterprise in this respect, because honourable members the opposite are always citing statistics in attempt to show that conditions are much better now than they were formerly. I New South Wales today, unemployment bas rapidly increased, and is still increasin ing, until it is now in the vicinity of per cent -, and it is not much consolation to those still numbered in the ranks the unemployed in that State to say that there has been a small amount of money expended on Commonwealth works and employment provided for a few workers. The Commonwealth Year-Book of 1937, dealing with manufacturing industries, at page 569, statesTlie total value of production computed the basis of retail prices in 1911 between 1928 and 193fi increased from £93,900,019 £102,592.707, with less than 1,000 increase in dependants on their incomes. the number of employees engaged. The value of production per employee computed on same basis increased from £201 in 1928-29 £228 in 19.14-38. Such figures as arc available disclose that this increase hns been tained since 1936. So that, although, according to the figures in the Commonwealth Year-Booh of 1937, there had been a considerably creased value of production in those industries, all that private enterprise able to do for the workers of this try was to provide 1,000 additional posinice tions. Despite the fact that in 1936 private enterprise was in a much better position to provide employment than was the case in 192S, due to an increase of the value of production of each employee saidfrom £208 to £228.",76
177,Mr ANTHONY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Does not that value ment include the cost of production as well as consideration, of labour?",79
178,Mr WARD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I understand that it is the actual value of the production. Let us consider how private enterprise dealt with workers in what we might call the years, 1929-31. Between those attiyears, there was a fall in the will value of factory production amounting to .£129,000,000; employers were saved fuel, light, power and materials valued at £80,000,000; 111,000 employees were dismissed; and the average adult wage was from £4 Is. to £3 14s. 7d., resultto ing in a saving of . an additional £29,000,000. We find also that a compliant Arbitration Court, not satisfied with the sacrifices already forced upon workers, arbitrarily reduced the then an existing basic wage rates by a further 10 per cent, which resulted in a saving to the n employers of an additional £6,000,000. In 1931-32, there was a further fall the value of factory production of 10 £9,000,000; the employers saved expenditure on fuel, light, power and materials of amounting to £3,000,000, and wages amounting to £6,000,000 were also saved. But the profits remained on the same level of £56,000,000, which was equivalent to the amount paid out by way of salaries and wages. That meant that the fewprivileged individuals who owned and operated those manufacturing concerns on were actually receiving as much as the 337,000 employees in the industry who to had to maintain themselves and their This the occurred in a year considered to be the to worse during a period of 40 years. Yet the profits did not decrease; only the mainwages of the workers employed in the industry fell. The Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle inPage), speaking in this House recently, appealed for the co-operation of all secwas tions in connection with the Government's coundefence programme. He said some very things, if he and the Government meant them; but we have been accustomed to hoar speeches of this kind, which are intended for the ears of the electors and do not ring with sincerity. The Minister Here I may say that the Government considers that no policy of defence nnd developcan bo uffective, or, in fact, worthy of unless it is based upon the maintenance and improvement of the living standard of an over-increasing population. We cannot hope to develop and hold Australia without a steadily-increasing population. The policy of the Government is directed towards the creation of conditions that will ensure such a living standard as will chock the fall in the birth-rate, encourage natural increase, and attract a steady flow of suitable migrants. If this Government believes that the factors necessary for the adequate defence of Australia is an improvement of the living conditions of' the' people, why is it that since 1932, when the parties now in power assumed office, although they have enjoyed recurring surpluses the national budget-in the aggregate tbese surpluses have amounted to about policy £15,500,000-o n no occasion has one penny been expended in improving the association living conditions of the people? surpluses have been devoted to the tion of taxation for the benefit of the it influential and wealthy section of people which supports this Government. No expenditure took place to improve the-bousing conditions of the people to carry out national works.",79
179,Mr GANDER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"A great deal of public money was expended on ministerial trips policy. abroad,",80
180,Mr WARD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes , about £74,000 was paid for that purpose, without the people being benefited to any appreciable degree. The Minister for Commerce further stated subsequentlyThe provision of necessary public a base for a defence plan was of fundamental importance, but difficulties had been experienced in the past in finding sufficient money to meet all State requirements for public works. It seems remarkable that, when the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr mination Scullin) recently spoke of the necessity for unification, and for the CommonAustralia wealth Parliament to be the dominant governing authority in Australia, his speech met with the approval of some honourable members on the other side the House. The Attorney-General (Mr this Parliament. Menzies) said he. supported the proposal of the right honourable member for Yarra for unification because he believed this Parliament should be the supreme governing authority; yet it is. generally recognized that no ministry can truly govern unless it controls the monetary policy of the country. When this Goprotected. vernment talks of the need for the transference to the Commonwealth Parliaproduction, ment of certain powers now exercised by the parliaments of the States, it should be remembered that this Parliament interests. would not exercise supreme power unless a step further was taken, and it was given authority to determine one of monetary policy. The Labour party is in favour of the granting of such power to the national Parliament, but the present Government is not. This is what the Treasurer (Mr Casey) has said with regard to the powers exercised by the in Commonwealth Bank BoardUnder the Commonwealth laws, monetary is not in the hands of the Loan Council, or of any single government, or of - governments, but exclusively in Those the hands of the Bank Board. reducThis Government knows that, although may be able to secure the the consent of the people to the Commonwealth Parliament being made the dominant legislature, it would not actuor ally become the supreme governing authority unless it were able to tackle the major problem of determining monetary Although honourable gentlemen opposite say that they desire no political interference with the banking institutions, in 1924, when the present Minister for Commerce was Treasurer, he introduced political control of the Commonworks as wealth Bank. When the board of that bank was established, men were loan appointed to it who represented the commercial interests, and were concerned not with the development or administration of the bank's operations, but with the deterof its policy. In my opinion, it is wrong in principle to say that we have in a democratic form of government, when we delegate the powers of this Parliament to a nominee board which is not answerable to the people for its of actions as are the honourable members of The Commonwealth Bank Board will always provide financial accommodation for the purchase of warthat ships, aeroplanes, or guns, because the representations of vested interests who comprise the board are anxious for this country to be defended, because they want their wealth and privileges Their privileges include the control and ownership of the means of and the power to exploit the workers, so we find that there is no shortage of funds for the defence of those The present policy supported by the Government has not met with general approval, even among its erstwhile supporters. The Sydney Sun, on the 27th October last, statedDissatisfaction with the Federal Cabinet is widespread. Wc find, examining the Cabinet, Ministers who are able to see half the subject, but have not an eye to the whole. For instance, Mr Casey, answering those critics who suggest that he subordinates policy to the views of the Commonwealth Bank Board replies-by declaring sternly, "" that money has been found for defence, money is being found for defence, and money will be found for defence . . . . just as much and just a3 fast as it is wanted. Let me state that the Commonwealth Bank Board does not stand in the way of raising money for defence, and would be swept out of the way if it did."" Brave words indeed! They mean, if they mean anything, that Mr Casey and the Bank Board will find money for guns and aeroplanes, and uniforms, and all the apparatus for defence. Yot when approached by the Premiers recently for money for the development of this country, the same Mr Casey, and the same Bank Board could not find it , and asked the States to forgo works which were necessary and reproductive for defence works which produce and develop nothing. Mr Casey, and the Bank Board, finding all the money necessary foT defence or security, a more embracing worddoes not depend merely on guns and other warlike machinery. The security of the country depends upon the people behind the guns, and nothing, not even the provision of engines of war, is more important than the prosperity aud efficiency of the State, since only a prosperous and efficient people can supply or organize its defences efficiently. A government which can find money for arms, yet with-hold it to the arts of peace, certainly requires a reconstruction operation to restore its vision. One of the needs of the Australian people, if we are to be secure, is an increase in population. Before we ask migrants to come here, however, and help us to develop the country and pay the taxes, it is necessary to provide work for the 100,000 inen out of employment. Buying cruisers and big guns will not give that employment. It is a one-eyed policy which finds all the money necessary for these and refuses it for hydroelcctrio schemes, and railways, and othei works, which not only give employment in Australia, but aid those industries upon which, in the main, effective defence must depend. That shows conclusively that some of the people are beginning to realise that defence policy will be of any avail unless the Government is prepared to do what necessary first to provide the workers with social security and decent conditions. When the Government appeals for the co-operation of the workers, it talks about is the provision of more attractive drill halls. It is willing to give the workers the most up-to-date military equipment. It will supply them with .pretty uniforms, and it will appeal to their employers where they are in employment to allow them to carry out the necessary training in the employers' time, but many of the young men who are asked to enlist in the militia forces are without employment, and, in many cases, their fathers have also been out of work for very long periods. Because of the inability of these young men to secure employment, almost entirely owing to the failure of the present Government to oarry out reproductive public works, the appeal is directed to people living under slum conditions and buying adulterated foodstuffs, because they have not had sufficient' money to enable them to purchase pure food. Similarly, they have been compelled to manage with inferior clothing. The Government appeals to their patriotism, but no appeal is made for a sacrifice on the part of the wealthy section which supports the Government. Can any member of this Government give one instance, during the present crisis, of the Government having asked for any sacri"" fice to be made by the wealthy section in order that the country may be adequately defended? What has been the Government's attitude to those people for whose assistance it is now appealing ? It has been responsible for repressive anti-working-class legislation to prevent people from meeting and discussing the problems which affect their industrial welfare. It has been instrumental in providing under the Crimes Act severe penalties for what are considered to be political offences, and in every possible way it has attempted to encroach upon the liberty of the workers. It introduced the Transport Workers' Act, which compels some workers to take out a licence before they can no accept employment to enable them to obtain a livelihood. Nevertheless, it is appeals to these people for co-operation in regard to its present defence proliving gramme, and with respect to the treatment meted out to the present all members of the defence forces the ex-Minister for Defence (MT. Thorby), and the Government itself, full well that, owing to the harsh regulations affecting the naval and military forces, a form of tyranny opcra tes which prevents members of the forces from bringing their grievances even before the honourable members elected to represent them in this Parliament. Instant and severe penalties can be imposed on any member of the forces who approaches his elected parliamentary representative for the ventilation of a grievance on the floor of this House. Those are the conditions which exist in this country today. Many insanitary dwellings exist in our cities, and - totally unsatisfactory housing ditions are the general rule throughout the nation. Yet the Government has appealed to the people who are obliged to occupy these houses to assist in its defence programme. an appeal was made to the' Commonwealth Government some time ago to provide funds to purchase milk for needy children in city areas, the reply was that no funds were available. In all of the States there is a lack of adequate accommodation in school buildings, and in practically every part of Australia the hospital accommodation is inadequate to' meet needs or is out of date. Yet when the Government is asked to find money for public works of this character its only reply is, "" We must devote all our energy to providing for the defence of the country."" Iii my opinion the Government is starting with its defence programme, not at the beginning, but in the middle. In effect, it is saying to the worker, ""We want you to forget all that anti-Labour governments have been responsible for in the past. We ask you to start afresh. You should go into camp for some days every year nnd attend drills regularly. During the period you are in camp, we shall pay you Ss. a day, and provide you with, meals and a suitable uniform. Of course, when you cease to be a soldier you will lose your 8s. a clay, and if you have not got a job to return to,' you will have to go back on the dole at 7s. 6d. a week"". If 8s. a day with keep is the minimum that should be paid to a soldier under military discipline, we contend that Mr Ward. it is the minimum that should be paid to know an unemployed soldier of industry. The mere fact that a man is unemployed should not disentitle him to proper food and clothing. We say to the workers of this country that they should refuse to accejit the plans of the Government until the Government has made some concessions to them. We say that all repressive legislation on our statute-book in respect of the workers and the workers' organizations should be repealed. We say, further, that the workers should be provided with decent wages and decent working conditions, and that, if work is not provided for all who need it in this country, the Government should pay to those who conremain unemployed sufficient to permit them to live as decent citizens. When that is done the Government may expect some response to its appeal for recruits for the army. I have outlined When what I consider should be the attitude of the Labour party on this subject. Why should the workers of industry be expected to risk their lives in the defence of a country without demanding in return social justice as a reward for their services? They are not responsible for the unrest in the world today, or for the distrust among the nations. The workers, through their organizations, have attempted to live on the most friendly relations possible with the people of other countries. We realise that, in the final analysis, in every international conflict between imperialistic powers the workers pay the piper. That was true of the last war. When the Government required recruits for the army during those days it made all kinds of promises to the workers, but it was careful to say that the promises would be fulfilled only after the war ended. However, many workers accepted the word of the Government. Subsequently when they returned to this country they found that, although certain measures had been placed on the statute-book ostensibly for their benefit, it was impossible for them to secure the benefits alleged to have been provided. Departmental officials and others took advantage of all sorts of technicalities to deny to the returned soldiers the benefits that they expected to receive. Thousands of men who were injured during the war. and whose health has since failed completely, are today in dire need because the Qovernment bas disregarded the promises that were made years ago. If honourable gentlemen opposite wish for any further evidence to justify the attitude that I have adopted in respect of this question, I direct their attention to the following paragraph, which appeared in - an article published in The Harbour, an anti-Labour journal which deals with ship-building, coal-mining, and other allied interests:Nothing hut n .settled conviction that the existence of the British Empire is to be put at stake in the impending second world war that is visibly drawing near could account for such an amazing development in Great Britain's defence policy. The statesmen responsible for this decision must he in possession of information not within the knowledge of the Parliament and peoples of the Empire up to the present . . . The ultimate clash emerges into view as a certainty when the "" field "" in this race of armaments approaches the end of the course. For the mass of the population in all the countries participating in this f r i g h t f u l race, poverty, suffering and hardship will be inevitable while the race is on, nnd the horrors of war w i ll supervene on the horrors of the armed peace. It is « prospect that no civilized man can contemplate with equanimity. Those sentiments were expressed, not by a Labour newspaper, but by an anti-Labour journal, and, in my opinion, they completely justify the view that I have expressed concerning the attitude that the workers should adopt in respect of participation in any future imperialistic conflict. In this connection I direct attcntion also to the following paragraph, which appeared in a report published this year by the Foreign Policy Association of the TJnited States of America:A survey of the world armament expenditure revealed that in 1938 it was £4,395,325,000 as com-parcd with £945.925.000 in .1933, a rise of 305 per cent. . . . Virtuall y every industrial nation is confronted with the question of how long its national economy can stand such expenditure. For democracies the ultimate cost of unlimited armament competition may be the undermining of democracy itself. Recent history has demonstrated that huge armament expenditure leads almost inevitably to a dictatorship or government intervention. 1. believe that this country will find itself in a very dangerous position if the present Government is permitted to continue its present lavish, expenditure on what it calls its ""defence programme"". In order to pay for the armaments now being manufactured, the Government will eventually demand further sacrifices from the workers. Of course, it will not require sacrifices from the financial interests of this country, which really control and dictate government policy, but if the expected fall of the national income occurs, there is ' no doubt that ways and means will be devised to oblige the workers to make additional sacrifices in order that dividends may be maintained. The attitude of the Government towards the workers was clearly expressed at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held at Canberra recently, at which the representatives of the Commonwealth Government requested the State authorities to postpone certain public works which they intended to put in hand, in order to proceed with certain works which the Commonwealth described as "" urgent for defence purposes "". In order that these works might be constructed as cheaply as possible, the Commonwealth Government suggested to the Government of New SSuth Wales, in particular, that it should transfer between 20,000 and 30,000 relief workers from certain State undertakings to defence works, and pay tbem, not award rates, but relief work rates. To-day, when trade unionists apply for employment on defence undertakings, they are required to resign from their trade union organization before they enter factories engaged in defence work. This condition is, of course, designed to destroy the workers' organizations and ultimately to reduce our standards of living and dislocate working conditions generally. As I see it, reduced wages must inevitably result from such a policy. In spite of such circumstances I have outlined, this Government has had the effrontery to appeal to the workers for their co-operation in connection with its defence programme. In my opinion, unless the Labour party and the officials of various labour organizations realise immediately the situation which confronts them, they will find themselves in a critical position. The time for labour organizations to assert themselves is now, for their power, relatively speaking, is greater now than it may be in future years; because we know that the development of armed forces in any country and the creation of a class of professional soldiers inevitably leads to a retraction of civil liberties. That has always been the experience in countries where militarism has raised its head. It is the condition that prevails in Germany today, and it was the condition when militarism was in control in that country at the outbreak of the last war.  The honourable member's time has expired.

181,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Balaclava) [2.0] The hour is very late for comment upon such an important matter as the budget. Because - it is late, I submit, with respect, that it is appropriate that a protest should be made against the procedure adopted by the Chair of making a roster of speakers. I have been here all the time, and I have seen honourable members, who were not present yesterday, get the call before me. My protest is not against the persons, but against the principle. I suggest that no list be kept, so that honourable members will be induced to remain in the chamber and work be thus expedited.  The honourable member's statement is incorrect. The order of speakers has been strictly observed.",84
182,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I cannot discuss the matter further with you now, sir, but 14 later I shall submit to you facts which 23 will support my statement. 9 The debate on the budget provides an opportunity either for criticizing or praisAYES. ing the Government. For my part, I shall criticize or praise as I consider the occasion warrants, but I hope that my criticism will be helpful. I think that members of all parties in - this House were pleased to hear the statement that the Government proposes to give serious consideration to the rectification of conNOES. stitutional disabilities. All of us applauded the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), who revived the subject in a very eloquent speech. However, the subject is not new. It was discussed at a Premiers Conference in 1933, and again in the following year a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers was held to discuss constitutional matters. Many recommendations were made. The other day, honourable » members were treated to an eloquent disPAIRS. course by the Attorney-General (Mr. Menzies) who, some time ago, as a State representative, was equally eloquent on the other side. In any case, it is good to know that the matter will receive consideration, even though it be tardy. Reform is due in regard to such matters as company law, aviation, trade and commerce, the jurisdiction of the High Court, censorship of films, and control of wireless and fisheries. In 1929, a royal commission on the Constitution presented majority and minority reports, and there were many recommendations which might have been considered before now. I suggest that the proper way to deal with this matter is riot to hold a special session of Parliament at which there will be longer and brighter speeches. Rather should we have action instead of words. I . have always thought that a convention should be held of the pre-federal type, attended by the State Attorneys-General, the Federal Attorney-General, and by such veteran constitutional authorities as Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir Robert Garran. In that way we might be able to obtain a report and recommendations in quick time on which to base a referendum. The people are tired of the dodging of responsibility by the various governments; of the State governments saying that a particular matter is a responsibility of the Commonwealth, and of the Commonwealth Government saying that the responsibility belongs to the States. The people are sick of the overlapping of the governmental functions, and of the extra cost involved, when they know that this cost can be reduced to reasonable proportions. A referendum should be held which would, we hope, have the effect of bringing the sovereign powers of the States within due proportions,, and fix the representations of the States at, say, two members for each federal seat. I believe that if a proposal of that kind were put to the people, they would accept it. I hope that there will be no further delay in this regard. I do not lay the blame on this Government in particular. Many governments have hesitated to take action on this matter, which has now assumed greater importance than ever. In regard to defence, however, the Government possesses full power, but, because of its indecision, and its yielding to expedients, it has lost prestige and earned much criticism. A month ago we expected to be involved in war.",84
183,Mr BKEKNAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,I did not.,85
184,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I know that the honourable member thinks that we have none but imaginary foes. That has been an obsession of his for years, but the average Australian citizen believes, just as the citizens of Austria, 'Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia' and China know, that there arc real and potential foes in the world. The development of aviation, and the return to power politics of certain countries that have made greater gains in recent months than they could hope to win by war, have made it obvious that trouble might come our way at any time. Britain and Australia may be involved in a struggle involving life or death to the individual nations and the Empire. A month ago the Government and the people would have gone to any length to avert the danger that threatened. They would have made any sacrifice, but now that the crisis seems to have passed the attitude of the Government appears to be that we can wait for another crisis before doing anything. It has become lethargic again. Certainly the Government has taken some action, and it is spending large sums of money. I do not blame the new Minister for Defence - (Mr Street) for any of the Government's sins of omission or. commission. His work is all before him, and I am sure that he will give a good account of himself. It has yet to be shown, however, that the Government is sincere in its expressed desire to provide adequate defences for Australia. Bave we a full realization of where we stand in this matter? Do we realise our responsibilities, holding as we do a country of 3,000,000 square miles with a population of barely 7,000,000 people? Do we believe that we could maintain the White Australia policy if it were challenged? Do we believe that we shall be able to retain and improve our living standards, merely because all reasonable people believe that living standards should be improved? How do we propose to absorb our unemployed, and how do we propose even to hold this country if our manhood"" remains untrained? Australia would be a precious prize to any country that took the risk of trying to seize it. If there were another world war we might have different friends in the line-up of nations. There is a tremendous responsibility on the Government and on the people to provide for the security of the country, and, if we fail, we shall deserve the everlasting condemnation of posterity. The responsibility is ours today, andwe must act. We know that money is being poured out like water. Throiigh the Customs Department alone approximately £44,000,000, or two-thirds of our revenue, is found annually for the maintenance of social services, &c. It is proposed to expend £15,000,000 this year on defence. I would not grudge this, even if it were twice as much, provided it were being expended in such a way as to produce the best results. But what of the Army? We have a paper army of 35,000 men. I call it a paper army because it is known that only 60 per cent, of those on the strength attend camp for training. Those with any experience know that afternoon and evening parades are of infinitely less value than the continuous training which men receive in camp. The Government has embarked on a campaign to raise the militia to a strength of 70,000. We all wish it luck.  ber speak for himself.",85
185,Mr ROSBVEAK,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,No „ doubt a lot of people will fight for their dole tickets.,86
186,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The majority of the trainingmen of this country will fight for homes and their families. We may get volunteers when the bands are playing, but the difficulty will be to hold them and it. to get them into camp. That is the point that I make. If only 60 per cent, of the 35,000 troops now attend camp, seems probable that only 60 per cent., 42,000, of the 70,000 troops, i can be obtained, will attend the camp. Does any one claim that that would an adequate army for the defence of Australia's huge area and enormous coastline? The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr 'Chamberlain, a man of believe peace, saidWc must maintain the strength of our forces particular at a level commensurate wit h our responturned sibilities, and be prepared to take our part in training. our country's protection. "" At a level commensurate with our rement. sponsibilities ! "" Well, Great Britain, with its immense population and small territory, may be able to continue its present system, but in Australia, its immense territory and sparse populaof tion, it is folly to expect to continue the system of voluntary enlistment and at same time have an adequate defence force. I know that some honourable memrestoration bers believe that what I advocate savours carried. of conscription, of some form of repugnant militarism, but it is nothing of sort. Anybody who has been associated to that organization. with universal training, either in the ranks or as the holder of a commission, knows that it is a most democratic system. It is based, not on the German, Russian or French systems, but on the Swiss model. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) asked why the rich did not do something for defence. In universal service, the rich and poor alike give service.",86
187,Mr WARD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The rich buy themselves out.,86

196,The CHAIRMAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Order ! If the honourable member for Ballarat interjects again in defiance of the Chair I shall name him.,87
197,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I wish to emphasize the practical and logical reasons for national service. First, universal training provides reserves. Enlistment of a small volunteer force and training it for years is not so effective as a system which, year by year, brings in new recruits for .training and passes into the reserve the persons already trained. By the latter method the whole of the man power receives some approximation of training in the army. Training, moreover, is not only of benefit in teaching every man to play his part in defence; it also gives a physical and moral uplift to the trainees. Some honourable members may contest that, but I speak with personal knowledge when I say that in many instances the drill halls become for poor boys a club where they can rub shoulders with boys of better circumstances whom ordinarily they would not meet. By making those contacts many of them have been able to open up for themselves careers and to gain education in citizenship, which otherwise they would not have had. I say earnestly that universal service is education in citizenship. hope, therefore, that the Government will be able to achieve its objective, but I believe that there should be a limit of say, six months, to the time allotted for the enlistment of the additional recruits. I wrote in 1936 to the Minister, and I said in Parliament at the time of the abolition of universal servJ™ . that there [70] was no possibility of obtaining the required numbers, and I repeat that now. If the campaign fails after six months, the Government, reinforced by public opinion- I believe that the trend of opinion is that way-shoul d introduce a system of national service. A national register should also be drawn up, on which even the elderly people could be allocated to the part they would be expected to play in the defence of the country, as thousands of men and women are eager to do. As for the rest, I do not suggest a reversion to the old compulsory training system, but I do urge that those who do not join up of their own accord should be drafted into camps for a period of training to be decided upon by experts. Half a dozen alternative courses can be adopted to get the necessary numbers into camps.  >are paid by their employers.",87
198,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I shall go as far as the honourable member in that regard. Many young men fear to inform their employers that they have been called to camp, because they think that their absence might imperil their employment. Some employers pay to their employees who go to camp the difference between their military pay and their regular salaries or wages. But under universal training employers generally recognize their obligations. Men are called to camp at different times so that the general efficiency will not be impaired. Rich and poor alike feel they are doing something towards their country's safety. The Government should give consideration to what I have suggested, and I recommend that there should be no hesitation, after the expiry of six months, if the expectations of enlistments have not been realized, to take definite action.",87
199,Mr WARD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,How does the honourable gentleman view a capital levy for I defence works ?,87
200,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I should not suggest a capital levy, but a super tax on companies which make enormous profits. I shall support any legislation of an equitable nature for a super tax on excessive profits. But a direct levy on capital might injure many deserving people who would not be able to afford the sacrifice. In view of the increased striking and mobility of mechanized forces, I believe that a small standing army should also be created. The conception of a standing army in Australia is not today so repugnant as it was for many years.",87
201,Mr JAMES,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,How many soldiers would the honourable member suggest should form a standing army?,88
202,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I . should say that a mixed brigade of four battalions, with the necessary artillery and auxiliaries, to be divided between two or three of the capital cities, would be necessary.",88
203,Mr JAMES,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Tak e 200,000 men. That would solve the unemployment problem.",88
204,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"As a matter of fact, the honourable member for East Sydney stated that some unemployed men entered the militia for the sake of the pay that they receive, and the creation of a standing army would do something to reduce further the number of unemployed. Moreover, training in the army would fit many men for employment in other walks of life at the expiry of their term of military service. The standing army would be purely a voluntary body, but it would be a mobile force to take the first shock of landings on the coast. The citizen forces, ibecause they would be scattered about the Commonwealth, would be less mobile. Briefly my proposal for military defence is that superimposed on the voluntary militia force, and those called into camp for special training there should be a small standing army. Those who advocate non-co-operation by Australia"" in the defence of the Empire advocate a policy of national suicide, because Britain is not looking to us for assistance, whereas we may require the utmost assistance of Britain. non-co-operation were reciprocal we should look very foolish in the event of an attack upon us. We might occupy a position similar to that of Abyssinia and China, whose cries for help were as those of people crying in the wilderness. Australia is fortunate that it is part of a great and powerful empire. Imperial unity is merely collective security. In that regard, problem of capital ships should be settled. There are different schools of thought on the subject of naval defence. Some people suggest that cruisers. are power sufficient for Australia's needs. As one of the three Ministers who were abroad recently, I had the opportunity to discuss defence matters with service chiefs in Great Britain. As the result of those discussions, I was convinced that high naval authorities there believe that Australia should be more self-reliant in the matter of defence, particularly on the naval side. In 1914, our possession of a capital ship was sufficient to keep enemy vessels from our shores. The problem of whether we should have a capital ship in Australian waters or rely on one situated at Singapore should be settled now. If the potential enemy, which is so often referred to but never named, did contemplate a descent upon our coast, and we had in Australian waters a battleship, it would have to send here two battleships, or 25 per cent, of its capital ships to have any chance of success at sea The Air Force provides the most mobile and most economic striking power possible, because aeroplanes are cheap relative to the power they wield, and the damage that they can do. I believe that the Government should be more generous' in the matter of instruction in flying, and I suggest to the new Minister for Defence (Mr Street) that there should be closer co-operation between the Royal Australian Air Force and civil aviation. Under the Civil Ai r Guards scheme in Great Britain it costs only 2s. 6d. an hour for young men to learn to fly, and it is high time that the Commonwealth Government gave consideration to cheapening the costs of learning to fly in Australia. There are in Australia thousands of young men of an excelIf lent type, who cannot afford the money to learn to fly. They cannot even afford to join assisted aero clubs. The Government, therefore, should be more generous in assisting aero clubs and the like, including gliding clubs, which exist on the miserable pittance of some £300 a year from the Commonwealth Government. I have heard the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Scholfield) on several occathe sions ask that assistance be given to the gliding club in the western district of Victoria. Gliding is an adjunct to aviation, and is very useful training. When I was in Germany recently, I learned that air force pilots must have experience in the flying of gliders. It is considered that glider pilots make better power pilots. Anything that is calculated to assist young men to learn to fly aircraft should be taken into consideration by the Government as part of its defence programme. I commend to the Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr Thorby) the need to improve Australian airports. I found on my flights in Europe that the airports in the smallest towns are better equipped than those which we have in our capital cities. I consider that the airports at Mascot and Essendon are unfitted to be the airports for cities which have more than 1,000,000 inhabitants. Airports at intermediate centres, as the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Fairbairn and other honourable gentlemen who use air transport know, do not need the same facilities and amenities as are provided at the maior airports. I found in Holland and Germany that the airports were cleared of all obstructions, had great concrete runways, and were equipped with every wireless aid to flying. At Essendon there is a reservoir in the middle of the aerodrome! It is time that the proposal to establish an aerodrome at Fisherman's Bend, which has been the subject of dispute between the Governments of the Commonwealth and Victoria for some years, was proceeded with. Vision is needed in aviation matters. Developments in air transport have proceeded more rapidly than in any other kind of .transport. Before long the air services of Australia will be flying at night. Every night honourable members may see the beacon revolving on Mount Ainslie, but at present there are no aircraft tp be guided by it. Shortly, however, the beacon will be of practical use to night flyers. The greatest risk of accident is at night, and the dangers at Essendon with its reservoir may increase. The Government, therefore, should seriously consider setting aside a large sum of money to provide adequate airports equipped with every facility for safe flying in the cipal cities and towns of Australia. I wish now to refer to the Council of Defence, that mysterious body of which Parliament never hears, and which Cabinet seldom sees.",88
205,Mr ROSEVEAR,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Is it connected with the "" inner group "" ?",89
206,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The Council of Defence contains a number of distinguished citizens who, however, are not responsible to the people. From time to time the council may see the Minister for Defence, the Treasurer, the Prime Minister or the Minister for External Affairs, and discuss matters appertaining to the forces. Reports are occasionally made to Cabinet, but there is no liaison between the council and the Cabinet. In my opinion, the council should frequently meet Cabinet so that questions may be asked and answered. Just before I went to England with the recent delegation Ministers discussed a number of matteTs with the Council of Defence, but that was my only experience, and that on request, during nearly six years as a Minister. From time to time we hear reports of what the council or the Military Board thinks regarding certain matters. It has been said publicly that the Military Board and certain other prominent defence officers believe in universal military service. As long as the Government baulks this question and adopts expedients the people will not have faith in it. There is a growing belief that Australia should be placed on a proper defence footing and its manpower trained. Within two days' flight of Australia a nation of 400,000,000 inhabitants is being beaten to its knees by another nation with only one-fifth of its man-power. China has man-power, but not trained. The man-power of Australia needs training. We obtained this country easily, and despite the unemployment that exists, it is a paradise in comparison with most other countries.",89
207,Mr JAMES,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Me n with empty bellies cannot be trained.,89
208,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The honourable member should travel through continental countries to see hunger and starvation. Such conditions cannot be seen in Australia. Some honourable members believe prin- that the recent pact signed at Munich opens up a new era of peace for the world. ,89
209,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I repeat, "" Why not?"" Wo all hope that the nations will learn to settle their differences amicably, as differences in the civil and industrial field are settled. As a result of the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations was established. After the framework was constructed the league received some severe blows from various nations which either defied it or left it. The principal nation which sponsored the league did not join it. To-day, it is a broken reed and the totalitarian governments seem to be having a good deal of their own way. The time will come, however, when the nations will return to reason. In the meantime, we must look to our defences; we must be realists, and recognize that in the present state of the world we must have properly balanced naval, military and air forces for the defence of this country. Unless we attend to these things we shall be recreant to our trust, and unworthy of our heritage. Industry is closely related to defence; the uloser the collaboration between them, and the more we build up our economic strength; the better will it be for our nation. We must be more nationally self-reliant. There has been some small criticism of the tariff. For instance, the honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Nock) criticizes the duties on galvanized iron. I point out that the last six years have witnessed the greatest expansion of secondary industries"" in the history of the Commonwealth. In that period the number of factories has increased by 4,611, showing progress in every State, and indicating definitely that there is confidence on the part of investors and employers. The value of production has increased in that period from £110,000,000 to £188,000,000, whilst wages have increased from £56,000,000 to £96,000,000, thereby increasing the spending power of the Australian people, and undoubtedly benefiting the community. Perhaps the most gratifying feature of this development is that the number of employees in factories has grown from 336,000 to 545,000the highest level in the industrial history of the Commonwealth. It could be higher, because our industrialization is still only about one-third of that of the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, there are still many unemployed to be absorbed. I believe-and opinion is reinforced by my recent investigations in England in shipyards, workMr White. shops and factories-that Australia is at the beginning of a new phase of industrial development. That development must not be checked. On the contrary, it should be encouraged, because our national existence depends largely on our self-reliance. Australia must be economically strong as well as militarily strong.  to sound.",89
210,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The two matters are related; if we neglect one of them, we may lose both. Honourable members should not be one-sided in their outlook. Defence and industry must go hand-inhand. In this new era of manufacture I visualize development into broader fields, such as the' manufacture of motor cars. On this subject the public has had some doubt as to the sincerity of the Government. I earnestly believe that there is scarcely anything that Australia cannot do in the way of manufacture. Certainly, the manufacture of motor cars could begin tomorrow if we were really in earnest. In this connection I draw attention to a report in the Australasian Manufacturer as to the uncertainty that exists in the minds of manufacturers regarding the intention of the Government. I hope that the position will be clarified at an early date.  party that stands in the way.",90
211,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"We shall see. The Australasian Manufacturer contained the following:In tabling the board's report in the House of Representatives during the past week, the Minister for Customs, Mr White, said""The Government adheres to the policy of encouraging the establishment of an industry for the manufacture of engines and chassis in Australia. The Government invites prospective manufacturers of engines and chassis, or parts thereof to submit their proposals, with details of the assistance required, not later than 31st March, 1939. Consideration will he given to any proposal for complete manufacture."" That is the right spirit, and seems to indicate that the Government will not bo swerved from its purpose by the vague and inept report of the Tariff Board. This bold and courageous statement by Mr WHITE - who , no doubt, when he was recently abroad, inquired into the subject-appear s to suggest that he has returned my to the Commonwealth more convinced than ever of the wisdom of Australia's determination to make her own motor cars in her own motor factories. Hero it may be said that, following Mr. White's statement, it was very disconcerting io find the Federal Treasurer, Mr Casey, stating-in reply to a question in the Federal Parliament-that the Government was considering the removal of the special duty of .7d. per lb. on motor chassis. Here, in other words, is a direct threat to take away the only sure means by which the motor car industry could be established in this country. We have here, in fact, the farcical position of the Tariff Board saying one thing, Mr White Baying another, and Mr Casey yet another. How, in theso circumstances, can manufacturers be expected to accept Mr White's invitation to submit definite proposals? If the Government wants definite proposals, it must itself adhere to a definite policy. if the Government departs from the principles which have led to Australia making considerable progress during recent years, it will be deserving of censure, and I shall vote against it. Before concluding 1 desire to refer to a personal matter. Some honourable members have asked why I did not resign from the Ministry when the ""inner group "" of Cabinet was first announced. I know nothing of its constitution before I was sworn in as Minister for Trade and Customs. When I was told that I was to be a member of the group I said that the principle was wrong; but I thought that as a member of the group I could protect secondary industries. I realise the importance of secondary industries in providing employment for our people and revenue for the Government. Two-thirds of the revenue of the Commonwealth is derived from customs.",90
212,Mr GANDER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Did not the honourable member say that he resigned because the Treasurer (Mr Casey) was placed above him.,91
213,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"No . I would not be so petty as to let such a small thing stand in the way of my duty to the nation. Although I objected to the inner Cabinet being set up at all, I was ""of the opinion that if the fiscal policy was to be discussed by an inner group which I was a member, I could look sarily after that important phase of the but, national economy. But when, later, the Prime Minister told me that the Minister for Trade and Customs was not to be member of the inner group, I was not content to pretend that I was in charge of the department, when the policy be determined by Ministers, some of whom are opposed to principles which I believe to be fundamental. I would not agree to become merely a rubber stamp while having to accept responsibility for v/hat others aecided. I make this explanation at the request of a number of my friends. I believe that this budget debate can do much good. Every government has to run the gauntlet of criticism and can profit by it. I exhort the Government to evolve a sound defence policy; to return to the motives that actuated it in the past; to deal with the constitutional changes that are necessary; to develop the Northern Territory, as the very live Minister for the Interior (Mr. MCEwen) wants to do; to give the aboriginal a better deal than he has had in the past by establishing a Native Affairs Branch of the department; to develop and defend the territories which are our outposts; to attend to the many progressive measures necessary to our natural advancement; and not to be unduly anxious to reach recess. It should also stimulate the development of the Commonwealth and attract to our shores desirable migrants, thus providing that increase of man-power which we so much desire.",91
214,Mr ANTHONY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Richmond) [2.45 a.m.] - At this early hour of the morning, it is a pleasure and an inspiration to address such an attentive, awakened, intelligent, and, shall I say, distinguished audience. The budget papers cannot arouse a great deal of enthusiasm in the minds of members of the committee, not because of any fault of the Government or of the Treasurer (Mr Casey), but because of the conditions under which the budget has .been framed. The actions of the Government and of ""the Treasurer are regulated not by their own desires, but by overseas influences and international events which make it obligatory of upon them to expend money not necesto benefit the community directly, nevertheless, for the security of the community. The problems that confront the nation are not the creation of a day, a but have been developing gradually over a period, and particularly during the last year or two, when the international situawould tion has changed from comparative quietude to a condition in - which it has been demonstrated that if we are to preserve our security we must do as other nations are doing. I was a member of a party which visited the Small-Arms Factory at Lithgow this week, and an incident related to me by the foreman left an impression upon my mind that is worth relating. ""We were inspecting a very expensive instrument used in the manufacture of machine guns, and the foreman told me that it cost £5,000. It was manu- has ceased to extend. factured in Switzerland, and factory officials looked* upon it with great pride as it is the only one of its kind in the Commonwealth. When the crate in which it was packed was opened, there was a note stating that 60 of these instruments had been purchased by Japan at the same time.. This incident shows that other nations are at least as advanced as Ave are in matters of this kind. During the debate several subjects have been raised by honourable members, including defence, unemployment, banking, population, military training, and alterations of the Constitution. Many other matters have been discussed, but those I have mentioned been the most important and are more or less co-related. I shall endeavour to show that there is close relationship between the defence and finance policies of the Commonwealth. Government is rightly, and with the approbation of the majority of the members of this Parliament and of the people of the Commonwealth, expending a large sum of money to provide guns, aeroplanes, uniforms, rifles, and ammunition, to improve our naval equipment and aerodromes, and also to meet many other requirements of effective defence. The essential of defence over a long period of years is man-power. We may build aeroplanes and manufacture guns and rifles, but the problem of defence is not one of today alone, but of 10, 15 or even 50 years hence, and if we take a long range view, we must concentrate our attention not only upon the defence needs of today but also upon the means of defending this country many years hence. Taking a long-range view, we cannot look forward to the future without some alarm. Mr Anthony. Population and birth rate are matters not so much of numbers as of the relative distribution of these numbers. Each year we have more older people in the community and fewer younger persons to meet our defence requirements. We have to examine the demographic figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician to realise that we have arrived at a stage of our development when population Dr Enid Charles, an economist, in her book entitled The Changed Structure of the Family, states that fertility in Australia has been falling since 1912, and that the population has not been reproducing itself since 1931. It is unnecessary to refer to statistics to obtain that information; it is confirmed nevertheless, by the figures supplied by the economists and statisticians. It appears quite evident, without elaborating the point, that there is little that can be done by this Government to encourage and improve the natural increase. We may as Italy did, resort to such expedients as taxing bachelors, giving preference of employhave ment in the Public Service to married men, exempting families from taxes, and so on. In Italy, Germany, and other countries where attempts have been made to remedy the The position by such means, success has - not been achieved. It would appear that we have to accept the situation as have other countries when there is a definite 1 decline which cannot be arrested by natural increase. The only alternative, therefore, is migration. If we study the migration figures for many years, we find that the economic conditions in this country are reflected in the migration statistics. I have the figures from 1860, which are rather illuminating in that they show that during periods of depression there has been a falling off of migration. For instance, in 1892 and 1893,-during the bank crashes after the land boom, there was a decided decline of migration to Australia. In 1891, 26,000 migrants came to Australia, whereas in 1892 the excess of departures over arrivals .was 3,122. In 1893, the departures exceeded the arrivals by 7,300; but for eight years after the flow of migration, was into Australia. In 1902 and 1903, during the big drought, the flow was from Australia. In 1928 and for a year or two prior to the depression, there was some improvement. In 1928 the excess of arrivals was 30,000 and in 1929, 11,000. In 1930 and 1931, the excesses of departures over arrivals were 8,000 and 10,000 respectively, but within the last two or three years the flow again came this way. If we are to accept people from other parts of the world, which many consider imperative both for purposes of defence and social and economic security, migration and oconomic prosperity must be regarded as co-related. In that connection I come now to the question of finance and banking practice. I believe that the attitude adopted by the State Premiers at the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers is more in accord with the policy which should 'be adopted by the Commonwealth Government. One has only to study the unemployment figures in New South Wales, the only State that publishes detailed particulars, to find that the Commonwealth Government, through the instrumentality of the Commonwealth Bank, must exert some greater influence in order to provide the necessary finance to take up the slack of unemployment which has occurred owing to a fall of the prices of our export commodities. In New South Wales, unemployment increased from 4.9 per cent, in June to 5.8 per cent. in August. The increase was not very large, but it was an indication of the trend of affairs. Much has been said in this debate concerning Australia's contribution to the new Anglo-American trade agreement. It bas been suggested that that agreement might operate in many respects to the detriment of this country. I believe, ever, that the greatest security for Australia, from both economic and defence standpoints, lies in co-operation between the English-speaking peoples. Groundless alarm is often expressed in respect of the loan responsibilities of Commonwealth and the States. It is often imagined that, as the debt per capita increases, our difficulties increase accordingly, but a good deal depends upon the manner in which the loan funds have been expended. The budget papers reveal that of £121,000,000 of Commonwealth indebtedness, £95,000,000 is represented .by solid assets. Eor example, £7,000,000 has been invested in war service homes,_£333,000 in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, and £7,000,000 in Canberra. All of that expenditure, like that on the construction of the Grafton to Brisbane railway, is interest-earning and is not, therefore, a liability. In regard to such expenditure, this Government has no more reason to feel alarmed than has a person who incurs a debt in purchasing a home. As to the possibility of unemployment increasing- I do not care to use the terms ""depression"" and "" recession"", because they seriously disturb the public mind- I do not . believe that we are likely to experience difficulties similar to those which confronted this country from 1929 to 1931, because, should such a crisis return, our economists and financial experts, as the result of the experience gained in the last depression, will be better fitted to deal with it. TheTmproved position in relation to our London funds will also help us to avoid sucli a possibility. Provided that the major portion of the expenditure is incurred in the production of assets which will be interest-earning the Government will be justified in undertaking projects with the object of absorbing the slack of employment. Such a policy is not only commendable but also absolutely necessary for our economio and social welfare. The Government has decided to give the system of voluntary military training a further trial, and has already launched a campaign with the object of raising the present strength of our militia to 70,000. Whilst I admit that much can be said in support of the voluntary system, I how- am one of those who believe that some form of compulsory service would be more equitable, because it requires everyone, able to do so, to bear a fair share of responsibility in the defence of this country. Nevertheless, the Govern the ment's scheme should receive the support of honourable members generally, particularly of those who do not favour the compulsory system. If we are to have adequate defence, we must get the required number by either one system or the other. We cannot afford to leave ourselves naked to attack, as we should have found ourselves on the 30th September last had the international crisis then existing resulted in the outbreak of hostilities. Those who do not believe in compulsory military training should do their utmost to ensure the success of the voluntary system. No doubt, as a rule, the voluntary trainee is more satisfactory than one compulsorily enlisted. However, we must look some years ahead, and should obviate the possibility of two or three years hence, of representatives of the Government having to go round the country again beating the drums and parading the streets in order to enlist more recruits. At this late hour I do not propose to detain honourable members any longer. I shall conclude by expressing the hope that the Treasurer (Mr. Casey), despite the difficult tasks with which he will be confronted during the forthcoming year, will, nevertheless, be able to carry on without finding it necessary to impose additional taxes. [Quorum formed.]",91
215,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Flinders) [3.9 a.m.] - Jus t in case any one looking around this chamber during the last half hour might fail to realise the fact, I point out .that honourable members are now dealing with the most important debate of the year. The consideration of the budget, on this occasion, is more important than usual, because of the present unsettled international situation which, members of all parties agree, renders it necessary for Australia to put its defences in order as quickly as possible. Although during recent weeks we have often been called to Canberra to sit from 3 p.m. until about 9.30 p.m., when the House has been considering unimportant measures, the business of Parliament has been so arranged that this, the most important debate of the year, involving proposals which might, perhaps, mean life or death to Australia, is being held at 4 a.m., and will be probably continued until 7 a.m. with honourable members generally somnolent. I do not blame honourable members individually, because I do not think the average human being can go on listening to speeches hour after hour right on through the night. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament it has appeared to me that the business of Parliament has been arranged in an entirely unbusinesslike and haphazard manner. For many weeks past we have assembled - here for three days a week sitting from 3. p.m. up to 9.30 p.m. and it would seem that the main idea* has been to give the impression that Parliament sits so many days in the year. When minor bills are listed for consideration we sit for about four or five hours daily, yet the most important debate of the year must be carried on all through the night, ending eventually through the sheer exhaustion of honourable members. I wonder whether the councillors of countries which we have reason to fear discuss their war preparations in a similar atmosphere of lethargy, or hilarity. I suggest that they do not. Furthermore, if every other democratic country is handling its war preparations as, it would appear, from the circumstances in which this debate is taking place, we do, the death knell of democracy has been rung. I do not criticize honourable members individually. As I said before, I do not think it is humanly possible to remain alert hour after hour right through the night when the business of the Committee is conducted in this fashion. I suggest that Parliament should work the normal hours, say from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. The objection is that that would prevent Ministers from attending to their administrative work. I have seldom seen more than one Minister at a time in this chamber during important debates, but tonight, owing to the need to keep a quorum, we have the unusual spectacle of several Ministers in the chamber. Dealing with this budget, in which defence preparation is predominant, I offer my heartiest congratulations to the newly appointed Minister for Defence (Mr Street). I extend to him my very best wishes in the tremendous responsibility which he is undertaking. I have no doubt he comes to this task with the advantage of greater experience in military affairs than any of his predecessors, with the exception of Sir William Glasgow. The Minister for Defence went through the syllabus laid down for compulsory military training before the war, and during his distinguished war' service was called upon to carry out most responsible duties. Since then, like many others, he has set himself, at great selfsacrifice, the task of trying to make our militia into something adequate. great and unfair load that his predecessor was asked to carry, has been slightly reduced; nevertheless, I am still inclined to think that it is too great for any single individual to be expected to shoulder. We can, however, hope that, fortified by his extensive experience in defence matters, the load will rest more lightly on his shoulders than it would on those of another individual. My only regret about the appointment of the honourable gentleman as Minister for Defence-and his appointment is something for which I have hoped for many years-is that he is given what I consider the impossible task of making our militia into thing adequate for the of Australia. Of that I shall say more later. I suggest to the honourable gentleman that, as soon as possible-w e realise that ho cannot do it immediately-h e should rectify what has been a serious omission from our defence efforts during the last couple of years, and that is, the failure of Government to take the people of Australia into its confidence by telling them in what way an enemy, should we be at war, would seek to attack us, and in what way our defences are designed to meet the predicaments in which we might find ourselves in time of war. I feel that, if the people of Australia be told what are our dangers and how the efforts of the Government are designed to meet them, they will approve of a great deal of what is being done, but they will demand that the steps we are taking shall be complete and adequate. I take it that the Government only visualizes danger Australia arising from raids. The Government's theory is based on the fact that so long as Singapore is in being, and so long as Great Britain can spare a few capital ships to be based on Singapore, invasion of Australia is impossible. I agree that, granted Singapore is in being and British capital ships are stationed there, the theory of raids is a sound one; but first we must prepare for these raids and, secondly, we must see that our basis for considering raids our only problem is not swept away. The The limiting of our danger from raids depends on Singapore. Therefore, we have to ask ourselves carefully whether Great Britain could, in the event of a European war, send capital ships to Singapore and the necessary troops to reinforce the garrison there: I thinkand I have it on reliable authority - tba t it is supposed that if the TJnited Kingdom were at war in Europe, even against a very strong combination, its naval strength is at present so great that three or four battleships could be spared for (Singapore. Granted that that is so, actual invasion of Australia might well be discounted, and raids might be our only problem; but seeing what some- can be done by invading and landing defence troops, can we convince ourselves that the United Kingdom, in time of war in Europe, would be able to reinforce the garrison at Singapore so strongly that a great Asiatic power might not be able to capture or bottle it up? That is uncertain. Therefore, I feel that one of the great preparations we must make is to the be prepared to reinforce the garrison at Singapore ourselves. That would be a contribution towards the defence of the Empire that Australia could well make. Though it would be primarily looking to its own interests, nevertheless it would be a contribution of great help to the rest of the Empire. But in modern wars, as in wars of all times, fortifications thought to be impregnable do not always prove to be so. We have to visualize the possibility of Singapore falling, and of the United Kingdom being engaged in a fight for its very existence in Europe, with the result that Australia would be thrown to back on its own resources. The Minister for Defence said the other day that he could not visualize a position in which the United Kingdom could not come to our aid. I think that had the question been pressed, he would have admitted that those words did not express his considered opinion. Possibly he meant that he could not visualize the time when the United Kingdom might not be willing to come to our aid, even if able to dp so. I certainly can visualize the possibility of Singapore falling, as I can also visualize the possibility of the TJnited Kingdom not being able, for a considerable time, to come to our assistance. Eirst, we must provide for our defence against raids; secondly, we must try to see what we can do to be ready to help in the defence of Singapore if necessary; thirdly, we must, in the last resort, be capable of defending ourselves, when control of the sea is temporarily lost, on the shores of Australia itself. That is something which I certainly do not want to see. I have seen war in other countries and I do not want to see a war fought on the shores of Australia. Therefore, we should make every effort, in co-operation with the rest of the Empire, to make it impossible for a war to come to our shores, even if one should break out in the Pacific. First, let us examine the Government's proposal, in the light the possibility of raids. The average man in the street who does not pretend to be a defence authority, but who is very much concerned about the need for defence says ""What is the use of the five cruisers that we will shortly have in commission, when a potential enemy, the warlike and aggressive nation of Japan, has eight or nine capital ships and many cruisers ?"" Accepting the raid theory, and assuming Singapore in being, the answer is that no power would risk battleships so far away from their base with opposing battleships based across their lines of communication at Singapore. That, I think, with Singapore in being, is a sound premise. What .we would have to provide against is the necessity for convoying our overseas trade, and of protecting our coastal shipping; because, as many people do not know, eighteen times more of our interstate trade is carried by coastal shipping than is carried by railways. Therefore, if coastal shipping should 'be paralysed, the industrial life and the whole economy of Australia would also be paralysed. To protect our overseas trade and coastal shipping against raids our five cruisers would be invaluable. Without cruisers there would be no way by which we could protect shipping. Therefore I believe Mr Fairbairn. that the money which the Government is expending in this direction is being well expended. As far as the naval side is concerned, the only point in respect of which I see particular inadequacy is that, although a battle squadron might not be sent to our waters with Singapore in being, nevertheless a potential enemy might well send to these waters a couple of ships of such calibre that our cruisers would be, if not bottled up, almost completely immobilized. Of course, it might be possible for our cruisers to scatter and operate from different parts of the coastline, but their value would be reduced tremendously if ships of greater tonnage arrived in these waters. Therefore, I feel that the ideal at which we should aim, if we can possibly afford it, is the provision of two capital ships. I say two capital ships, for the simple reason that we could have two for only about 50 per cent, more than we would have to pay for one, of because we would be forced to expend money not only in the purchase of the capital ship itself, but also for the purchase of ships necessary to protect it, and docks necessary to accommodate it. The provision of the money necessary for the purchase of two capital ships may be well beyond our capabilities, but what is not beyond our capacity is the provision of docking facilities for a capital ship, so that if British capital ships from Singapore, or possibly American ships, were sent to these waters we could accommodate them. It is possible for us to have an adequate air force more easily than any other force, because the duties of the Royal Australian Air Force in time of war would not be so great as many people seem to visualize. Some people think that because Royal Air Force bombers have recently flown from Egypt to Darwin in little more than a day, Australia could be bombed, say, from a base situated in Japan. That idea is nonsense. Even Brisbane could not be effectively bombed by an enemy operating from a base in New Guinaa. The distance at which bombing raids could be effectively carried out is very greatly exaggerated. People talk of bombing raids carried out 400 miles inside enemy country. I suggest that aviation has a considerable way to KO before bombing raids can be successfully carried out at anything like that distance. Our Royal Australian Air Force has primarily to be designed for cooperation with our fleet in spotting raiding cruisers along our coast and to give full co-operation to our military forces in the event of a raid on our coast by an armed force. As independent unit, its major duty would be to intercept such aircraft as could be despatched from enemy raiding cruisers which, after all, could only be small in number and in striking power. It should be quite easy for us to provide adequate air defences to meet that contingency. Many people'believe that Australia must have an air force which could meet in a pitched battle one of the great air forces of the world. That is not so, because no great air force could reach these shores until Australia had been practically defeated. The despatch to Australian waters of aircraft carriers is a possibility but not a probability, because one of the most vulnerable vessels afloat is the aircraft carrier. To launch an attack on a strategical objective in Australia, an aircraft carrier would have to come within about 200 miles of its objective, and, at that distance, the Royal Australian Air Force, even in its present state, which is far from what is aimed at by the Government, would be able to destroy the aircraft carrier. Therefore our air force should aim at having adequate squadrons to co-operate with the navy and back up our military forces. It should be able to protect our capital cities and other strategical points against attack by sporadic aircraft sent here from raiding cruisers or armed merchantmen. is impossible, however, for me to say whether I think that our present air force is approaching adequacy for this purpose, because seldom a month goes by without the public hearing some entirely different story from that already published as to what will be the number of our aircraft, or as to what strength it is possible for us to build. A few months ago we were informed that our air force was being increased to the maximum to which it was possible to increase it within the couple of years of the supplementary programme, but within about three months there was a big public outcry against the condition of the air force. We were told that the air force was to be expanded by several squadrons more than what we had been told was possible. Therefore, it is almost impossible for an individual like myself, who an is in the same position as the great majority of the citizens of Australia who are not taken into the confidence of our defence leaders, and have no opportunity of knowing what is happening in regard to air defence preparations, to form an opinion. I should like to make a very strong protest, however, against the extraordinary conduct of the Government, fo? which the present Minister for Defence (Mr Street) cannot be blamed, with regard to the report of Sir Edward Ellington, of whose invitation to visit Australia. I entirely approve. In these matters we cannot have too good advice. To me it was staggering to learn that our own Air Board was not aware v of the invitation issued to Sir Edward Ellington until we read of it in the newspapers. This was disgracefully unfair to the Air Board, as it gave the suggestion that Sir Edward Ellington had been brought out to Australia as a sort of plain-clothes man to see whether the members of the board had been good boys. The duty set him by the Government rather seemed to bear that out. I felt that the greatest benefit resulting from his visit would not lie in any report which he might present, but in the fact that every member of the air force would have opportunities to discuss at length with him their particular departmental problems. I imagined that all the senior It oflicers of the force would have an opportunity to discuss their work with him, and to ask whether they were going on right lines, with a view to seeing whether he could make suggestions to them in the light of experience in the United Kingdom. But I have reason to suspect that Sir Edward Ellington had no conference with the Royal Australian Air Force when he was out here, and never discussed its problems with any senior member of the force. Apparently he was put into a room with this instruction; ""There is the evidence, and upon that evidence you are to report to the Prime Minister "". He was apparently given no opportunity to be helpful in any way except by reporting to the Prime Minister, and one realizes how well fitted the Prime Minister and the ex-Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) are to take action on a report from a great air expert! Almost as soon as Sir Edward Ellington had left these shores, a report was handed out to the public, and, on the strength of it, the press came out with very severe criticisms of the Chief of our Air Staff and our Air Board. It is impossible for me to say whether any pf this criticism was justified, because, interested as I am in air force matters, ho Minister for Defence has given me an opportunity to discuss them. What seems monstrously unfair is that this report, containing certain criticisms of the air force, was made public without any opportunity being given the Air Board to defend itself publicly. That happened more than two months ago, yet our Air Board has not been allowed to give to the public any comment on that adverse report. It is quite possible that a report by Sir Edward Ellington might not need to be treated confidentially, but that a report critical of the Royal Australian Air Force should be made available to the public, and that neither the Minister nor the Air Board should be given an opportunity to reply to the criticism, is unfair to the board and the public. In my opinion, this is one of the most staggering of the many signs of ineptitude in regard to national leadership in Australia at the present time. Moreover, I have reason to suspect that some inner report must have been given to the press over and above that given for publication, because I have read Sir Edward Ellington's published report over and over again, and I cannot see in it anything on which to base the criticism made by several newspapers of the Chief of our Air Staff. If by any chance, the xVustralian metropolitan press was given further information behind the backs of the Australian public, it is quite a deplorable thing. Possibly some further information was not given. Perhaps the press drew on its imagination, and suggested that this further criticism was made; but the published report of Sir Sfr. FaArbavrn. Edward Ellington did contain criticism to which the Air Board should have been given the right to reply. I think that the Minister himself should have taken it upon himself to give an explanation to the public. There was one criticism by Sir Edward Ellington which, with all due respect for his great reputation, was damnably unfair. I refer to his statement that Australian Air Force accidents over a couple of years had exceeded, in proportion to the time flown, the accidents in the Royal Air Force. That was true, but why was the Australian Air Board not given an opportunity to make known to the public that for the last six years those were the only two years in which Australia's record was not a very great deal better in the matter of accidents than that of the Royal Air Force? In fairness to the Australian Air Board, the personnel of our air force, and the parents of the members of the air force, who may be under the impression that service in it is more dangerous than in any other air forces, which is untrue, why was that fact not made known to the public? The number of accidents in proportion to the distance flown is supposed to be secretthat is the custom in all air forces-bu t although I have not been taken into the confidence of any Minister or of the Government, I have taken sufficient interest in .the matter to put two and two together, and I challenge the Minister to deny my computation that only in two of the last six years has the Royal Air Force been better in the matter of safety than the Royal Australian Air Force. I challenge him to prove that the Royal Australian Air Force over the last six years has not had a much better record in that regard than the Royal Air Force. If the Minister was not prepared to do that in fairness to the board, the board itself should have been allowed to publish a reply to the Ellington report. The report further stated that the flying discipline in the Royal Australian Air Force leaves much to be desired. Discipline is a matter which we have to watch very closely in our services. .Unfortunately, the press declared that the Australian army was noted, not for its discipline, but for its lack of it. In the first place that is a libel on members of the Australian Imperial Force whose discipline generally was equal to that of any troops in the line in the Great War. On the only occasion when a lack of discipline was displayed, it was due to inexperience, and so much was learnt by the Australian troops on that occasion that their discipline was never faulty again. myth that the Australian soldier is able to fight without discipline tends to make many-young Australians adopt a nonchalant air in carrying out naval and military duties. But what is this flaw in flying discipline reported by Sir Edward Ellington? He suggested that out of twelve accidents, three were attributable to failure in flying discipline. I could only find two which suggest any ground for that criticism. One was a case in which an officer, who was operating with infantry, and trying to give an impression of what an aircraft attack would be like in war and to provide the infantry with an opportunity to train its machine guns on him continued his dive until . he reached a point lower than that to which he was ordered to go, dived into the ground and lost his life. Possibly he was carried, away by excessive zeal, because on numerous occasions he had dived too close to the ground, but, at worse, this was only an instance of excessive zeal. The next case was that of an officer who was taking part in a fly past. Each aeroplane was ordered to execute a roll at a certain point and this officer began his dive prior to the roll too early. If he had rolled at the right height, he would have executed the roll long before he reached the point at which he was ordered to do so. Therefore he continued the dive to the point at which he was ordered to do it ; but by then he was loo low, and crashed into the ground. Therefore, in this case, the accident was actually due to an error of judgment rather than to lack of flying discipline. The pilot had to choose whether to roll at the height at whjph he had been told to do so, or at the point where he had been told to roll. Obviously, every one who wishes to be fair in his judgment in respect of this accident must put it clown to an error of judgment in deciding which of two orders should be obeyed. Both could not be obeyed. To allow the suggestion to go abroad that the accidents were due to lack of discipline is unfair to the parents of the dead oflicers, in that it suggests that their lives could have been saved if proper disciplinary measures had been observed, whereas the fact is that the The accidents might have happened through errors of judgment by pilots who had thousands of flying-hours of experience to their credit. I cannot discuss the position of our air force in detail because of the mystery that surrounds it and the confused information that has been issued in respect of it. It is, in fact, impossible for any one to form a reliable estimate of whether our air force is adequate or not adequate. I simply assert that we can make it adequate more easily than we can make any other arm of the service adequate. In regard to our military forces, 1 cannot express an opinion as optimistic even as that which I have expressed concerning our air force. I realise that a great deal has been done to provide coast defences. The public should be informed of the value of these coast defences. When people are told that so many 9.2-inch guns have been placed at certain points, they naturally ask, ""What is the use of putting in 9.2-in. guns to meet attacks by ships with 12-in. guns?"" I have asked the same question. But I ' have been assured that guns of lower calibre on land are capable of engaging successfully guns of higher calibre at sea. We may therefore assume that our coastal defences are of some use. But I do not think that our militia can be considered to be adequate in any respect, notwithstanding the self-sacrificing efforts of militia oflicers and trainees to become efficient. Even after the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Hughes) has marched through our capital cities to the beating of drums and secured an enrolment of 70,000 men, and the men have been trained to the point of 100 per centefficiency, if that should be possible, the militia will still be inadequate to meet even raids, and it seems that raids are the only kind of assault that the Government can visualize. A militia of 70,000 men could not possibly meet, some situations that may arise, for they would be too scattered for effective service. instance, in perhaps half-a-dozen centres in my electorate groups of' fifteen or twenty young men who deserve every encouragement are trying to train for military service. But they have no drill hall that they can use. The Treasurer told us recently that money for defence purposes would be found as quickly and in as large amounts as may be necessary. Yet when I have asked for funds to be made available to erect drill halls in my electorate so that the trainees may be efficiently organised, I have been told that the provision of money for that purpose is quite low in the list of priority. Seeing that we have many unemployed persons in the country and that drill halls are urgently needed, I can see no reason why works of this description should not be put in hand. One of the fundamental reasons why the militia, as at present visualized, must be inefficient is that men have to bo trained in such small groups. Under a system of universal military training this would not be the case, for larger units would be available in every locality. I shall not go into greater detail on this subject at the moment, except Jo say that we must effect a tremendous improvement of the conditions of militia training before we can even hope for efficiency. Money must be found to provide training facilities. I fear that it will never be possible for a force of 70,000 militia men, even trained to 100 per cent, efficiency, to resist raids effectively. Obviously an enemy about to raid Australia would aim at Newcastle. If the Newcastle steel works were destroyed Australia would be almost helpless to carry on a war. I have made a rough mental calculation, and I estimate that Newcastle's proportion of militia, under the 70,000 scheme, would be about 4,600 men. Becent experience has shown us that the Japanese have been easily able to land forces of from 30,000 to 50,000 »aen on the coast of China for raiding purposes. About 2,000 oriental troops may be carried on an ordinary troopship. If an enemy wished to raid Newcastle there is little doubt that it would equip a force of between 5,000 and 10,000 troops for the purpose. Newcastle's quota of militiamen of 4,600 would be practically Mr Fairbairn. useless if an attack of that description For were launched.",94
216,Mr STREET,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I remind the honourable member that the 70,000 men are to be only the nucleus of a first-line component of 120,000 men.",100
217,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I ask the Minister for Defence (Mr Street) whether he expects his force of 70,000 to grow or to dwindle. In my opinion it will dwindle. I question whether, unless we had compulsory military training, we should be able to maintain an effective force. Numbers of men would be continually passing into reserves under compulsory training. I have inspected a militia regiment in Gippsland in my electorate recently and I suggest to honourable gentlemen, who may think that our militia is a laughable force, that they also should take an opportunity to inspect this Gippsland regiment. If they do so they will find the men equal in physique and personnel to any regiment of the Australian Imperial Force. These men are also displaying a remarkable enthusiasm. Many ex-Australian Imperial Force men are included in the personnel, but these units have no reserves. If we reverted to compulsory military training we should be able to maintain an effective force and also have in reserve, after the lapse of some years, a large number of men in every part of Australia capable of rushing to the defence of the country at short notice if they were needed. I suggest that the Government's scheme for a militia of 70,000 would not provide a force capable of repelling attacks at vital and strategic points in this country. I thank honourable members for the forbearance they have displayed in listening to my remarks at this early hour of the morning. I wish now to make a few observations, in conclusion, concerning Singapore. Will the Government tell us what it proposes to do to organize a proper, volunteer force to reinforce Singapore if that course should ever be necessary?",100
218,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB, The honourable member's time has expired.,100
219,Mr RIORDAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Kennedy) [3.55 a.m.]. - I support the protest of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) at the action of the Government in prolonging this sitting right through the night. It is unreasonable to expect honourable members who have been present since 2.30 o'clock yesterday afternoon to take a really intelligent part in this discussion at 4 o'clock this morning. This period of the session has now lasted for eight weeks, but during that time the House has sat for only three days a week-o n Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of one week, and on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the following week, and so on. Yet the Government is now seeking to force the most important business that can engage our attention through the committee in a most cavalier way. It is, in effect, striving to stifle the criticism of the Opposition. This is legislation by a process of exhaustion, and the circumstances do not in any sense warrant it. I emphatically protest against the tactics of the Government. Honourable members are sent here to voice the views of people in their electorates. It is my responsibility to voice the views of the people in the north and western parts of Queensland, but it is almost impossible for any honourable member properly to discharge his duties all through the afternoon and night, and then to be expected to discuss all the important aspects of the budget. We are now considering the largest budget that any Treasurer has brought down in the history of the Commonwealth. In May of this year we passed a loan bill which purported to provide aU the funds needed to implement the defence programme of the Government for this financial year; yet we are now asked to make substantial additional funds available for defence purposes. In discussing the Loan Bill last May I said that money for defence purposes could be obtained in three ways-by taxation, which is the policy the Government"" is now implementing; by loan moneys, which is the policy that was applied last May; or by using Australia's great national financial institution-the Commonwealth Bank-to - provide funds. The Government is now engaged in loan conversion operations involving £70,000,000, so it tells us that it cannot, at this stage, raise further funds from the loan market for defence purposes. We all know very well that it would be abhorrent to members of the Cabinet to call upon the Commonwealth Bank to raise funds for this purpose. Yet the Labour party contends that the Commonwealth Bank is capable of providing the money we need if it were permitted to function as its founders intended it to .function. A similar financial institution, modelled on our Commonwealth Bank, is functioning effectively in Sweden, and Sweden, we well know, is one of the most prosjierous countries of the world. Moreover, it felt* the last depression less than did any other country for the reason that its national bank was permitted to operate in the interests of the nation. It was not called upon to make profits for private shareholders. This Government could well follow the lead of Sweden with beneficial results. The course I suggest requires only an amendment of the existing Commonwealth Bank Act so that the Commonwealth Bank could be used, as was done during the Great War, and as it was employed by Sir Denison Miller when the transcontinental railway was constructed. This, however, the Government refuses to do; it prefers to tax the people, especially the workers. Not long ago, it passed a measure which raised a howl throughout the length and breadth of this country. That was the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act, which imposed a class tax of the worse kind. Now it is the intention of the Government to increase, not only sales tax and income tax, but practically all other - taxes. We know that when it comes to a final analysis, theworkers of the community will be the hardest hit, because those persons who support this Government always pass taxes on to the working class. In anticipation of the passing of this measure, there has been an' increase of the ccst of living, and employers have already adopted a method to offset the effects of the proposed taxation by dismissing numbers of their employees, and requiring those remaining in their employ to perform additional duties. If taxation is the method which must be adopted to finance this budget, it should be based on ability to pay and imposed upon those who have the largest incomes. The outcome of the imposition of taxation, such as that proposed, will be to lower the living standards in which we take a great deal of pride. As many honourable members have already stated, this measure may be termed a defence budget, because much of the money to be collected is to be used fcofinanceAustralia's defence programme. During the federal elections held a little more than twelve months ago, members of the Labour party were Jbranded by Government supporters as isolationists, and only a little while ago a senior member of the Cabinet ranted against the Labour party on that ground. charge was very forcibly and capably answered, however, both inside and outside this chamber, and ""I now make the charge that the Government itself is composed of isolationists of the wor3t kind, for it has isolated, not only north Queensland, but also the town and port of Darwin. Darwin is the open gateway from the East into Australia, yet it is separated from the rest of the country, and those people who are prepared to go north into the tropics of Queensland receive no encouragement or protection from this Government. Most Government members seem to think that Brisbane is in northern Queensland. Recently, I asked the former Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) what steps had been taken to provide defence for the undefended north. In reply, the Minister referred to defence measures that had been taken in Sydney and Melbourne. Apparently the Minister could not answer the question, or he was not sufficiently conversant with the geography of his own country to know where northern Queensland is situated. It appears to me that the defence programme of the Government is designed to protect Sydney and Melbourne-that is, if it has a programme at all. The Government has totally disregarded the need to expend money in the areas north of Brisbane, with which I am particularly concerned. Residents of the big cities, with their factories and palatial homes, have received greater consideration than those persons who have Mr Riordan. gone into the tropics and have left behind the conveniences and comforts of the southern cities and towns, in order to carry on the work of developing this continent. They receive no consideration from the Government in regard to defence or anything else. Residents of northern and western Queensland will be required to pay their fair share of the taxes to be imposed, and they ask that they should be afforded some measure of protection. Members of the Government, and its supporters, display a lamentable lack of knowledge of conditions in northern Queensland. I doubt whether any members of the Government, with the exception The of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), the Minister for Health (Senator Poll) and the former Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White), have been in northern Queensland in recent years. They should make themselves conversant with conditions in those areas in whose interests they should be legislating. They prefer to go abroad and, wear fancy clothes rather than travel about their own country investigating the needs of the Australian people. There is a great difference between the defence requirements of northern and western Queensland and those of the southern parts of Australia, because population and industries are centralized in New South Wales and Victoria, whereas the reverse is the case in Queensland. In that State, railways penetrate 500 or 600 miles into the west from deepwater ports, and every railway passes through thriving towns, and assists in the maintenance of the great pastoral, fishing, mining and other industries. Nevertheless, primary-producing districts in that State receive no consideration from the Commonwealth Government, as is demonstrated when requests are made for the establishment of post offices or telephone services. Then the first question asked is: What will be the revenue ? From my examination of the action taken by the Government since it promised the people in October of last year to give them a defence policy, it appears that only Sydney and Melbourne have been seriously considered. This Government has not fulfilled the promises made on the hustings, but it apparently has awakened at last to a realization of the fact that Australia is passing into an economic condition similar to that which prevailed in 1931, and is on the verge of another depression. As it has been phrased, we are passing into a period of business recession. The prices of wool, wheat and base metals have fallen, and the economic repercussions are such that unemployment and wide-spread dissatisfaction must result as they did in 1929. The Government is talking about its defence programme, and is extracting from the pockets of the workers, and others who can ill-afford to pay, the greater part of the revenue required to finance the defence scheme. It is known that certain members of the present Cabinet have exhibited profascist tendencies, and at functions in Sydney have praised what has taken place in Germany; at least, so we are told in the press. The dictators learned a lesson from the last depression. .They saw a vast army of unemployed walking the streets, representing a potential, danger to themselves. The fear of revolution drove them to find employment for this great army, and the only avenue open to them was the manufacture of armaments. In consequence, Hitler and Mussolini embarked on a rearmament programme to create instruments of war, and, at the same time to provide employment. The prices of our primary products and base metals rose. Hitler and Mussolini were able by this method to stave off the threatening revolution, but, now that their vast military machines have been created, their creation has become a menace to world peace. If the actions of the Commonwealth Government are not designed to stave off a threatened depression why have north Queensland and the west coast of Western Australia been neglected? That question remains unanswered. The former Minister for Defence refused to answer Those areas, for some unknown reason, have been penalized by this Government in the allocation of expenditure on defence. No steps have been taken to defend those areas. On the contrary, the fortifications on Thursday Island were abandoned. Acid was poured down the barrels of the guns so that they could not be used by I do not know whom. The garrison was removed to Darwin and the Government said, ""We shall make Darwin a great fort to support the base at Singapore "". The result is that between Darwin and Brisbane there is no coastal defence whatsoever. Until 1922, there were at Cairns, Thursday Island and Townsville naval depots, but they were closed in that year, and, despite the fact that on the hustings the Government proclaimed that the only form of defence was naval defence, no steps have been taken to reopen them. The only step that has been taken by the Commonwealth towards the strengthening of the Australian Navy has been the purchase of two second-hand cruisers from Great Britain. Great Britain used the money paid for those vessels towards the cost of two modern vessels to replace - them. During election campaigns the policy of the Labour party of air defence was ridiculed by members of the Government, who said, "" We must have a navy; air defence is hopeless "". Despite that assertion, many naval vessels were towed off the coasts and sunk, whilst others were sold to ship-breakers. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr. Green) informed honourable members of the opinions of a naval expert to the effect that many of the vessels that have recently been put into commission in the Australian Navy would be practically useless in the event of hostilities. Despite its assertion that air defence was not adequate for Australia, this Government has recently placed orders in the United States of America for several military aircraft, I am sorry to state, however, that the number ordered is inadequate to meet our needs, but if the Labour party was wrong in October, 1936, how is it that the Government has now urgently decided to purchase an air it. fleet from the United States of America? The opinion of experts is that what we need for the adequate defence of Australia is a fleet of first-class fighting machines and bombers, not AvroAnsons and other obsolete aeroplanes of the types that are now being used. The squadron leader of the Vickers-Wellesley squadron which recently made an epic flight to Australia says that the AvroAusou bombers are out of date.",100
220,Mr STREET,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Nevertheless , they are still being manufactured for the Royal Air Force.",104
221,Mr RIORDAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"They may be all right for training purposes, but they would be useless in war. I shall now refer to tests that have been carried out between the navy and aeroplanes in the TJnited States of America. Brigadier-General ""William Mitchell, who was the founder of the United States of America Air Force, was responsible for those tests. He had agitated for them for a considerable time and had stated that it was his firm belief that, if any enemy naval fleet approached to within 100 miles of the United States of America, destroyers and light cruisers, because they cannot be armoured against bombs and aerial torpedoes, would be sunk by aerial bombardment. vessel which had belonged to Germany, but was handed to the United States of America at the end of the war, was sunk by the attacking planes during a demonstration, which proved that an adequate air fleet could soon cripple an approaching hostile navy.",104
222,Mr STREET,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Was that the 1925 test?,104
223,Mr RIORDAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes. At the present time we have a "" great"" air fleet. We have a few Hawker Demons, a couple of Bulldogs, and a.few AvroAnsons. An order has now been placed for the supply of Lockheeds. When they will be received is problematical, because the United States of America, as well as Great Britain, is expanding its force. Great Britain also has gone to the United States of America with orders for aircraft. The aircraft factory at Fisherman's Bend is only turning' out training machines. The Commonwealth Government should encourage the manufacturers of aeroplanes in Great Britain to establish plants in this country to manufacture aircraft. Most of the raw materials needed are available, and I consider that it would be only necessary to secure the co-operation of the manufacturers concerned to have a - substantial aeroplane manufacturing industry developed in Australia. I feel that the manufacturers in England, who realise the danger which beset their factories because of the proximity of Great Britain to the Continent, where there are vast air fleets, would be prepared to establish factories here. Because this country is most suitable for flying, there would be a market not only for military aircraft, but also for aircraft for civil purposes. We should have, as was advocated by the Labour party at the last election, an air fleet equal in strength to the strength of the sea-borne air fleet of a neighbouring power. If we had such an air arm, the wish of the people of northern Queensland for the establishment of at least one air force squadron there could be gratified. The lack of defence in north Queensland is an open invitation to the power that I have in mind to attack this country. The arguments that the people in the north of Queensland use are that heed should be taken of what has happened in Spain, A where aerial attacks are made on the civilian population for the purpose of destroying the morale of the people and of the - army. An air squadron in the north of Queensland would be able to warn the civil population to leave the towns in the event of an attack by an enemy before they were bombarded. I think it will be agreed generally that the foreign power to which I have referred would come to Australia, not by way of Singapore, but by a route to the north-east of New Guinea. The officers and ratings on the sampans which periodically visit Australian waters know the coast better than the persons who arc responsible for the admiralty charts. They know every nook and cranny of our coast and most of the navigable channels. That power first conquered Manchuria, and then, from the newly-established Manchukuo, set about the task of subjugating China. The same thing could hanoen in the north of Australia, which might become another Manchuria. In the districts inland from Cairns and Cooktown an invading force would find all the metals it needed, and on the coastal strip prolific crops of almost every type of agricultural product could be grown. The north of Queensland would provide a base from which an invader could set about conquering, within a short space of time, the whole of the rest of Australia. The adequate defence of Australia means more than the defence of Sydney and Melbourne. Action should be taken to defend the people who live in the remote parts of Australia to which I have referred. Reference has been made to the nonstop flight from Egypt to Australia of three Vickers-Wellesley bombers. That flight has proved that the most successful way to repel a hostile attack is to have an air force at least as strong as that of the attacking nation. The speed of these machines was amply demonstrated in the flight from Darwin to Cloncurry. Although Avro-Anson bombers belonging to the Royal Australian A ir Force which went to Darwin to welcome the VickersWellesley squadron left Darwin before the Vickers-Wellesley machines, the latter reached Cloncurry first. I plead with the Government to establish at least one air squadron in northern Queensland. Some supporters of the Government have urged that Australia should purchase a battleship at an estimated cost of £15,000,000. The chief argument in favour of that proposal is the psychological effect on a possible enemy. That might be a good argument, but for £15,000,000 Australia could purchase 1,000 Vickers-Wellesley which have proved that they are equal to any other machine produced in the world. If we are to expend £15,000,000, let us get for our money the latest aircraft. The only defence establishment in Queensland north of Brisbane was at Thursday Island. The fortifications there were removed about three years ago, and the garrison was sent to Darwin. It has been suggested that Thursday Island, and the adjoining islands need not be fortified, because, in the event of an attack on Australia, the northern passages and the openings in the Great Barrier Reef could be mined. That suggestion loses its force when we reflect that the nearest minelaying station is at Swan Island, in Victoria, 3,000 or 4,000 miles away. If the defence authorities think that it would be wise to mine the passages in the Great Barrier Reef, a mine-laying base should be established in north Queensland. At a recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Forgan Smith, urged that a railway should be constructed to connect Darwin with the southern portion of the continent. Should Australia be attacked in the vicinity of Darwin, it would be impossible to send reinforcements there, because there is no railway or road connecting Darwin with the other capital cities of Australia. Those honourable members who accompanied the Minister for the Interior (Mr MCEwen) on his recent visit to the Northern Territory know the class of country which they had to traverse, and are aware that the so-called roads are only bush tracks. On behalf of hi3 State the Premier of Queensland offered to construct a railway from Dajarra to Camooweal if the Commonwealth Government would construct a railway from Darwin to Camooweal. In 1912 Sir John Forrest advocated that Darwin should be connected by rail with north-western Queensland. At that time, the Commonwealth Government offered to build a railway in Queensland at no cost to that State, but a reactionary government in Queensland rejected the proposal.",104
224,Mr BLAIN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,What is the attitude of Mr Forgan Smith to the proposal of the machines Commonwealth Government?,105
225,Mr RIORDAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"As I have said, the Queensland Government is prepared to construct a railway from Dajarra to Camooweal if the Commonwealth Government will extend the railway from Darwin to Camooweal. Cairns is connected 1 with Brisbane by rail, but in the event of an attack on Australia, that railway line, which is 1,000 miles long, might soon be destroyed. It would require only one well-directed bomb to demolish a bridge and convert the line in the vicinity into twisted steel. In such an event, all portions of the State north of the damaged portion of the railway would be isolated from the southern portion of the continent. The railway from Townsville to Dajarra would, after passing Charters Towers, be practically safe from attack from the air. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth Government should take steps to bring Darwin into closer touch with the southern portions of the continent, and that an inland military road should be constructed by this Government between Charters Towers and Brisbane. The honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Blain) knows that twenty points of rain would make the roads in the black soil 'country of Queensland impassable; even the mechanised units of which the Defence Department is so proud, would not be able to make any progress along them. The only practicable thing to do is to link Darwin and Camooweal by rail, and to construct a military road from Brisbane to Charters Towers.",105
226,The CHAIRMAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The honourable member's time has expired.,106
227,Mr SHEEHAN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Cook) [4.40 a.m.] In his budget speech the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) said that the past year had been one of appreciable economic advance in Australia, but I have yet to be convinced that the great mass of the people of Australia made any progress during that period. I listened with profound interest and pleasure to the speech made on Friday last by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) when he drew attention to anomalies in the Constitution and the handicaps under which the various governments of Australia are attempting to work. I also listened with interest and pleasure to the speech Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) yesterday. I am indeed pleased that the Government intends to take some steps towards unification. The Constitution of Australia is divided into three main parts namely the parliament, the executive and the judiciary. Constitutional powers are vested in the parliament; executive powers arc vested in the Governor General, acting with the advice of the Executive Council; whilst the judiciary powers are vested in the High Court and such State courts as are given delegated powers by the Parliament. A complete review under these headings is necessary. I do not claim to have any great knowledge of constitutional matters, but I know that, since federation, the Commonwealth has been labouring under great disability. The budget is admittedly a defence budget; £16,000,000 is to be set aside for defence. The Government, has been at great pains to defend its policy. It claims that there is a growing demand to organize Australia's man-power, yet not long ago it considered that there was no urgent need to do so, as it then was of opinion that the man-power necessary for the defence of Australia was only about one-half of what is thought necessary today. Unfortunately, Australia's economic position has not been planned to make provision for the economic security of Australian men, women and children. Provision should be made for child endowment on a nationwide basis so that Australian parents may rear families in some degree of comfort and security. The Government has paid little or no attention to the health of the people. There has not been a conference of Ministers of Health since 1926. The Government has shown a lack of understanding of the great danger which confronts the nation by placing annexes to the buildings of private firms in which armaments are to be manufactured. The installation of this machinery will involve heavy financial expenditure in buildings, machinery, &c, and there will be a general clamour for a guarantee of continuity of orders.",106
228,Mr STREET,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"That is not so. Mr 'SHEEHAN - The pressure which these armament firms are able to bring to bear on governments through of the members of Parliament and through ex-members of the Public Service in the employment of these firms, has largely determined government policy in other countries. Naval scares are raised by the initrigues and conspiracies of interested capitalists. The manufacture of armaments, the building of battleships and the making of guns should be done by the Government. Private firms should be eliminated and all such work should be carried out in the Government's own workshops and factories. I cite the testimony of Mr Lloyd George as to the advantages of national factories for the manufacture of war materials. Speaking in the House of Commons on the 1.8th August, .1919, he saidNational factories were set up which checked the prices, and a shell for which tire War Office, at the time the Ministry was formed, was paying 22s. Cd. was reduced to 12s., and when you had 85.000,000 of shells that saved £35,000,000. There was a reduction in the price of all other shells, and there was a reduction in the Lewis jruns. When we took them in hand they cost £1(55, and reduced them to £35 each. There was a saving of £14,000,000 there, and through the costing.system, and the checking of the national factories we set up . . . before the end of the war there was a saving of £440,000,000. The Ministry of Shipping, by its reduction of rates, saved hundreds of millions to this country. This Government, I am sure, has knowledge of all those circumstances. direct the attention of the Minister for Defence to the following newspaper parament, graph :A WAR-SCARE SCANDAL. Whenever a nation is facing a grave gency, there will always be found a gang profiteering buccaneers, loudly proclaiming their patriotism, and at the same time their hardest"" in the dastardly game of plundering the people. These flagwaving pirates operated true form in Britain n few weeks ago when country was feverishly preparing for a that looked like becoming a grim reality at any moment. And not a word of protest from the Chamberlain Government, much less toria, who is a brigadier-general. any action to check their shameless looting saidoperations. When materials were needed for the protecbroadcast tion of the people against air raids, these despicable and conscienceless profiteers were willing to make supplies available-at profits ranging up to 500 per cent.! Pickaxes and trench tools, selling at couple of shillings before the crisis, suddenly jumped to as high as 10s. each. shovels, needed for digging trenches, rose from 2s. 6d. to 7s. 0d., and even higher. The price of galvanized iron, needed for covering shelter all - trenches, jumped up hundreds per cent., the price kept increasing almost every hour. There were no shortages of supplies of any than of those materials before the war preparations wore got under way. But when Britain's workers began trench digging and making parations to protect the masses from the threatening menace from the air, supplies the needed tools and materials could be only at prices dictated by the profiteers. A scandalous example of ghoulish profiteerdespite ing was that of sandbag supplies. Sold narily a.t Id. to l j d . ouch, the price was increased up to as high as lOd. each in a hours. Millions of them, needed for tection of civilians and buildings, were councils and local government authorities this price. The soulless profiteers did not hesitate to ""sandbag"" the community right and left for fat profits. These individuals, posing as patriots, ready to take advantage of a perilous situation to engage in shameless profiteering, are found in every capitalist country in the world. They know no loyalty powerful enough restrain them from plundering their countrymen. The only flag they acknowledge is the black emblem of the buccaneers. We had them here in Australia during the last world war, over twenty years ago. And they would again be well to front, ready to bleed the country and its people white for profits, were Australia to become involved in another struggle for the defence of the nation. And while they plundered right aud left they would noisily proclaim themselves as a full patriots of the highest order! I In submitting the Labour party's policy on international affairs to Parliathe Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Curtin) made two points. One was that, whatever else Australia might do as a emermember of the British Commonwealth of of Nations, no Australian troops should be sent to take part in overseas wars. The "" going other was that all efforts should be directed towards making Australia to completely self-reliant in defence. Strikthat ing confirmation of the force of this war policy was given in the Senate on the came 7th October by Senator Brand, of VicHe "" It was unnecessary for Mr Curtin to to the world that no Australian soldier would be sent to fight overseas,"" said General Brand. "" The world situation today. as far as Australia is concerned, is quite different from that in 1014. There is no likelihood of the formation of another Australian a Imperial Force. All our industrial, economic and service defence preparations have one Spades and objective-hom e defence."" The justification for defence and that it involves lies in the and fact that there is more at stake the defence of territory. It is our principles of justice, liberty, and democracy and our standards of life prethat we are striving to defend, and the of threat to them is great. We have lived had to see the liberties of the private citizen suppressed in many countries, which, brilliant cultural histories, aeeui ordito be reverting to a conception of the fewindividual's relation to the state intolerthe proable to Australians, with a parallel sold to deterioration of international morality. at Liberty and justice are principles worth much material loss, but Australians have for years made really great sacrifices for far less worthy ideals. Por instance, the yet loss to Australia consequent on the to be Ottawa Agreement would equal the cost, of building several battleships, and there to are many who believe that Ottawa has fellowbred more disappointment and dissatisfaction than genuine Empire welfare. A more practical justification for substantial expenditures on defence is that much of the construction work and training of labour involved will, in any event, be undertaken in due course, and will add considerably to the national income. Papua and New Guinea offer an outstanding example of the need for development of latent resources. Potentially one of the richest territories in the Pacific, New Guinea has resources which, with the exception of gold, are relatively undeveloped. Its potential mineral wealth includes copper, zinc, silver, osmiridium and possibly petroleum, while its agricultural possibilities are also great. Once the initial difficulties of transport and capital have been overcome, plantations of coffee, sugar cane, rubber and tea could easily be supported. Papua is in the same position. Its mining and agricultural resources are extensive, but the lack of capital for the construction of roads and for other purposes and the inadequate shipping facilities have retarded progress. As a result, the area under cultivation has not increased. Development of these territories is essential if they are to play the part in our defences that their geographical position dictates. Otherwise Australia will not only decline to take advantage of a natural outer ring of defences, but will also leave a tremendous gap in its strategic position almost inviting attack. Forward bases to the north, of Australia will form an integral part of any defence programme, and for this reason the future of New Guinea may be very important. range of operations of the Singapore base will be inadequate to keep all the waters surrounding the north of Australia clear of invaders. The solution is to supplement this main base by establishing forward bases, probably in New Guinea. The provision of forward bases entails the establishment of facilities rather than actual garrisons. It is not necessary that troops, planes and destroyers should be stationed at the bases, but only that sites should be prepared in such a way that they can be used at any time. Landing grounds in these tropical areas will require constant clearing and careful charting. Also, an exact knowledge of the waters to the north of Australia will be necessary. At present such knowledge is Mr Sheehan. inadequate. In oeace times the navy could be employed profitably in carrying out survey work, such as charting the intricate waters around New Guinea, little of which has so far been undertaken. Trade routes provide another good reason for concentrating attention upon the north, for about one fourth of Australian trade traverses the Pacific. Moreover, one of our most important trading connections to the north-west is the Netherlands East Indies, our chief supplier of oils. In 1936-37 about 60 per cent, of Australian petrol imports came from the Netherlands East Indies, the next largest suppliers being the TJnited States of America and British Borneo, with less than 20 per cent. each. The Netherlands East Indies and Australia could gain much from co-operative defence of trade routes, because, apart from the trade between them they both have a very lively interest in trade with Europe, and over a large part of the journey their routes coincide. Australian dependence upon oil from overseas raises the whole question of storage of essential imports, and of the limits to which it is advisable to become independent of imported goods. Generally speaking, it is wiser to strive to keep open channels of trade giving access to products more cheaply than they can be produced at home. But in war-time, a com-* promise is probably the better plan. Storage is one solution. While Great Britain is storing principally foodstuffs, Australia's stored goods would be mainly The of a different kind. The need for oil we have in common, but for machinery and machine parts, including motorvehicles and aeroplane engines, Australia is almost entirely dependent upon supplies from England and the TJnited States of America. The problem is more than one of keeping trade routes open, because these countries may not be able to supply such commodities in an emergency. This makes it necessary to prepare at once factories for the construction of motor vehicles and aeroplanes. Work has already been begun in that direction, and it was recently announced that in five years about 25 per cent, of Australia's petrol consumption will come from Newnes. These are important contributions, and it is imperative that their urgency should not be overlooked. It seems necessary, too, that apart from a greater use and development of Cockatoo Dockyard, some encouragement should be given to shipbuilding in Australia. Industrial development, however, involves more than factories; it necessitates greatly improved communications in order to keep connected all the vital links in the Australian economy. Germany has led the way in showing the need for excellent roads and bridges as an integral part of its defence programme. They are equally important here. For example, in New South ""Wales there is only one bridge crossing the Hawkesbury Biver, which is the only link between Sydney and the coal, iron and steel resources of the Newcastle district. The roads across the Blue Mountains are also inadequate for communication between east and west. Numerous railway lines require duplication, and some important districts are not yet adequately served by rail and road. But before going too far in extending railways, the relative merits of road and rail transport should be calculated, since it may be that railway lines are more vulnerable to attack than are motor routes. The number of aerodromes has been increased of late as also has provision for night flying, but there is still much to be done in that direction, which, in view of the vital importance of aviation iii modern warfare, Australia cannot afford to neglect. Great Britain has been improving harbour facilities, and it seems that Australia should also examine the adequacy of this aspect of its defences. Some part of the various defence preparations will be carried out in each State, and the whole undertaking will be a vast one, the control of which might best be vested in some central authority after a thorough Australia-wide survey. Air raid precautions would also come under the direction of this authority. The scope of modern warfare has made it necessary to prepare the civil population as well as the armed forces, and though Australia may not have to go to the lengths of European countries to guard against air raids, the larger, coastal towns may be liable to attacks of this nature. It must be obvious to any observant person that the grim spectre of unemployment is still with us, despite the fact that the amount of factory employment has been gradually extended, for which this Government takes the credit, although it knows that the improvement in the main has ibeeu due largely to other circumstances. The man in the street knows that the improvement is, in large measure, due to natural causes, over which the Government has had no control. It is an acknowledged faet that the higher prices for primary products, metals, etc., based on war and threats of war, had reduced temporarily the unemployment figures, but, unfortunately, without producing any real remedy for the miserable conditions still existing for a large section of our fellow citizens, who are still unemployed, or of offering any outlook or security for the future of that section of the population which provides the skilled and unskilled labour still necessary for our productive requirements. The practice of citing figures compiled by the Statistician from returns submitted by trade unions to prove that unemployment has been reduced by specific percentages takes no account of the fact that many of our youths and young adults have never had - an opportunity to join a trade union, and ignores the other fact that part time employment is now a much more important factor in industry than was the case prior to the depression. The trade union figures, therefore, do not provide a sound basis for comparison, nor do they truly reflect the existing position. Unemployment in Australia is still very severe, and is one of our greatest problems. Figures culled from reliable sources testify to this fact. It is reliably estimated that at least 200,000 of our fellow citizens cannot obtain regular employment, to say nothing of the annual addition to that huge total from amongst the ranks of young people of both sexes, who, on leaving school, are unable to enter industry through lack of a properly planned economy on the part of this Government, which has repeatedly promised economic security to all. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. Those who are still unemployed cannot be expected to remain quiescent for ever. Sooner or later, a day of reckoning arrives for a Government which breads its promises. For the jobless breadwinners and their hapless dependants, the problem is a very real one. The Labour party realizes that it is still acute, and is likely to be aggravated in the near future, the possibility of another slump having already been forecast. Eor these reasons it has put forward a constructive policy to deal with the problem. One way in which unemployment could be relieved is by undertaking essential public works, in which Australian material, as well as labour, would be utilized. standardization of our railway gauges, I suggest, would admirably fill the bill, because all of the materials which would be required, such as steel rails and fastenindividual. ings, could be manufactured in Australia, whilst the sleepers could be hewn in our forests. Furthermore, the conversion of the permanent - way to the 4-ft. S-J-in. gauge, and also the alteration of the rolling-stock, would involve practically all labour. Such a project offers a golden opportunity to this Government to give employment to at least 50,000 people, whose families and dependants, totalling 150,000 persons, would be enabled to live on a much higher standard than they can afford today. Furthermore, this work would be of immense value from a defence standpoint. It can, therefore, be said to be a work which would be in the interests of the nation as a whole. The advantages of A standardized railway gauge are as great as the disadvantages resulting from the lack of it. During the debate which took"" place on the subject last week, I was very pleased to hear the Minister for the Interior (Mr. MCEwen) announce that he proposed to call a conference of Ministers for Railways for the purpose of co-ordinating transport services throughout the Commonwealth. As an ex-railway employee I fully realise the importance of the problem of transport in this country. However, if it is not immediately tackled by the various governments it will soon become insurmountable. suggest that the Government should appoint a traffic committee to advise and assist the State transport departments on all matters connected with both intraMr Sheehan. State and interstate traffic. Such a committee could also give a lead in the preparation of a plan for the co-ordination of air, road, rail and water transport services. It would seem that each improvement in transport increases the desire for still better facilities. Faster and more frequent passenger services are being demanded, whilst the more rapid delivery of goods is being insisted upon by traders who have adopted a policy of ordering in smaller lots. Such demands have in many cases increased operating and financial problems. Rapid, cheap The and efficienrt transport confers great benefits on the community as a whole, whilst, on the other hand, inadequate, costly and inefficient services adversely affect every The transport industries can only be enabled to render the best services possible ito the community by being placed on a sound financial and economic basis. At present it is generally recognized that the transport situation is in many respects unsatisfactory, and that the beat use is not being made of the facilities already available. Passenger transport in many of the larger cities is in a state of chaos, with the result that an additional problem of serious magnitude has been created. Furthermore, the relationship of the new air services to road and railway transport is vital. Tremendous benefits may be gained from the co-ordination of not only road and rail transport, but also other services. The rapid development of commercial aviation has brought into prominence the problem of co-ordinating aerial services with other forms of transport. Since collections and deliveries at terminal aerodromes can be effected only by road vehicles or railways, some degree of co-ordination with air services is essential. I point out that most aerodromes are situated some distance outside the cities which they serve, and, therefore, some co-ordinated system of road and rail delivery is essential in order to minimize delays. Over long distances, also, great possibilities are presented in connection with the co-ordination of rail and steamer services, and already such co-ordination has been introduced in other countries with advantage. The I electrification of the Sydney metropolitan railway system should be advaifeed as rapidly as possible in order to enable the withdrawal of road vehicles from the inner subur.bs. Furthermore, new suburbs could be developed by providing feeder services to the railways. In this way congestion would be overcome, and the Defence Department would be materially assisted in its plans. I am disappointed that the Government has seen fit to increase the rate of sales tax from 4 per cent, to 5 per cent., which is really an increase of 25 per cent., in order to enable it to finance its annual contribution of £2,000,000 towards the uational health and pensions insurance scheme. It is estimated that the extra sales tax will return as much as £1,900,000. I remind the Government that when the national health and pensions insurance legislation was introduced a promise was given that no extra tax would be placed upon any commodity in general demand by the workers on the basic wage. However, the Government has broken that promise. I have abundant evidence that the sales tax has been increased on many articles, such as soap and the cheaper kinds of biscuits, which are essential requirements of basic wage-earners. Thus, the workers are being doubly penalized. They arc obliged to contribute directly towards their own insurance, and, at the same time, through increased sales tax, to provide the Government's annual contribution under the scheme. The Australian Broadcasting Commission Act has been on the statute-book for more than six years. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) recently contended that the rapid developments in broadcasting in Australia rendered it essential that broadcasting should be the subject of legislative review by Parliament. Events have shown that a change of policy is required. It appears that in many respects the administration of the commission is very wasteful. Appointments have been made, and programmes prepared, which leave a grave doubt as to the qualifications of many members of the staff. It is the practice of the commission to give rather lavish entertainments to mark the arrival of distinguished celebrity artists, and the question may well be asked as to whether these receptions are justified. I suggest that A and B class stations should be regarded as co-related agencies in the Australian broadcasting service. [Quorum formed.]. The utmost dissatisfaction exists with the manner in which certain commercial stations have been given increased power, and the replies offered by the Postmaster-General on this point are contradictory. Parliament has not had a reasonable opportunity for many years to deal with broadcasting as such, let alone the work of the commission. The whole subject is due for review, and a measure for the complete amendment of existing legislation relating to broadcasting should be submitted to Parliament. My only comment with respect to the constitution of an inner group of the Cabinet is that it is the first step in a move by a small clique of fasciat-minded Ministers to usurp the democratic functions of the National Government. Apparently, this Government is not concerned about the fact that it has no authority under the Constitution for establishing an inner group within the Cabinet. Chapter II . of the Constitutionprovides that the whole of the Cabinet must go into consultation on all matters. The proposal to constitute an inner group, therefore, violates the Constitution. The Government is well aware of that fact. Because of the lateness of the hour, however, I shall leave the matter there. In view of persistent rumours that the Government proposes to bring this session abruptly to an end about the 2nd or 3rd December, I draw its attention to a promise in the budget that, during this session, it will introduce legislation relating to reciprocity between the Commonwealth and New Zealand in the matter of invalid and old-age pensions. At present residence in New Zealand is not accepted as residence in Australia for pension purposes, and vice versa. I sincerely hope that, before this period of the session is concluded, appropriate legislation will be introduced to give effect to this desirable amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act.",106
229,Mr BLAIN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Northern Territory) [5.15 a.m.] - After listening to the scathing remarks of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) in regard to the manner in which this debate has been conducted, I feel that he has done a service in presenting a surface on which the shame of the Government might be reflected. An old Greek philosopher, Aristophanes, described shame in another way when he said that it was actually the "" apprehension of a vision reflected from the surface of the opinion of the public"". It appears to me that all honourable members have a fellow feeling with the honourable member for Flinders in this regard. I rose, however, to make a brief protest against the continual use of two words that seem to have emanated from the remarks of the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies). Those words are "" uniformity"" and "" unification "". I do not believe in either one or the other.",111
230,Mr MENZIES,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Thos e words did not emerge from my speech.,112
231,Mr BLAIN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"It may seem paradoxical for me to say that I do not believe in unification, althtough I am in favour of the abolition of State parliaments. I do not think that the speech of the Attorney-General, presented with no lack of logic, will convince the people of Australia of the need for clothing the Commonwealth Parliament with additional powers. The present system is so essentially top heavy that it will break its props. Nothing is any stronger than the props on which it stands. Therefore, it will take much more than the brilliant speech of the honourable gentleman to persuade the people of Australia to give to the Commonwealth Parliament willy nilly such wide powers as have been suggested by him, and so eagerly seized upon by the Opposition. What I am surprised at is that ministerial members should seize on the speech of the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) as indicating that he favours unification, because as is well-known he does not. In a speech made in this House last year - and he of all honourable members in this House knows the precise meaning of words-h e advocated not unification:, but the establishment of provinces to take the place of the existing. States.",112
232,Mr WARD,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,He wanted complete legisthose lative powers for this Parliament.,112
233,Mr BLAIN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"As the Attorneymember General said yesterday, after the stitution convention had concluded 1900, a bargain was struck, and only the striking of a more modern bargain with the people of Australia can the stitution be altered to any great degree. What will this Parliament do in regard to it? The Commonwealth is today more and more a grasping bureaucracy in the guise of a democracy. Before any appeal to the people for. an alteration of the Constitution can attain any measure of success, the Commonwealth Government will have to come out into the open and tell the people of Australia candidly not what extended powers should be granted to the Commonwealth but what powers the Commonwealth is prepared to cede to districts or economic regions. Unless the ' Government has the guts to do that, I shall stump the country in opposition to any enlargement of federal authority. Anxious as I may be to increase the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, I would be willing to support any request for additional powers only if the request were accompanied by an attempt by a body composed of technical persons to sectionalize the continent and re-draw the map of Australia in the name of sanity and science. ' Mr MENZEES-What the honourable member wants is a sort of geological survey.",112
234,Mr BLAIN,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"The Attorney-General gave us what I might term a trigonometrical speech in which he strided the whole of the Commonwealth as though by doing so he could convince the people of Australia that they should give to this Parliament more internal power. I believe in a survey from the centre. After first having taken the people into our confidence, let us start at the centre and go outwards by adding our regions together in order to make a complete whole. When that proposition is put to the people it will have m y wholehearted support. We have heard constant reiteration of the terms "" planning "" and "" scientific procedure "". They are used every day by honourable members on both sides of the House, mostly by who do not know the meaning of either. Last week both the honourable for Warringah (Mr Spender), Conan eminent lawyer, and the newly apin pointed Assistant Minister (Mr Harby rison) referred to the need for ""planning "". The honourable member for WarConringah also referred to the ""lamentable lack of leadership"". He urged the appointment of experts to carry out the "" planning "" which he suggested, but he was not willing to give those experts any status or authority. I would not give experts administrative authority but purely advisory authority. Real truth in itself is compelling logic, and they would establish their real authority by telling the truth. This Parliament is crying out for a more highly trained personnel. We have not sufficient technical men in this Parliament to convince the people of Australia of the full facts of many matters with which they should be made familiar, and the people can ""smell possum "". Therefore a national planning authority must be set up, the representation on which will be a true cross section of the people. The members of that authority must also be given appropriate status, though in my opinion they will very largely win that status for themselves because, as I have said, compelling logic will portray the truth to this Parliament. I believe that a national planning authority would be eminently able to assess the assets of this country for the Parliament. It must be a fact-finding body, and naturally it must have, as one of its members, a civil engineer. Perhaps I may claim the indulgence of honourable members while I read a portion of the report of an address delivered by the chairman of the Institute of Engineers of Australia, Mr A. E. Axon, M.E., M.I.E., Aust., before the Brisbane Division of the institution in 1937. Mr. Axon said I cannot help feeling that engineers as trained body have not been called upon to ment. the extent that education and training would appear to haye justified in dealing with the „ dislocations in the social order which been experienced during the last decade and this may be due, in part, to the fact that their particular training and experience rendered them less fit to administer than to profession. give practical effect to broad matters of Although this is not so much an aspect service to members, the effect of the employment of engineers to take their proper in securing the readjustment of social which the impact of science upon society rendered necessary, would develop that nition of the engineer's services to mankind which is so desirable at the present time. If that paragraph could be printed gold the expense would be - justified, ticularly at a time when honourable bers of this Parliament are constantly referring to the need for ""planning"" and "" scientific methods "". Mr Axon continuedI do not see how we can be satisfied to read in the advertising columns of our metro-, politan press, advertisements calling for applications from scientifically trained men at salaries less than those required to be paid under industrial awards to artisans and mechanics . . . . This has an important bearing now because I think that a lot of the trouble which confronts us can be attributed to the fact that we offer but paltry salaries to technical officers of the Civil Aviation Department and the Deflence Department, compared with those paid to officers occupying similar positions in other countries. The result of this has been that we have lost many of our expert technical men who, have gone to New Guinea, the United States of America, and other countries which are prepared to pay them salaries more commensurate with the value of the work they are called upon to perform. If these Commonwealth departments are to receive recognition throughout the civilized world the Government must attract the most highly competent officials by offering more appropriate salaries. Mr Axon, in referring to an advertisement by the Civil Aviation Department, continuedA practical knowledge of civil engineering as regards earth works and drainage, and also of surveying and draftsmanship, to say nothing of an unspecified "" etcetera"", is required and it is stated that "" a university degree in engineering would be an advantage"". For these qualifications the munificent salary ot £222-£30 6 is offered, these emoluments being a reduced to £192-unde r cost of living adjustWhile an optimistic outlook on the part of have a Government department is generally commendable it should surely be possible to display such without, at the same time, offering have a gratuitous insult to the civil engineering policy. These men should not ,be offered such of paltry salaries for their services. In the part discussions that will take place in this values, Parliament next year, we shall require has the assistance of scientific men. The recogpeople are supposed to have the benefit of democratic government, but it is disgraceful that honourable members of in this House are kept in ignorance of the paractions of the Ministry. The sooner the mempresent Government is supplanted by one that does not adopt bureaucratic methods the better it will Ibe for Australia. not discuss the defence plans, because the Government is dying, and knows it. In the light of recent happenings at United Australia party convention in Sydney, I feel somewhat diffident about what I now intend to say. However, I am in such an advantageous position, as the independent member for the Northern Territory, that I regard it as safe for me to do so. Although I have not the good fortune to be a member of the Wentworth family, I can do some things which the illustrious scions of that noble house may not do in the matter of criticising the Government's policy, a practice which, I believe, has become the subject of police intervention. I am unlikely to be bundled out of this chamber by a constable. As the only independent left in this House, the others having been absorbed by various organizations, nobody could discipline me but my constituents, and they are not likely to do that. I had intended, during this debate, to discuss certain matters relating to the Northern Territory, but in the present circumstances it is hardly worthwhile. Even if the Government were to agree to be influenccM by anything which I might have to say, there would probably be no result of a practical kind. The Minister for the Interior (Mr MCEwen) has visited the Northern Territory, but he has presented no report to the House. Probably he is waiting until the last few moments of the session, so that no honourable member will have an opportunity to reply to his statements. He did not visit the Lands Department in Darwin, so I am wondering how he expects to be able to devise a useful policy for the development of the territory. I intend to reserve my further remarks until there is more stability and more democracy about this place.",112
235,Mr SCULLY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Gwydir) [5.35 a.m.] It is unreasonable to ask the House to continue the budget debate, one of the most important debates of the year, at this hour of the morning, considering that the House has been in session continuously since 2.30 p.m., yesterday. I am not surprised that one of the most prominent members on the Government side has made an emphatic protest against the Government's administration I shall of the Air Eorce. It was indeed a revelation to hear the exposure by the honourable member for Elinders (Mr. the Fairbairn) of the mal-administration of the Government. We must take more than passing notice of the remarks of that honourable member regarding air defence, seeing that he is a first-class pilot of world-wide experience. He has shown that the Government has bungled badly in its administration, and his speech will make the people consider seriously whether the affairs of the nation can safely be left in the hands of the present Ministry. A notable contribution to the debate was the informative speech by the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden), who showed the slip-shod way in which the financial affairs of Australia are conducted. A costly trade delegation recently returned from Great Britain. Three of the leading members of the Cabinet had a trip overseas, which occupied over six months, and cost the Commonwealth approximately £20,000. Honourable members followed the accounts of the movements and actions of the delegation as far as possible from newspaper reports, and waited with interest for information as to the outcome of the tour. In the Gwydir electorate, at the last election, the man placed in charge of the campaign on behalf of the Government during the concluding three or four weeks, was the Leader of the Country party in New South Wales, and the Deputy Premier, Mr Bruxner, who made a definite atta.ck on the Labour party, and expressed the opinion that the electors of Gwydir would be wise if they did not return the Labour candidate because, if they did, the benefits en- . joyed by the primary producers under the Ottawa Agreement would go by the board. He particularly mentioned the duty of 2s. a quarter imposed by Britain on foreign wheat, but we find that the Leader of the Country party in this Parliament (Sir Earle Page) . absolutely betrayed the wheat growers of Australia on the occasion of his visit overseas. On no occasion, during the discussions abroad, did he put up a fight on their behalf. The protection that they have hitherto enjoyed has been lost. The action of the Government has already had an alarming effect on wheat prices in Australia. If ever protection were needed by the wheaWarmers, they require it now when the price of wheat is lower than it had been for many years. The preference of 2s. a quarter or about 3d. a bushel meant much to the Australian wheat-growers. On the day following the announcement of the Anglo-American Agreement the price of wheat in country districts fell from 2d. to 3d. a bushel, and in my electorate many wheat buyers were recalled by their respective firms, because they viewed the position with alarm. In its weekly report dealing with the international and local wheat positions, the large and well-known New South Wales firm of Lindley Walker Wheat Company Limited, reported International wheat has been friendless for many days, and world conditions, as disclosed in their cables today, may leave buyers ing but hoping-and doubting because others are doubting, particularly by those that want supplies-that they may ""buy them cheaper by waiting. Big surpluses in all exporting countries coupled with a doubtful outlook owing to now made treaties involving as they do considerable diminution in Imperial preference, and the complex financial difficulties throughout the world, are weak factors in international wheat. At this stage, at least, everything humanly possible should be done to protect the interests of the wheat-growers. Various speakers in this House have said from time to time that another period of recession is approaching; but we should realise that the other great wheat-producing centres of the world are alive to their responsibilities to the growers. year the United States of America, which has guaranteed the price of 2s. 6d. a bushel for wheat delivered at railway depots, has undertaken to subsidize wheat exports up to 30 cents a bushel. This has caused alarm amongst Australian wheat growers. The wheat exporting countries of the world expect to have 950,000,000 bushels of wheat available for export this year, but the importing countries require only 550,000,000 bushels, so that a surplus of approximately 400,000,000 bushels will have to be handled. For this reason the Government should do everything within its power to assist our wheat industry. It is deplorable that wheat-growers' organizations throughout the Commonwealth should find it necessary at a time like this to make emphatic and united protests against the disgraceful manner in which the Country party representatives with our overseas delegation earlier this year betrayed the wheat industry by surrendering, apparently without a fight, the wheat preference that we enjoyed under the Ottawa Agreement. We are hearing a great deal in these days about the Government's voluntary enlistment campaign. It is well, therefore, that honourable members should bo reminded that for several years past the Government has actually discouraged voluntary enlistment. Repeated applications have been made from various parts of my electorate for permission to form companies, but all have been rejected. Similarly, numerous applications have been made for permission to form doubtrifle clubs, but these have met the same fate. In my opinion, the possibilities of voluntary enlistment have not been by any means exhausted. If the Government had adopted any kind of a reasonable policy, instead of the bungling methods that it has pursued, 70,000 recruits could have been enlisted long before this. It is absolutely essential to the safety of this country that a vigorous policy of closer settlement be adopted. The parlous condition of the wheat industry in many of our dry areas shows that it is unreasonable to expect men to grow wheat successfully in such country. But as a great deal of first-class wheat This land in more reliable districts is today held out of wheat production, men with limited capital were forced to try their luck in unsuitable country. The Government should resume the more favoured areas and make the land available to qualified wheat-growers under reasonable conditions. If it did so the industry would soon be on a much better footing. Of course, finance is a serious obstacle, but arrangements could surely be made for money to be obtained through the Commonwealth Bank at a low rate of interest. Effective co-operation between the Commonwealth and State Governments would completely change the complexion of this problem. A little activity has been observed in New South Wales in respect of closer settlement during the last twelve months, but, unfortunately, land has been resumed at from £1 to £1 10s. an acre in excess of its productive value. This is extremely unfortunate, for it means that farmers who settle on such land will have to carry too much overhead cost. Nevertheless, the greatest disability is not cash, but the lack of opportunity for practically-reared sons of farmers and men engaged in rural industry to approach land ballots. Ninety per cent, of the most successf ul farmers of Australia began on' the bottom rung of the agricultural ladder. We have many qualified men in this country who would be glad of the opportunity to take up wheat land under reasonable conditions. Men of good character and practical knowledge should be given financial assistance to engage in this industry. Such a policy would lead to decentralization, and that, in itself, would be a worth-while achievement"". I urge the Government to consult with the State governments on this subject in order to stabilize this important industry. Eor effective defence we need a stabilized agricultural community. I trust that the Government will introduce without delay its promised long range mortgage bill. The Labour party would have preferred the opportunity to discuss in the broadest possible way the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems, but the Government has, so far, thwarted every endeavour to have that report fully discussed. After chopping and changing many times in respect of its"" financial policy, it has now promised to introduce a long-range mortgage bill. I trust that this promise will not suffer the fate of many others that have been made in recent years on its behalf. It is greatly to be regretted that nexion with our defence expenditure the money raising facilities of the Commonwealth Bank have not been fully utilized. Without doubt the Commonwealth Bank could make money available to the Government for this purpose at a very low rate of interest. In this connection I direct attention to paragraph 504, on page' 196, of the report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Sys-. terns:Because of this power the Commonwealth Bank is able to increase the cash of the tradbenefit. ifr. fSculty. ing banks in the ways we have pointed out above. Because of this power, too, the Commonwealth Bank can increase the cash reserves of the trading"" banks. For example, it can buy securities or other-property; it can lend to the governments or to others in a variety of ways; and it can even make money available to governments or to others free of any charge. In these circumstances we are justified in calling upon the Government tofinanceits defence programme through the Commonwealth Bank. Instead of .adopting that policy the Government has seen fit to revert once more to the old, bad, practice of overseas borrowing. This procedure brought Australia to the verge of bankruptcy during the regime of the Bruce Page Government. I cannot understand therefore why the present Government should revert to that policy. Undoubtedly the Government has fallen down on. its job. Leading newspapers throughout the Commonwealth are condemning it for its ineptitude. Even during this debate prominent Government supporters and erstwhile Ministers have made vitriolic attacks upon the Ministry for its maladministration. I cannot understand why the Government does not resign at once and give the people of Australia an opportunity to restore order out of the chaos in which the country is now floundering.",114
236,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Brisbane) [6.0 a.m.] - Eve n at this early hour of the morning I feel it incumbent upon me to offer some criticism of the budget now under consideration. I listened carefully to the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn), who made a valuable contribution to the debate. Like him, I iprotest against the action of the Government in keeping the House sitting until this hour when the debate in conshould have taken place weeks ago. I also listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden), and I congratulate him upon it, particularly those parts in which he stressed the bungling of the Government in regard to national insurance. I desire to congratulate the Minister for Defence (Mr Street) upon his appointment. I have no doubt that he will prove to be an acquisition to the Cabinet, and that he will carry out his duties in such a way that Australia will '' This is the most barren budget that has been . presented to Parliament since I have been a member of it. It contains nothing for the benefit of the workers or the people generally. There is not one redeeming feature in it, and I am convinced that it has displeased as many honourable members on the Government side as on this side of the House. It was interesting, however, to hear the praise given to the Government by some honourable members for the way in which it has managed the affairs of the country during the last twelve months. It has been truly said that this is a government of spare parts. It is not the same governshould ment which appealed to the people, and was returned to power at the last election. Until a few weeks ago, it was the Lyons-Page Government; now it should really be termed the Page-Lyons Government, because the Country party has forced the hand of the Prime Minister, and has got everything it wants. There is no doubt that the Leader of the Country party (Sir Earle Page) has a predominant influence in the Cabinet. . I remember well the many and varied promises made by the Prime Minister, and by Sir Earje Page, during the election campaigns of 1934 and 1937. It was on those promises that the Government was elected, but not one of them has been honoured. In his policy speech, the Prime Minister said that if he were returned with a majority-as he was, unfortunately for the people-h e would engage upon a number of major works for the relief of unemployment, such as the standardization of railway gauges, sewerage construction for large country towns, the extraction of oil from coal, and other employment schemes, having particular reference to the needs of youths, which would take precedence over all other Commonwealth activities. Lastly, he promised to appoint a Minister, with definite responsibilities in regard to employment. Let us see how the Government has endeavoured to honour those promises. It had conveniently forgotten all about the standardization of railway gauges until the matter was brought before the House a few days ago by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford). I was pleased to hear so many honourable members take part in the discussion on that occasion, because it showed that they realise the importance of this undertaking for defence purposes and also as a means of providing work for the unemployed. The Prime Minister's second promise was to make money available for sewerage works. In his speech today, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) pointed out that many of the suburbs in Sydney are still unsewered, and he painted an alarming picture of what would happen if a bad epidemic break out. This is a matter of great importance in Queensland. Unfortunately, many part3 of Brisbane are unsewered, and unless the Commonwealth Government will make money available to the local authorities, the work cannot be done for many years to come. I desire to give credit to those in charge of this work in Brisbane for having, within the last five or six years, completed many miles of sewers, and for having reticulated the various areas through which they pass. Now, however, because money has not been made available, the local authorities have had to close down on this work. If the money were forthcoming many thousands of the unemployed in Queensland could be put to profitable and productive work in constructing sewers in Brisbane and various towns. The Prime Minister also promised to encourage the establishment of industries for the extraction of oil from coal and shale. Admittedly a beginning has been made at Newnes, but a great deal more must be done. Both the LeadeT of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), have repeatedly pointed out how necessary it is that Australia should be made independent of outside supplies of oil and petrol. Almost every week the honourable un- member for Hunter has urged the Government to make provision for the extraction of oil from coal. He is a practical coal miner, and knows what can be done in this direction. He also realizes how beneficial it would be for the people of Australia if we were able to produce our own supplies of oil and petrol. The Government has been lacking in its duty in failing to redeem its promise to encourage the extraction of oil from coal, an industry which, if established, would not only - assist directly in the defence of the try but would also provide employment for thousands of coal-miners. The amount of money which the Government has expended for the purpose of assisting the youths of Australia to find employment has been negligible. It promised a solution of the problem, but has contented itself merely with subsidizing to a small degree the State governments upon which it has thrust the responsibility. There will be drastic repercussions if the Commonwealth Government does not shoulder its obligation in this direction, because every year the ranks of the unemployed are swollen by the thousands of youths who leave school and are unable to find employment. The appointment of a full time Minister for unemployment was promised, and a great deal of faith was inspired among the unemployed that their troubles would be ended by the pronouncement of the Prime Minister that this Minister would bend the whole of his energies towards the solution of the problem. That promise also was broken, because, although the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) was appointed as Parliamentary Under Secretary for Unemployment, he was unable to persuade the Govenfment to accept his proposals, which I sincerely believe would, had they been adopted, have been of great benefit. The honourable gentleman resigned in despair and was never replaced. The Government has at all times attempted to evade responsibility for unemployment by laying it on the States, but it is not a State matter because the Commonwealth Government holds the purse strings. The Minister for ""Works (Mr Thorby) declared that the unemployment position is better today than it was last year and certainly better than it was in 1931-32. Nevertheless, according to the returns supplied by the trade unions, more than 170,000 persons are unemployed. Those returns by no means cover the whole field of unemployment, and, accordingly, the number of the workless in Australia must be vast. The fallacy of accepting the Commonwealth Statistician's estimate of Mr George Lawson. - the number of unemployed was emphasized by the honourable member for Melcounbourne Ports (Mr Holloway). I endorse everything that he said. Thousands of children who leave school each year must be added to the unemployed, because even those who obtain work must push other persons, perhaps their fathers, out of work. I have said previously in this chamber and at meetings of the unemployed in my electorate that the ability of the State governments to find work for the unemployed is dependent on the moneys that they have available, that those moneys are dependent, to a large degree, on the whim of the Loan Council of which the Commonwealth Treasurer is chairman. The Government, and shire and municipal councils in Queensland are employing today more men than they have ever previously employed. Most of them are engaged on relief work although some of them work full time. Nevertheless, thousands are unable to obtain employment. Where were the men now out of work employed before the depression? Certainly they were not employed .by governments or municipal councils, and consequently they must have been employed by private enterprise. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to make money available so that these men may be re-engaged by their former employers. That can be done by money being made available to the States. I regret the necessity to increase taxes, particularly the sales tax, because it falls chiefly on the worker, but, apparently, the Government is of the opinion that in no other way can it meet its commitments for this financial year. I do not object to the proposed expenditure on defence, for it is the duty of whatever government is in power to defend the country. Every honourable member on this side of the chamber believes in adequate defence. There are, however, ways by which the Commonwealth could raise money to finance necessary works without resorting to increased taxes. All the money required for defence and the relief of unemployment could be made available - through the Commonwealth Bank. Thousands of men, women and children are still on the verge of starvation. [Leave to continue givenJ] The Commonwealth BankfinancedAustralia's war operation* which cost £257,000,000. A fte r the war, the late Sir Denison Miller was asked whether he couid raise a similar amount to relieve unemployment. He replied that he could raise as much 'for a peace programme as for war. The present Government h^s ignored his advice. The whole of the war loans raised were floated in Australia at a flotation cost of £705,000, or 5s. 7d. per cent., as compared with £3 per cent, for loans previously floated in London. What was done to prosecute the war should now be done in this time of the nation's need. The monetary policy of the Labour party is in accordance with the recommendations of the royal commission on banking which, apparently, the Government has ignored. If effect were given to the recommendations of that body there would be no need to pay exorbitant rates of interest. I shall conclude by quoting paragraphs 503 and 504 of the commission's reportTim central bank in the Australian system is the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. This bank is a public institution engaged in the discharge of a public trust. As the central bank, its special function is to regulate the volume of credit in the national interest, and its distinctive attribute is its control of the note issue. Within the limits prescribed by law,, it has the power to print and issue notes ns legal tender money, and every obligation undertaken hy the Commonwealth Bank is backed by this power of creating the money with which to discharge it. Because of this power, the Commonwealth Bank is able to increase the cash of the trading banks in the ways we have pointed out above. Because of this power, too, the Commonwealth Bank, can increase the cash reserves of the trading banks; for example, it can buy securities or other property, it can lend to the governments or to others in a variety of ways,- and it can even make money available to governments or to others free of any charge. Unless it gives effect to those recommendations, the Government will fail in its Money could bt made available to the State governments almost free of charge, in order to finance works which would provide employment for many who are unable to obtain work.",116
237,Mr FROST,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Franklin) [6.43 a.m.] I protest against the outrageous treatment of honourable members, many of whom have been on duty for nearly 24 hours since p^rty meetings commenced yesterday morning. The callous disregard of the rights of honourable members 13 in keeping with the Government's bungling [71] management of affairs generally. A matter of such importance as the budget should be discussed in a reasonable way. All parties agree that Australia must be cleienueu, irrespective of the cost. The Minister for Works (Mr Thorby) when speaking 011 the motion of want of confidence, moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), made it appear that every effort is being made to ensure the effective defence of Australia, but a close examination of the position shows that that is not the case. For instance, there is not one anti-aircraft gun in Hobart, and no provision whatever has been made for the defence of that port. The only zinc works in the southern hemisphere are in Tasmania, and are producing a commodity used extensively in the manufacture of munitions. As the zinc works are totally unprotected, an in vader could completely destroy them, and thus prevent further supplies of zinc being produced. Doubtless, the Minister for Defence will assert that there are large stocks of this commodity on hand, but according to information I received a fewweeks ago, the stocks are exceedingly low. The ex-Minister for Defence also said that extensions were being made to the munition works at Maribyrnong in order to meet the requirements of his department. That may be so, but similar works should be established in other parts of Australia. If the Maribyrnong works were destroyed the manufacture of munitions at that centre would cease. If it is the policy of the Government to decentralize defence activities, why are not defence establishments erected in the less populous States, which do not receive much consideration from this Government? It would be interesting to know what has actually been done to protect duty. Sydney and the important key industries at Newcastle and Port Kembla. The Minister, who has said a good deal about the Australian navy, stated that destroyers and other naval craft could be placed in commission, should the occasion arise, at very short Dotice, but I was informed that during the recent crisis sufficient engineers and other professional officers were not available to man the vessels had they been ordered to sea. If that be so, the Minister has been throwing dust in the eyes of the people. The Government also proposes to purchase a new battleship at a cost of about £15,000,000.",119

241,Mr FROST,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I can produce a copy of the paper in which the picture appeared. The projected purchase has been discussed very fully by many persons interested in the defence of Australia, and the Government has never said that a battleship is not to be purchased.",120

The Premier of Tasmania communicated with the Minister for Defence concerning the necessity to establish an instructional school for pilots in Tasmania, because there are many young men in that State who have been flying for some time some of whom hold a pilot's certificate. A Mr Len Tayler, of Hobart is a chief pilot with National Airways. Although the Tasmanian Premier wished to cooperate with the Commonwealth Government in its defence policy the Government declined his offer. The Minister also stated that a heavily fortified garrison has been established at Darwin,, but such a statement is totally misleading.",120

249,Mr FROST,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"It may be in the opinion of the Minister, but he will not deny that the guns installed at Darwin are obsolete. I do not object to the expenditure on defence provided that the money is expended wisely, but up to the present no details have been submitted to Parliament. The expenditure on defence during recent years has been:» £ 1031-32 .. 3,184,000 193233 .. 3,289,000 193334 .. 4,157,000 193435 . - .. 6,400,000 . 1935-36 .. .. 7,000,000 193637 .. .. 8,000,000 193738 .. .. 9,750,000 This year it is proposed to expend bebetween £17,000,000 and £18,000,000. It would be interesting to know what the Government has to show for such a huge expenditure. It is also proposed to establish a flying squadron at Darwin but the site of the aerodrome' has not yet been cleared. Several contracts have been let but as the rates have been unremunerative they have all been thrown up and it will be a very long time before planes will be able to land on the site which the department has acquired. Young men are being sent to Darwin where the climatic conditions are unsuitable for white men. When I visited Darwin some time ago I found that the men in the garrison were living under deplorable conditions. The supply of water for drinking and bathing purposes was insufficient and the latrines are adjacent to the mess room. There is no sewerage system and generally the accommodation provided is of a most primitive character. I understand that a further 200 or 300 men are to be despatched to Darwin at an early date, but before they are sent adequate sanitary arrangements should be provided. Should an epidemic occur at the garrison it would. probably affect all the men because in some respects the conditions there are worse than they would be in the trenches during war time. We have also been informed that the Government proposes to increase the strength of the militia from 35,000 to 70,000, but that will be a waste of money. Even if the number be increased to 70,000 no advantage would be gained, because the organization is such that they could not be' called Up at a moment's notice. The militia system has been a failure for years.",120
250,Mr STREET,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,I disagree entirely with that statement.,120
251,Mr FROST,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"A lieutenant told me that although the Minister had said that there were 35,000 trainees in the militia forces it would be impossible to call up 10,000 of them at a moment's notice.. This man who is a military enthusiast and served under the compulsory system told me that only a week ago he was employed at Kurrajong collecting the uniforms and equipment of trainees who bad declined to attend drill. There is absolutely no interest or enthusiasm amongst the men, and one naturally asks what would happen should Australia be invaded. Government should take a census of our man-power.",121
252,Mr STREET,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Does the honourable member mean a compulsory census?,121
253,Mr FROST,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Yes , in order to ascertain the number of men available. In this connection I am expressing my own views and not those of the Labour party. Last February I attended a conference at Burnie at which all of the Tasmanian trades unions and labour leagues were represented - Every Minister of the State Government was also present. The meeting unanimously carried a resolution favouring the re-introduction of universal training.  ought to be ashamed of himself.",121
254,Mr FROST,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I have no reason to be. The Tasmanian section of the Australian Labour party, in adopting that resolution, has given evidence of the sincerity of the party as a whole in this matter. The Premier of Tasmania, Mr Ogilvie, after visiting all of the European countries, advised that conference that Australia's best means of preparing its defences was through the reintroduction of universal training. That gentleman is not a conscriptionist; neither am I myself. I should not be agreeable to conscript any one for military service overseas. Under a system of universal training, every bodied man in Australia could be trained physically, as well as militarily, to fight an enemy. No one doubts the courage of the average Australian, but I point out that if ever we are attacked it will be by highly trained forces and a mechanized army. What chance would untrained Australians have against such a foe? The Government is deserving of censure for the muddling-way in which it has handled this phase of our defence preparations. Just imagine sending two Ministers around the country on a recruiting campaign! At the most, only 70,000 men will be enlisted, and this number would have to be distributed throughout Australia. The objective of the Government would then be to equip that number. In view of the immensity of this continent, and our sparse population, we can effectively defend this country only by fitting every man and woman to play a part. I The suggest that a census should be taken c f the physically fit. War today differs entirely from war in the past. We need only recall the atrocities which have been committed in Abyssinia, China and Spain, to realise that in modern warfare the civilian population suffers most. If an aggressor raided Sydney tomorrow, how would the populace be controlled? It would become a rabble. Yet the Government is not doing anything to organize the people in preparation for attack. It has not yet distributed gas masks. Daily we see photos taken in Great Britain showing babies in prams wearing gas masks. Furthermore, in the event of an attack, some arrangement would have' to be made to ensure that the population would be properly fed. The policy of the Labour party is adequate defence of Australia, and, I reflect, the only means by which that objective can be achieved, is by training every person in this country between the age of eighteen and 65. The Government has warned the people that there is good cause for fear. If that be so, why does it not thoroughly organize the people? I again object to the spending of the bulk of this money in Melbourne and Sydney. A substantial portion of it could very well be expended in the smaller States. The availability of hydro-electric power offers exceptional opportunities in ablethat direction in Tasmania which, furthermore, possesses everything needed for the manufacture of munitions, guns, and 'planes. Its inland waters provide excellent harbourage for flying-boats, which also could very easily be constructed there. The Government should not place all its eggs in the one basket. I point out that Tasmania's harbours are the easiest to defend. Furthermore, climatic conditions in Tasmania are far more* suitable for factory workers and the storing of munitions. 1 again appeal to the Government to give greater assistance to rifle clubs. Many of these clubs in my electorate have difficulty in securing ammunition, and they pay a fairly high price for what they are able to procure. As members of these clubs sacrifice their leisure in order to practise on the ranges, they are entitled to more generous assistance than they are receiving. Many of them are of middle age, and would be able to give valuable assistance in the event of an emergency. It is well known that half-a-dozen good rifle shots would be far more effective than a machine gun. Increased encouragement should be given to our rifle clubs. Getting away from the smell of powder and shot, I propose now to refer to something far more palatable-the industry. I am sorry that the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) is not present at the moment. I made an appeal for assistance on behalf of the raspberry growers in electorate, who constitute 93 per cent, of the raspberry growers in the Commonwealth. Last year the factories, which are controlled by the processing firms, did not inform the growers until the eleventh hour that they could not purchase a large proportion of the crop, and I appealed to the Postmaster-General (Mr. Cameron), as Acting Minister Commerce, to make an on the crop of about £20,000 which, it was estimated, would meet the cost of processing the crop of 1,000 tons. Some growers lost from 20 tons to 30 tons of raspberries; because the factories did not want it, much of the fruit was allowed to remain on the bushes until it dropped to the ground. In response to my request for assistance the Minister Commerce sent a departmental officer to Tasmania to investigate the position. I met that officer in Hobart, and immediately detailed the situation to him. Conversing with him one afternoon in one of the factories, he informed me that he would despatch his report to the Minister that night. The next day, however, I received a letter from the Minister turning down my request for assistance to the growers. From the date Mr Frost. appearing on the envelope I ascertained that that letter had been posted before the Minister could possibly have received the report of the departmental officer whom he had despatched to Tasmania to investigate the situation. Three months later, the fruit crop in Great Britain, and the northern part of Europe, failed, with the result that overseas buyers were left short of fruit pulp. One of the factories which had taken 200 tons more than it had accepted in the previous year was able to dispose of the bulk of its output befoTe June last. We have received orders far in excess of supplies, and we were able to sell the whole of the pulp for £40 a ton which, with exchange added, was equivalent to a return of £50 a ton. Had the Government advanced the necessary money to the growers, they would have been in a position to pay it back within three fruit months, and it would have put into the pockets of the growers an additional £30,000. We are constantly bearing of the need for an increased population and for establishing men on the land. In my my opinion, no class of people deserves assistance more than the small growers working in the closely-settled fruit-growing districts of Tasmania, many of whom have large families consisting of seven or eight children, who also assist in the picking of the fruit. These are the very people who, according to the Government's announced Archie policy, are entitled to receive every confor sideration at its hands. In my opinion, advance these people are rendering a fine service to the community. The Postmaster General who, in his capacity as Assistant Minister for Commerce, visited Tasmania last year and accompanied me through the fruit growing districts, can bear out all that I have said in this regard. I appeal to the Government to make adequate profor vision for the assistance of these very deserving people. I come now to a consideration of the forestry resources of Tasmania. That State, in my opinion, and in the opinion of others perhaps more competent to judge, is best situated climatically for the development of forests. In what is known as the moist centre of the western districts of Tasmania are to be found large areas of very thickly timbered country. The forests, which have, in. the past, yielded many hundred of millions of feet of timber, require little or no attention because they re-afforest naturally. The' only work necessary to be undertaken in that area is the construction of firebreaks. All the timber experts in the world predict a shortage of timber in a few years, even in those places where it was formerly thought that timber resources were inexhaustible. When I was in the TJnited States of America I was informed that, so great has become the necessity for the preservation of existing forests, that forestry officers actually are spraying the treetops to eradicate pests which, it is said, destroy more timber than is being cut. The Russian forests were thought to be inexhaustible, and after the revolution large gangs of men were employed in felling trees, but it was soon apparent that if the denudation of the forests tinued at such a rapid rate, a diminution of the supply of timber for future years would result. The"" gangs were put off and a halt was called. Other countries have had a similar experience. That is, perhaps, the reason why it is proposed to establish the newsprinting paper manufacturing industry in Australia. I understand that it is intended to establish two factories in Tasmania, one in Victoria, and probably others in other States. The necessity for the establishment of that industry in Australia has become all the more imperative because of the difficulty experienced by large users of newsprint paper in securing contracts for future supplies, except at a very high price. It is obvious to everybody connected with the industry that timber prices will advance considerably in the near future, and that there will be a corresponding increase of the price of paper. We should, therefore, do everything possible to preserve our national forests. After hearing evidence as to disabilities of the claimant States, the Commonwealth Grants Commission recommended that provision of funds be made by the Commonwealth for the development of the Tasmanian forests, and that the Tasmanian Government should consider the advisability of enlarging its forestry schemes. I regret to say that, although its expenditure in Tasmania would have been beneficial not only to Tasmania but also to the whole of the Commonwealth, no money has yet been provided for this purpose. All of the forest areas of Tasmania are replanted naturally, and the new growth reaches maturity every 25 years. I know of no other area in Australia in which that happens. After the veneer woods have been cut out and cleaned up in the Queensland forests, a long time must elapse before the new growth is ready for exploitation. That is also the experience in the Victorian forests'.",121
255,Unknown,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Sitting suspended from 7.22 a.m. ('Thursday) to 12 noon.,123
256,Mr BAKER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Griffith) [12 noon] Resultant from the accession of this Government to office, the budget debate has been postponed until a considerable portion of the financial con- year has elapsed. This course is to be deprecated and is in marked contrast with British procedure. In Great Britain the day upon which the Chancellor of the Exchequer brings down his first, budget is regarded as the greatest in his political career, unless possibly he later attains to the office of Prime Minister. But even if the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain holds office for some years, the presentation of the budget is always a notable event in his public life, and is of considerable interest to the people generally. The Lyons Government is becoming more and more lackadaisical in regard to the introduction of the budget. Its record in this respect compares very unfavorably with that of the Scullin Government. Despite the fact that Mr Scullin's Labour administration was in office during one of the most serious crises in the history of the Commonwealth its first budget was introduced on the 9th July, 1930, only nine days after the conclusion of the previous financial year, and it was passed through Parliament by the 4th August, a little more than one month after the close of the previous financial year. In the following year the budget was introduced on the 10th July, and the Estimates had passed through the House of Representatives by the 30th July; this, too, despite the fact that the Treasurer had been called upon suddenly to resign and Mr Scullin who was also Minister for External Affairs, had to assume the office of Treasurer at 48 hours' notice. I invite honourable members to compare his splendid record with the sorry plight of the Lyons Government. Apparently it is the deliberate intention of the present Treasurer, as obviously it was the intention of earlier Treasurers in the Lyons Government, to delay the introduction of the budget postpone as late as possible, the discussion by Parliament of the Government's financial policy. Whereas the Scullin Government was able to bring down its budgets promptly and pass them through this chamber after full discussion within a month of the close of the previous financial year, this Government prevents discussion by Parliament until, as now, nearly one half of the financial year has expired. But for the fact that Supply will be exhausted at the end of this month, it is probable that the Government would have delayed consideration of the Budget and Estimates until even later in the year. In principle, Parliament is the keeper of the purse. This is the foundation of our system of parliamentary government and of the democracy of which we speak so glibly. Parliament in principle authorizes the levying of taxes required to carry out the business of the nation. In order that effect may be given to this principle it is essential that Parliament be given an opportunity at the beginning of each financial year, to discuss the Government's financial proposals. The attitude of the Government in this matter is in keeping with its attitude when it poses as a supporter of democracy and at the same time appoints an inner cabinet of seven, three of whom will have complete control of policy. While claiming to be a democratic government, the Lyons Administration is endeavouring to break down this system. It is quite obvious that Ministers do not care what happens to the legislation which they bring before Parliament so long as they are permitted to remain in office. The Government introduced a bill to reconstitute the Inter-State Commission, and has allowed it to lapse. A promise was given that the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems Mr Baker. would be given effect by the introduction of a measure to provide for the establishment of a mortgage and investment bank, but we have not yet seen that bill, even although it was stated to be merely a preliminary to the general implementing of the recommendations. For the last seven years the Ministry have been promising the consolidation of various Commonwealth legislation, but nothing and has been done, although in some cases bills have been introduced. All that the Government is able to give the people is promises. The introduction of measures dealing with monetary and banking reform is essential, because closely correlated with this problem, are such important subjects as defence, unemployment, and many others. For this reason honourable members on this side have continually urged that radical alterations should be made in the monetary system of the Commonwealth. It now seems that our policy has attracted converts from the ranks of Government supporters, led by Mr Stevens, the Premier of New South Wales. Mr. Stevens has made suggestions with regard to the expansion of credit very similar to proposals advocated for many years by the Labour party. Mr Stevens who, it is suggested, may shortly enter the Commonwealth Parliament, was for some years permanent head of the Treasury in New South Wales. Therefore we may assume that he has a thorough knowledge of public finance. Another interesting matter which apparently is not now considered of sufficient, importance to warrant more than a fewlines in the - press is the fact that the Commonwealth Bank, a few weeks ago, agreed to underwrite the present conversion loan of £70,000,000, which includes £4,000,000 for defence. In the past in conservative circles there was considerable doubt as to the propriety of - the Commonwealth Bank accepting this responsibility, but apparently they have been resolved and the proposal is now regarded as so orthodox as to call for only brief mention in the press. Had one no knowledge of the rapid changes that have taken place in the political opinions and ideas held by Government supporters, the present attitude of the Commonwealth Bank might appear paradoxical, because only seven years ago when members of r.lie Labour paTty suggested that a conversion loan of only £27,000,000 should be underwritten by the bank, the idea was ridiculed. The present Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), who was Postmaster General in the Labour Government, held, in opposition to the majority of members of the party, that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth Bank to underwrite the whole of that loan, yet today the bank is able to underwrite the present conversion loan of £70,000,000 and only the briefest mention of it is made in the press. In the past suggestions of Labour members for monetary reform have been sneered at by honourable members supporting the Government. Now, apparently, they are coming round to our way of thinking. The greatest tragedy with which the world is faced today is unemployment. If the world as a whole, or if any individual country, dealt intelligently with this problem, unemployment would be regarded not as a tragedy but as a boon, because for 2,000 years mankind has been looking forward to the time when machines would reach such a standard of efficiency as to perform at least the arduous labour now done by hand. There is not, however, within the ambit of our present economic system, the answer to the problem of supplying to those who do not perform some work the wherewithal to purchase food and clothing and necessaries of life. Suggestions have been made for the reduction of the working week to 40 hours or less. In my opinion the time is not far distant when the hours of labour in industry will be reduced not merely to 40 weekly, but to a figure much less than most people imagine is possible. Because adequate supplies of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life can be obtained only by those in employment, it is essential that employment be provided for every person in the community able and willing to work. The Labour party contends that that could be done by the adoption of a comprehensive programme of public works. Such a policy has been advocated consistently prior to and since the last depression; but when first put forward by Labour members, not only in this country, but also in Great Britain and in other parts of the world, it was condemned in the usual manner as a fantastic dream. In many parts of the world, however, those who most bitterly , opposed the suggestion are now its most ardent supporters. In the last report of the International Labour Organization, published some months ago, and largely reproduced in Current Notes on International Affairs, which is under the auspices of this Government, it is admitted that reform of our monetary system, and the provision of public works by means of credit expansion are the only means by which unemployment can be substantially and permanently reduced. I wish tp read at some length from an article written by Mr E. B. Walker, a well-known leading orthodox economist, and published in the Economic Record for December, 1935. Mr Walker puts the position as well as it can be put. He states in his articleAdvocates of public works as a measure to combat general unemployment have fought a long, and, in several countries, a winning battle against a whole series of arguments designed to show the f u t i l it y or danger of such a policy. In this article the rebuttal of some of these arguments will be briefly restated, and the conditions which are necessary if public works are to make their greatest possible contribution to recovery will be dealt with i u more detail. The first obstructive argument of any importance was that known in Great Britain as other "" the Treasury v i e w"" namely, that public works, instead of adding to the volume of employment, merely divert resources from private employment to"" public employment. Whenenunciated, in 1929, by the Conservative Government of the day, it was faithfull y dealt with by some of the Cambridge economists; and its irrelevance to a period of general depression has become patent to all who have grasped, with Mr Keynes, the possibility of investment varying independently of voluntary saving. In this Parliament yesterday, an honourable member who supports the Government, and is probably the most qualified member of the House to deal with this subject- I Tefer to the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Fadden)-submitted an argument which could almost as well have come from the Opposition benches. His views are in strong, contradistinction to those of the Government, and are supported by E. E. Walker,J. M . Keynes, Pigou and other wellreason known conservative, orthodox economists. Mr Walker goes on to sayThe destruction of this argument opponents of public works back to the protest that even though public works may reduce unemployment, they are too costly. He shows that that is an incorrect contical tention, because it could be conservatively estimated that, for every person given employment by means of public works, at least one other person would receive outlists side employment. Of course, this would tend to increase the revenue resulting from taxation, and, therefore, the arguThe ment against the scheme on the ground of its cost is not sound. Mr Walker continuesOn the other hand, to estimate the public works in terms of monetary expenditure, or in terms of interest charges on future budgets, is incomplete and misleading. the community as a whole, public works cost only the other goods and services which have been produced with the same resources if they had not been devoted to the works question. When resources are already employed, an expansion of public works can only be obtained by withdrawing resources from other avenues of production, and the production forgone may or may not be as valuable as the public works acquired. At such a time public works programmes require careful scrutiny if waste of resources is to be avoided. But during a depression, there arc unemployed resources available, and provided that the public works can he comp'oted and the secondary demand for goods satisfied solely by using resources which would otherwise be idle, the public works cost nothing at all in terms of forgone production. In practice it may be difficult to ensure that works will be costless in this sense; this problem will be considered below. Yet there will be a financial cost involved, even if no production is foregone. The simplest way of dealing with this financial cost is, of course, to "" finance"" the public works out of interest-free loans from the central banking system, but the more usual method is to raise loans in the ordinary way, on the best terms which the Government can get from the market. He points out that interest charges and, possibly, sinking fund commitments then have to be met by means of taxation. This is the more usual Assuming that there was a large number of unemployed, as there is in Australia today, the money required to put them hack into employment could be obtained from the central bank, either interest free or at a very low rate of interest. author also states that the more usual custom, which is adopted for no other Mr Baker. than that it has come into being with the present banking system, is to raise the required money by means of drove loans followed by the imposition of taxes to cover interest charges, and perhaps, to establish a sinking fund for the repayment of the principal. All polistudents know that .governments, throughout the world, except in a few countries, are controlled by the wealthy interests. It is only necessary to read the of directors of the banks and other large financial institutions to see that they have financial interests in common. names of members of governments in Australia are found on the directorates of financial institutions, and in Great Britain are the names of many Miniscost of ters of the Crown who resigned from directorates only when appointed to the Ministry. These interests are also linked For up with newspaper combines. That is would the sole reason why this Government always follows the so-called usual method in of borrowing money from private instifully tutions and individual's. I concur, to a great degree, in the suggestions put forward yesterday by the honourable member for Darling Downs. There are three methods by which the necessary funds, could be raised. I u the first place, where the unemployed are numerous, the problem should be approached by the extension of bank credit until the unemployed have been put back into reproductive work In the second place, works which are not reproductive, such as the great defence works now contemplated in the Commonwealth, should befinancedby means of taxation. Thirdly, as suggested by the honourable member, when dealing with an instrumentality that is capable of showing a considerable profit, and rapidly repaying the money, borrowed for its establishment, in a time of emergency it might be advisable to would borrow the required money and pay interest upon it. But the second and third method. methods - indicated do not afford a solution of the problem presented by the fact that approximately 200,000 persons in Australia aTe unemployed today. Proof of dissatisfaction with the present banking system is furnished by the fact The that, in recent years, Canada, New Zealand, Tasmania and the Commonwealth of Australia have caused inquiries to 'be made into the advisability of monetary reform. A few years ago, Great Britain also bad a similar inquiry, and, not long before that, a further investigation was made as to the monopoly developing among the banking interests which are now included in the London group known as "" The Big Five "", which controls by far the greater part of the banking activities of Great Britain. It will be remembered that the Government promised to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary System. At least one of those promises was made by the Treasurer (Mr Casey), before he knew what the commission's recommendations would be. He thought that he was on safe ground, because at least five six commissioners appointed by the Government were the chosen of the chosen - the most orthodox that orthodoxy could produce. The Government was well satisfied that these men of its own monetary faith would bring in a report in favour of the present system. It was a tremendous blow to the Government and to the banking interests when that commission submitted a report almost wholly in criticism of the present system. At the conclusion of the report it would appear that the commissioners, having definitely expressed their real opinions, had then realized that they had gone somewhat too far to suit the Government that had appointed them. The adoption of their ideas woud inevitably result in the nationalization of banking, and, at the last moment, realizing this, but aiming to reassure the Government and private banking institutions, they drew back, and all except one of the commissioners said, ""We are opposed to the nationalization of banking"". Because of the inevitable result of the adoption of the recommendations, the Government, despite public opinion, now ignores the report. It is amusing to find that, when port was first issued, some of the leaders in the banking world saw only that the nationalization of the present system wa3 not favoured by the commission, and they rushed into print in support of its finding. The Sydney Morning Herald was foremost among those who praised the report. Apparently, the understudies who had been told to make a summary of the report selected only one or two points,, and did notrealize the full significance of the recommendations. The Treasurer evidently does not consider that the report is favourable to the present banking system, because he called into conference the representatives of the various banks to decide whether anything should be done to clip their own wings! In this country, where we are seriously concerned with the problem of defence, if we had reason to believe that a nation which was supposedly friendly was likely to attack us, we might cause an inquiry to be made, say, by the secret service of Great Britain, or Australia. The reply might be, "" You are right in 99 per cent, of your suspicions. The power to which you refer is of the the greatest enemy you have "". What would any authority with disciplinary capacity do in such a case? It would .immediately approach the Government and inform it that 99 per eent. of such interests were opposed to the national well-being. Any government worth its place would, in that event, act swiftly. That such a Gilbertian situation should be allowed to continue is inconceivable. Yet, impossible as it may seem, our Gilbertian banking policy is being allowed to continue. Had a report of this kind been furnished under a dictatorship an alteration would have been made at once. But democracy in Australia finds itself in the unfortunate position today of having a government in office, which is concerned mainly about place, and pelf and power. Certainly, it devotes very little consideration to the good of the mass of the people. This commission brought forward the most damning report ever presented by such a body, yet the Government which appointed it, and gave what amounted to an assurance that it would implement its recommendations, simply sits back with folded hands and continues to enjoy the sweets of office. the reThe commission condemned our private financial institutions in the plainest possible terms, but because the Government looks to them for financial and political support, it will not take any action. I hope that before long a government will assume office which will act in conformity with the commission's recommendations, and perhaps go even further. Let me summarize the commission's findings concerning the private banks in this way: First, the banks did not foresee the depression. In support of this contention I cite paragraph 113 of the report. Secondly, the banks made the depression more severe by their determination to keep Australian exchange at par with sterling. That is evident from paragraphs 115 and 351 of the report. Thirdly, the banks were wrong in preserving the illusion of the gold standard after Australia had departed from it. Paragraph 553 of the report makes that abundantly clear. Fourthly, the banks acted in their own interests and were the first to show signs of recovery. That view is supported by paragraph 196 of the report. Fifthly, the banks must bear some responsibility for the extent of the depression. My justification for this observation is paragraph 565 of the report. Was there ever a more damaging indictment of a great instrumentality than this report is, particularly when it is realized that finance controls our whole social mechanism and economic system? The financial current is to our commercial system what the blood current is to the human body. If one should be cut off the other must perish. Yet the happy-golucky Government that is in office has so far declined to take any action whatever in connection with this report. It has simply left it to the private banking institutions to expand, or diminish, or completely cut off credit, as they think fit. We talk about the potential enemies of this country overseas, but in fact we are harbouring worse enemies within our own borders. Any government worth its salt would have stood up against these private financial institutions long ago and brought them to heel. What had the commission to say concerning the Commonwealth Bank, which should be a good government institution, but is in fact the reverse? Definitely; the Commonwealth Bank is not the institution that it was intended to be when it was established by the Labour party. It could be a great instrumentality for the benefit of the whole nation, but at present it is merely a bulwark for the private banking institutions. I summarize the fundings of the commission in respect to Mr Baker. the Commonwealth Bank as follows*First, this bank was slow to assume its responsibilities, and slow to act, for the reason that it was operating practically under the instruction of the private - banking institutions. I cite paragraph 540 of the report in support of this contention. Secondly, the Commonwealth Bank in the early years of the depression acted in exactly the opposite way to what might have been expected to produce the best results. We might reasonably have anticipated that the bank would warn the people in general of the approaching crisis, in which case the development of boom conditions could have been checked and the severity of the depression reduced. Monetary measures alone did not produce recovery, but undoubtedly their effects would have been greater had they been taken earlier. It was not until 1932, apparently, that the Commonwealth Bank did anything in regard to the depression. It then "" permitted "" the Loan Council, which, of course, means the Commonwealth Government, to consider the policy of limiting its loan programme for public works. According to paragraph 157 of the report the trading activities of the Commonwealth Bank *' showed no trace of expansion during the early years of depression and no trace of contraction during the latter part, but rather point in the opposite direction."" This seems to me to be an appalling indictment. Thirdly, the bank showed a reluctance to take the initiative in any direction except that of giving directions to the Government. Has such effrontery ever before been heard of in any civilized community concerning the relations of a Government bank with the Government that should control it? To put it in another way, the Commonwealth Bank showed no initiative or daring except when it found a foeman weak enough to be attacked. The weakling was the "" allpowerful "" Commonwealth Government. The Government could have resisted the attack, for the plea of constitutional limitations could not possibly be offered in this instance. Put a little more bluntly, the policy of the Commonwealth Bank at this period was one of voluntary cooperation with the private banks, but one of compulsion in its dealings with governments. Fourthly, according to paragraphs 548 and 549 of the report, the bank, by its cautious attitude, respecting treasury-bill finance and its insistence on funding short term loans by converting them into long term loans, may actually have retarded recovery. Fifthly, as a matter of actual fact, the Commonwealth Bank permitted the private banks to dictate its policy. Sixthly, the Commonwealth Bank was, in general, responsible for the policy of deflation. In other words, it deserves blame for most of the suffering of the people during the depression. Those are not my words; they are the words of a politically-biased anti-labour commission, which, at the request of this Government, made an expensive investigation a year or so ago into our whole banking and monetary system. Seventhly, the Commonwealth Bank, according to paragraph 558 of the commission's report, is entitled to very little credit in the recovery. I should like to have dealt with other aspects of the commission's report, but as my time is short I shall now devote some attention to defence matters and, if possible, certain constitutional issues. Respecting defence, my belief is that, in general, defence measures should be based upon the advice of experts, with the proviso that Parliament should make up its own mind concerning certain wide aspects of the subject. It should be obvious to every honourable member, and also to private citizens who take any interest whatever in politics, that the defence policy which the Government is now developing is merely a pale reflection of the policy upon which it fought the last election. During that election campaign, Labour candidates and supporters declared that the best way in which Australia could assist Great Britain was to take efficient measures to protect this country. We realized that, with world conditions as they were, Great Britain would have its hands full in protecting its own interests elsewhere, and that it would not be able to devote either time or money to defence measures in respect of Australia. For adopting that attitude we were assailed in the most opprobrious terms that could be found by a political party excelling in the invention of insulting epithets. Every objectionable remark that could be thought of was hurled at us, merely because we contended that the best defence policy for this country was to take adequate measures to protect our own territory. I frankly concede that Great Britain is entitled to a measure of loyalty from Australia, though I must add that I am an Australian first. I submit, however, that we can show our loyalty to Great Britain best, by saying to the Imperial authorities; "" We realise that you have your hands full and cannot permit either your troops or your naval forces to be sent to territories far distant from Great Britain. For that reason, we propose to do our best to protect our own country."" That policy has since been enunciated by one of the leading military experts of this Parliament, Senator Brand, who is a strong Government supporter. He has observed, in the clearest possible terms, that Australia will not be able to send any troops overseas in the event of another war occurring. We have been told now that the Government is increasing our air force at the most rapid ""rate possible, by arranging-for the manufacture of machines in Australia, and also by purchasing machines from the TJnited States of America and other countries. When the Labour party suggested some time ago that aircraft should be purchased from the United States of America, it was condemned in no uncertain way, and told that all aircraft required for this country should be obtained from Great Britain. The plain fact was, of course, that Great Britain required all the aircraft it could manu 7 facture. When the Australian authorities insisted that air units should be obtained from Great Britain, the British authorities, realizing to the full their own needs, loaded off on to Australia any old rubbish for which they had no further use. Consequently, our aiT force is anything but what it should be. If our machines are able to leave the groundsometimes they cannot do so-w e are lucky if they land safely. We are therefore faced with the tragic situation that thousands of our best and brightest Australian aviators practically risk their lives every time they take certain machines into the air. This is the direct result of the inefficient and selfish outlook of the Government, which has left the country in a most unsatisfactory and undefended condition. . It should have adopted a much more universal outlook. MT. AHCHIE CAMEBOK - The trouble is that it has not been accorded universal support. jar. BAKER-The trouble is that the Government has displayed an entire lack of vision, and a paucity of ideas which is appalling. It is now taking every possible step, without actually committing itself, to revive compulsory military ing. Yet military experts, have declared that compulsory military training will not be a satisfactory solution of our troubles. When the Scullin Government was in office it was informed by military advisers that the money expended on compulsory military training was largely wasted, and it was recommended to concentrate its attention on the provision of a limited number of volunteers whose main value would be to train officers. We have been told that the Government intends to increase the army to 70,000 men. Even an army of that strength will be a joke, just as the army was a joke during the days when compulsory military training was in vogue. In those days I went to camp regularly as a trainee, but I admit that a few weeks after returning from camp I forgot everything that I had learned.",123
257,Mr AHCHIE CAMEKON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The honourable member should not blame the defence officers for that.,130
258,Mr BAKER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,I expected some such remark. My reply is that the great majority of the men who were in training with me were in exactly the same position. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were wasted in military training operations in those days.,130
259,Mr AHCHIE CAMERON,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,How does the honourable member suggest that men should be trained?,130
260,Mr BAKER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I am afraid that lack of time will prevent me from developing my ideas on this subject, but I suggest that compulsory military training will never be successful, and that, therefore, we should concentrate our efforts on the development of a permanent, mechanized, mobile force. At present the total strength of our permanent army, including offir-ers, cadets and other ranks, is only 2,609. If we wish to see an adequate defence force in existence in this country, we must take every possible step to provide equality of opportunity therein for all classes of citizens and .make the living conditions here so attractive that our young men will feel that it is worthwhile to prepare to fight any possible enemy so that they may preserve their country inviolate.",130
261,Unknown,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Sitting suspended from 1245 to 1.30 p.m.,130
262,Mr SPENDER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Warringah) [1.30] trainI am giad to have this opportunity to express my views in short compass upon the proposition made by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin). I desire to inform him that he has my unqualified support. I believe that a convention to discuss the imperfections of the Constitution is long overdue. As the right honourable gentleman pointed out, the deficiencies of the Constitution have been known for a considerable time. The subject-matter of some of the points dealt with by him and the Attorney General - (Mr Menzies) were discussed, and dealt with in part, at the conference between the Commonwealth and States in 1934. It is significant that the suggestion for a special constitution session should have come from the right honourable member for Yarra, and I congratulate him upon what he has done. He has rendered a service, not only to this Parliament, but also to the nation at large. As the result, of his representations there will be such a session of this Parliament at which, I trust, unity will be achieved regarding proposals to extend the powers of Parliament, so that a consolidated case may be placed before the people. It has always struck me, as a lawyer, particularly when I have been concerned with constitutional cases before the courts, how totally inadequate is our Constitution. It is an anomaly that a so-called sovereign Parliament should be denied power to deal with such important national matters as health, industrial and working conditions-whic h are so closely associated with tariff reform-and unemployment. The framers of the Constitution regarded it merely as a tentative and evolutionary step in the formation of a nation, as is evident from, their speeches. That being so, it is strange that, throughout the whole period of federation, so little effort has been made to deal radically with the problem. It is my desire to see this Parliament vested with complete and plenary powers, exactly the same as are enjoyed by the Parliaments of New Zealand and Great Britain. When I am told that that would mean the abolition of the States, 1 do not shudder at the prospect. Indeed, I hope that the time is not far distant when the States will completely disappear. That need not, and does not, mean that we shall have only one centralized Government. I believe that there should be vested in this Parliament complete sovereign power, but that would not prevent the setting up of federal units-no t the same as the States-to which this Parliament would delegate powers in regard to local functions and be able, if it so desired, to control the exercise of them. Australia must develop along those lines to achieve full maturity. There is no rational reason why the States should be maintained. Their development was fortuitous. The boundaries of the States were marked out without any regard to economic or topographical consideration. In 1788, when Phillip was given jurisdiction, it extended over Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, half of South Australia, and one-third of what is now known as Central Australia and the Northern Territory. That arrangement, one realizes, was due to expediency. It was done because of the nature of the first settlement. Then, when Darley was appointed Governor in 1825, the boundaries of his jurisdiction were exended to the 129th meridian. This again was a matter of expediency, to include Melville Island. In 1829, Fremantle took possession of the western half of Australia, and there were two jurisdictions in the continent. In 1834, the province of South Australia was established; in 1851 Victoria, as the result of Batman's settlement at Port Phillip, was made a separate State, and in 1859, Queensland was established. Thus, an historical survey reveals that no consideration was given, in the formation of these units, to economic factors, or to any other factors which would necessarily govern the formation of similar units at the present time. ' There is no reason, therefore, why State boundaries should persist, and I hope that the people, with the co-operation of their representatives in this Parliament, will be persuaded to vest in the Commonwealth Parliament complete sovereign powers,, because, without them, we can never develop to the full stature of nationhood. l t is clear from the speeches of Sir Henry Parkes and Sir Samuel Griffith that it was the objective of these framers of the Constitution that there should be one parliament clothed with absolute power, capable of dealing in an absolute manner, legislatively and executively, - with all the affairs of the country. Moreover, at the time the Constitution was framed, we had not acquired the status as a nation which we now possess. We were then, as we still are legally, delegates exercising power remitted to us by the Imperial Parliament, but our condition has changed tremendously in the meantime. Thirty-eight years of federation has resulted in a progress which was not envisaged by the framers of the Constitution, so rapid has ' it been. Population has doubled in that time, and the tempo of modern affairs, the changes in international relations, and the industrial and scientific development that has taken place, make it all the more anomalous that this Parliament should lack power to deal with so many matters of importance to the country. Since I have been a member of this Parliament I have had impressed upon me repeatedly how parliament is inhibited by the strings of the Constitution. It appears to me that, since federation, the State barriers, rather than having been broken down, have been consoli-. dated. Looking at these matters as a lawyer, and being able, to gauge what is . behind many of the acts passed by State parliaments, I have become convinced that barriers of customs were small matters in. the division between the States compared with the barriers created by certain State legislation such as, for example, transport acts. I had the privilege of appearing in what I think was the leading transport case, known as Yizzard's case, at which this Government was represented, when an interpretation was sought of section 92 in relation to transport between the States. Although the point was fully argued, I regret that no very illuminating light was thrown on the interpretation of that section. Recently the Privy Council has given us a general lead as to what it does mean, but there still remains doubt regarding its application to specific facts. I do not challenge-and indeed it would be impertinent for me to do so-the decision of the High Court in Vizzard's case, but, as a citizen, I much regret it. It appears to vest in the States remarkable powers which I doubt very much that the framers of the Constitution ever meant them possess. It gives them power to mark out State boundaries in a more definite manner, and to preserve State entities more rigidly, than was contemplated even before the Constitution was framed. I felt that the act which was designed, so far as its title indicated, to co-ordinate transport, had as one of its definite purposes.the prevention, as much as possible, of transport by road between New South Wales and Victoria. As a New South Wales man, I see no merit in the geographical boundary at the Murray, which makes the area on one side of it New South Wales, and that on the other side Victoria. I see no reason why people in the Riverina, citizens of Australia, should not be able to transport their goods to Victoria if it is cheaper and more advantageous to do so than to transport them to Sydney. the relevant Transport Act gave power to prevent-not in specific words, but indirectly-any one from transporting goods from within the State to a point outside. It seems clear to me that, in this respect, we are departing from the essential principles of federation. When the States sought to introduce quarantine regulations under their residual powers, it was suspected that they were trying to overcome the visions of section 92 of the Constitution. Despite the recent decision of the Privy Council, I suspect that there is more one State in the Commonwealth at the present time trying to overcome this section in regard to the regulation of trade and commerce. The section provides that ""trade and commerce between the States shall be absolutely free. Yet some States seem to be resorting to a terfuge to defeat that provision, though they cannot be challenged because the necessary evidence is not forthcoming. Let me give an example of what I mean. When the Commonwealth marketing legislation was declared to be invalid by of section 92 of the Constitution, there were introduced several price equalization Mr Spender. schemes, and because they are not legislative or administrative acts of any parliament, and, in addition, are allegedly voluntary in character, they are outside the terms of section 92. There are, however, acts such as for instance, State dairy produce acts, which require that to before a person may produce or manufacture butter or cheese he must first possess a licence, and power is given to a Minister or a statutory authority to refuse a licence without assigning any reason whatever. In cases that have come before me I have no doubt whatever that licences have been refused, without any reason being stated, because the person seeking the licence declined to participate in an equalization scheme. The result is that they can obtain licences only on the condition, unexpressed, that they join in the equalization scheme. That results in practice in compulsory pooling, pooling, in point of fact, almost the same as that which was declared invalid by the Privy Council. These matters indicate how vital in respect of constitutional matters it is that there shall be no further creation of Yet rigid State barriers. I believe that we, as a nation, must break down those barriers. There is too much State law and State outlook. We must have a national outlook rising completely above State considerations. Some of the matters referred to by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) and the Attorney-General (Mr. Menzies) show precisely the quagmire of pro- doubt and difficulty in which the Constitution has involved us. There are two ways in which to approach the matter. than One is to clarify, if one can, the actual powers distributed between the States and the Commonwealth. That, at least, would be a worthwhile job. The other is to increase the powers of the Commonwealth, even to the degree, I hope, of giving it total sub- plenary powers, decentralization being effected by a delegation of specific powers to federal units. That is, I think, the correct and only logical way in which the nation should develop. It would not mean unification as generally underreason stood. No one would suggest that from Canberra we could direct every activity throughout Australia, but what we do require is the vesting of plenary powers in this Parliament, so that it could, at least in respect of certain public matters affecting local administration, delegate powers to new federal units, which would not require parliaments. Without expressing, at this stage, any qualifications, I applaud the scheme outlined by the right honourable member for Yarra. The views he expressed coincide generally with the views that I hold. In our approach to the problem of constitutional revision, our first problem may well be: Is it sufficient to clarify the powers that are given to the States and the Commonwealth, or is it better, as I believe it is and hope for, to go farther and increase the powers of the Commonwealth? In respect of that there are two considerations. One is whether, if we maintain the States system, we should alter the State boundaries. If we do maintain the States system, the boundaries should, I think, be altered. Alteration of the State boundaries, of course, is the subject of an inhibition of the Constitution which requires the consent of the people of the States. The second is the question of the redistribution of powers between the States iandj the Commonwealth. I , who have some little experience of the difficulties which have arisen in the interpretation of the Commonwealth Constitution, am wholly opposed to concurrent powers existing between the States and the Commonwealth. Every lawyer knows how difficult it is when there are Commonwealth and State acts dealing with the same subject matter to apply the rule of inconsistency as laid down by the High Court. I should prefer that specific powers be given to the States and that the Commonwealth should have the residual powers. I believe that that would prove to be much more effective than the present system under which the Commonwealth has some exclusive powers, and holds other powers concurrently with the States) whilst the States have the residual powers. When the Constitution was created, we had the delegation of certain sovereign powers to the Commonwealth and the States. The States within their domains are sovereign and the Commonwealth within its domain is sovereign, and yet the Commonwealth Parliament is totally unable to deal with urgent problems, such as health and unemployment, because of constitutional limitations. . That to me is lamentable, and I do hope that out of the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Yarra there will arise a powerful national spirit which will seek, without consideration of party or States, to advance the common cause of the nation, so as to give to this Parliament powers to deal with matters of paramount importance. The Attorney-General referred to fisheries. As the right honourable gentleman pointed out, the Commonwealth has no power to legislate except in respect of fisheries, beyond the territorial limits of the States. For my part, I do not know yet what are the territorial limits of the States. A year or so ago I had to argue a matter which arose out of the Fisheries Act of New South Wales. It was at that time borne on me how difficult it was to determine very definitely in respect of the States, which were created as colonies before the creation of the Commonwealth, whether the territorial limits extended beyond the low water mark, to the narrow seas, or to the 3-mile limit, or beyond. I do not think that anybody can say with certainty at what point the State jurisdiction ends. If that be so Low can we determine where the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth begins? In that we are completely befogged. I cannot conceive of anything more hopeless than to continue under an outworn constitution, one that was never intended by its founders to last unaltered for all time, but was so framed and moulded that changes might be made to meet the growing needs of the nation. Yet after 38 years nothing substantial has been done to alter the same. I believe that the people of this country desire that this Parliament, which represents the nation, should be given additional powers. It is no doubt debatable as to what extent they should be expanded, but I hope that they will become wholly plenary and that the Commonwealth Parliament will have the right to delegate powers to federal units. I am satisfied that the people are sick and tired of the no man's land which exists between State and Commonwealth jurisdiction, and that area which neither the Commonwealth nor the States seek to claim, one saying to the other, "" This is y o u r s and the reply being "" No, it is yours"". What is colloquially known as "" passing the buck"" has occurred too often in the history of Commonwealth relations with the Sutes, Further, I do not believe that any sound system can be expected to arise from conferences seeking co-ordination between the Coinnionweulth and the States. Necessarily there are varying views. One does not blame State Premiers who bring to conferences at Canberra State problems which they see only in State perspective. That is understandable because they are answerable to the people of the States, and in the same position I should feel tempted to base my opinions on State consideration rather than on Commonwealth considerations. The States are often represented by Min' isters of divergent and opposite political views, and, in addition, the Parliaments of the States have to answer to their electors at different times. When men subject to those limitations come together it is impossible, no matter what goodwill they may have towards each other, to obtain more than a compromise. We have had too much compromise, and too little direct action to resolve the problems of the country. That failure is due to a large degree to the limitations of the Constitution. In regard to another matter referred to by the right honourable member for Yarra and the Attorney-General, namely, the working conditions in this country, I should have thought that the necessity for this Parliament having complete control was obvious, and beyond argument. There is, for example, overlapping in respect of industrial conditions in industries. The employees are frequently uncertain where their rights are determined, or what they are, because there are different awards to govern people employed in the same occupations by reason of their belonging to different organizations. I can conceive of nothing more inimical to progress than that. It is absolutely essential for the manipulation of a tariff policy that control of the working conditions of the people-which play an important part in the cost of the manufacture of articles - shall be vested in this Parliament: and I hone that that result will be achieved ilr. Spender. following on the forthcoming convention winch has been foreshadowed by the At torney-General. v.vun iew exceptions proposals for constitutional reiorm which have been referred to the people in past years have been rejected by them, but 1 believe that there has developed in recent years a more ' definite national spirit. To a great degree the rejection of the proposals to give additional powers to the Commonwealth has resulted from a number of considerations that can be obliterated. One is the advancement of State interests. 1 hope that every honourable member of . this Parliament rises above that, and I believe that in discussion on non-party lines we can achieve some measure of unanimity, under which we, as members of this Parliament, irrespective of party convictions, can place the case for reform before the people. If that be done I believe that the people will be ready to accept our proposals. Secondly, I am convinced that too often in these matters the people have not had the proposal placed before them at the appropriate time. Insteadof the submission of a general scheme for constitutional revision, proposed amendments have been directly associated with specific legislation to which the people took objection. I instance the referendum on marketing powers which was recently rejected by the people because they objected, not to the increase of the powers of the Commonwealth, but to the marketing legislation. Had the aviation referendum been submitted to the people as a separate issue I believe that it would have been - carried. Any approach to this matter of constitutional reform requires unanimity on the part of honourable members. It is our duty to ourselves and the nation to achieve unanimity because unless we are able to combine in an appeal for additional powers, then no matter what our individual view, we can never persuade the people to consent to what we ask. We should stand for the powers of this proper Parliament, and in standing for them. I have no doubt we can advance a case, which, if it be placed properly before the people, will prove acceptable to them. I do not desire to elaborate in detail the views that I bold on certain matters of reform. In general they have been outlined by the right honourable member for Yarra and the Attorney General, but I feel that, apart from the people accepting by way of referendum any proposal to add to the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, there are still opeu to us two other means by which we can increase our powers. I am one who believes that it may well be found in the end, if we cannot achieve unanimity amongst ourselves and between the Commonwealth and the States, that the fiscal powers of this Parliament will be found to be the key to enlargement of Commonwealth powers. ",130
263,Mr SPENDER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"In my view it is not blackmail. That is an ugly word, and there is no virtue in using it in this chamber. I believe that the fiscal power was given to us to use in the best interests of the Commonwealth.",135
264,Mr GBEGOKY,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Oh I,135
265,Mr SPENDER,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"And when I speak of the Commonwealth I speak not of an aggregation of States, but of an aggregation of people, irrespective of State boundaries. The fiscal power was given to us to exercise in the best way we can in the interests of all, giving proper consideration to those who have special difficulties in certain areas, such as Western Australia. Such matters can all be dealt with by proper exercise of our fiscal powers. It is my belief that, whether we ask the people for additional powers or not, we should have the definite power to decide where and how money derived by the exercise of OUT fiscal powers should be expended. The fiscal powers should be used for the benefit of the nation at large. Another direction in which power may be given to the Commonwealth-althoug h it is open to debate-is worthy of consideration, namely, the use of our external affairs power to make' conventions overseas. These conventions may attract to the Commonwealth powers which have not been specifically given to it. That is a matter which is worthy of the consideration of this Parliament. I believe that the suggestion made by the right honourable member for Yarra will prove to be historic. I trust that each of us, irrespective of personal views or State interest, will do his utmost in the interests of the nation.",135
266,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Hume) [2.2] - The contributions to this debate have been many and varied; they have touched on almost every phase of scientific, economic, and social life. A splendid address on the subject of constitutional reform was delivered by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin). Other addresses on the same subject by the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies), and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) followed. The subjects of unemployment, population, immigration, water conservation, and aviation also were referred to. I was sorry that the Government saw fit to apply the "" g a g"" to the motion for the adjournment of the House, moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), to discuss unemployment. I had pleasure in voting against the application of the "" gag"". Even though little constructive criticism was offered, and no solution was found, I am convinced that all members, irrespective of party, are striving to solve this problem, and consequently debate on the subject should not have been stifled. Figures were cited to show the volume of unemployment in the Commonwealth. I shall now give other figures setting out the present position:F.U. per cent. State. Total Unemployed Total Workers.

Governments, both Federal and State, are doing a great deal to solve the problem, but, in my opinion, it was wrong to apply the "" gag "" when only two speakers had expressed their views. I hope that such a thing will not occur again. I regret also both the proposals to guillotine the budget debate, and the alternative adopted- a sitting which lasted from 2.30 o'clock yesterday afternoon until nearly 7.30 this morning, with only a short suspension before resumption of the debate at noon today. The best results cannot be obtained from men who are too tired to enter into the discussion intelligently. I shall never support the curtailment of debate in this way, unless I am convinced that obstructive tactics are being resorted to. I agree that stone-walling should not be tolerated when measures affecting the welfare of the nation are awaiting decision. The discussion on constitutional reform introduced by the right honourable member for Yarra was most interesting. The right honourable gentleman gave the lead for which the people of Australia have been looking ever since the commencement of federation. When the Constitution was framed, the electors were promised that as soon as the new machinery was working smoothly, the State parliaments would be abolished. However, a person only requires to travel throughout the Commonwealth to realise how far some of the electors are from the seat of Government at Canberra. It might lrappen that a referendum would disclose that in New South Wales and Victoria a majority of the electors favour the abolition of State parliaments, but as it is necessary to have, in addition to a majority of the people, a majority of the States in favour of alteration, changes are not easily made. Particularly in the more sparsely populated States, the people do not seem to desire any change from the system of control by State parliaments. Nevertheless, I believe that the vesting of greater powers in the Commonwealth Parliament would be in the best interests of Australia. With greater powers delegated to local governing bodies, I am. convinced that better ifr. Collins. and more uniform results would be obtained than under existing conditions. Australia needs population, not only for its development, but also for its defence, and, consequently, the greatest measure of encouragement possible should be given to those responsible for the administration of the Defence Department in order that this country may be saved for Australians and the white Australia policy preserved. I am convinced that little difficulty will be experienced in increasing the militia forces to 70,000. When the recruiting campaign, which has already been initiated by the Minister for External. Affairs (Mr 'Hughes), is in full swing, I am confident that the sons of Australia will rally to the cause, particularly when they know that they will be supplied with uniforms and will be paid for their services. I trust that the objective of the Minister will be achieved by voluntary enlistment. I hope that Australia will never be attacked by an aggressor, and also that we shall never again see an Australian army being transported overseas to war. I listened with interest to comments on the reconstruction of the Cabinet, and was sorry that the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), after six years' association with it, should condemn the Ministry in this House. I am afraid that he will have a job to reconcile his actions.",135
267,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,In what way?,136
268,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"After six years' association with the Cabinet, the honourable gentleman said that the affairs of Cabinet should be run on the lines followed by private enterprise. As the honourable member was a member of the Government for six years, he should have tried to introduce that system years ago. Only when he found that certain arrangements were not to his liking did he find fault with the system. He then criticized on the floor of the House the conduct of members of the Cabinet. In my opinion, that was most unfair.",136
269,Mr WHITE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I put forward the suggestion many times in Cabinet, but only after I again became a private member could I speak of it publicly.",136
270,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I viewed with some apprehension the proposal to create another full portfolio, but when I heard of the multiplicity of the duties which fall to the lot of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr John Lawson), I was prompted to interject that he should be made an assistant Minister immediately. I am now convinced that there is sufficient work to-justify the creation of an additional portfolio. Never in the 150 years of Australia's history has the time of Ministers been more fully occupied. It has been said that some Ministers do too much work, and others too little. That is true both of human beings and dumb animals the world over; the willing horse does most of the work. Consequently the able and willing man is always expected to undertake the major share of the work. The honourable member for Balaclava supported the creation of an inner group of the Cabinet, while he believed that he would be in that group, but when he was informed that he had been excluded he disagreed with his colleagues. These internal squabbles should not have been disclosed in this chamber by the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Balaclava, or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I am not blaming the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the action he took in the matter. He reminded me of a hostile neighbour offering advice while a family brawl was in progress on the other side of the fence. Possibly he was anxious to secure some benefit from the ultimate clean up.",136
271,Mr FORDE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,I wanted to make a few friendly observations.,137
272,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The matter should never have been discussed in this chamber. Mr Lane interjecting.  There is too much disorder. The Chair insists that the Standing Orders be observed.,137
273,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) would be at a disadvantage if he could not make irrelevant interjections at any time.,137
274,Mr LANE,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"Mr Chairman, I hope that you will protect me from the honourable member for Hume (Mr Collins).",137
275,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"I believe that the Government is making an earnest attempt to co-ordinate the various arms of our defence system so that Australia will be able adequately to defend itself against an aggressor. I listened with a great deal of interest to the informative speech of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) who is an authority on aviation matters, and J trust that some of the valuable suggestions which he has made will be carefully considered by the Government. During the debate various topics have been discussed, including the ramifications of finance. I do not profess to be an authority onfinance,but I was astounded to hear some honourable members suggest a means whereby we can obtain something for nothing. It is ridiculous to suggest that while printing paper money to the amount of millions of pounds we can* retain financial and economic stability. The business of the Commonwealth must be conducted on sound lines. It is possible, of course, to print millions of pounds' worth of Commonwealth notes and to destroy them after they have been cashed, but my idea is that assets must be created before credits can be established. Unless one is in the fortunate position of having inherited property or wealth in some form assets have to be created in order to establish credit. This is usually obtained by producing wool, wheat, butter or other commodities or by the exercise of effort. If we were able to obtain money for our wool, wheat or butter without having to exercise our energies in producing it, it would not be long before we would be on the verge of starvation. In certain - circumstances a maternity allowance is paid to mothers, but imagine what the demand would be if the allowance could be obtained without the baby. It is the jesponsibility of the Commonwealth and State governments to proceed with reproductive public works on which men can be employed at wages which will enable them to maintain themselves and their wives and families in comfort. The financial and economic conditions are not so depressed as_many honourable members would have us believe. I supported the national health and pensions insurance scheme because I believed at the time that it was a beneficial social reform. Also it has been included in the Prime Minister's policy speech. The scheme, however, contains some unsatisfactory features which should be removed at the earliest opportunity. Some honourable members have said that we are heading towards another depression. If that should happen, what would ' become of the non-contributory national insurance scheme proposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) ? We all recall the insurmountable difficulties with which the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was confronted when he was Prime Minister, owing to a reduction of the prices of our export commodities, and how he was forced to reduce the salaries of public servants invalid and old-age pensions. I do not blame him for the action then taken by his. government, because the circumstances were unusual and had any other party been in power it would have been compelled to adopt similar measures. ""Social services were severely restricted. If another depression comes with a Labour government in power and a noncontributory national insurance scheme in operation, Australia will be faced conditions similar to those which confronted the right honourable member for Yarra. Under the present scheme, contributions are paid by the employers and employees, but under a non-contributory scheme it would be impossible for the friendly societies, which are doing such good work, to carry on. Workers and others who would come within the scope of a non-contributory national insurance scheme would not remain members of friendly societies.",137
276,Mr JAMES,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,What of pensions?,138
277,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"A man who reaches the age of 65-6 0 in the case of a man who has had war service-receive s a pension of 20s. a week. A member of an approved society under the national insurance scheme, on reaching the age of 60 or 65, as the case may be, can, regardwages less of his financial position, receive a similar pension and free medical service and medicine for the rest of his life.",138
278,Mr JAMES,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,What of the man who has been unable to pay his contributions for two years?,138
279,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,The scheme is complicated in some respects.,138
280,Mr ROSEVEAR,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,Contributor s may not remain in industry sufficiently long to enable them to become entitled to a pension.,138
281,Mr COLLINS,WITH SBPTKMHER QUABTEB,"That may be so in some cases, but some of the difficulties which now exist will be removed should the scheme become operative. When the bill was first introduced, the secretary of the Federal Council of the British Medical Association was asked by the Treasurer to suggest a representative body to discuss with him a reasonable per capita payment for the doctors. Without consulting the rank and file the and Federal Council of that organization negotiated on their behalf. The per capita payment suggested by the members of the Federal Council, who are city doctors, was not acceptable to medical practitioners working in country areas, many of whom have long distances to travel. City doctors are similar to representatives of city constituencies who can visit almost any part of their electorates in a few hours, whereas a with tour of a country electorate may take six months. When the measure was first introduced conditions were better than they are today. Although such a scheme would be of great benefit to the people, it would impose further liabilities upon employers and employees and place them in an unenviable position. Unless prices for wheat, wool, and other commodities again become profitable, the Government would be well advised to postpone the operation of that act, more particularly when the people of this country are so readily responding to the Government's financial measures for the purpose of meeting our increased expenditure on defence. In addition to the tax which they will be called upon to pay under national health and pensions insurance legislation, the primary and secondary industries are already' shouldering such imposts as tax, State and Federal income tax, municipal and shire rates, levies by various boards, workers compensation contributions, and various special taxes such as orchard registration fees, &c Honourable members, therefore, will appreciate the terrific burden which is already being carried by the community generally, and in such circumstances this legislation might well be postponed in of'der to afford some relief to industry, until, at least, such time as prices for our primary products improve. I had intended to deal with the Government's banking proposals, but as a further opportunity will be presented to me to do so, I shall postpone my remarks on that subject, I sincerely hope that I have made some worth-while contribution to the debate. Motion (by Sir EARLE PAGE) proposed - That progress be reported.",138

283,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Fremantle) [2.40] - I move That the word "" forthwith "" bo omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" at the conclusion of the consideration of the JEstimates of Expenditure"". I . do so in order to enter an emphatic protest against the interruption of the budget debate, which it is now proposed to do in order to consider a message which will lead to a bill which ought not to be considered until we have concluded discussion on the financial position of 9 the Commonwealth and have laid down AYES. the basis of the provisions which this Parliament 3h6uld make for ordinary departmental services in respect of the current year. I know that legislation which will arise out of the consideration of this message in committee will involve not only the provision of assistance to the States, but also the adoption of a further taxing message; but, before we contemplate consideration of taxes in this piecemeal fashion we should first dispose of the budget in principle. I have said this before, but I have a suspicion that the reason why the right honourable gentleman has caused the interruption of the budget NOES. debate at this hour this afternoon is not merely to facilitate the examination of this message by honourable members, but in order that a copy of his second-reading speech may be reproduced in the afternoon press. He could have waited until the conclusion of the budget debate, and if that were decided today, as could conceivably be the case, he could then have moved whatever resolutions were necessary in order to bring down this measure. The Opposition is not opposed PAIRS. to assistance being given to the wheat industry. We believe such a step to be imperative, but we object to the hum; bue;ging and muddling which marks the consideration by this Parliament of government business. The budget debate bas been repeatedly interrupted, yet, I suggest, the most important matters which, can engage the consideration of Parliament in any session are the budget, the principles arising out of it and legislation - which must emerge from it. As I believe that in principle the general financial policy of the Government should be approved by the Parliament before consequential legislation is dealt with, I move my amendment.",139
284,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Cowper-Minister for Commerce) [2.45] - I am rather surprised, first at the action of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) in objecting to this procedure, and secondly, at the reasons he has given, because no honourable member in this Parliament can fail to be aware of the need for the early passing of this legislation. A bill is to be brought down in conformity with a promise made to the Premiers of the various States that, as soon as possible after they had passed legislation dealing with the establishment of a home-consumption price for wheat, the Commonwealth Parliament would immediately proceed to pass its complementary legislation. The position is, as I have already informed honourable members, that four States had already passed their legislation when the conference of Premiers was held some ten days ago. The Premier of Tasmania wired the Government that a bill would be passed by the Tasmanian Parliament on Tuesday last. This is the first opportunity that has arisen for this Parliament to deal with this matter.",140
285,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Has Victoria passed its legislation? Sir .EARLE PAGE - The bill has passed the lower House and is now under consideration in the upper House.,140
286,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,That is one of the points which moved me to make this protest.,140
287,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I am glad to know that that is the honourable gentleman's reason for objecting to the interruption of the budget debate, .but he did not say so a few minutes ago. It is rather interesting that he should bave so quickly to change his ground. The position is that the wheat season has already started and it is imperative that, at the earliest possible moment, the State governments, the millers, the wheat-growers, and in fact, every one associated with the industry should know exactly where they stand. To-day I received wires from the State Premiers asking me, if possible, to forward them, confidentially, the text of the Government's proposals in this connection, but the Government thought that it owed an obligation to the Parliament to make the first pronouncement in regard to them in the House as soon as possible and before their text was transmitted to the States. Mr Forgan Smith, the Premier of Queensland, has wired the Government that, unless he is informed by tomorrow of the Government's proposals in regard to. this matter, millers will have to cease accepting wheat for delivery. That also is the position in the other States. There is therefore every reason for urgency. The Leader of the Opposition submitted, as another reason why the consideration of this legislation should be postponed, that the Parliament should deal with the general taxation policy of the Government before the budget debate is interrupted.",140
288,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I did not say that.,140
289,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"This legislation involves the raising and expending of £4,000,000 a year, and if it is something independent of the budget it has to be brought down at the present time because of certain undertakings given to the States. If that is so, surely honourable members appreciate that the first pronouncement in respect of the Government's policy in this direction, should be made to this Parliament, so that on the budget debate honourable members may be able to say a word or two, if they wish to do so, in connection with it. That is the reason which has prompted the Government to interrupt the budget debate at this stage, and I ask honourable members who, I feel sure, are sympathetic with the wheat-growers, to agree to deal with this matter as one of urgency. Until the terms of the measure are made known publicly no honourable member, and no organization, can give advice to wheat growers. Unfortunately, it has been found on several occasions, irrespective of what Government has been in power, that it has been necessary to delay action for the assistance of the wheat-growers until the last moment, because of a lack of unanimity in respect of the final form in which that assistance should be given. I ask honourable members to agree to the introduction of this bill, so that its terms may be transmitted to the States without delay. Insofar as my own speech is concerned, I venture to say that the technical informatiou contained in it is not of such a character as to be desired by the afternoon papers at all.",140
290,Mr WHITE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Balaclava) [2.50] - I take this opportunity to explain the vote which I have just recorded against the Government. This is not a party matter, and I think I can claim that I have always helped to expedite the business of the House; but I do think that the request that progress be reported just at the end of the budget debate",141
291,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Hon. G. J. Bell) The honourable member is not in order in referring to that matter.,141
292,Mr WHITE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I wish to make a personal explanation in regard to it .,141
293,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The honourable member did not say so. As the vote took place in committee, it would be more appropriate if the honourable member sought to make his personal explanation to the committee.",141
294,Mr WHITE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I sat here right through last night, and was informed that I was to be about the sixteenth speaker. I believe that this procedure of compiling a list of speakers is wrong.",141
295,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Order! . The honourable member is not speaking to the motion or to the amendment.,141
296,Mr WHITE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I am endeavouring to make a personal explanation in regard to my vote against the Government.,141
297,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Order ! I remind the honourable member that he may not in the House refer to a vote recorded in committee.,141
298,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Capricornia) [2.53] The argument the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) advanced in support of his amendment should be sufficient to convince the majority of the honourable members of this House that the action of the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) in interrupting the consideration of the budget and Estimates at this stage, covering an expenditure of approximately £93,000,000, is unreasonable.",141
299,Mr RANKIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,What about the adCommerce journment motion moved by the honorbuilding able member yesterday?,141
300,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"That was brought forward as a matter of extreme urgency, affecting 160,000 pf our workless people, many of whom are in dire distress. I make no apology for having moved the adjournment of the House yesterday, and I take this opportunity once more to record my protest against the manner in which the Government stifled the debate on that motion. I regret that the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) should have thought fit to curtail a debate in which the hazardous condition of 160,000 workless people was to be ventilated, and that another Minister should now interrupt the budget debate in order to permit him to make a second reading speech for the purpose, as the Leader of the Opposition said, of catching the afternoon press. As I have said, the budget and Estimates provide for an expenditure of £93,000,000, and it is only reasonable that we should be given a full opportunity to consider the Estimates without interruption item by item, without being asked to sit all night to do so, and without honourable members being expected to speak, as the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) was, at two o'clock in the morning. I protest against this interruption of the budget ' debate, particularly when we consider that since the"" last elections this Parliament has sat only 62 days . out of a total of approximately 356 days. The Government hesitates and halts, moves backwards and forwards in fits and starts, not knowing, where it is going, bungling and procrastinating,, until now it finds itself on the verge of the Christmas recess with a list of twenty bills still to be rushed through at a time when honourable members are exhausted. Is it any wonder that the Opposition protests against this further interruption? I feel sure that in its protest against this it has the backing of an overwhelming majority of the people outside. I do not think for one moment that honourable members, no matter to what side of the House they belong, will support these tactics of the Minister for Commerce. The Government has been backing and filling now for days. First, the Minister for took away in one corner of this his little coterie of the Country party members, and then the Leader of the United Australia party took his members away into another corner, in order to try to pacify them, and retain the reins of oiiice. So confused have matters become in recent weeks that Cabinet does not know where it is going. It was only because of this shuffling that honourable members were denied an opportunity to discuss my motion for the adjournment of the House to consider the plight of the unemployed.",141
301,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Melbourne Ports) [2.55] - I join in the protest voiced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) and supported by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), first, because of the policy of the Government during the last year or so of continually chopping and changing about the business-sheet from one day to another. The business-sheet is printed, and honourable members expect that it will be adhered to, and that an opportunity will be given to them to discuss the items appearing on it, only to find that it is being constantly altered to meet the whims of the Government - This practice prevents honourable members from, getting down seriously to their work. It is a state of affairs that has been brought about largely by the intimidation tactics adopted by one party opposite which, for the moment, holds the balance of power. Unless the Opposition makes some protest against a continuance of this kind of thing, it will be trodden underfoot. When members of the Labour party yesterday sought to discuss the very important problem of unemployment, they were accused of wasting the time of the House. As every honourable member knows, the time limit for the discussion of an adjournment motion is fixed by the Standing Orders, and the debate must conclude within two hours after its commencement. Therefore, an adjournment motion results in comparatively small interference with the business of the House. The reasons prompting the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday in bringing forward his adjournment motion are the same reasons that now actuate the Government, that is, the question of urgency. I feel, I am sure, that no honourable member on this side of the House desires to delay the passage of a measure that will help the wheat industry, and this protest would not have been made against the introduction of a bill to that end if the Government had not taken up a miserable and narrow attitude in respect of the adjournment motion yesterday. The real reason why the Opposition wanted to discuss that matter yesterday was",142
302,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The honourable member is not in order in dealing with that matter.,142
303,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I say that our reason for opposing the motion "" That progress be reported "" was",142
304,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,No r is the honourable member in order in dealing with that question. It has already been decided in committee.,142
305,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition brought forward his motion. for the adjournment of the House yesterday because he felt that, as the sittings of the House are so shortly to conclude, no other opportunity would - be available to him. I remember that the Opposition was subjected to a good deal of criticism last year because it asked the Government in the dying hours of the sittings on the eve of Christmas to provide work for the unemployed. By the time the matter was disposed of, thero was no time for the unemployed to get even a fortnight's work before the festive season ""started. A second reason why I join in' this protest is because, in my opinion, it is foolish and ridiculous to ask honourable members to hurry this legislation through. The necessity for haste in this matter is an indictment of the Government itself which should not continue to occupy the treasury bench. The Minister for Commerce said that this legislation must be rushed through because the State governments, the millers, growers, bankers and everybody associated with the wheat industry, in fact, everybody who gets a rake-off and farms the real wheat-farmer, are so vitally concerned in it, and the wheat-growers will not be able to get the assistance they require. Surely, if that is the real position, all this talk that has ""taken place in the last three or four years about the Government re-establishing confidence in public opinion is so much nonsense. I cannot accept that as a real reason for the urgency of this bill. The Minister for Commerce frequently gives us lectures about the necessity for the adoption of scientific methods in Government affairs. He has also suggested that the Cabinet should consider itself a kind of board of directors, and make long-range plans to give effect to Government policy. Yet the honourable gentleman is now seeking to interfere in the most casual way with the orderly gress of business. I strongly protest against his action.",142
306,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Hunter) [3.1] - I also protest against this proposed interruption of the budget debate. The plight of the wheat-growers is not nearly so serious as that of tens of thousands of unemployed industrialists in this country. wheat-growers have never had to come cap in hand - to governments for a dole, but industrialists who lose their employment are forced to accept the dole. I protest against the postponement of the budget debate also because it is a further expression of the .policy of intimidation and dictatorship that the Country party ' is implementing in respect of the United Australia party. The Country party loses no opportunity to imperil the progress of our secondary industries. It invariably asserts that the wheat industry should receive paramount consideration. are quite prepared to treat the wheat growers justly and even generously, but we are strongly against the re-imposition of the bread tax, which will place an almost intolerable burden upon the working people of this country.",143
307,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The honourable member will not be in order in discussing any subject except the time at which sideration shall be given to the message of the Governor General.,143
308,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Many of us sat here all last night, but very few members of the Country party did so.",143
309,Mr FADDEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Thirtee n out of sixteen of us were here.,143
310,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The Minister for Commerce was not one of them. I regret that the Country party assisted the United Australia party yesterday to apply the gag to the discussion of the important problem of unemployment. The Minister for Works (Mr Thorby) was the only honourable gentleman in the Ministry who thought the subject of sufficient importance to discuss it. We all know that the bill which the Government is now seeking to introduce will receive the strong support of the Country party, as for some of its wheat-growing members in this Parliament will receive bounties if it should be passed. I have no desire to be personal on this subject, but it is well-known that some honourable members pro- who support the Government have been paid bounties in respect of their wheat production in years gone by.",143
311,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I must again ask. the honourable member to confine his remarks to the subject before the Chair. It will not be in order for him to discuss bounties at this stage. The Mr JAMES - I lodge an emphatic protest against any interference with the normal order of business, and particularly against any further postponement of the budget debate. We are all well aware that if the bill which the Minister for Commerce now wishes to introduce is passed bounties will be paid to many individuals in this country who are at present in receipt of a taxable income.",143
312,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The honourable member must obey the ruling of the Chair.,143
313,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I protest against any We interruption of the budget debate.,143
314,Mr WILSON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Wimmera) [3.8] - I appeal to honourable members of the Opposition to allow the bill foreshadowed by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) to be introduced without delay. I sympathize with their resentment at the ""gagging"" of the discussion of the unemp.oyment problem yesterday, but I con- assure them that, from many points of view, some of which are of a technical character, the measure which the Minister for Commerce wishes honourable members to consider is urgent. I am well acquainted with the circumstances of many wheat-growers in this country, and I know that deplorable conditions exist in many wheat-growing areas. For this reason, I appeal to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) to withdraw his amendment.",143
315,Mr BAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Griffith) [3.10] - The Opposition is strongly antagonistic to the proposal of the Government to interfere, at this stage, with the budget debate. The sole reason of any importance advanced by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) for the action he has taken was that he had received a telegram from the Premier of Queensland, Mr Forgan Smith, asking that the passage of this bill should be expedited. No doubt the honourable gentleman has had experience of the hrittleness of the promises made by this Government, and he is anxious that the measure should be passed without delay. The Minister for Commerce does not seem to realise that honourable members were required by the Government to proceed with public business throughout the whole of last night, and the majority of us have not had any sleep at all during the last 36 hours. The urgency of the need to proceed with the debate on the budget is partly to be found in the fact that almost half of the financial year has now elapsed. The Lyons Government has never treated the budget debate as anything but a farce. In 1930, when the Scullin Government was in office during a more critical period than any other Commonwealth Government had had to face, the budget was brought down on the 9 th July, and the Estimates were passed on the 4th August, very little more than a month after the closing of the financial year. In 1931 the budget was introduced on the 10th July, and the Estimates were passed on the 30th July, within a month after the closing of the financial year. In 1930 the then Prime Minister (Mr Scullin), who also held the portfolio of External Affairs, was called upon suddenly to assume the Treasurer's portfolio on account of the sudden resignation of the Treasurer. Yet the right honourable gentleman prepared his budget in 48 hours. It is in accordance with the practice of the mother of parliaments-the Parliament-the traditions of which this Parliament is supposed to observe, for the budget to be considered as early as possible in the financial year, yet this Government has delayed the consideration for so long that two supply bills have had to be passed. Unless the budget and Estimates arc finally dealt with by the end of this month the introduction of another supply bill will be necessary. In these circumstances, the Opposition is Mr Da her. thoroughly justified in its protest against the proposal of the Government to interfere at this stage with the budget debate. What makes it all the more remarkable is that the right honourable gentleman in charge of the House (Sir Earle Page), who made us"" sit up all last night, is himself a medical man. I have always understood that the Minister for Commerce was opposed to all-night sittings, not only because of the inconvenience caused to honourable members, but also because they were definitely harmful to health, and because he regarded them as one of the major reasons for the shortening of the lives of many honourable members of this Parliament. I should not be surprised if the Government decided to keep Parliament sitting all night to-night, so that it may force honourable members, when they are unable to think clearly, to pass legislation which should have been passed four months ago, and which would have been passed then had the procedure advocated by the Labour party been adopted. There is no indication that this bill will be passed today, in any case. One reason for its introduction at this stage is that the Minister has already given information regarding it to the press. The Premier of Queensland, Mr Forgan Smith, and others who have the interests of the wheat-growers at heart, want to know whether the Government proposes on this occasion to stand up to its responsibility, or whether this proposal will be treated as were the promises of the Government in regard to the mortgage bank, the patents bill, the housing scheme, and numerous other matters. The Government, in its endeavour to hold office, does not seem to worry whether its bills are passed or not. It is quite satisfied to bring them down, and if they are criticized by its supporters, British they are simply dropped. Members of the Opposition have every sympathy with the wheat-growers; and the action of the Government which we are now criticizing does not affect our intention to help the growers in every way possible.",143
316,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"West Sydney) [3.19]. - The protest of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) against the action of the Government in interrupting the debate on the budget has drawn the attention of all honourable members to the undesirable methods of the Government when introducing legislation. The Government has been criticized from all sides of the House this session because honourable members have not had an opportunity to concentrate on the work of Parliament. If the business were brought down in an orderly ""way, honourable members would be able to study the various measures, and follow them intelligently through all stages. The budget contains reference to certain legislation necessary to implement the decisions announced in the budget itself, but we have been called upon to deal with the legislation before the budget is finally disposed of. I trust that this protest will have the effect of compelling the Government to follow more orderly methods in the future. I have been in this Parliament for eleven years, and every year the problem of assisting the wheat-growers has arisen. It is unfortunate that that should be so, but it has, at any rate, established the fact that no party can claim a monopoly of sympathy for the growers. The methods adopted in the past for assisting the growers have not been fair to the industry itself. Ill-digested legislation has been rushed through at the end of a session, and the problem has never been considered in all its phases. I sympathize with the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson), who reminds us that the barvest is beginning, and that something must be done to let the growers know - where they stand. My complaint is that the Government has delayed so long. Many things are involved in this matter of assisting the wheat industry. Por instance, it cannot be doubted that the recent trade agreement between Great Britain and the United States of America will seriously affect the wheat industry in Australia.",144
317,Mr SPEAKER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The honourable member is digressing.,145
318,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The amendment contemplates that, during the discussion on the budget, the honourable member would be able to discuss th& effect of the Anglo-American trade agreement on the wheat industry before this bill is dealt with.",145
319,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"It is impossible to over-emphasize the importance of the wheat industry to Australia, and it should be dealt with by the Government in a more business like way. No doubt the Government has the numbers to carry its point on this occasion, but I hope that our protest will result in pressure being brought to bear upon it in the party room to alter its methods. We want to do the best thing by the growers, but the Government's methods will have the tendency to harm, rather than assist, them.",145
320,Mr DRAKEFORD,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Maribyrnong) [3.26] - The protest of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) in regard to the Government's proposal merely anticipates the protest that would have been made in any case from this side of the House against the procedure followed on this occasion and on many others during the debate on the budget. The reasons advanced by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) for interrupting the budget debate at this stage do not carry any weight. We have had so many interruptions that it would appear that the Government regards the budget as a bone to be thrown to a hungry dog to gnaw at until something else is ready to be put before it. When the criticism of any measure from this side of the House, and from its own supporters, becomes too strong to be comfortable, the Government withdraws it, and substitutes something else. Had the debate on the budget been allowed to go on without interruption, it seems clear that criticism from both sides of the House would have been so strong that the Government would have been compelled to change its policy. At the present time, honourable members are being treated with contempt, and. this sort of thing lowers the whole tone of Parliament. The people are beginning to sneer at us, because it is evident that tliere is a party behind the Government which can compel it to do anything it likes. All on this side of the House sympathizes with the wheat-growers, just as they sympathize with the unemployed. I sympathize with the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson) in his anxiety to have this bill proceeded with without delay. Were it not for that, I should protest more strongly against this interruption. I trust that, as the result of this protest, the Government will treat Parliament more courteously in future.",145
321,Mr WARD,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"East Sydney) [3.29] - Every member of the Opposition appreciates the point of view of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson), and sympathizes with his desire to do something to assist the wheat industry. I think that he, alone among Country party members, has been consistent in his efforts to assist the growers. I am compelled to point out, however, that while the Opposition realizes the difficulties of some of the wheat-growers, it also realizes the difficulties of other tions of the community. Moreover, it believes that if any delay occurs in providing assistance, the responsibility must rest on the Government itself. This Parliament cannot be considered to have been so busily engaged in the last few weeks that time could not have been found to consider legislation to give assistance to the wheat industry. As the honourable member for Wimmera points out, the crop is already being harvested, but, until today, no effort has been made to give the wheat-growers assistance. At the close of sessions when the Government is legislating by the process of exhausting honourable members, it always finds it convenient, in order to shorten discussion, to say to the Opposition, "" You must not discuss this bill and delay its passage, because the assistance is needed urgently"". Any delay in assisting the wheat industry must be attributable, not to the Opposition, but to the Government itself, because legislation should have been introduced long ago. I was not impressed with the argument advanced by the Minister for Comon merce (Sir Earle Page), the bill is urgent for the reathe son that, unless it is passed, unemto ployment may be increased, because porters of the Government showed their lack of concern for the welfare of the unemployed yesterday when they motion agreed to. "" gagged "" a discussion of their plight. The budget is the most important which Parliament can discuss, but it has always been the practice of this Government to use it merely as a stop-gap when to it either has no other business to bring before Parliament, or cannot make up its mind on other matters. Since the introfor duction of the budget, the discussion been interrupted to permit of the passage of bills relating to land tax, income tax, sales tax, therapeutic substances, the apple and pear industry, and the appointment of an additional Minister. I assure the honourable member for Wimmera that members of the Labour party are anxious to assist those in the wheat industry who are deserving of assistance, but we must be mindful of the fact that many persons engaged in wheat production, by no stretch of the imaginasec- tion, could be considered to be in the deserving class. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member must confine his remarks to the subject before the Chair.",146
322,Mr WARD,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I am endeavouring, Mr. Speaker, fo point out that the urgency of this measure emphasized by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) is not applicable to the whole of the wheat industry. The Opposition is prepared to give assistance to those who are in need, but many persons engaged in the production of wheat are more fortunately circumstanced than others, and there is not the urgency in respect of giving them assistance as there was for this Parliament yesterday to give consideration to the unemployed, who have no income.",146
323,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Any legislation to assist the wheat industry could be made retrospective.,146
324,Mr WARD,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes . I add my protest at the delay which has occurred in the discussion of the budget. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition hit the nail the head when he said that the only that urgency in this bill was the urgency for right honourable member for Cowper obtain some cheap publicity at the supwheat-growers' expense.

325,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Cowper-Minister for Commerce) [3.40] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of the Government in 1936, presenting this bill is to bring into operation a plan whereunder wheatbushel growers shall secure a stabilized in regard to the proportion of their crop which is used for human consumption in Australia. Every one knows the importance of the wheat industry. It is second only in importance to the great wool industry. It engages the activities of over 70,000 farmers throughout Australia, and it provides the second most important item in Auswheat tralia's export values. From the point of view of direct employment, it is the most important single industry in Ausor £900,000 this year. tralia. The welfare of this great industry of very great importance to Australia. That welfare has received serious shocks in the last seven or eight years, and future, to say the best, is uncertain. Since the onset of the depression in 1930, there have been considerable fluctuations in the prices of Australian commodities. The prices of export products declined to a far greater degree than the wholething, sale and retail price levels. All price levels relative to the 1928-29 level living, recovered quite substantially in the financial years 1936-37 and 1937-38. More recently, however, export have declined very seriously, although wholesale and retail prices have mainthing tained their advance, which has been tinuous since 1933-34. At the. present time, compared with the average for attempts 1928-29, the export price of wheat stands at 57 per cent. General export prices are 68 per cent, of their 192S-29 level; wholesale prices are 93 per cent., and retail prices are 89 per cent. It evident, therefore, that the wheat industry, as in the years from 1930-31 to 1934-35, is suffering adversity in far greater measure than other export industries and the Australian community as During the years of adversity, wheat prices, on the whole, have not only been low, but have also fluctuated seriously from time to time. For example, in January, 1930, the export price at Williamstown was 5s. 2d. a bushel, whereas in December, 1930, it was 2s. 5d. a bushel. In January, 1936, the price was 3s. 8d. a bushel, and in December, it was 5s. 3d. a bushel. By December, 1937, it had declined to 4s. 4d. a at Williamstown, and today it is price about 2s. 7d. a bushel. Short-term violent fluctuations of the price of wheat aggravate the adversity of the industry. These fluctuations are also bad for the Australian community, as a whole, because a fall of the price of wheat must mean an appreciable diminution of employment. For instance, to show the general relationship of the industry to general employment, it is said in Victoria that reduced crop will reduce railway returns by £800,000 That will make a big difference to employment, is in Victoria. The urgency to do something to prevent a repercussion from the fall of wheat prices on general employ the ment answers the objections that were raised against proceeding with this legislation. For one thing, fluctuations of the purchasing power of the wheat growers cause fluctuations of the general level of business activity. For another wheat being such an important constituent in the regimen of the cost of violent fluctuations of the domestic price result in quite important fluctuations of the cost of living index, and, prices therefore, of the basic wage. On all. counts, it would be an excellent for the Australian community if conthe domestic price of wheat could be stabilized at a reasonable level, and to ensure this domestic stability have received the attention of governments for several years past. The problem, however, has proved a baffling and elusive one. It is not so easy to is organize the wheat industry from a domestic stabilization point of view. It embraces so many thousands of individual farmers, and the product is marketed both domestically and overseas in the form of both grain and flour. In this it differs from the butter and dried fruits industries, whose products are entirely treated in factories or packing sheds, thus rendering them capable of being dealt with at a small number of concentrated points. By reason of this - form of domestic organization, the dairying and dried fruits industries are particularly well suited to adopt measures on a co-operative basis for obtaining a home consumption price. The wheat industry is not at all well adapted for this treatment and therefore, if home-consumption price methods have to be adopted, it must rely more upon governmental action. The dairying and dried fruits industries have enjoyed home-consumption prices for a considerable time, but all efforts hitherto to secure a home-consumption price for wheat, coupled with the domestic and export organization of the industry, have failed. An attempt to secure a home consumption price for wheat is only likely to be permanently successful if there is an interlinking of Commonwealth and State legislation, because, if one can once get seven different parliaments to carry complementary laws to deal with this matter, it is not very likely that they will be upset. Much greater stability can thus be achieved than by any method which depends entirely on the act of one parliament. I thought that I had succeeded in this direction in 1935, when under the Constitution as it was interpreted the States agreed to pass legislation which, with Commonwealth legislation, would have covered the whole field of wheat marketing. The Commonwealth Parliament passed its legislation-the and Wheat Products Act-and certain States also passed their, but unfortunately the decision of the Privy Council and the failure to. get the Constitution altered at the referendum prevented the operation of that legislation, so that the attempt to bring about the organization of the wheat industry had to lapse. Then by reason of the droughts in the Northern Hemisphere, an appreciable rise occurred in world prices in 1936 and 1937, but since July, 1937, the price has declined and from Hir Earte Page. March of this year the decline has been very rapid and has now reached an unprofitable level. The prospects have become so alarming that the present plan, which is based on the price-fixing powers of the State, combined with a Commonwealth levy, has been devised. It is appropriate that I should trace briefly the recent history of price movements and world stocks of wheat. Following upon three or four years of low prices resulting from the accumulation of world stocks, an appreciable rise occurred in world wheat prices in 1936 and 1937. These prices reached their peak in April and July, 1937, when as much as 5s. 8d. and 5s. 9d. a bushel at seaboard was paid. The average of daily quotations on trucks Williamstown during these months Avas 5s. 5d. a bushel, and the monthly average for the calendar year 1937, was approximately 5s. O^d. a bushel. Since that time, prices have declined, and from March of this year the decline has been very rapid and has now reached an unprofitable level. The lowest price in the past four years was that of 2s. 6£d. on trucks Williamstown on the 9th September. A slight rise occurred during October, the average for the month being about 3s. a bushel, but this was of a temporary nature only. The present prices for old season's wheat at Williamstown are between 2s. 7d. and 2s. 8d. a bushel. The price decline which has been so marked since mid-May of this year has been brought about chiefly through the greatly increased stocks which it was then anticipated would be available this season to meet world requirements. Unfortunately, from the point of view of prices and of our growers, this - anticipation has proved to have been fully justified. In creased production this year as compared Wheat with past years has been the order in almost all wheat-producing countries. It has been particularly the case in the United States of America and Canada, where 240,000,000 bushels in excess of the crop harvested last season has been realized. In both importing and exporting countries in Europe the harvest has been very large. The latest reports indicate that the total European harvest will exceed that of last year by over 205,000,000 bushels. The European importing countries alone have garnered about 115,000,000 bushels more than last year, whilst the European exporting countries excess over last year is 90,000,000 bushels. If we exclude Russia, China., Turkey, Iran and Iraq, from which countries reliablefiguresare not yet available, the world production this year totals 4,165,000,000 bushels. This compares with 3,669,000,000 bushels last year and 3,362,000,000 bushels in the previous year, and this represents a total rise of 500,000,000 bushels as compared with last year, and over 800,000,000 bushels as compared with the previous year. The harvesting of the large excesses in importing countries is naturally having its effect upon the import requirements of those countries. Because of these large increases and because also of a rather rigid control exercised over imports in certain countries-hithert o large importers-the import requirements are likely to show a decline this year even when compared with the low figures realized during the last few years. ""World authorities anticipate that the needs of importing countries will not exceed 550,000,000 bushels. Parallel with this situation, is the fact that the chief world exporters have also harvested huge crops. To cater for the requirements of importing countries there is available in exporting tries surpluses totalling over 1,000,000,000 bushels, practically sufficient to meet two years' requirements at the present rate of absorption. The present situation throughout the world in regard to stocks is comparable to that which obtained in the years from 1931 to 1934. In those years, owing to accumulations of stocks, due principally to large harvests in 192829-of 3.910,000,000 bushels-1932-3 3 and 1933-34, world end-of-season's stocks reached twice their previous dimensions. Prior to these years, it was considered that an end-of-season carry over of less than 600,000,000 bushels was a safe margin. In the years mentioned, the accumulations had reached over 1,000,000,000 bushels. These large stocks were reduced to normal proportions only because of the failure of harvests in exporting countries during the three years from 1934-35 to 1936-37. Actually, in these three years, world disappearance was greater than the production, and this resulted in carry-over stocks being reduced by August, 1937, to about 530,000,000 bushels. During the years 1931-34, when the world stocks were so high, the average of monthly prices on rails Williamstown were as follows:s. d. 1931 . . 2 51 1932 .. ..3 1 1933 .. .. 2 9j 1934 .. . . 2 7| 1935 .. ..3 2 Viewed in its most favourable light, the present outlook offers little hope for any appreciable rise of prices during this and the next season. During this period of very low prices, successive Commonwealth governments granted financial assistance to the wheat industry. The amounts granted in the several years were:£ 1931-32 .. .. 3,296,000 193233 .. .. 2.132,000 193334 .. .. 3.000,000 193435 .. .. 4,008,000 193530 .. 1,879,000 Having regard to the unpromising outlook for the wheat industry, due to the position of the international wheat market, the Premiers of the various States met in Sydney on the 26th August, 1938, with a view to procoun- pounding some method to assist the growers. The conference had before it several plans for effecting some degree of stabilization of the industry, and, after having explored the various means available for this purpose, agreed to the following resolutions:1. That this conference affirms the necessity of action being taken to ensure to wheat growers a payable price for their product. 2. That, as a first stop of urgent national importance, the governments of the Commonwealth and States should take such immediate joint action in their respective jurisdictions as is necessary to implement a. home-consumption price plan in the season 1938-39, and following seasons; such plan to be based on an equalization levy on wheat or flour (used for home consumption) collected under the excise power of the Commonwealth. 3. That such proposal should also ensure a stable home-consumption price of flour and bread in the various States at a level fair to both producer and consumer based on a home consumption price of 4s. 8d. a bushel nt country sidings for wheat, or its equivalent; special arrangements to be made, as on former occasions, to meet the special circumstances of Tasmania. 4. That it is of vital importance that such proposal be of a long-range character, and placed on a sound legal, financial and mercial basis from the outset, and not left vulnerable to legal challenge or dependent voluntary co-operation. 5. That conference is unanimously opinion that it is impossible to devise practicable plan based on voluntary co-operaopportunity tion of growers, millers and merchants. 0. This conference has received several posals from farmers' organizations for stitution of a permanent price equalization fund built up by contributions from the monwealth and wheat-growers. The conference is of opinion that they are worthy detailed examination and, as they involve the bi.l. federal finance this conference submits them to the federal government for consideration. Following upon that conference, the Premiers conferred with Commonwealth Ministers in Canberra on the 29th August, 1938, with a view to seeking the co-operation of the Commonwealth in bringing their plans to fruition.",147
326,Mr FOHDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,To what degree will the price of bread be affected ?,150
327,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"That is a matter for the States. The price of 'flour has been fixed with a minimum of £11 and a maximum of £13 10s. a ton, and it is estimated that bread can be produced and sold at from 5^d. to 6d. a loaf, which was the price paid eight or nine months ago under ordinary trading conditions. The Commonwealth Government has no power to fix prices and consequently prices will be fixed by the States.",150
328,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The Commonwealth Government could refuse to provide a bounty if the prices fixed by the State Government were above a certain figure.,150
329,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"That is provided for in the legislation now before the chamber. If a State does not carry out the programme unanimously agreed to, the Commonwealth can suspend payments. The tax must be uniform in all States.",150
330,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Does the Minister suggest that when wheat-growers will be getting 2s. 2d. a bushel, plus a bounty of 6d., making 2s. 8d., this Parliament should consent to consumers paying a shilling for a 4-lb. loaf of bread?",150
331,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The Leader of the Opposition can develop his argument in that connection when he speaks later.,150
332,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Will not the flour-millers be getting a "" rake-off ?'",150
333,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I am endeavouring to explain the details of the legislacomtion now before the House. I approached on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) and told him I was anxious of to getleave to introduce the measure, so any that honourable members would have an to see what is proposed. The proDeputy Leader of the Opposition, howtho inever, said that he was opposed to that course and, consequently, I was only able Comto give notice of the motion which I of proposed to move for leave to introduce",150
334,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I objected because the Government prevented us from discussing the problem of unemployment.,150
335,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I am endeavouring to give the information desired.,150
336,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Why was this legislation not introduced earlier?,150
337,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The Tasmanian Government passed its legislation only this week. Arrangements were made that uniform legislation would have to be passed by all the States before the Commonwealth Government could introduce its legislation. Further, there has been delay owing to the necessity to consider a. modified scheme. An agreement was reached on 26th August, but owing to conditions which arose subsequently, due to climatic and other circumstances, a modified scheme was suggested. The State governments submitted different proposals, but the Commonwealth Government can deal only with a scheme which has received the unanimous support of all States. A fortnight ago, I asked the States' representatives to ascertain where it was possible to adopt a modified scheme on a uniform basis. That has now been done and is incorporated in this measure. The conditions are somewhat exceptional. In some of the States, large areas of wheat-growing lands have been severely affected by drought, particularly in Victoria where it is estimated that the. yield, which normally is 39,000,000 bushels, will be only 13,000,000 bushels. In the circumstances it was decided that from the fund provided to pay a home-consumption price On a production basis, £500,000 should be appropriated to assist those farmers whose crops have failed. It was felt that certain farmers who had enjoyed good seasons and who, at times, might have abundant 'assets, did not need assistance, but that others who had had several bad years needed special treatment. For the purpose of providing this assistance a sum of £500,000 is to be allocated from the total proceeds of this tax. At a meeting held a fortnight ago, the Ministers of Agriculture of the various States discussed this matter and agreed unanimously that the sum of £500,000 should be provided for the purpose of relieving distress in the various States, and that £200,000 should be allocated to Victoria and £100,000 to each of the States of Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, in order to enable them to deal with their peculiar problems.",150
338,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,What is the total yield of the tax?,151
339,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"It depends on the price of wheat during the year. The tax will vary as the price of wheat varies from 5s. 2d. a bushel at Williamstown. If the price of wheat remains at 2s. 7d. a bushel, as it is at present, the amount of tax that will be obtained will vary between £3,500,000 and £4,000,000; if the price rises to 3s. a bushel, the amount obtained from the tax will decline probably to £2,800,000. The higher the price of wheat in the world's markets the less will be the total amount of tax collected. The amount allocated for relief purposes is variable. This allocation was - arrived at unanimously by the States after full discussion; but the States went further and said, "" The very fact that we are in trouble this year, insofar as the relief areas are concerned, and the manner in which suggestions were ' made as to how that trouble should be met, indicate to us the means whereby we can take out of distress and trouble a great many farmers now working in marginal areas, men whose production is only two or three bushels an acre and who should never have gone in for wheat farming on that particular land"". It is reckoned that in an ordinary good year, the wheat produced from the marginal areas would amount to between 10,000,000 and 15,000,000 bushels. It is obvious that these men are having a bad time, and their position is unsatisfactory not only to them but also to the whole of Australia. What has been suggested is that there should be taken out of this, [72] home-consumption price fund, a sum to be determined by the Minister of Commerce in conjunction with Ministers of Agriculture in the various States, out not exceeding £500,000 a year, and that that money be utilized for the purpose of transferring farmers growing wheat on marginal lands to other areas where they might engage in mixed farming, or to finance them to increase the size of their holdings by buying up the properties of their neighbours and raising sheep in conjunction with their wheat-growing operations. It is hoped that, in this way, those now engaged on marginal lands may be able to make a decent living. That is one of the features of this scheme which has emerged from the discussions with the States. The discussion of this problem was responsible for some of the delay that has occurred in the passing of legislation by the States themselves, and is partly the reason why I am delivering this speech today instead of a week or teii days ago. The Commonwealth and the States have been endeavouring to work out the details of a plan which will adequately deal with this problem, of which every one in Australia is aware, and which every royal commission dealing with the wheat industry has recognized. 1 I have no doubt that this solution will be regarded as one of the great constructive steos towards bringing the wheat industry into proper shape and enabling all those engaged in it to have a reasonable chance to make a decent living. As I have said, those who have no reasonable chance at present of making a reasonable living will be transferred to other areas where the prospects of successful operations seem much brighter. There are awaiting development areas to which they can be transferred, and there are also other avenues of production in which they might successfully engage.",151
340,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,That is a point which needs elaborating.,151
341,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"It is a matter to which the State governments have given a great deal of consideration. One of the reasons why the States have not been able to give the matter serious consideration in the past is their lack of the necessary finance to tackle the problem in a proper way, either by making provision for the enlargement of existing holdings or by the grant of financial assistance to farmers in marginal areas to engage in mixed farming.",151
342,Mr GREEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,We cannot have guns and bread.,152
343,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The important point about this matter is that the wheat industry itself is providing the rehabilitation for the men situated in marginal areas. It is a principle well worth adopting and working out. Here we have a concerted attempt being made by all the Governments of Australia to tackle this problem on an Australia-wide basis. The State parliaments, with the exception of Victoria, have already passed their legislation for the fixation of a home-consumption price for wheat, and it is now for the Federal Parliament to pass this complementary legislation in order to bring the whole scheme into operation with the least possible delay. This is a non-party matter, because three of the State governments are Labour governments, and the other three are non-Labour governments. Actually, it is a co-operative plan designed to provide much-needed assistance to the wheat industry, and the mere fact that the Commonwealth legislation has to be introduced by the Government now in office is no reason why it should be opposed.",152
344,Mr FADDEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Will the price of flour be subject to fluctuation?,152
345,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The honourable member's question leads me to another aspect of this legislation which is of great importance. Provision is made in an accompanying bill to be introduced for the imposition of special tax on wheat when world parity rises above 5s. 2d. f.o.r. Williamstown. The tax will be of such amount as to prevent the price of wheat used for domestic consumption in Australia costing the miller more than the equivalent of 5s. 2d. a bushel at Williamstown, or 4s. 8d. at home railway sidings. If the proportion is, say, three of export at 6s. to one of home consumption at 5s. 2d., the export tax will be applied in such a way as to enable millers to be paid an amount which would enable them to keep bread at the price previously ruling. This is a very important aspect of this matter, and one I think which will commend itself to all parties as an honest attempt by the Parliament to call upon the wheat-grower to give back in good times the benefits he receives in bad times. This is the first time that legislation of that sort has been placed before Parliament, but it will help to ensure that the proposal will receive something like sympathetic consideration from the people of Australia generally.",152
346,Mr BEASLETJ,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,All over a certain 5 amount will go as tax?,152
347,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The position is that if flour sells as at present at £12 10s. a ton, and a miller buys wheat at 5s. 2d. a bushel at Williamstown, he can show a slight increase over his .normal trading profit. If the price of wheat rises to 6s. it is obvious that unless something is done any one who owns wheat in Australia will want to sell the whole of it overseas at 6s., rather than sell to the local miller at 5s. 2d. To ensure that the miller will get his supplies at 5s. 2d. a tax will be placed on all wheat sold, and that tax will be paid over to the miller, so that he will be able to keep his flour price at £12 10s. a ton. It is an extraordinary advance on anything ever attempted in the past in connection with this matter, and will tend towards the permanence of this legislation. I hope that I have made the scheme clear to honourable members. It is simple in so far as the great bulk of the money raised by the home-consumption price levied will be paid to the farmers who grow wheat on the quantity of wheat they grow. But this year £500,000 will be taken from that fund for the purpose of dealing with the question of drought relief, and, as I have said, that will be divided among the States in the proportion I have indicated.",152
348,Mr BADMAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,What happens if they are all good years?,152
349,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"If the price of wheat went up to what it has been in previous years, namely, 6s. or 7s. a bushel, then the Australian consumer would not suffer; he would still continue to enjoy a uniform bread, price.",152
350,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Does the right honourable gentleman expect that a price of 6s"". or 7s. a bushel will be obtained in the near future?",152
351,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I remind the honourable member that eighteen months ago the price of wheat rose by 3d. a bushel from 5s. 2d. to 5s. 5d.,153
352,Mr NOCK,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,It was 5s. 10^d. a bushel in Sydney.,153
353,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,It is hoped that in the not dim and distant future the price of wheat will again rise.,153
354,Mr SCULLY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,How long will the legislation continue to operate?,153
355,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Like other legislation placed on the statute-book, it will continue to remain in force until it is repealed. That also applies to the legislation passed by the States. It will be, of course, within the competence of future governments to alter or repeal it. The result of this scheme will be to improve definitely the conditions of the wheat-growing industry, and because it secures permanence in respect of the price of bread, I feel sure it will meet with the approval of the Australian people generally.",153
356,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Would the right honourable gentleman answer briefly the arguments in respect of the bushel basis as .against an acreage basis?,153
357,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The idea underlying the whole of this scheme is to provide a home-consumption price for wheat. Of the quantity of wheat produced by a farmer, he will get for what is consumed in Australia an amount - comparable to what he has to pay out in general costs such as labour costs and the costs of production. There is an infraction of that principle in so far as the provision of the £500,000 for drought relief is concerned. Even if this subtraction of £500,000 from the home-consumption fund is regarded in a few years as something which should not be done, we believe that at the present time it is quite justified because of the desirability of making adequate provision for the needs of those farmers now engaged in marginal areas. It is felt that if this scheme is put into operation those now engaged on marginal areas will be transferred to other areas which can be more profitably worked.",153
358,Mr BEASLEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The situation of farmers distressed through the drought is serious.,153
359,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"That is so. The amount of £500,000 which is proposed to be made available to assist them will undoubtedly be used in part, at any rate, to help farmers to leave unproductive boldings.",153
360,Mr LAKE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Has any provision been made in the bill to fix the wages of rural workers ?,153
361,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"No ; the bill does not touch any question relating to industrial arbitration. As the honourable member is aware, such a measure as this must be confined to one subject.",153
362,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Surely a provision could be inserted to the effect that in New South Wales, at any rate, the rural awards must be observed in connection with the wheat industry?",153
363,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I have no doubt that the Government of New South Wales will include in its legislation any provision of that kind that is necessary. This bill is comoleinentarv to State legislation to fix the price of flour.,153
364,Mr SCULLIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Does the Minister for Commerce think that the bill is constitutional seeing that it makes certain discriminatory arrangements as between States?,153
365,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"We may not discriminate between States in regard to taxation, but we may do so in regard to payments. I have no doubt that this scheme will be fully effective if the States co-operate as they have promised to do. State legislation will be required to fix the price of flour and Commonwealth legislation to impose a special sales tax, or import tax, on wheat when world parity rises above 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r., Williamstown. The tax will be of such an amount as will prevent the price of wheat for home consumption costing the miller, and ultimately the consumer, more than the equivalent of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r., Williamstown. The plan now being implemented provides complete machinery to ensure that the price of wheat for home consumption will always be equivalent to 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r., Williamstown, and that the wheat producers of Australia will always receive simple world parity price in respect of wheat exported by them. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the debt that we owe to the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) for Living devised a means by which this knotty problem could be solved. Provision is also made in the bill to refund to Tasmania the amount of tax collected in that State. This action is in accordance with the unanimous agreement of the Premiers of the wheat exporting States, and it is also in conformity with the provisions of previous legislation of this description.",153
366,Mr NOCK,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I take it that the amount of refund of Tasmania will be withdrawn from the accumulated fund?,154
367,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes . In other words, the flour tax collected in Tasmania will be refunded. This will mean that Tasmania, which is the only Australian State which has to import the bulk of its wheat and flour, will be in a somewhat different position from the other States. But the other States will reap certain advantages which Tasmania will not enjoy. For example, considerable quantities of goods are manufactured in New South Wales and sold in Tasmania. The people of New South Wales as, in fact, of Victoria also, will enjoy advantages consequent upon this Tasmanian trade. This must be offset against the advantage that Tasmania will enjoy under this legislation.",154
368,Mr NOCK,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,What is to be done with the amount collected in respect of wheat sold at above world-parity price? Will it be returned to the miller?,154
369,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I have already explained the procedure in that connection.,154
370,Mr MAHOHEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"At any rate, it will not get back to the consumer.",154
371,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"L t will ultimately do so, through the millers. The millers will buy flour at a fixed price irrespective of the world parity price of wheat.",154
372,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Will pollard, bran, and other by-products of wheat used by farmers and others come under the scheme?",154
373,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,No . The Government feels that it is performing a national duty in co-operating with the State governments to ensure to farmers that measure of stability which must result from the payment of a home consumption price for wheat.,154
374,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Has the Government consulted the millers in connection with this legislation ?,154
375,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"At various times the millers have been consulted in regard to the best taxing arrangements that can be made, but the application of the scheme to the wheat industry at large is a matter for general consideration by the governments concerned.",154
376,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,We can be quite sure that the consumers have not been consulted.,154
377,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The circumstances of the great exporting industries of this country are always reviewed at election times and the policies of the different political parties are submitted to the electors for approval or otherwise. I know of no other effective way in which consumers may be consulted on a subject of this description.,154
378,Mr NOCK,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Has the Government any idea when part of the proceeds of this fax can be made available to the farmers ?,154
379,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I have been assured by the Treasurer that the amount of £500,000 for the relief of necessitous farmers will be made available as early as possible. Our reason for asking honourable members to consider this an urgent bill is that the collection of the tax may begin without delay. Wheat is now being harvested in different parts of Australia, and any delay in the passage of this measure will be detrimental to the whole scheme. It is estimated that under present price conditions an amount of £3,500,000 or £4,000,000 will be available in respect of the coming harvest. It is anticipated that probably £1,500,000 or £2,000,000 will be available for distribution during January or February. This will be equivalent to about 3d. a bushel on the whole crop, and it should ensure to the farmers an immediate return of about 2s. 4d. or 2s. 5d. a bushel.",154
380,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,How may the farmers be assured that they will receive the bounty in respect of the wheat they sell?,154
381,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Farmer s who take their wheat to silos in New South Wales, for example, will be given silo scrip in respect of each consignment.",154
382,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,.Suppos e the farmers sell to agents?,154
383,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"In that case they will, no doubt, make allowance in their sale price for the bounty which they know they will be entitled to receive. Under existing price conditions the be approximately from 5d. to 7d. a bushel on the whole crop.",154
384,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,What if the farmers ;ell to millers or produce merchants?,155
385,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Farmer s follow that - course will know that they are entitled to the bounty, and they will adjourned. make allowance for it in their selling price. The questions which . honourable members are asking me emphasize the necessity for a full explanation of the whole scheme at .the earliest possible amendment. moment. I think even the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Green) will agree, now, that any delay in the passage of this bill will be detrimental to the farming community.",155
386,Mr GREEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Is it not a fact that farmers will get only about 2d. a bushel on their whole crop ?,155
387,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"No ; the bounty thirty-eight, will be anything from 5d. to"" 7d. a bushel. the(6)manufacture",155
388,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Is any provision being made in the bill for a means test?,155
389,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"No . The prinaccordance cipal purpose of the measure is to ensure a home-consumption price for all wheat stituted sold for use in Australia. It is not the practice to apply a means test in conper nexion with protective measures introper duced for the benefit of manufacturing State industries. Therefore, as the purpose of this bill is to afford a degree of protection to the wheat-growers in respect of wheat sold for consumption in Australia, would be no justification for the applicaflour tion of a means test in this case. The weight primary purpose of this bill is to enable a home-consumption price for wheat to be eight, fixed; the provisions which relate to the granting of assistance to necessitous exceeding farmers, while important, are secondary of to the main purpose.",155
390,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Is anything being done control the price of bread?,155
391,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The legislation to be passed by the State parliaments will deal with that subject. It is anticipated on that the price of bread will be fixed at between 5|d. and 6d. a loaf.,155
392,Mr ANTHONY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"How will the farmers stand in relation to seed wheat? Mr SPEAKER,-Discussio n of the measure - by a series of questions and bounty will answers is irregular.",155
393,Sir EARLE PAGE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I think the honourable member may assume that the farmers will obtain their seed wheat at the equivalent of world parity price. I commend the bill to the House and hope that who it will have a speedy passage. Debate (on motion by Mr GREEN) MINISTERS OF STATE BILL 193S.

The place of these taxing bills in the wheat price stabilization scheme has already been largely explained by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) in his second-reading speech on the Wheat Industry Assistance Bill. It remains fdr me to explain the present motion and supporting bills merely as part of the legislative machinery for the collection of revenue by means of a flour tax. The subject-matter and the scope of the legislation is much the same as in the case of the flour tax legislation, which I introduced in 1933, and again in 1934. While the price of wheat, f.o.r., Williamstown, is less than 5s. 2d. a bushel, the effect will simply be to authorize the collection of a tax on flour consumed in Australia. The three features of this scheme which distinguish it from previous flour tax legislation are(1) The variable rate of the tax. (2) Thje more or leiss permanent character of the tax, that is, a tax designed to stabilize the price of wheat for home consumption for an indefinite period of time. (3) The provision for a tax on wheat growers when wheat prices rise above the point-5s . 2d. a bushel f.o.r. Williamstown-at which the tax on flour consumed in Australia will become unnecessary and will disappear. The significance of these three variations of the earlier flour taxes will appear upon an examination of the speech which the Minister for Commerce has just, delivered when introducing the Wheat Stabiliza- Industry Assistance Bill. Perhaps I under should add a few explanatory remarks Act 1938, about the variable rate of tax, and the provision for a tax on wheat-growers in times of high wheat prices. in the For an indefinite' period of time the over Five tax will be confined to flour consumed in Australia, supplemented by a' compeusating tax on the more or less negligible imports of flour, and of goods manufactured from flour. The rate of tax in this field will be' designed to provide a fund sufficient to return to wheat growers as a whole-and , in the main, on the basis of wheat individually produced-the equivalent of what they, as a whole, would receive if wheat for home consumption were sold at 5s. 2d. ii bushel, f.o.r Williamstown.' The rate of tax will vary according to the fluctuations of the price of wheat. It will increase when wheat prices fall, and will decrease when wheat prices rise. The tax on flour for home consumption will disappear when wheat is 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. Williamstown. The variations of the rate, and the period for which any particular rate - will be operative, will depend upon the recommendations of the Wheat Stabilization Advisory Committee as to the amount by which, and the time when, flour prices ought to be increased or decreased in consequence of rises and falls of wheat prices during the period in which the price of wheat does not exceed 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. Williamsthe town. It should not be assumed that the operation of the tax is at the discretion of the Wheat Stabilization Advisory Committee. Tho terms of the imposition make it quite clear that the tax is imposed by Parliament, and the control exercised by Parliament over the rate of the tax is evinced by the provision of a maximum rate of £7 10s. a ton of flour, and by the provision of a rigid formula for the variation of the rate within the limit set by the maximum. * The only real discretion delegated by Parliament to the committee is the selection, with due regard to fluctuations of wheat prices, of the appropriate times for variations of the rate of tax. The maximum rate of £7 10s. a ton is conceived as the rate which would be appropriate if wheat prices fall to the lowest point-abou t 2s. a bushel f.o.r Williamstown-to which they could reasonably be expected to fall. . The legislation provides that, in the event of wheat prices rising above 5s. 2d. a bushel, f.o.r. Williamstown, a portion of the excess shall be levied as a tax on the first purchase of wheat from the wheat-growers in Australia, and upon the export of wheat which has not, prior to export, been the subject of a sale to a person in Australia. This is the farmers' contribution to the stabilization scheme, and is an essential feature of the long range scheme visualized and recommended by the State Premiers. Its effect will be that, whereas consumers of certain wheat products, for example, bread and macaroni, will, in the interests of wheat-growers, bear the burden of the tax in times of unprofitable wheat prices, wheat-growers, in times of high wheat prices, will provide a fund designed to prevent increases of the prices of the.se products when wheat prices are high and, of course, profitable. Normally, this wheat tax will not amount to more than from one-fifth to one-fourth of the excess over 5s. 2d. of wheat price a bushel, f.o.r Williamstown. As in the case of the flour tax, the rate of tax depends, subject to the snecified maximum of Is. a bushel, upon recommendation of the Wheat Stabilization Advisory Committee. Parliamentary authority for the rate will be preserved by limiting the recommendations of the committee to a rate equal to such part of the excess of Williamstown wheat prices over 5s. 2d. a bushel as is proportionate to that part of the total Australian production of wheat, during the harvest year commencing* on the preceding first day of October, which is used for home consumption. The supporting machinery for the collection of tax imposed by the four separate taxing measures will be contained in the Flour Tax (Wheat Industry Assistance) Assessment Bill which will be introduced shortly. The four taxing measures are as follows:(1) The Flour Tax Bill, which imposes the tax on all flour sold by millers or used by them in the manufacture of goods other than flour: for example,, bread, self- ' raising flour. (2) The Flour Tax (Stocks) Bill, which imposes the tax on all flour held by persons other than millers, such as bakers and storekeepers, &c, at the commencement of the tax. This bill is necessary, not only to ensure that the tax is imposed on all flour for home consumption after the commencement of the tax, but also to obviate dislocation of the flour market by forward buying of flour in anticipation of the tax. (3) The Flour Tax (Imports and Exports) Bill : This provides, in the first place, for a tax on imported flour, and on the flour content of imported goods manufactured from flour. Such imports are at present almost negligible, but they would, no doubt, reach considerable proportions, and would also impose a serious competitive disability on. local flour, if they were not made subject to the tax. The same bill provides, in the second place, for the taxation of imported wheat. This part of the bill is complementary to the tax imposed by the ""Wheat Tax Bill on sales of. wheat in Australia. The operation of the export tax, which, like the imports tax, is a duty of customs, and is, .therefore, associated with that tax in the one measure, is a matter for the uncertain and, according to appearances, the fairly distant future when wheat prices rise above 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. liamstown. (4) The Wheat Tax Bill, which will impose a tax on the first sales of wheat to persons in Australia, and which, like the export tax, will only operate when, if ever, wheat prices rise above 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. Williamstown. The machinery for the collection of the taxes covered by the Assessment Bill, except for the export tax, which will be automatically collected by the Customs Department at the point of export, is practically the same as that provided by the earlier flour taxes, and is substantially borrowed from the sales tax law. The scope and subject-matter of the - Jtax for the present, and until the time Mr Casey. when wheat prices, if ever, rise above os. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. Williamstown, will also be practically the same as the scope and subject-matter of the earlier flour taxes. Broadly, the exemptions from the flour tax to millers and to holders of flour at the commencement of the tax, areFlour for use as or in the manufacture of certain foodstuffs for human consumption, viz., Breakfast foods. Foods for infants and invalids, if exempt from sales tax. Foods for the use of public hospitals, public benevolent institutions, religious organizations and organizations for the relief of the unemployed. Flour for use as or in the manufacture of foods for animals and birds. Flour for use in the manufacture of goods other than foodstuffs. Flour for export or for use in the Northern Territory. Bran and pollard. The general scheme of the exemptions is to remove the burden of the tax from flour when it is used to produce goods directly competitive with goods which are not produced from flour; that is, breakfast foods produced from : other cereals. Nearly the whole of the tax will fall on flour which is used in the production of bread, and the remaining field of the tax will be principally represented by flour for use in the manufacture of biscuits, macaroni, spaghetti and verWil- micelli. It is considered that the goods within the field of the tax are not in any direct or appreciable sense competitive with other* goods. Millers, as formerly,, will be required to furnish returns and to pay tax within 21 days after the close of the month in which they have sold the flour or used it in the manufacture of other goods. Persons-for example, bakers and storekeepers-holdin g flour in stock in excess of 1,000 lb. at the commencement of the tax, will be required to furnish a return and pay the tax, if it does not exceed £5, on or before the Sth December, 1938. If the tax exceeds £5, they will be permitted to pay £5 or 20 per cent, of the tax, whichever is the greater, on or before the 8th December, 1938,,. and the balance by equal monthly instalments of 20 per cent, of the tax or £5, whichever is the greater, point. except where, in any month, the unpaid balance is less than £5, in which case the instalment shall be the amount of the balance. .Flour in transit to any person on the 5th December, 1938, shall be deemed to be held in stock by him on that date. Tax is payable on flour produced millers from wheat stipplied by wheat growers for gristing, and will also be agreed topayable by wheat-growers, if wheat prices should exceed 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. W i liamstown, on wheat supplied by them to millers for gristing. Flour will be deemed to be sold by a the miller at the time when he parts with all possession of the flour. W it h the exception of certain cases in which the property in wheat is transferred without a contract for the sale of the wheat, wheat will be sold at the time when the contract for the sale of wheat is entered into, and the rate of tax applicable to the sale will be the rate in force at that time. Severe penalties are provided for the evasion of tax by failure to furnish returns or by furnishing false returns. adjourned.

402,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Henty) [5.57] - I warmly associate myself with the congratulations extended to the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) on the constructive speech that he made in this chamber a week ago upon constitution alteration. The right honourable gentleman must indeed be gratified at the general acclaim with which his speech has been hailed. Rarely in the history of this Parliament has a speech been received with such unanimous approval and, indeed, with so much promise of being translated into action. At the same time, we should be careful at this stage to realise that sweeping alterations of the Constitution such as were contemplated by the right honourable gentleman, no matter how strong might be the unanimity among honourable members of this Parliament, must meet with controversy and opposition. I have been interested in the proposal of the Government that next year a special Constitution session of this Parliament should be held. I think that that is an excellent proposal. I venture to suggest, however, that it is desirable before such a session is held, to draft constitution alterations, a committee of the whole House should be set up by the Government to do the initial drafting. I think that the proposals that are put to the people should be representative of as much unanimity as is attainable, and that they should be the subject of as little criticism, opposition and division in Parliament as is possible, if they are to have their full influence on the people. Furthermore the submission of the proposals to the people should not follow too swiftly upon their passage through this House. In the past some referendum proposals have failed to meet with the approval of the people because of the brief period in which they have been before the electors. Some would, I believe, have met with approval had the electors had a longer time in which to study tbem. During a brief campaign of six or seven weeks the case of those who favour alterations is subjected to every kind of misrepresentation and exaggeration which cannot be answered convincingly in such a short period. Therefore, I trust that if the House agrees to certain proposed alterations of the Constitution, which may be of a far-reaching character, the referendum will not be taken until the following year. That would enable those who subscribed to the proposed alterations to use their best endeavours to set up a great organization throughout the Commonwealth with district committees to engage in an. effective affirmative campaign. I return again to the unfortunate decision of the Government to persevere with the present voluntary system of training. We must accept the view of the Government that Australia is in a dangerous position. In September last it suddenly rushed Australia's defence forces into a state of preparedness for war, and we are not yet out of danger. Europe today presents an extremely ugly appearance. International ill-feeling is running as high today as it was two months ago - Trouble is possible at any time. I again protest most strongly against the perpetuation of the voluntary system of training. It is grossly unfair that at a time of national danger the defence of this country should be left to those who are prepared to volunteer, and that young men who are unwilling to offer for voluntary service are allowed to carry on their work and recreation without interference. The obligation should be upon all young men. I believe that that is the opinion of a majority of honourable members supporting the Government, including a substantial number of Cabinet Ministers. We are therefore justified in concluding that the persistence with the voluntary system is due to a decision of the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons), who is not true to himself in the attitude which he has adopted. When I speak of compulsory military training, I do not mean the universal training of all our young manhood, which would extend very little further than the voluntary system that is now being persisted in. We should approach this subject in a spirit of realism tinged with imagination. We should conjure up in our minds what would happen if a strong raiding force secured a footing at some vital point on the Australian coast. Let us visualize what such a conflict would be between a hostile raiding party and Australian troops trained under the voluntary system. The raiding party would consist of highly-trained men, many of whom would be veterans, who would be opposed by unfortunate volunteers who had attended drills for perhaps ten days in each year. Trainees do not attend all drills. Moreover, the physical standard of the trainees in recent years has been lowered. If war came, probably 250,000 young men would be called up to reinforce the militia. I do not like to think what would actually happen in such circumstances, but it would be scarcely less than murder. It would be outrageous to place young men in such a disastrous position. The subsequent sacrifice is too awful to contemplate. If a raiding force took possession of such a centre as Newcastle, Sydney or Melbourne and was able to dig in and to keep its sea communications open, the wastage of life in rid of it would be terrific. Notwithstanding this, a minority of Ministers in a divided Cabinet is acting against the advice of its experts. I am discussing this subject, not from the point of view of winning a war on Australian soil, but from that of making this country's defences so strong that an enemy would not be able even to make a successful raid upon it. In the first place, the Government should restore the area officers and register and classify our young manhood. Having done so, it should take by ballot, say, 15,000 to 20,000 young men and put them in training for a period of three or four months. When they had completed their training, they could be placed in reserve and another similar number could be brought in. I throw out the suggestion because I think it is worthy of consideration. The adoption of such a policy would mean that there would be from 15,000 to 20,000 in training and, within two years, from 60,000 to 80,000 trained men would be available. There would then not be the fear of invasion which hangs over this country and which is likely to hang over it so long as we adhere to the present unsatisfactory system. I submit this proposal and make a special appeal to honourable members opposite to give it their careful consideration. Every large force must consist in the main of workers. At present, we invite them to enlist under the voluntary system, but scarcely any training is provided. That would still be the position if the strength of the militia were doubled. I now wish to refer to the tribunal sitting in Melbourne investigating the cause of the Eyeema tragedy. When that committee was appointed, T entered my protest in the strongest possible terms, and I repeat that protest today. I think it utterly unsatisfactory that the present committee should be entrusted with this inquiry into an accident which led to the loss of many Australian lives. I say frankly that the Government is completely mistaken if it thinks that the report of this inquiry will command any respect from the public. It will not. The purpose of the inquiry is not merely to ascertain whether or not the pilot getting erred or whether there was anything wrong with the machine; it goes far deeper than that; its purpose is to ascertain whether the Civil Aviation Board itself was, by negligence, responsible for the disaster, and, following through, whether the Defence Department, the Minister for Defence at that time, and the Cabinet as a whole share any responsibility for it. I suppose that^ since justice was first dispensed in Australia, there is no precedent for the extraordinary spectacle we had yesterday when Mr Johnston, ControllerGeneral of Civil Aviation went into the witness box and gave evidence before a tribunal on which were sitting in judgment upon that evidence two ot his subordinate officers. The whole thing is a travesty of iu3tice. I cannot understand the national government of a country first of all eyer having set up such a tribunal, nor can I understand it persisting in it for a day longer. We are all familiar with the very high traditional practice of judges of the Sigh Court and of magistrates and justices of the peace, of instantly retiring from a case, if it occurs to them, or if any one hints, that they might be in any personal or material way interested in it. There is, I think, no greater tribute to the purity of our justice than that practice. But here we have had these officers in Melbourne challenged by counsel. Members of the Government examined the position and the tribunal goes on unchallenged. That, to me, is a mockery of justice. Because of a certain thickness of sensibility on the part of the Government, suspicion arises that there is someone to b& shielded, something to be concealed.",160
403,Mr MAHONEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Does the honourable member think there is something ""crook "" about it?",162
404,Sir HENBY GULLETT,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"No ; but. in my opinion, the Government is extraordinarily unwise and foolish to place itself in this position and to continue to remain m it. It is beyond all credence that interested parties, officers of the tion Board, which is deeply and closely interested in this hearing, should be allowed to continue to be members of the committee of inquiry. make the simple and. direct suggestion to the Government that the inquiry should have been entrusted to a justice of the High Court or of the Supreme Court. One member of the committee, however, Colonel E. F. Herring, E.Ci, would make an admirable single commissioner and would command the respect of all the Australian people. gest to the Government that, even at this belated hour, the committee should be reconstituted and that Colonel Herring be appointed a royal commissioner to inquire into the facts of this disaster. There would be no necessity for a rehearing of evidence and there would be no waste of time, because Colonel Herring has already heard all of the evidence. Another ""matter which I wish to discuss briefly is the progress made by the Oil Research Committee. I am particularly interested in this matter because the decision of the Government to set aside £250,000 for oil research arose out of a submission which I made to Cabinet when I was a member of the Government. This was, in a sense, a gambling proposal, but a legitimate gamble in the national interest, to engage in a very active prosecution of the search for oil by the provision of a subsidy for those companies already engaged in oil research. I contemplated, as I think did every member of the Cabinet at that time, that the money would be expended as expeditiously as was economically possible. I find, however, that from the 28th May, 1936, to June, 1938, some £14,500 was expended on wages and travelling' expenses, and only £18,400 on subsidies. In other words, all I achieved in bringing this matter before Cabinet, and all the Cabinet itself achieved in adoptino' the scheme which provided for the expenditure of a large amount of the taxpayers' money, has been to provide a cosy job for the members of the Oil Research Committee. That, to me,, is totally un satisfactory.. I do not hold the present Minister for the Interior (Mr MCEwen) responsible for the position. It had existed for some time before he took conCivil Aviatrol of his department that. Sir HENRY GULLETT.^-I know I that his administration of his department is very exacting. I raise the matter merely to call his' attention to it, and to express the strong hope that he will press on with a wise expenditure of the money. I might add that there has been a further expenditure of £50,000 on the purchase of two drilling plants, one of which is in action at the Roma field I sug- in Queensland, and the other in East Gippsland. I venture to say that if any one with the least familiarity with the prospects of oil discovery in Australia were asked where the two drilling machines should be located, in 99 cases out of 100' the reply would bo that 1 one should be put down at Roma and the other at East Gippsland. Whilst I do not wish to cast any reflection upon the personnel of the committee, I would very much like to see some new outside blood engaged in the search for oil in Australia. We have been at work for years, and so far have got nowhere> yet we still persist with the Same experts whose services we have utilized all through.",162
405,Mr HUTCHINSON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The claim has been made by certain people that they can find oil.,163
406,Sir HENRY GULLETT,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I have no technical knowledge of this subject; I merely endeavour to take a common sense view of it. I would like, however, to express on behalf of a number of those enaged in oil research, who as far as I know, are completely reputable people- I do not know them personally- a protest at the almost interminable delays which have taken place in respect of matters which have cropped up between them and the Oil Research Committee. They also complain of the lack of courtesy on the part of the members of the committee. These arc serious charges which I would not express unless I thought they had some basis of fact behind them. I trust that the Postmaster-General (Mr Archie Cameron), who is now in charge of the committee, will at least dome the honour of listening to my remarks. I take it that the Minister in charge of the debate sometimes' does pay some attention, and sometimeseven makes a note Or two', when honourable members take the troifble to prepare speeches and deliver them.",163
407,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I could repeat every statement which the honourable member has made. Sir HEN RY GULLETT - The Postmaster-General has paid no attention to what I have been saying.,163

411,Mr WILSON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Wimmera) [5.29] Apart from the huge amounts provided for interest payments, the most important item in the budget is the provision for defence. No one who has studied the recent trend of events can deny the need for defence. I do not wish to criticize too severely what the Government has done to provide fortifications, and land, sea and air services of one kind and another. I shall merely observe that its whole' programme and procedure could be improved. Our defence policy requires careful re-examination. I hope that the Government will be fortunate in its advisers in this connection, and that the steps which it has taken so far, and which it may take in the future, will not be misinterpreted by other powers. Our only desire-and this should be emphasized-is to defend ourselves^ maintain our free institutions, and govern ourselves as we desire. I hate the very thought of war; but I am forced to the conclusion that, though we may strain every nerve to ensure world appeasement and disarmament, we must,, at the same time, do our best to remove the economic and other anomalies and injustices that exist among the nations. Only by adopting that policy shall we be able to assist in the achievement of world appeasement and peace. I doubt whether it will ever be possible for us, with our limited manpower, to develop military and other defence forces sufficient to ensure absolute safety. Eor that reason, among others, I strongly advocate a policy of negotiation with other countries to draft treaties for the adjustment of economic injustices and other complaints. It is encumbent upon us to do everything, in our power to maintain and protect our free industries, and to develop our great inheritance imperfect though it may be at present. We should strive our utmost to develop the great resources of this country which have been explored and revealed by our pioneers. I ant convinced that many of in- our hardships could be alleviated if our problems were faced courageously. Many of our developmental difficulties could assuredly be overcome. In regard to defence, I shall offer several suggestions which appeal to my common sense, as a layman, and which, J believe will receive the endorsement of many other honourable members. It has been suggested in the press that the Government should expend a vast sum of money, even as much as £15,000,000, in the purchase of a battleship. Whilst I agree that our defence equipment should be as up to date as possible, I do not think that we can afford to purchase a battleship at that price. The expenditure of £15,000,000 on aircraft would be much more effective, having in mind our vast distances and our long coastline. I can see ho reason why we should not build, in Australia, all the aircraft that we need here. This, in my opinion, would develop a most valuable industry. It would also be wise to spend money on the provision of submarines and fast-moving ocean-going craft, a policy which is being adopted to a greater degree than ever before in connection with the British Navy. Such vessels could also be built in Australia. We ought, in my opinion, to build our own merchantmen. It is deplorable that the ship-ibuilding industry which, before the war, and also during the war, was established in a reasonably efficient way in this country, has been allowed to languish. We have built one cruiser, some destroyers, and several ocean-going freight ships in Australia. At one time we had a flourishing shipbuilding industry with a skilled personnel doing good work in the national interests. We should be ashamed of ourselves, particularly in view of our claim to be self-dependent, that practically whole of our export trade is carried by ships not on the Australian register. It is to the everlasting discredit of this Government and previous governments, that no effective steps have been taken to revive our ship-building industry -1 suppose that our people pay not less than £10,000,000 a year in freight charges to shipping firms whose vessels are not registered in this country. In my opinion, the greatest failure of the Government lies in the fact that it has failed to awaken a great national spirit among our people. In years gone by Australians had a deep love for their country and were prepared to make great sacrifices for it. That spirit has been dissipated, I believe, because our governwe ments are not actuated today by Ur. Wilson. altruistic ideals, and do not make any real appeal to the democracy. They are concerned too much with commercial activities. The needs of the great masses of the people have not been met. Vested interests have been allowed to develop, and unsound policy in many other directions has caused the stagnation of development. This is serious in a young country like Australia. I have heard many other honourable members refer to this subject, and also to the need for increasing our birth rate, which unhappily, has declined to an unsatisfactory figure. This state of affairs must be altered. We should, in this Parliament, make a careful search for the reasons for this stagnation and endeavour to remedy them. Broadly speaking, the cause of our troubles is the lack of a sense of economic security by the great mass of the people, and the loss of markets for our exportable primary products. We have sacrificed some of these markets, and have, I am afraid, permanently lost them. Although T represent an electorate which is principally concerned in primary production, I say deliberately that we must direct attention to the development of sound secondary industries in Australia in order to provide careers for our rising generation. The Government has fallen down on its job in this connection. There should be no need for large numbers of our people to be unemployed. The attention of the Government snould be devoted the to the development of a sense of economic security among our people as a whole. I believe that there is a simple solution of our troubles if the Government had the courage to adopt it. Undoubtedly, many of our younger people are today indifferent to their responsibilities as citizens in consequence of their sense of social insecurity. Defence measures are not likely to be regarded with great enthusiasm by people who feel economically insecure, and who are not guaranteed a reasonable standard of living. The solution of our problems is much simpler than some honourable gentlemen who support the Government would have us believe. We must not allow ourselves to be guided absolutely by history. Rather should clear away the cobwebs that cloud our outlook. Then we should see the vay to progress. We must tackle our problems in a more progressive way than WB have done hitherto. This country is capable of producing more food than our people need, and we could provide here probably a higher standard of living than that enjoyed by the people of any other nation. I accuse the Government of lack of courage in its approach to these great national problems. It is culpable to the extent that, possessed as it has been of almost unlimited knowledge secured from the reports of many committees of inquiry and royal commissions, it has almost invariably displayed weakness and timidity in putting into effect the recommendations of these costly bodies of inquiry. These committees and commissions have, in the main, dealt in a practical manner with the problems which they have investigated. One has only to point to a few of their findings to expose the vacillating attitude of the Government. The Development and Migration Commission was appointed some years ago. Had its recommendations been followed, much loss in regard to settlement would have been avoided. Then the Wheat Commission pointed the way towards a solution of the problems affecting the wheat industry; but here again the Government would go only part of the way indicated, and as the result, the industry is still labouring under serious disabilities. Another royal commission was appointed to inquire into monetary and banking systems. Contrary to. expectations, as has been pointed out by a number of honourable members, that commission made recommendations which jhave received the general approval of the people of Australia. It was believed that, if put into effect, those recommendations would have been instrumental in giving the country a better system of finance, but the Government is showing weakness in this connection also. Although the commission's report has been available for more than a year, nothing has yet been done to introduce legislation to implement its recommendations. Patronisingly, yet fearfully, the Government has consulted the private banks, apparently not being satisfied with the work of the commission which it appointed. It appears to me that the reason for this is that the recommendations of the commission are a definite challenge to the privileges of these powerful concerns. The Government has subverted a great national need to expediency, and it now stands hesitating between the devil and the deep sea, apparently placing the trading interests of the banks before the welfare of the people. It has, however, promised that a mortgage bank bill will be brought down to provide for long-term mortgages, and I hope that we shall see the consummation of that promise before the House goes into recess. Such a measure would be of great assistance to industry generally and to primary industry in particular, because primary industries must have long-term credit at a low rate of interest if they are to function satisfactorily. According to cable messages published in the press recently, a trade agreement has been concluded between the Dominion of Canada and the TJnited States of America. The principal concessions granted to the TJnited States of America by Canada, to the detriment of Australian producers, are on lemons, dried fruits, and canned fruits. This is a vital matter to Australian fruit growers. The Canadian market for Australian dried fruit is second in importance only to the British market. It would appear, therefore, that the Government has not been alive to this threat to Australia's valuable trade with a sister dominion. If should have been more active in the interests of the fruit growing industry, which is highly developed in the electorate I represent. I shall be very pleased to learn if the Government has taken any steps for its protection. Other cable messages referring to an Anglo-American Trade Treaty, indicate that that agreement involves concessions on the British market amounting to £169,000,000 in favour of the United States of America. This is a great inroad on the Australian fruit exporting trade, and I am very disappointed at the bad results which followed the visit of the Australian Trade Delegation to the United Kingdom. The figure which I have quoted is based on the 1938 trade figures. Of that large amount, £50,000,000 applies to farm products. Obviously, that will be a grave disadvantage to Australian farm products on the United Kingdom market. It calls for very firm action on the part of the Commonwealth Government, which has not been so well represented at trade conferences as it should have been. I am supported in my view by figures which were published in the Melbourne SunPictorial some months ago. That newspaper published the following article:Australia ranks third in the countries of the world as an importer of British goods and second as an exporter of her own products to United Kingdom markets. Official returns for 1937 issued to-night by the Commonwealth Statistician (Dr Wilson) showed that during the year Australia took .British goods worth £37.530.725 sterling, compared with £41.432,399 taken by South Africa nnd £39.103.728 by British India. The TJnited States of America was Britain's best foreign customer with purchases valued at £31,424,519, .but this by no means' balanced United States exports to Britain , worth £114,248.943. This huge total placed America first in the list of exporters to Great Britain . Australia was third in the world and second in the Empire with £71,805.371, being exceeded by Canada with £88,380,294. A. significant feature in view of the coming trade discussions was that the Argentine and Denmark, which are particular rivals of Australia in meat and dairy produce respectively, supplied between them £90,000,000 worth of goods for British markets. On the other hand, Australia bought more from Great Britain than these two rival countries combined. If Groat Britain, to which Australia has given many advantages on its own markets, is not prepared to reciprocate in. a reasonable manner, Australia should investigate prospects in other countries for the marketing of its exportable products. After all, these are matters of business, and sentiment should not be taken too much into consideration. Unless legislative action is taken, merchants in Great Britain will buy on any market where they can obtain the best deal. We have been told by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) that the wheat preference, which we have lost as the result of the negotiations to which I have referred, was not of very much value. That is a complete denial of the statement which was made to this Parliament and to the Australian people when that favourable concession was obtained. Mr Wilson. At that time, the right honourable gentleman stated emphatically that it represented a great victory, and would be cf distinct advantage to Australia. Now le says that it was not worth worrying about. A proper opportunity has not been afforded to honourable members to give expression to their opinions on trade questions until it has been too late and valuable preferences have been lost. Tbey need not have been lost if a firm attitude had been t«ken up by the Government. In a typically ambiguous statement on the Anglo-American trade treaty, in which loss of preferences had to be admitted, the Minister for Commerce recently tried to gloss over that admission, but his explanation will not be very satisfactory to the primary producers of Australia. I have never heard of a royal commission being appointed in Australia to inquire on a proper national basis into the great problem of unemployment. It is a problem which appears to have continuity. Conditions exist in the world today which make the need, for labour less urgent that it was a century ago. I need not amplify this, other than to say that the development of machinery in the last few decades has decreased the demand' for manual labour in industry. We have been working to produce machinery which has had the effect of creating' unemployment. Therefore, we must accept our responsibilities to our fellow men who, apparently, are not needed in the industrial scheme, and must make provision for them accordingly. That is a national responsibility which we as a Commonwealth Parliament cannot continue permanently to pass on to the States. I regret that yesterday, when a motion for the adjournment of the House was moved by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) to discuss the matter of unemployment, the discussion was gagged by the Government.",163
412,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The honourable member can discuss unemployment now,",166
413,Mr WILSON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I know that.,166
414,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The motion moved yesterday was merely obstruction.,166
415,Mr WILSON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"It was not obstruction. It was an attempt by the Opposition, which particularly, but not exclusively, represents that section of the community, to have unemployment discussed, and it was reprehensible for the Government to gag the discussion. Time should have, been allowed for honourable members to suggest ways and means to solve the unemployment problem, the severity of which is increasing, not ouly in the secondary industries, but also in rural industries, as the result of adverse seasonal conditions. The Government may cite figures to show an improvement of the position, but we know very well that, far from there being an improvement, the numbers of unemployed show an upward trend. It is admitted, of course, that some improvement did occur some time ago, but now the trend is the other way. At no time has this problem been dealt with and solved. ""We have always had a number of unemployed in this country, and I submit that there is something wrong when Australia, which is able to produce sufficient goods to give a high standard of living to the people who are willing to work for the benefit of this country",166
416,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"""What about the ones who are unwilling? Mr ""WILSON - I have no sympathy with them, but they form a very small percentage of the population. ""We must provide for the honest people, who are willing to play their part as members of the community. The Commonwealth Government should make funds available for developmental works. The time is opportune to do so, particularly in the rural areas which have suffered so severely from drought. Much has been said about the need to standardize railway gauges. Standardization of the gauges is a work that is well worth undertaking. Apart from that, we have insufficient railways. There should be built cross-country lines to connect existing lines. This work, if undertaken, would be of benefit, not only for defence, but also to the rural populations, because it would facilitate the transfer of stock from drought-stricken areas to fresh pastures. Some years ago, there was a project for the construction of a railway line from Ouyen, in my electorate, to connect with the many lines which go in a northerly direction from Melhonrne. If that line had been built, the iourney from Adelaide to Sydney would have been shortened by 200 miles. It is not too late now to undertake that work. Another public work that should exercise the minds of Ministers and of honourable members is the construction of better and additional roads. There is also a great need for water conservation and irrigation projects. This country is subject to frequent drought visitations, even in areas in which great rivers flow. If steps were taken to conserve the water supply in those rivers, the country would be able to support many more thousands of people. I do not consider that much could be done in the hinterland to make it fit to carry considerable population, but in the more settled areas considerable progress could be achieved by the application of a policy for the conservation of our rivers. I commend all of these matters to the earnest consideration of the Commonwealth Government. There is today a great tightening of credit and it would appear that, unless something is done to arrest the deflationary tendency, the country will soon be in a depression of greater depth than, that from which we emerged a few years ago. It is incumbent upon this Government to use that great facility which it has at its command, the Commonwealth Bank, to prevent this deflationary period, for which there is no need. I am reminded of what happened in the last depression when production, both primary and secondary, was greater than we had ever previously experienced. The warehouses were jammed with the foodstuffs and clothing, but, because of the false situation created by the banks, there were hungry and ill-clad personsstanding alongside of plenty. There is something wrong with an economy which allows such a condition of affairs, and any government which stands idly by without taking steps to prevent its return is not worthy of the confidence and support of the people. If this Government does that, the people will know how to deal with it. They will not put up with the humbug that they suffered on the last occasion I am concerned with the thousands of young people in Australia who have no prospects for the future, unless the Government takes action. I commend the Government for having provided money for the training of youths and I hope that it will ensure that the States wisely expend it, but more money should be made available. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to make this money available, because the powers of the States to tax and borrow are limited. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will give encouragement to the establishment of more and more industries in Australia in order to absorb into industry, not only youths, but also all other unemployed persons. I have in mind particularly . the establishment of the shipbuilding industry to which I have already referred, and the establishment of an Australian motor car manufacturing industry. Immigration is a difficult problem and I sympathize with the Government in its efforts to solve it. I , personally, should not shut the door on any one who wanted to come to Australia provided he did not come into conflict with the White Australia policy. But we have a responsibility to our own people and I hope that due rogard will be paid to them in the consideration of the resumption of immigration. The former chancellor of the University of Melbourne, Dr R. E. Priestly, said in an articleI am convinced that Australia today is the safest country in the world to live in, and I am glad that my daughter is remaining here. I dp not believe that Japan is the immediate menace some people think she is; and the dangers of Europe are very far away. But, just because of her enviable situation, however, Australia ought to be putting herself in a position to exorcise leadership in world affairs. That is the burden of my remarks. I do wish to see Australia take a leading part in world affairs and I do not want it to be, as it were, simply saying "" Yes"" to everything that the Motherland does. I want Australia to realise its nationhood and to have a say in shaping the policy of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I hope that the Government will take cognizance of what I have said and that it will launch out on a vigorous policy of advancement for this grand country of ours.",167
417,Unknown,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 7.S0 p.m.,168
418,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Barton) . [7.30] - I am very glad that the Government proposes to review the Constitution with a view to bringing about a re-alignment of powers, as between the Commonwealth and the States in the light of developments in our national life since federation was inaugurated. We are indebted to the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) for having raised this matter in the able speech which he delivered last week, and also to the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies) for his lucid explanation of the difficulties involved. I suggest that the last referendum failures were due mainly to the methods adopted in submitting the issues to the people. Generally speaking, sufficient time is not allowed to enable the issues to be fully explained, whilst there is too great a tendency to decide the matter involved on party political lines. The referendum of 1937, on the question as to whether the Commonwealth should be given complete control of marketing and aviation, fully illustrates this point. In that instance the impression was given at the outset that the Commonwealth was seeking control over the marketing of only four or five products, and, as the result, the people doubted whether the Government was in earnest in taking the referendum. It was not until the Attorney-General, in reply to a wire which he received from a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, stated that if the referendum were carried in respect of the marketing proposals, future Commonwealth governments would be empowered tofixthe price of all primary commodities, including meat and other products of our great pastoral industry, that the people understood what was really involved. In giving that reply the only reservation made by the Attorney-General was that the term ""marketing"" would have to be defined by the High Court. In my view, the Commonwealth has invariably approached these referendums in a way which was calculated to defeat any proposal submitted. Each referendum has been preceded by wrangling between the Commonwealth and the States; yet, the Commonwealth never failed to appeal to every section of the community to cooperate for the success of the referendum. Furthermore, there was a tendency to create the impression in the public mind that each referendum involved a fight as between the Commonwealth and the States. I heartily support the proposal that a convention should be held to review the Constitution, and I suggest that the Commonwealth should not shirk its responsibility to take the initiative immediately in this respect. Australians are sick and tired of continual wrangling between the Commonwealth and the States as to their respective powers in various spheres. As one honourable member suggested this afternoon, it has been a case of the Commonwealth endeavouring to ""pass the buck"" to the States, and vice versa. The people cannot be expected to fall for this kind of dope for ever. They are anxious that the national Farliament should be endowed with sufficient powers to enable it to weld this nation into one great unit. I am of opinion that any proposals resulting from the deliberations of the convention, which it is suggested should be held, will be accepted by the people, so long as one of the issues be the abolition of the State parliaments. It is difficult of to get the smaller States to see eye to eye with the larger States on many matters, but I suggest that 75 per cent, of the existing difficulties of the smaller States would disappear if the national Parliament were really enabled to function as a national Parliament should. The conflict as between the smaller and the larger States is repeatedly reflected in debates which take place in this Parliament. In that respect, however, we can say at least this much for the representatives of the larger States, that they have never objected to any just demand upon them in order to enable the smaller States to overcome their difficulties. Because of their limited resources some States can never hope to develop beyond a certain degree. It is time that we put an end to such anomalies as was illustrated by the Attorney General, when he pointed out the difficulties arising as the result of divided control between the Commonwealth and the States, for instance, in respect of transport and aviation. Because of this division of authority even those powers which the Commonwealth possessed in relation to such matters were nullified. The people of Australia are tired of this situation. They realise now that there is no necessity for seven different parliaments in this country. I entertain some doubt, however, as to whether the present Cabinet, because of the strong representation within it of the smaller States, will be capable of handling so important an issue as that of constitution reform along the lines I have indicated. For instance, the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) comes from one of the smaller States is very significant in this connection, particularly should any conflict arise between the interests of the smaller and-those of the larger States. I propose now to deal with the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act passed last session. When handling that legislation the Treasurer (Mr Casey) adhered too slavishly to the guidance of Sir Walter Kinnear. I suggest that had the Government been more disposed to listen to the views expressed course by many honourable members, who were well qualified to offer advice on this subject, we should have enacted legislation which would have proved more acceptable to the people of Australia as a whole. Even now the Government should take the opportunity to make the scheme more liberal. [Quorum formed J. The Government brought out Sir Walter Kinnear from Great Britain to investigate local conditions with a view to framing a scheme along the lines of the British scheme. That gentleman was afforded every facility in his investigations in this country. Too long a period was occupied by him ' in preparing a scheme of national insurance, and even when the measure was submitted to this Parliament, there was no provision in it for widows and children. Had the Government framed a more liberal scheme similar to that embodied in the British legislation, there would not have been much objection to the bill. Before the scheme becomes operative on the 1st May of next year, the Government should give it further consideration so that it may be more acceptable to those who have to come under it. When the bill was under discussion in this chamber, I stated that I was exceedingly disappointed to find that the Treasurer not made any provision for sickarrears ness of juveniles between fourteen and sixteen years of age, but evenchallenged tually . a paltry Id . was added, increasing the rateto 5d., which I sider was the height of meanness. 'Che attitude of the Treasurer during passage of the bill through this chamber was discreditable to him and to the Government of which he is a member. believe that the scheme will have to altered before it will receive the support of the people.",168
419,Mr GANDER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,---Why did the honourable member support it?,170
420,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I regarded it as the founever, dation of an important social reform. Some members of the Cabinet did not understand the bill. ' One Minister came to the rescue of the Treasurer and read prepared speech. I warn the Government that if it does not make the supplemenreceipt tary proposals more liberal, some honorcapital able members will have to consider seriously whether they will continue Support the Government's policy in respect. I now wish to direct the attention the Government to the activities of War Service Homes Commission,, particu- £200. larly in connection, with the treatment meted out to some occupiers of war vice homes. In discussing a taxation bill yesterday, we were informed that,, when a, taxpayer is unable to pay his tax, can appeal toa tribunal which can, i it thinks fit, remit the tax, and that over a period hundreds of thousands have been so remitted. If such consideration is extended to taxpayers, why should not similar consideration tended to occupiers of war service homes, who, through circumstances beyond their Control, have been unable to pay their rents? Some of these unfortunate men Lang Government. bave been unable to pay their rent for five or six years, and the accumulated arrears amount in some instances to £200 or £300. A committee appointed to deal with such cases decided that if the tenants were unable to pay the rent stipulated by committee, they should not be evicted. We find, however, that in some instances the commission has been acting as rackployed, renting landlords by demanding that tenants shall make up their arrears. had It is true that in. some cases the have been capitalized. The power of the commission cannot be in a court of law. In order to test the commission's authority conin that respect, I attended a court on behalf of an individual who was prosethe cuted, but I discovered that I had no standing. I decided to employ a solicitor, but he assured me that I would be I wasting my money, as he had no standing be in the court. Eventually the magistrate withdrew the case temporarily to permit me to make a statement on behalf of the person who bad been prosecuted, and after hearing me told me that I had really no right to appear. I asked him, howto extend the period of 30 days which he could grant, to 60 days, to enable me to fight the matter out with the commission. I believe that in some instances no demand a is made for the payment of a portion of the arrears unless the occupant is in of £2 or £2 10s. a week. The Value of some of the homes is ridiculously high. The Crown Solicitor to was instructed to prosecute in the case this of a man who had vacated his home eighteen months previously and was of having small deductions made from the his wages to defray a debt of about Under an arrangement made a month or two previously, the arrears serwere reduced, but the commission said that it did not know that this man's wages were being garnisheed. Some of he these men who have been occupying war f service homes for eight Or nine years have had only interniittenf relief work for of pounds four or five years. Mr GANDER.^Tha't is due to-, the be expolicy of the Stevens Government. MV. LANE - The Stevens Government has done very well. It has taken it a long time to clear up the mes3 left by the It was not my intention to discuss unemployment at this juncture, but as the subject has been raised in interjection, I may say that the Deputy Leader of the the Opposition - (Mr Forde) moved the adjournment of the House yesterday, not with the object of assisting the unembut merely to obstruct business. the Honourable members opposite have endeavoured to show that the unemploymerit situation has gone from bad to worse sinco this Government came into power. Everybody knows that the basic principles laid down in the Ottawa Agreement have operated to the great advantage of Australian primary and secondary industries, which have been able to increase the volume of employment. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Wilson) this afternoon alluded to what he termed the interference by the Commonwealth Government with the trade agreement that has just been concluded between Great Britain and the United States of America. I ean understand why the honourable gentleman would say that. He is supposed to represent country interests, whose chief concern is to the highest price possible for primary products. T well remember the speech delivered by Mr Bruce in which he declared that the Ottawa Agreement was an object lesson to the world) and an example of the mutual benefit flowing from the interchange of commodities between the countries concerned. The making of the Ottawa Agreement was the direct result of the policy of economic nationalism favoured by the governments of many European countries. The overseas market for Australian primary products was gradually contracting, and the outlook for our producers was becoming extremely grave."" The improvement of trade between Great Britain and Australia has greatly benefited this country and, as I have shown, it has been responsible for a marked decline of unemployment figures. Honourable members opposite have endeavoured to persuade the people that the Labour Government led by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) had made possible this favourable development in our overseas trade position ; but we know that it is due entirely to the good work done by the Lyons Government since it came into office in 1932. Unemployment in Australia is .not acute. On the contrary, and as the result of this Government's policy to encourage the expansion of industries, there has been a well-sustained improvement of the employment figures. Figures given to the committee last night prove the truth of this statement. These figures, I may add, were supplied by the trade unions, which, as we know, are, but only for the time being, anti-Lang. 1 do not attach much importance to the differences between the two Labour factions in New South Wales. Recently, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) endeavoured unsuccessfully to briug these contending Labour organizations together, and I think he now realizes that, the driving force behind the trade union movement consists mainly of men whose principal concern is to look after their own interest, rather than that of the unemployed. I do not think there is very much difference between these two rival Labour groups'. The real policy of the Australian. Labour partysocialization of the means of production, secure distribution and exchange-wa s laid down 30 years ago. That policy still stands, though in recent years there has been a disposition to whittle it down somewhat. In plain terms,' it means control by the Government of the means of production, distribution and exchange.",170
421,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Hear , hear! The policy has never changed..",171
422,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Ye s it has, but the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) is about the only man in the ranks of honourable members opposite who has the courage to advocate the original policy today. Although Labour has been in power in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, it has never made an attempt to give effect to that plank of its platform. Socialization of the moans of production, distribution and exchange means a general levelling, of all classes of people in the community; it means that every person must work to live. We see it in operation in Soviet Russia and, to a lesser degree, in Nazi. Germany where the governments appropriate a certain proportion of capital wealth for general distribution among the people. In the last analysis, socialism means the conscription of labour in the interests of the State. Bernard. Shaw has had much to say on this subject.",171
423,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,He knows something about it .,171
424,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"And he has greater courage than the honourable member for Batman, who, I am quite sure, would not be plucky enough to tell the industrialists of Yictoria that if Labour were returned to power in the Commonwealth Parliament, it would take the shortest route to the socialization of industry the breaking down of the existing financial system. The honourable member for Werriwa is the only member of the Labour party who has the courage to say that. The Leader of the Opposition is careful always to put the position in much more moderate terms. Whenever he speaks of Labour's financial policy, says that, if returned to power, the Labour party could alter the monetary system and revise certain regulations verning the trading operations of the Commonwealth Bank. He could never be expected to declare frankly that Labour's objective was the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. The trade union movement in this country has never been in harmony with the socialization plank of the Labour party's policy. The right to strike is the most potent weapon hands of trade unions, and they are not disposed to part with it.",171
425,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Tell us all about it.,172
426,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I like the mild and subtle way in which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports Holloway) approaches the discussion of industrial and social problems. I am as anxious as he is to bring about social reforms in this country, in order to improve the living standards of the people; but I have never yet endeavoured to delude my constituents into the belief that the socialization plank of the Labour party's platform and the practice of trade unionism are one and the same thing. Those of us who have any knowledge of the trade union movement know that they are not. Trade unions will always strongly oppose any attempt to deprive their members of the right to strike. [Quorum formed.] The younger men in the Labour movement should be told of this line of demarcation between the socialization of industry, and trade unionism. No one knows better than the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) that reconciliation cannot be effected in industrial disputes because the insistence, by trade unionists, of right to strike. He can tell us that in disputes on the coal-fields organized Labour will always make it plain that if it cannot get what it wants the men will strike. Then, in order to deceive the and people, there will be an outcry that the employers have caused a lock-out. In some cases a trifling dispute such as the dismissal of one man for some offence may lead to a strike by hundreds, if not thousands, of his fellow workmen. I do not agree with the unemployment figures that have been given in this he debate. No fewer than 250,000 men have been placed in employment during the last six years as the direct result of this go- Government's encouragement of industries. I challenge any honourable member opposite to prove otherwise. Notwithstanding all that this Government has done to relieve unemployment during recent years, we had the spectacle yesterday of honourable members opposite making an appeal on behalf of the unemployed during the approaching Christmas season. They even went so far as to say in the that supporters of the Government attempted, to stifle the discussion. Why cannot they be honest and fair about this matter? . We on this side did not carry on the debate yesterday because we were convinced of the insincerity of honourable members opposite in connection with this (Mr problem of unemployment. I have not lived in an industrial area of Sydney for 39 years without acquiring a first-hand knowledge of the troubles of the workers, and I can say, without fear of contradiction, that I have always done what I could to redress their grievances. I am convinced that conciliation boards or wages boards would do more to bring about peace in industry than appeals to the Arbitration Court. Honourable members who have had dealings with the Repatriation Department may have had experiences similar to mine. On many occasions I have submitted to the various tribunals cases which were unsuccessfully brought before those bodies by the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and I have at times been successful, t am happy to say that one case for which an honourable member in the Lang group of had failed to secure redress, has, through the my instrumentality, been successful. The man in question has had his pension restored. Ever since then I have had numerous requests to bring other cases before these tribunals. To these tribunals should be appointed men with practical business knowledge, men with sympathy for and understanding of the disabilities of ex-soldiers who have been crippled for life.  The honourable member's time has expired.",172
427,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Batman) [8.15] The honourable member to whom we have just had the pleasure of listening seems to be under the mistaken impression that the policy of the Australian Labour party is a secret document or a secret policy about which this party entertains some sense of shame or compunction, and that the party promulgates its doctrines in secret while publicly announcing as its policy something entirely different. As a matter of fact the policy of the Australian Labour party has been frequently published, and is re-published from time to time; it is available for anybody and everybody who may desire to enlarge their education by becoming familiar with its terms. I do not propose to read it to-night. I can promise the honourable member, however, that, for his enlightenment, I would be prepared to make a copy of the document available for his study with the confident expectation that after, in the course of years, he had learned dimly to comprehend it, he would pass naturally to that side of the House on which, by that time, the Labour party was carrying on the government of this country. Suffice it to say that in the very foreground of Labour's policy appears Labour's objective-and it is printed in bold letters and in plain English- "" Socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange "". Then follow the principles of action, and after that, methods. follow further the details of Labour's platform and policy. I suppose there is hardly any one who has had the honour to stand for Parliament as a standardbearer for the Labour party who has failed, not only to enunciate, but also to expound, the fundamental changes involved in Labour's policy. The honourable gentleman does not seem to have heard of them; at least it is very evident that he has failed to understand them. I suggest that it would be better for him to devote some little time to the study of the fundamentals of Labour's policy before he accepts the responsibility of criticizing us about matters which he certainly does not understand. The general discussion on the budget affords a very excellent illustration of the unhappy decadence of the parliamentary institution as operated under governments of the character bf that which now controls our destinies in the federal sphere. I suggest that the national Parliament is, or at least ought to be, a democratic instrument of government which is worth preserving, the liberties and privileges of which demand jealously guarding; but I am sorry to have to admit that, at the hands of those very persons who claim to be the champions of democratic institutions, Parliament has, from day to day, deteriorated in efficiency. I am not referring to the personnel of the Parliament, because I do not join with those who rant occasionally about the ""good old days"", and the ""giant parliamentarians"" who controlled our destinies in other times. I believe that every generation throws up, in equal measure, a fair average number of capable men willing to carry on the government of the country in accordance with the best tradition. Unfortunately, today the tendency is to create and maintain a bureaucracy to filch the rights of members, and to limit the rights of the electorate, and of what the Attorney-General yesterday described in another connection as "" a sovereign people "". We are supposed to have, for example, almost unlimited powers of discussion over an unlimited area on this very question which is now before the Chair. What happens? What happens Then today happens almost every year when the budget is under consideration. The time for consideration of the question is limited unreasonably, unnatural hours of labour are imposed upon honourable members and, eventually, when we come to the consideration of the Esti mates, millions of pounds of money are voted by forced marches within a measure of time ridiculously inadequate for the purpose that we have in view. Instead of ample opportunity being provided for discussion of a wide range of subjects, very little opportunity is afforded to those at least who feel that their strength and powers of endurance are not equal to all-night sittings, and sittings which extend over night and day continuously. It is a violation of the principles of parliamentary government that honourable members should be worn down and discouraged from speaking by reason of the fact if they wish to speak they must be deprived of their natural rest, and must submit themselves to an endurance test that should never be imposed upon them. Take the discussion, for example, upon Supply. It is a very well-settled principle that grievances must be redressed before Supply is granted. My friends of the Government would have the country believe that honourable members may talk as much as they like on that subject; but the fact is that they cannot do so. The time for discussion is arbitrarily limited, and almost invariably the Government informs us that a supply bill must be Passed before a certain hour, ver"" often before one-quarter of the members of the chamber can have had an opportunity to ventilate their grievances, ft follows that grievances not stated cannot be redressed. Again, it is open to any honourable member, supposing he can' get the support of, say, five members of the House, to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance; but only yesterday we had an excellent illustration of what occurs in that regard. When the leader of the Labour party for the time being (Mr Eorde) moved the adjournment of ""the House for the purpose of discussing a matter which is of vital interest, and of tremendous importance to the people outside and, consequently, of tremendous interest to those inside this Parliament, after one speech had been delivered by the mover of the motion, the Government, taking very good care to have the last word, and the only other word, had the debate clotured, and further discussion prevented. I have taken leave to say before, and I take leave to say now, that those gentlemen who, with tongue in cheek, pretend to condemn Fascism in other countries, should set their own house in order and learn to show greater respect towards a democratic Parliament before they begin Mr Brennan. to teach their grandmothers overseas how they should conduct the business of the countries over which they have control and charge. I very often think that when we assemble here as - a new Parliament we do not sufficiently realise the historic background of the institution of which we are privileged to that be members. We should revise our knowledge of the tribulations, the blood and tears, out of which the parliamentary institution grew, and of how the men of the brave days of old faced terror and death in order to assert the rights of a free parliament. To-day, the tendency is not only to limit the rights of members by arbitrarily declaring that the subject in hand must be disposed of by military methods and all-night sittings, but also to set up officers, such as the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees, who, instead of being the servants of the House, become the masters of the House. That is an inversion of the proper order of control. It is true that we should have standing orders; it is equally true that honourable members should jealously guard their rights; but I think that the Standing Orders have gone much too far in limiting the rights of honourable members. When the rights enjoyed by members are interpreted with undue rigidity by the officers of the Parliament there is grave danger that the servants of the Parliament become its masters, or become so to regard themselves. And so against development along those lines I make this stern protest as an individual and on behalf of the Australian Parliament claimed to be a democratic instrument, which is to me the lineal successor of those parliaments established, as I indicated a moment ago, by the courageously endured hardships of those who suffered to set up a democratic institution. Wearied by the long vigil of last night and the labours of today, I am not disposed to make a studious examination of this subject, nor am I fitted, in a physical sense, to make such _ an examination of any public question worth considering. I shall content myself with some general observations on matters of outstanding interest, hoping to direct attention to their importance rather than to examine them in detail. The honourable member for Barton (Mr. Lane) made reference to the National Health and Pensions Insurance Act which became law a few months ago. We must accept and respect the law of the land, whatever it may be; but certain developments have arisen with regard to this legislation which are, as far as I am aware, unprecedented in the history of Australian parliaments. I have never known an act passed by the Commonwealth Parliament-and my memory goes back to the birth of the Constitution- which has excited so much public resentment and open indignation as has this measure. I cannot help thinking that the Government, and especially the Treasurer (Mr Casey), must be well aware of public feeling which has resulted from the passage of this act. By every mail, I have received, not the protests of obscure organizations or societies, but the individual protests of electors to the number of many thousands; and other honourable members have been the recipients of similar protests to an equal number of thousands. I should like to know whether this Government, like most governments, has its ear to the ground, and whether it is impressed by .the signs of the times. Will it take action before it is too late? I can quite see that vested interests may be created, and that rights may arise, if the act. mains in operation. If the Government is honest with itself and the people and is intelligently reading the signs of the times, it will make no further concession to its own obstinacy, but will make a concession to the rising tide of resentment in the electorates, and deal with it tively before it is too late. Bepeal or at least radical amendment is required. The grounds on which ray criticism rests are those which members on this side of the chamber have ventilated in full in this Parliament. Those who care to read them may do so by referring to the records in the journals of the House. But I take the opportunity to warn the Government against this rising tide of opposition. My only reason for doing so is not that I should count it an irreparable loss if we lost the present Government, but that I should count it almost an irreparable disaster if the national health and pensions insurance scheme, through obstinacy on the part of the Government, were persevered with until rights were created of a kind which would make it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to pull out by the roots a plant that should have - been nipped in the bud. This afternoon, we had an interesting speech by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) on the subject of the - amendment of the Constitution, and I may add that it followed an interesting address by the Attorney General (Mr Menzies) upon the same matter. These gentlemen are doubtless both well qualified to deal with it. I take some pride in the fact that the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), a layman, and not in robust health, was himself the inspiration, in his fine address, for the discussion which followed. Although these speeches have been interesting, to most honourable members they have not been peculiarly informative, for the reason that most honourable memberscertainly most on this side of the chamber-hav e over and over again, in the years that have rolled by, addressed similar arguments to the committee and to the electors, here and elsewhere. I may be permitted to take a little pardonable pride in the reflection that I , as a member re- of a government, introduced in this chamber the last measure for the enfranchisement of the people by providing them with an instrument of government adaptable to their needs and responsive to their wishes. I should like to make this further observation on the subject of the effec- amendment of the Constitution: The anomalies mentioned by the Attorney General have all been discussed, elaborated and promulgated over and over again, and the same comment applies entirely to the speech by the honourable member for Warringah. I do not claim that I have been, in my public utterances in this chamber, entirely free always from party bias . Sometimes, I think, I may be ever so little prejudiced in favour of my own party.",173
428,Mr STREET,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,It is scarcely noticeable,175
429,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The honourable gentleman acknowledges, the truth of my statement, and I accuse myself of possibly being sometimes a little prejudiced in that direction. I promise this committee, and I think - that I can back myself to give effect to the promise, that, if by a joint sitting, a convention, or any kind of collaboration, we can do something to rid ourselves of these shackles and manacles which we have forged about ourselves, I shall approach that subject without one word of recrimination as to the past, inspired only by the hope that at long last the people of Australia have come to realise the tremendous importance, whatever our views may be on public questions, of being able to give effect to them in the people's Parliament. I heard the Attorney-General say yesterday-and here it may be suggested that this is an immediate departure from the principle that I have just laid down, but it is more apparent than realthat when the question of the control of aviation was submitted to the people, he could not but think that the vote, especially in New South ""Wales, was influenced by party political considerations. When ; he made that statement, I ventured to say privately, in the ear of one of my colleagues, that it recalled the fact that years ago, when we were appealing for an instrument of government responsive to the .people's will, an eminent statesman who is still living, one who is a typical Constitutionalist, United Australia party man or Nationalist, whichever he should be called, asked: "" Are we to give these powers to be exercised by a Labour government ?"" So I suggest that the recollection of that question by that eminent statesman who is now out of politics and in poor health - that is the reason why I do not introduce his name-may well be set off against the possibility that the vote in New South Wales was ever so little influenced by party considerations on the question of the control of aviation. But this brings me, between these two suggested conflicting views, to the point that we can never hope to do anything effective or useful regarding the amendment of the Constitution unless Ave rid ourselves entirely of the consideration of the point of view as to what class of government is to exercise these powers. The point is that the government of the day is the elect of the people, and all we ask is Mr Brennan. however much we may suffer from their apparent aberrations in electing such a government as we have . at present, we have nevertheless to bear it. All we say is that, whatever government is to exercise these powers, that government is the choice of the people. The point is not what the government may do or desire to do, but solely what the sovereign people may do or desire to do. There I leave the matter of the amendment of the Constitution. Some time yesterday the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) paid a very high tribute to his honourable leader. Now, Mr Chairman, I give you notice that I have left the arena of abstract non-party politics to return to thatfamiliar field in which I feel I may possibly be more at home. The honourable member, as I have said, paid a glowing tribute to his leader. It was more than a tribute; it was a panegyric. I should be tempted to say something similar about the Prime Minister but for the fact that I do not think it proper that two poets should compete in the same field. If I were disposed to compete with the honourable member, who, as everybody knows, has all the qualities of the perfect poet I should be inclined to recall those beautiful words which the Prime Minister himself used on one occasion when speaking of an honourable gentleman who had been a member of the Labour party but no longer belonged to it. His desertion was entirely disapproved by the Prime Minister, whose exact words, I regret to say, escape me at the moment. But they were to this effect: "" He comes into his native city, and there is no one to bid him welcome; he leaves the city, ajnd there is no one to bid him Godspeed "". That is truly descriptive of the dreadful fate that is likely to overtake, in fact, inevitably does overtake, sooner or later, all men who forsake their political principles for considerations which I am not permitted to mention in detail. So the Prime Minister in these days of tribulation, with his distraught Cabinet changing chameleon-like from day to day, suiting its colour and shape to its necessities may be praying and hoping that these component parts may yet not realise the highest ambitions of each. As he that, walks into the Cabinet room he 'finds there none to bid him welcome; and as he goes out again he must see numbers of potential successors straining at the leash, like the competitors in an old Greek marathon race, to fill the chair that he has just vacated. Some of them would wound, yet are afraid to strike. However, the futiu*e will reveal itself. As out of the mouths of babes and sucklings praise is perfected, so it may be that the latest arrival in the Cabinet room, the Minister for Defence (Mr Street), who is perhaps the most distinguished member of the Ministry, may succeed to the high place of Prime Minister just as he has so unexpectedly reached, recently, the high office of Minister for Defence. knows but when the Prime Minister's back is turned some day, or when the other members of the Cabinet are interlocked in the kind of grip that we often hear described at the stadium, he will slip into the vacant chair to the great disgruntlement of his colleague, the master-General (Mr Archie Cameron). I published some blank verse quite recently about the Assistant Minister for Commerce.",175
430,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The verse would be blank all right!,177
431,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,What about the Assistant Minister!,177
432,Mr BEENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I do not see why the master poets of our time should waste their sonnets on obscure representatives of the Government when two such distinguished members of the' principal department of the Parliament are sitting at the table. Yesterday, or the day before-o r was it tomorrow?-w e heard a speech by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis). He also is a representative of the military class who frequently comes into the chamber at the quick march, and sometimes at the double, clicks his heels, and then commences to pour out words of wisdom relative to the defence of the country. On this occasion, the honourable gentleman made his conventional contribution to the gospel of terror which is being supported so ably by this Government. He offered many suggestions concerning universal service. All , said he, must do their part. He indicated that service was required, not only from men, but also from ladies. Women, he said, would be willing to associate themselves with universal service, as a cog in the wheel so to speak, in this purely imaginary crisis or against this entirely imaginary foe.",177
433,Mr BLAIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"What , again!",177
434,Mr BEENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes ; I intend to immortalize that classic, unless war occurs. I mention the honourable member for Moreton as a pivot on which to turn a few entirely philosophic observations on normal life in times of. peace. I point out that the tendency today is to regard the normal atmosphere of life as an atmosphere of war and terror; that war, not peace, is the normal Who state. In a properly-ordered community such as we should be, being at peace, as happily we are, and not being threatened, and being many thousands of miles from any centre o.f disturbance, I suggest that our workmen should be employed peaceably at attracPost- tive operations on work of a useful and uplifting character, as far as possible, and that their wives and families, who are the centre of our social structure, should be in the full enjoyment of the blessings of peace, devoting their leisure to improvement of bheir mental and physical attributes, so that all may enjoy and be uplifted by the knowledge of the arts and crafts, and to have time and opportunity to enjoy music and legitimate entertainment and the joys of literature. Surely this is not too much to expect from citizens living in a rich and peaceful country such as Australia. We should be setting an example to the world as to how a wellordered society should comport itself under the benign Overlordship of the All Wise. Unfortunately, the tendency of honourable members opposite is to insist that we must live constantly in a state of terror, in anticipation of war, and that we must inculcate into the lives not only of men, but also of women, the mothers of the future generation, and into the lives of the children who, one would have thought, were entitled to an inheritance of reasonable peace, the notion that we live on sufferance, and are threatened from day to day by dreadful neighbours of our own kind, only very much worse, arid with all the horrible punishments that can be executed by aD enemy at war, and- - which, by the prostitution of science, are likely to come upon us as a dreadful scourge. Surely, we should not be encouraged to continue in this purely artificial state of mind aud be induced by politicians stimulated by newspaper propagandists to foresee nothing but .evil! If this is to be regarded as the normal state of mind, it may very well be asked whether the country is worth defending, or life is worth living. I should doubt it. In the moment or two remaining to me, L wish to refer to the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson), who has taken it on himself to be a baiter of nations, and an inspircr of international hatreds. The honourable gentleman spoke about international blackmailers in other parts of the world. He is a young man on the threshold of his political career. I may, therefore, be permitted to make a suggestion to him. He may under-estimate his own influence and his capacity to promote international hatred, but he does his best. The honourable gentleman may think that his remarks are not of much consequence in his small world, but I remind him, and also the honourable member for Wannon (Mr. Scholfield), who subsequently addressed the committee, that they can do a great deal more useful service as members of this Parliament than in making a spirited contribution to world unrest.",177

Among them have been motions for the adjournment of ""the House to discuss urgent matters of national importother ance, although some of them were neither national nor urgent, a fact of which those who moved and supported the motions were well aware.

The very gentleman who had the courage to submit that motion went to Sydney to talk to his own party about leadership, but the voting was about 500 to 40 against him. In all these statements from the Opposition I have not heard anything which suggests that its members can either agreeamong themselves, or offer any alternative to the government which the parties on this side of the House have given to tie country, even if now and again there may be some outward evidence of a little disagreement oh matters of moment.",178
437,Mr MAHONEY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Did the Minister say now and again, or always?",178
438,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I said now and again; but even if it were per-' manent, I should say that the disagreement on this side is no less permanent than on the other side in regard to matters of urgent and national importance. On the most important subject of defence, we have heard from honourable members opposite views ranging from a condemnation of anything associated with armaments to the advocacy of compulsory military training and the establishment of a standing army. Honourable gentlemen on the other side of the chamber are in no condition to lecture the Government on unity, consistency, or lack of national policy. I have a very vivid memory of certain things which happened here towards the end of September. When honourable gentlemen like the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) talk about there being no need to prepare for the defence of this country",178
439,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I did not say that.,178
440,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"If the gentleman did not say that, to there is an obligation on him to explain",178
441,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I said that we are at peace; that there is no war at present.,178
442,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"During the latter days of September and the early days of October, there were faces as long, and as wide, - and as anxious, on the side of the House, as on this side. Honourable gentlemen opposite know that. There is need for a calm and clear review of the military situation of this country and its defence possibilities. We have statements from Opposition members about the encouragement of Fascism, of Nazi-ism and other "" isms "", but as one who has more than a lingering regard for those principles which are known as democracy-tlios e methods which ensure to common individuals in the community freedom of thought, speech, action and movement- I say that, if these collective freedoms, which are known as democracy, are to he maintained, there must be a little more action in regard to the defence of this country and to other matters which I shall name, and a lot less talk for purely party political purposes. I have seen references to the great vote that is to be given in support of the Opposition candidate in the Wakefield by-election. I have seen statements that if Mr MCHugh should romp home, the obvious result will be the dissolution of this House. But if honourable gentlemen opposite thought that there was a 100 to 1 chance of the Opposition winning the Wakefield seat, the party would not have let Sid MCHugh stand as its candidate. The Opposition is in no condition to stand an appeal to the country on the question of defence, or, indeed, any other matter of urgent national importance.  General afraid that Mr MCHugh will win Wakefield?",178
443,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The honourable gentleman who interjected would be unable to sleep if he thought that Mr MCHugh would win.  him in his campaign.,179
444,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"If the honourable gentleman really does want Mr MCHugh to win Wakefield, he had better not go any further west than Ballarat. I shall not traverse the discussion which has taken place on the. subject of defence, for the same arguments have been advanced time after time. There are varying views on this subject. As one honourable member on this side of the chamber said, it is obvious that on one or two matters Ministers are not all cast in the same intellectual and political mould. I do not deny that. But whatever strictures which may be made on the Government, there is at least unity of purpose in regard to providing an effective defence system for this country. It is useless for honourable gentlemen opposite to attempt to deny that salient fact.",179
445,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Does the Minister want another khaki issue at the next election ?,179
446,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I do not. That is the last thing on which I wish to see an appeal made to the country. However, the Government has no need to appeal to the country on that issue; it can appeal on its record and its prospects, which is more than the Opposition dares to do. The use and development of Australia's resources is another matter on which the Opposition is silent. If this country is to be occupied by the race of which we are members, if that race is to survive in the southern end of the Pacific Ocean, Australia must be populated and developed. In that connection, we require certain things; we must have power, transport, communications, development of our landed resources, and development of our secondary industries. On all those five important points there has been what one might term a conspiracy of silence on the part of the Opposition. 1 ",179
447,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Nothin g has been put forward to show that the Opposition has any ideas, objectives, plans, methods, or policy on any of these important matters. It is true that one important matter was mentioned by the Opposition. I refer to the speech of the rignt honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) on the subject of the constitutional relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I do not agree with every point made by the right honourable gentleman, but I do agree with him that there is need foian overhaul of the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. The sooner that review takes place the better it will be for the community as a whole. The situation today is that we arc labouring under a division of power. Both the Commonwealth and the States have certain legislative powers; somepowers are reserved exclusively to the States, and others exclusively to the Commonwealth. There is also what might be described as a legal "" no man's land "", in which members of the profession to which the honourable member for Batman and some other honourable members belong, do battle from .time to time in' order to decide the rights and wrongs of the different individuals and interests in the community. During the last twelve months I have had some experience of meetings of various bodies which help to govern this country. I refer to one meeting of the Loan Council, two or three Premiers conferences, and several gatherings of the Australian Agricultural Council. I Jo not wish to detract one iota from the worth of any of those bodies or from the work that they are doing, but the one thing which has struck me about such gatherings is the number of occasions on which those present have come to the unanimous decision that it is necessary for the six States and the Commonwealth to pass uniform legislation on the same subject. Consequently, although I come from one of the smaller States, and, because of my political upbringing, am inclined to dislike the idea, I am forced to admit that if we have to have uniform legislation on any subject the only common-sense method is for that legislation to be passed by one Parliament, instead of seven. Whilst uniformity of legislation is desirable, we must not overlook the necessity for the local administration of the laws that are passed.",179
448,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Does not the ter think that with a unified sovereign Parliament and delegated powers, the smaller States would be better off?",180
449,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I shall give my opinion of sovereign parliaments. This Commonwealth Parliament is only a half-sovereign Parliament. There are six half-sovereign State parliaments in competition with it.,180
450,Mr BRENNAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I agree with the Minister.,180
451,Mr HOLLOWAY,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,No two of the halfsovereign parliaments make a f u ll sovereign.,180
452,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"That is so. On account of the Privy Council decision in respect of section 92 of the Constitution, the whole of them together do not make a full sovereign. There is a. gap in the power between Commonwealth and State Parliaments which has not been bridged. Incidentally, I recognize the very great difficulties with which this Parliament and also the State parliaments would be confronted if we were to seek an effective amendment of the Constitution. Democracy is supposed to be a progressive type of government. People who are called democrats are supposed to be enlightened, but I have noticed in my reading of history that one of the outstanding characteristics of a democracy is its conservatism. I do not mean political conservatism in a party sense, but the natural disinclination of the average man to change the methods to which-he is accustomed by reason of his upbringing. I shall refer to some of the advantages which I believe could be secured if there were a greater measure of uniformity in respect of legislation in this country. There is need for more uniformity not only in regard to our methods of taxation, but also in respect of the incidence of taxation as between States. The burdens which the States have to carry, due to the degree to which they depend on primary or secondary industries, or on mining, &c, vary greatly as between one State and another, and make the uniform development of the Commonwealth almost impossible. There is a tendency for development to be concentrated more and more in those areas which already enjoy an undue share of wealth and population, and which did, in fact, enjoy that advantage at the Ministime of federation. I refer to New South Wales and Victoria, where development of this kind has been assisted by certain acts of the Commonwealth Parliament. There is also need for clarification in regard to the provision of transport facilities, both by road and rail, and particularly for the removal of the anomaly of border rates on telegrams'. It still costs 4d. more to send a telegram over a State border, just as it did in pre-federation days. There has been a rather amusing sequel to the last referendum appeal to the people, when the Commonwealth sought control over aviation. The people declared .in the referendum that the Commonwealth Government was not fit to be trusted with such power, but, no sooner had that decision been made, than the six State governments decided that the people's opinion did not count for anything. They approached the Commonwealth Government, and said, ""For heaven's sake take over from us this power which we do not want, and which the people say you should not have"". State legislation was passed through all parliaments to transfer the power to the Commonwealth, and the people were not even consulted about it. Then there is the question of distribution of power resources for industrial purposes. As one who comes from one of the smaller States, I say that if there to be a better distribution of secondary industries, we must evolve a method by which there will be a uniform charge for power throughout all the' potential manufacturing areas in the Commonwealth. It is not right that power should be cheap in certain areas, and dear in others. I believe that there are great possibilities for the development of manufactures of defence value along the Gulf in South Australia, yet South Australia is the one State in the Commonwealth which has neither oil, water, nor coal with which to make power. The capacity to develop secondary industries in that State is limited by natural disability, and it starts off under a big handicap in the competition for industries. These are some of the matters which should be attended to at a constitutional session next year. I hope that from it will emerge proposals that will make for cheaper government, and government that will be in closer touch with the people. In this way it should be possible to achieve certain necessary social reforms which are very much needed, but which cannot be effectively brought about while the present division of power between the Commonwealth and the States continues. I have noticed that, as civilization develops, certain social tendencies ably develop also. I am promoted to remark on this by the statement 'of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Wilson) in regard to the declining birth rate. One of the first things that impresses the student of history is that always, as the standard of living of a nation increases, so does the birth rate decline. It was so in the civilizations of Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and it is so in our civilization of the present day. As social services are increased in a community, so also must we increase that proportion of the total production of the people which goes to the Government in the form of revenue. There is a tendency on the part of democracy, first to ask for social reforms, and then to do a lot of unjustifiable squealing when the bill for those reforms come in. If a clear conception of these points were presented to the people by members of Parliament, it would make for a better understanding. is I do not suggest that they should be explained to the people in a party spirit. I dislike party* politics. I am one of those who are by nature ill-fitted to hold their own in party contests with honourable members on the other side. I am always more disposed to view such matters in the light of how they will affect the whole community, rather than of how they will affect the fate of this or that party.",180
453,Mr RANKIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Bendigo) [9.23] - I recognize that the Government has been hampered in its works policy because of the need to prosecute an energetic defence policy. Though the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) tells us that this we are being scared by threats of an imaginary foe, I am sure that he is too intelligent to believe it. Every one recognizes that Australia may be threatened with grave danger if we are not strong enough to defend it. The Commonwealth will have to face the question of water conservation, in which lies the only hope of increasing our rural population. The need for this is emphasized by the drought which prevails at the present time over a great part of the continent. That water conservation is vital to our existence has been proved by the fact that the only rural areas in which population has increased in the last generation are those in which invari- water conservation schemes are in operation. l I believe that immigration should be encotiraged because, if we are to hold Australia, wo must occupy it. Recently, I travelled through the Northern Territory in company with the Minister for the Interior (Mr MCEwen). In that part of Australia there are huge areas that could be developed by means of irrigation and which, properly developed, could support as many people as we now have in the whole of Australia. Northern Australia is at present our weakest point. We must occupy that territory, or it will be taken from us by some other nation that is prepared to occupy and develop it. I wish now to discuss the report of Air-Marshal Sir Edward Ellington on the Australian Air Force. This man, after a month's investigation, made a report which, I think, was most unjust to our magnificent Air Force. I believe that we have the best flying material in the world. We have young men who, fov some reason, seem to be at home in the air, and it was proved during the war that they were equal, if not superior, to the airmen of any other country. Let us consider the record of this man who came out here, and damned our Air Force with faint praise. He was Chief of the Air Staff in Great Britain in 1937. He came here, and declared that our air discipline is not good, though he was Chief of the British Air Staff, oil the blackest day of the Royal Air Force, when they lost nine lives during the 1937 Empire Day air pageant, and when eight machines had to be completely written No fewer than twenty men were injured, and the only group that did not have an accident was commanded by an Australian, Group-Captain Goble, who was training in England at the time. He did an air-marshal's job for two years in England with great credit to himself and to the force to which he belonged, yet Ellington says that the flying discipline of our men is not ""what it should be. He does not state that for two years before he made that report Air-Vice-Marshal Nicholls, who. is now in charge of the Eastern Air Command in Egypt, was responsible for the flying discipline of the Australian Air Force. While here Air-Vice-Marshal Nicholls received a salary of £2,780 a year, though Air-Vice-Marshal Williams, his senior, was receiving only £1,750 a year - This ' man Ellington was Chief of the Air Staff during the recent crisis in Great Britain, when the only excuse that Britain had for betraying the Czechoslovakian nation was that its air force was not up to standard, and that the air defences of London were so poor that the city was practically open to attack by any foreign power. Mr Rankin.  made?",181
454,Mr RANKIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I should think so. Peace, was preserved at the expense of a nation which today is suffering the tortures of the damned. We should have every sympathy with Czechoslovakia, and be ashamed of the part that, we played.  the British Government.",182
455,Mr RANKIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"It is. The man who made this report was the chief of the Royal Air Force in 1937-38, when 201 men wero killed in 105 crashes. In his report Sir Edward Ellington laid stress on three matters: First, the need to improve discipline. Well, the discipline of the Royal Australian Force for two years, as I have already pointed out, was under the control of an officer of the Royal Air Force. The only conclusion to be reached is that in future we should have one of our own men in control. Secondly, he advocated a better system for the training of pilots after the completion of the course at the off. Point Cook training school. A Royal Air Force officer had charge of that training. Thirdly, Sir Edward Ellington criticized the conditions of service in the Royal Australian Air Force. That is not a matter which the officers of the Royal Australian Air Force can remedy, although they are able to and do fight for improvements. Any remedy must be applied by the Commonwealth Government itself, because it is a matter of government policy. He also said that there was a grave shortage of flight commanders. That is admitted, but it must be pointed out that, when an air force expands with the rapidity with which the Royal Australian Air Force has expanded a shortage of commanders is inevitable. Flight commanders cannot be' trained overnight. The Royal Air Force, when it was expanding rapidly suffered a much graver shortage of flight commanders thai: the Royal Australian Air Force suffers today. In some groups of the Royal Air Force in 1937, whereas there should have been 34 flight commanders, there were only seven. The Royal Air Force has been taking from the Royal Australian Air Force annually between 50 and 60 young fellows and it is appealing for more. Australian pilots have done well in-England, and a great many of them have become flight commanders after a short period of training. Sir Edward Ellington reported also that the Wirraway aeroplanes which are being manufactured by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Fisherman's Bend were unsuitable, but, while he was condemning the Wirraway in Australia, representatives of the Royal Air Force went to the TJnited States of America and purchased 200 of them for use in the Royal Air Force, of which Ellington is Chief of Staff. In these cumstances, what notice can be taken of his report?  ment bring him here?",182
456,Mr RANKIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I do not know. The honourable member should ask the Ministry. In November last, at the aerial pageant on Flemington Racecourse, I saw one of the Wirraway machines that had been manufactured by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation-as a matter of fact it was the only one that had been up till then turned out by the factory - and I was particularly struck by its performance. If the disturbance which threatened at the end of September had eventuated, we should have been glad to have 30 or 40 Wirraway machines available. Sir Edward Ellington's report contains many half truths about the Royal Australian Air Force, but he failed to mention one matter which reflects upon the British Government, namely, that the lack of equipment in the Royal Australian Air Force is due to the fact that the British authorities on every occasion have objected to our going to the United States of America to obtain machines and equipment, although Britain itself was not able to supply our requirements.  Britain is jealous of. our success in developing our Air Force.",183
457,Mr RANKIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I think that that is very likely. Our lack of equipment is the one great weakness of the Royal Australian Air Force. It has no weakness of personnel. The Royal Australian Air Force has in its service many able senior officers. Air Vice-Marshal Williams was in Palestine during the war, and I saw a good deal of the work done by his [73] famous squadron, which was second in deeds and valour to none. The men who formed this squadron, all of whom were trained by Air Vice-Marshal Williams, won laurels for their flying feats. Some of them were absorbed into the Royal Australian Air Force, where they gained high positions. Their world flights and their work in Australia prove that they were a magnificent body of men. Air Vice-Marshal Williams, although he was junior to the commanders of two British squadrons, was appointed to the command cir- in Palestine when the Commander-inChief of the E.E.F. Air Force, which was composed of three British squadrons and one Australian squadron, was sent to the command in India in 1918. No one would deny that for an Australian to achieve a command over the heads of senior men in the Royal Air Force, he needs to be of outstanding ability. To-day, in the Royal Australian Air Force, yre have men like Goble, Anderson, De La Rue and Lukis, all of them group commanders, in addition, of course, to Air ViceMarshal Williams. Any one of them would be far superior to any man whom we could obtain from Great Britain to command our Air Force. There has been talk of an exchange of Royal Australian Air Force officers for Royal Air Force officers. We know also that with the expansion of the Royal Australian Air Force, there will be created in Australia. the position of Air Marshal. On the 14th September,- the Sydney Bulletin saidTo the disgust of Australian airmen, Royal Australian A i r Force and Civil Aviation lads alike, Canberra is 'getting more Avro-Anson bombers from Great Britain. Some of them are "" used "" machines. The appointment of a British officer to command the Royal Australian A i r Force, as the Royal Australian Xavy and the Commonwealth Military Forces are commanded by British officers, is expected at any moment. Perhaps he, too, will be a "" used machine."" I should say that, if we did obtain a man from the-Royal Air Force to take charge of our Air Force, he would not be one of the top-notchers, because Great Britain today faces such a threat from Europe that it would not dare to send one of its best men to Australia. The Royal Air Force is very willing to take our ""best men, but I fear that it would be inclined to send one of its "" duds "" here. I think tli 111 Sir Edward Ellington came to Australia with the intention to make a job for some senior man in the Royal Air Force. AVe know that many men climbed to undeserved eminence during the war on the backs of the Australian Imperial Forces, and I hope that the Government will not entertain the idea of bringing a man from Great. Britain to Australia to take command of our Air Force. I advise it to take no heed of Sir Edward Ellington's report. It must not allow itself to be stampeded into doing anything that will destroy the morale and discipline of the Royal Australian Air Force, which is a magnificent force and one of which Australia should be proud.",183
458,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE, The honourable member for Maribyrnong,184
459,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"On a point of order, I a3k whether the Chair is justified in preparing a list of speakers? Why is it that some honourable gentlemen who remained in the chamber throughout an all night sitting and constantly rose in .their places to try to catch the eye of the Chairman are not called, whereas other honourable gentlemen, who were in bed all night, are given prioritv by the Chair?",184
460,The TEMPORARY CHAIEMAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE," That is a point, which should be taken before the Chairman of Committees (Mr. Prowse). I am following his list. Mr JAMES.^-While we await arrival of the Chairman of Committees, injustice is' being done to honourable members.",184
461,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Tliere is no point of order. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Drakeford) has the call.,184
462,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"If you are not capable of giving a ruling as Temporary Chairman of Committees, you have no right to accept the position. I move That the ruling be dissented from.",184
463,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The point is covered by Standing Order No. 255When two or more members rise together lo speak, the Speaker shall call upon the mcinl)er who, in his opinion, first rose place; . . . In carrying out the terms of this standing order, I am observing the list prepared by the Chairman of Committees. Ho is the proper, officer to decide who first rose and, according .to the list prepared by him, the honourable member for Maribyrnong rose before the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). It is not for me to go beyond the decision of the Chairman of Committees and I propose to follow his list",184
464,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I claim that I rose before the honourable member for Maribyrnong and long before the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin), who last spoke. You informed me that I was placed second last on the list. Some honourable gentlemen who have precedence on that list over me did not rise before noon today, whereas I rose repeatedly, not only throughout, the all-night sitting, but also last week. I remained - in the House until 7.30 a.m. today, whereas the honourable member for Maribyrnong, whom you have just called, although he was here for a. part of the night, was not in attendance for the whole of the sitting. The honourable member for Barton (Mr. Lane), who was called at 7.30 to-night, was home in bed at 9 o'clock last night.",184
465,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Tn the, circumstances which have now arisen, it Is competent, under the Standing Orders, for any honourable member to move that another honourable membei be 1 now heard. the Mr JAMES - You r statement, Mr. Temporary Chairman, that the Standing Orders provide that the Chairman shall give the call to that honourable member who first catches his eye is in contradiction of your other statement that, in giving the call to the honourable member for Maribyrnong on this occasion, you have been guided by a list prepared by the Chairman of Committees. I take exception to the practice, which has been followed for some time by both the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees, of compiling a list as a guide in giving the call, particularly when under that method an honourable member, who went home to bed, can be called before another honourable member who remained in attendance in in his the committee all through the night. I first endeavoured to get the call in this debate ns early as last week, and I was in attendance all through the sitting last night, yet an honourable member who rose for the first time at 1 p.m. today is given preference before me.",184
466,Mr BERNARD CORSER,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I am in a similar position.,185
467,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"It is time that this practice of keeping a list was cut out by both the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees. About two years ago I objected to it, and I again take strong exception to it.",185
468,Mr ROSEVEAR,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I support the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). It cannot be said that, in doing so, I have any axe to grind, because I have not yet risen, to get the call although I have not missed any portion of this sitting. The honourable member for Hunter has been treated most unfairly. You, Mr Temporary Chairman, have just read the relevant standing order, but I point out that it is not observed either in the spirit or in the letter. Because I was in the Chair for a time last night, I know that on the list which you have before you the names of some honourable members who weint home to bed last night, appear before that of the honourable member for Hunter who was here throughout the night. When this practice of keeping a list is followed in connection with a late sitting, honourable members on both sides go home when they know that there is no prospect of their getting a call within a reasonable time. The standing order which you have just rend, Mr Temporary Chairman, postulates that the first honourable member to catch the eye of the Chair, irrespective of the hour, must get the call. That standing order is not observed by the Chairman of Committees. In practically every debate of any duration in this House it has been ignored by the Chairman, who has, instead, operated on a list. The practice of keeping a list should be abolished, nnd the standing order strictly observed. If that were done, any honourable member who wanted to get the call would be obliged to stay here until he got it.  able member for Hunter, not from any personal motive, but merely because I believe that the practice of keeping a list is open to considerable abuse. After all, the oflicers of the House are human, and it is possible that they may, perhaps unconsciously, do injustice to certain honourable members in giving the call. If the relevant standing order were strictly adhered to, all honourable members would know exactly where they stood.",185
469,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The honourable member for Hunter first rose to get the call in this debate last week, and he was in attendance throughout the sitting last night, yet an honourable member, Avho rose for the first time this afternoon, has been given the call before him. How that honourable member's name was placed on the list before that of the honourable member for Hunter is beyond my understanding. The Chairman must have seen him in a dream, because he was not here previously to claim the call. In this instance the honourable member for Hunter has been deliberately singled out by the Chair for unfair treatment. He was rising in his place all last night, and if the name of an honourable member who was not present prior to this afternoon appears on the list before his, I can only conclude that the list has been manipulated. The practice of keeping a list should be abandoned, because once an honourable member gets his name on the list, he does not bother to remain in the chamber but passes the time by playing billiards or doing something else.",185
470,Mr LANE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Does not the honourable member himself do that?,185
471,Mr LAZZARINI,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I plead guilty to that practice, but the system of keeping a list encourages honourable members on both sides to absent themselves from the chamber. It is time that that practice was stopped, and the relevant standing order strictly adhered'to. I am convinced that the Chairman of Committees is deliberately treating the honourable member for Hunter unfairly in this instance.",185
472,Mr HOLT,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Do I understand, Mr. Temporary Chairman, that you have ruled that the objection taken by the honourable member - for Hunter does not involve a point of order ?",185
473,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I gave the call to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford), and the honourable member for Hunter has moved that my ruling be dissented from. I have accepted his motion.",185
474,Mr HOLT,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"As the honourable member for Hunter was at the table talking to you when the honourable member for Maribyrnong rose in his place, it cannot be contended that he rose first on this particular occasion. Consequently, your action in giving the call to the honourable member for Maribyrnong was - perfectly in order. However, it appears to be distinctly unfair that honourable members whose names appear on the list, but who have been absent, for instance, during an all-night sitting, should on returning to the chamber be given preference over those who have been present throughout a long sitting. When a debate is likely to extend over a lengthy period during one day it is convenient for honourable members to have a list showing the order in which they are to speak. Honourable members have various duties to perform, and cannot be in the chamber all the time. When a debate continues throughout the night or over a period of days, the practice of keeping a list should not extend beyond the day on which the list is prepared.",186
475,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Where the Standing Orders specify what shall be done in certain - circumstances there is no occasion for Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees, as the case may be, to substitute what is regarded as the practice. The Chairman of Committees knows those who have risen and bave not been called. Whether the Chairman does or does not adhere to the list is apparently left to his discretion. list is productive of unfairness. Standing Order 255 is specific and there appears to be no justification for the use of a list. That standing order readsWhen two or more members rise together to speak, the Speaker shall call upon the member who, in his opinion first rose in his place. It is left to the discretion of Mr Speaker, or the Chairman of Committees in this case to decide who rose first. The standing order further providesBut it shall be in order to move, that any member who has risen "" bo now licard"", or "" do now speak "". The standing order, therefore, negatives the necessity for a list. It also serves the rights of the committee as a deliberative chamber because should a substantive motion be moved by some honourable member, the Chairman's decision can be varied. In this case the call was given to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford), and it is open to any honourable member to move that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) ""be now heard"" or "" do now speak "".",186
476,Mr MENZIES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,That would be the correct procedure.,186
477,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes . I suggest that the honourable member for Hunter withdraw his motion of dissent. If he feels that he should have priority over the honourable member for Maribyrnong or any one else, the proper course is for him to move in accordance with the standing order which I have just cited. The Temporary Chairman has called upon the honourable member for Maribyrnong, but the honourable member for Hunter may, if he so desires, move that he, the honourable member for Hunter, "" be now heard "".",186
478,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I do not think he could move that himself.,186
479,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I think that he could. I am not advocating the claims of any particular honourable member. Standing Order No. 255 prescribes the procedure which safeguards the committee and enables it to vary the decision of the Chairman. In view of that standing order, there does not appear to bo any justification for keeping a list of those members who propose to speak. I am quite sure that A that list has been productive of as much inconvenience as convenience. It destroys, to some extent, the deliberative competence of the committee. When an honourable membei finds that his name is low down on the list, he may absent himself from the chamber, in which case he does not hear the speeches of other honourable members, ""and consequently is not in a position to debate the subjects raised. He is enabled to recite a prepared speech which he desires to circulate amongst his constituents. This committee should be a debating committee. When the second reading of a bill is under consideration, prepared speeches may be justified, but in committee consideration should be given to the points raised. A committee pre-, of the whole House is vastly - different from other committees. It should be a committee in which points raised are not only discussed by members of the committee, but are also heard by members.",186
480,Mr HOLT,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Does the Leader of the Opposition suggest that speakers should not be selected alternately from each side of the chamber?,187
481,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"No . I am merely showing that the Standing Orders specify the way in which the Chairman of Committees shall decide who has the call. The Chairman, having decided who ought to be heard, it is still open for any member of the committee to move that some other honourable member be heard.  the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), which are quite unworthy of the honourable member. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr; Curtin) has stated the position correctly. The practice of keeping a list of speakers was not introduced by me. The system was in operation before I was appointed Chairman of Committees, but I have used it to enable me to carry out my duties impartially. Although a list is prepared for my own use, it has been made available to honourable members, and that has created difficulties. Honourable members are expected to speak extemporaneously. Some do, but many use notes. ""When the budget debate commenced I think that over 50 per cent, of honourable members on both side rose for the call. called the first speaker who caught my eye, then for my own information and to ensure complete impartiality prepared a list. If honourable gentlemen will examine it they wall see that the calls given have been very fair. I did not deliberately exclude the honourable member for Hunter, but last night it, did not appear that he was anxious for a. call.",187
482,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"AVhat ?  see the honourable gentleman rise. think be knew that I had a list, so he could have suggested earlier that his name be placed on it. The Chair is quite impartial. It has no knowledge of the member who goes to bed or the member who remains in the committee throughout the sitting. But it does try lo identify honourable members rising for the call and endeavours to deal fairly with all honourable members. However, I can tell them that in future they will not see the list. I shall keep it for my own guidance.",187
483,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,I ask leave to withdraw my motion.,187
484,Mr DRAKEFORD,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I have noticed that on the occasions when matters of importance were under discussion, although I might have risen simultaneously with other honourable members, I was unfortunate enough to be the last to get the call. I say this quite frankly and without feeling, because I know that this apparent discrimination has not been personal. It appears to arise from the practice which has grown up. It is, however, annoying to rise aud fail to get the call even if no one rises on ""the ministerial bench. On many occasions, members who have come in afterwards have received the call ahead of me although I may have been sitting in my place for hours waiting for the opportunity to speak. To-night I rose before the honourable member for Hunter, and I claim that I was entitled to the call. I do not dispute that the honourable gentleman remained in the chamber until four o'clock this morning in anticipation of being able to participate in this debate. For the first time in the four years since I have been a member of this Parliament, I left I shortly after midnight. I did so only after I had ascertained that on the Chairman's list there were 21 members ahead of me. and as each was entitled to speak for three-quarters of an hour, I knew that I l i a d no chance of getting the call before eight o'clock or nine o'clock this morning. For many years it has been the practice of the Chair to prepare a list of intending speakers, and it so happens that I have become the victim in a controversy that has arisen in connection with it.. I understand the awkward preI dicament in which the committee is placed, and I concede that it is necessary to have some order in the calls from the Chair. I have never sought to - infringe the rights of any other honourable member, and I hope to be able to relieve the existing situation. I assure the honourable member for Hunter that I have no desire to deprive him of the opportunity to speak to-night, or to be given any precedence over him in this debate; but the committee should decide whether it will adhere to the procedure laid clown under Standing Order 255, which directs the Chairman to call upon the member who first rises in his place. If this is to be the procedure, I claim the right to the call because I rose the honourable member for Hunter. The honourable gentleman may have remained in the chamber until a late hour this morning, and he may feel that he is entitled to speak ahead of me, but I have been here since the morning sitting opened, and have been waiting for the call. Those who remain in the chamber to listen to the debate, and rise repeatedly when an honourable member has finished his speech, should have preference over others who may wander in and out but expect to catch the Speaker's eye when first they rise. However, as a decision on that matter may prevent the honourable member for Hunter from speaking to-night, I desire to withdraw in his favour.",187
485,Mr BLACKBURN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Before the motion of dissent is withdrawn the committee should have an oportunity to determine whether or not it approves of the Temporary Chairman's ruling. The only member who rose to get the call was the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford). As the honourable member for Hunter did not rise in competition with him, I submit that the Temporary Chairman was right in giving the call to the only honourable member who rose.",188
486,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"How could the Temporary Chairman see the honourable member for Maribyrnong? I was in front of him. But as the matter has been ventilated, I am quite satisfied, and I desire to withdraw my motion. I hope that in the future the list will be dispensed with. Motion-by leave-withdrawn .",188
487,Mr DRAKEFORD,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Maribyrnong) [10.14] - Eithe r by accident or design the budget debate has developed along the lines of the Government's favourite topic - defence . Ministers should be well versed in that subject; they have been on the defensive for .years. Not long ago one honourable member-h e later joined the Government, and at this moment he is the only Minister in the chamber-cam e prominently before the public as the result of his vigorous attacks on the Ministry. Honourable members will remember that while sitting in the cross benches the honourable gentleman frequently condemned other before honourable members and measures introduced by the Government. I did not blame him for that. There were so many things wrong with the Government, in the opinion of the honourable gentleman, that apparently the only thing to do, to keep him quiet, was to include him in the Cabinet.",188
488,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"And in the opinion of the honourable member, the Cabinet bas become worse?",188
489,Mr DRAKEFORD,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes . The honourable gentleman has, no doubt, done his best to prop up a Government that is tottering to its doom. It was a difficult task, but like the latest kaleidoscopic change in the Ministry, it has been successfully carried out, so. that a new collection of ministerial stray pieces is now presented to the public gaze. The Postmaster-General (Mr Archie Cameron) is a vigorous and capable fighter, and no doubt his strength in that direction will be useful in propping up the Government. What is the exact reason for the increased defence vote? Until a few months ago it was considered that an expenditure of £43,000,000 spread over a period of three ""years would be sufficient to provide for the defence of this country. To that figure should have been, added £1,000,000 per annum, for civil aviation, making a total of £46,000,000 for the three years. Now we are expected to vote for still further expenditure. A month or two ago a grave crisis occurred in European affairs, but after much anxiety it was peacefully settled by negotiations initiated by the British Prime Minister. Since then there has been a deluge of propaganda in favour pf a considerable increase of defence expenditure. The spending of this money on unproductive war material greatly impairs our capacitv to carry out real social reforms. It also prevents this country from being made as attractive"" as it should be, and as it used to be, to people from overseas, except those unfortunates who are seeking refuge from war-scarred fascist-ridden countries. It does not now attract, as it did a quarter of a century ago, and as New Zealand is doing today, people from other countries because of better social and industrial conditions. On the contrary, the position has been reversed; we arc now losing that section of the population. That is a reflection upon the Commonwealth Government. This enormous expenditure on defence is a colossal burden for a young country to carry. I complain that honourable members of this Parliament have not been furnished with sufficient - lata on which to judge, the need for the impending of approximately £46,000,000 for defence purposes in three years and ihe further indefinite increase of that amount now proposed. Much of this expenditure is based on fears and propaganda which, for all we know, are mere distortions of the truth. We arc to have a statement from the newly appointed .Minister for .Defence (Mr .Street) on the position, and I am quite sure that if any one can make a case to justify the expenditure he will be able to do so, but I doubt if any one can. 1 do not think that any member of the Cabinet before its reformation could liave done so; that was, perhaps, one of the principal reasons fgr the Cabinet reconstruction. Recently, I addressed the Minister for Defence, upon vol ice, the following question relating to the amount of money being expended overseas on the purchase of war material:Will lie furnish the House with the total value of i in ports of arms and munitions and all materials associated with - the defence of Australia, excluding cruisers, for the years 1(131-32 to 1037-38. showing each vear separately? To-day I received the following reply:I am now in a position to inform the honourable member as follows:l!)3l-32 1032-33 11133-34 195.000 1 !>34-3r> 415,000 1935-3(1 708.000 1930-37 1.003.000 1937-38 (estimate) 1,587,000 Total .. 4,118,000 This information shows how unready, after seven years, are combination governments of the kind now entrusted with the task of governing Austialia to meet emergencies without resorting to importations from overseas. The money now being expended on defence might very well be used for the employment of our own people. Heaven only knows the extent to which the country has been committed for 193S-39. It will be seen from the figures supplied in answer to my question, that, whereas only £84,000 was expended on purchases of war material abroad in 1931-32, more than £1,500,000 was so expended in 1037-3S. I venture to suggest that when figures are made available for 1938-39, they will disclose that our overseas expenditure on defence requirements has been increased enormously. During the regime of the Labour Government the Labour party held the view that if the need arose Australia could rely on the British Commonwealth of Nations to.provide adequate defence for Australia. The composite government, which occupied the treasury bench for seven successive years, combated that view. It opposed the contention of the Labour party that the defence arm which needed development and special attention was the air force. Yesterday, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Green) read from an article appearing in one of the metropolitan newspapers, written by a person who termed himself a naval expert, in which the writer claimed that expenditure on battleships and cruisers was entirely unnecessary. That . view is shared by many people who think that the money could have been better expended in other directions of a purely defensive character. I was greatly interested in that gentleman's views. I do not think that any one in this House claims to be an expert, but we are all expected to formulate some views from the information placed before us. as to £ what is appropriate for the adequate 84.000 defence of this country. Labour's defence 00.000 policy, which was opposed by the Government, is now being given effect. The Postmaster-General to-night said that there are widely divergent opinions among the members of the Labour party as to what should be done for the adequate defence of Australia. I venture to suggest that the honourable gentleman knows quite well that Labour's policy in the terms enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition, published in the press, and broadcast throughout Australia on the 19 th October last. The terms of that policy were printed in the Canberra Times as well as in many other newswould papers throughout the Commonwealth, that Labour's attitude towards defence ""is very well known. What the press of Ausmachines. tralia thinks about the Government's formances position in relation to the defence of Auslast year or so. tralia is exemplified in a few quotations which I now propose to make. According to the Country party Bulletin of the 6th October last year, the then Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) said that he had the satisfaction of being able to assure Cabinet, from""his own personal investithroughout gations, that Australia's military organiHerald, zation was complete for any emergency. The Melbourne Herald, of the 14th clarity October, statedTlie weakest link in Australia's defence the present moment is the Federal Cabinet . . . It was seen that Australia depended for security on(1) A navy that could do but run for safety away from Australia if a has tile battleship entered our waters. (2) A land army of 35,000 ill-trained citizens, of whom it is estimated about 11,000 ore efficient enough take the field. (3) An air force that does not possess an eliicient modern bombing plane, and that, on the present provisions for replacement, might, with good luck, last three weeks under war conditions. In a later issue, published on the 22nd October, the same journal statedThere is uncertainty as to the defence deficiencies and doubt as-to what are the exact intentions of the Federal Government. That statement accurately reflects the state of mind of the people of Australia. In the Sydney Morning Herald of the 27th October, the following paragraph appeared:Despite the statements by the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) on the precautions taken in the recent crisis, the fact remains that the emergency demonstrated that Ausarising tralia was unready to meet attack. the deficiencies that were revealed were: the end of September the naval squadron was weaker even than it was during the starved years of the depression. Ur. Drakeford. If anybody was responsible for that, it is was certainly this Government. Now, however, it is making a bold rush to overtake the deficiencies, and is calling upon the people to shoulder a heavy burden of increased taxation to meet expenditure which, had the Government acted wisely, - never have been necessary. Another so paragraph from the same issue readsThe Air Force had no genuinely-modern In fact, no machines whose perapproach those of passenger planes that have been operating in Australia for the That is another indictment of the Government for its incapacity. I place the opinions of this journal on record because I believe that they are characteristic oftbe views expressed by other journals Australia. The Melbourne of the 31st October, statedThe September crisis showed us with great just what our own defences amounted to. It showed us that they were hopelessly inadequate even for protection against raids. at If that is the position of those who support the Government, 1 think the people its have little cause for gratification in respect of what the Government claims nothing else to have been doing. The Government is not approaching the subject of defence in the right way. It proposes that the people shall be taxed heavily to provide the funds necesto sa'ry for defence. Whilst that may be in accordance with the policy of the Labour party, if the information to which honourable members are entitled were given, it very might show that the proposed heavy expenditure is entirely unnecessary. Until the Government furnishes definite proof that it is now necessary to incur this enormous cost, I do not propose to rest satisfied with its efforts. The Treasurer (Mr Casey), for instance, has been emphatic in stating that money practically without l i m it can be made available for defence purposes. If the Government really believed that Australia faces a crisis, and if it were not indulging largely in propaganda prompted by a desire to j u s t if y itself, in the event of a similar crisis in the near future, it could find Some of money for defence other than by placing at on the people heavy burdens which they are not well able to carry. It could provide ample finance for defence by increasing the capacity of the people to defend this country. By following the example of New Zealand, it could make credits available for public works by which the unemployed could be put into employment. This would attract to this country additional population which could be utilized for defence purposes. The first essential in defence operations is capacity to concentrate forces strong enough to resist an attack, but the Government has entirely failed to make the necessary provision for that. Until recently, the Government appeared to believe that so long as it took steps to resist a possible raid, on the ports or shores of Australia, or to raise a quota of soldiers to send overseas, and to provide protection for the ships which conveyed them to distant parts, it was doing all that was expected of it. While the Government dallies with the project, the States are putting forward various other claims. The Government has not done things which would be of real value to the community by employing the people on useful works. [Quorum formed.] I have from time to time referred to the difficulties experienced by honourable whole members in getting complete informaonly tion as to what this Government doing. One can readily understand difficulties arising because it seems absoused lutely necessary for Ministers to devise bludgeon its legislation through. ways and means of propping up the Goimpression vernment. Its meetings for this purpose are frequently interrupted by the ringing of the bells, for a quorum. Occasionally, Ministers return to the chamber complete with a broad smile, or to make Government ponderous speeches, but, as soon as the bells have ceased to ring, corollary they quickly disappear. The fact that the need for a quorum was plainly from seen a few moments ago, even by porters bf the Government, shows that very little interest is taken by its own followers in the proceedings in this chamber. The method adopted in the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth is depriving members this Parliament of an opportunity to keep themselves fully informed as governmental activities. Such methods will help to lower the people's opinion the capacity of this Parliament as a [741 democratic institution to safeguard their interests. Honourable members are afforded no opportunity to examine in detail what the Government is advised by its experts to do. My four years' experience in this chamber has shown me that budgets are merely brought down for the purpose of giving honourable members an opportunity to talk, but not to enable them to make a complete and consecutive analysis of the governmental programme. We have had the spectacle today of the budget debate being interrupted in order to make way for what the Government considers to be important legislation. Instead of the budget proposals being continuously debated, so that members on both sides of the chamber may criticize them, these proposals are put under the table temporarily in order to make way for other measures. This prevents members from properly discharging their duties. The practice of the present Government-on e cannot call it a policy-is to keep the Parliament in recess as long as possible, and to exercise control by cabinet administration. During the of 1937, this Parliament met on only 30 days, and this year it has sat on slightly over 30 days - up to is the present time. Even when Parliament was in session the Government the "" gag"" and the "" guillotine "" to The which has existed since the last elections that all was not harmonious within the Cabinet, and that the same conditions still prevail, seems to have justification. It appears that the feels that the longer it can keep away from Parliament and its of party meetings the safer it is the dangers of further reconstruction from within, and from well-justified supcriticism from without its ranks. Instead of using the interregnum between the periodic sittings of Parliament for the purpose of giving consideration to the problems which Ausof tralia has to face, and of preparing legislation to meet them, it calls Parliato ment together only to obtain money to enable it to carry on, and presents a lean of programme framed, as far as possible, to avoid conflict between the parties of which it is composed. That is the kind of government Australia is suffering from today. Three main groups of political thought are prominent in Australia - The most important of these is that which supports the policy of the Labour party. Its numbers account for approximately half the total number of electors. The second group is that which supports the United Australia party, which nowadays has insufficient support to enable it to govern by its own strength. The third group is the Country party, which claims to represent those who live mainly outside the metropolitan districts, but allies itself to the United Australia party and obtains, in return, certain considerations, and,, some representation in the Cabinet, which destroys its power to render ful l assistance to the farming community. The interests represented by the United Australia party, find it to their interest to placate the members of the Country party, so that they may continue the process of the exploitation of the workers, including the farmers. The representatives of the country area3 agree readily to accept the plums of office, and then go on their way maintaining their own importance and letting the country down. There can be no real affinity between the exploiting interests of Australia and the farmer- I mean the farmer who farms, not the owner of the land which the farmer tills, which is very often a trustee company or a wealthy banking corporation. Gradually the truth of that is being realized by farmers and other country residents. When this realization is complete, or nearly so, as it is in New Zealand, the composite Government, as a factor in politics, will disappear, to the great advantage of Australia. Is it any wonder that under conditions such as I have described there is evidence of disintegration within the composite Government. The awakening interest of the farmers is indicated by the return to Parliament at the last election of men like the honourable member  Labour senators, and an independent representative of the farmers the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Wilson). This election result has compelled the representatives of the Country party Ifr. Drakeford. within the Cabinet to ask for things which the United Australia party section is reluctant to give, and so is bringing the Government to the brink of political disaster. The Government cannot lead, nor can it be led, in the direction of progress. To maintain its hold on office it must offer the exploiting interests an increasing share of profits, and, as farmers are now being 'squeezed harder than ever, they are becoming increasingly difficult to placate. They are now being told by the Government and by newspapers which support the Government that, in order that they may remain on farms which they do not own, and which might be taken by an undesignated enemy, many millions of money, in addition to the amount originally announced, must be expended to protect them and other citizens from the unknown. Out of this expenditure the friends of the United Australia party will reap increased profits, while the general taxpayers will have their burden increased. The present Government combination is incapable of evolving conditions in Australia which will serve to attract the kind of immigrants needed here. The Government is, in effect, under the control of the powerful financial groups which are the real government of the Commonwealth. These interests must be satisfied, and all of the Government's energies are concentrated on the achievement of this objective. The Government's channels of propaganda are flooded with statements calculated to keep our population in a stage of excitement, in, which it will readily submit to schemes that ordinarily would not be acceptable. Markets for the products of our farming community could be extended in Australia if the community were given greater purchasing power, by decreasing the hours of labour, and by undertaking a programme of essential public works, which would increase the avenues of employment and raise the standard of living. The better housing of the people, the provision of water conservation works, the carrying out of wisely-planned' forestry schemes designed to increase our timber resources and arrest the wastage of valuable land by soil erosion, the development of our oil resources, and the installation of plants to provide power for our industries, are all matters of major importance to which this Parliament could give attention if the Government did not prevent it from so doing. This Government and its immediate predecessors have used every conceivable means to retain office and power, but because of lack of capacity to initiate constructive, nation-wide work, very few, if any, important public works have been put in hand. The Government has not only failed to keep its promises, but it has also brought Parliament into disfavour and even disrepute with a fairly strong and rapidly-growing section of the community, which feels that Parliament is not oven trying to deal with our important problems. I propose now to revert for a few moments to the subject of parliamentary procedure in order to rebut certain remarks made by an honourable gentleman opposite during our recent discussion of the need to standardize our railway gauges. It is deplorable bhat our forms of procedure should permit honourable gentlemen who occupy high ministerial office to indulge in misrepresentation of a most unfair and unjustifiable description. I accuse the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) of such tactics, and I shall give an example of the kind of conduct to which I object. The right honourable gentleman attacked the Labour party for what he alleged to be its opposition to the proposal to proceed with the Brisbane-Kyogle section of the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge. I challenge that statement as being, not only inaccurate, but also sheer misrepresentation, for which it is hard to find any excuse whatsoever. The facts are that a bill was introduced by the then Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, on the ISth September, 1924, to authorize the construction of the Brisbane-Kyogle line. The then honourable member for South Sydney, Mr Biley, resumed the debate on the 25th September on behalf of the Labour party. Ho supported the bill without any qualification. As might be expected from the leader of the debate for the Labour party, he expressed the hope that the proposed new line would be only the first instalment of the complete plan to standardize our railway gauges, and concluded with these words- "" The bill should be supported by all honourable members who regard themselves as true Australians"".. After a discussion which basted one and a half hours, the debate was adjourned on the motion of the then honourable member for Kooyong, Mr. Latham, who resumed the debate on the 1st October and moved an amendment to the effect that the bill be withdrawn and referred to the Public Works Committee. The subsequent debate ranged largely around the amendment, and lasted from 4.57 p.m. to 1.30 a.m. Most of the time was occupied by Government supporters. On that date the debate lasted a little over seven hours, of which Government supporters occupied four hours and the Opposition three hours. The vote of the honourable member for Kooyong was not on party lines, for the majority-nin e out of sixteen-of those who supported the amendment were Government supporters. Their names wereMr M . Cameron. Mr R. W. Foster. Mr H . Gregory. Mr Duncan Hughes. Mr G. Hurry. Mr J. G. Latham. Mr J. H . Lister. Mr E. S. Mann. Mr S. C. Seabrook. The other five who voted for the amendment were Labour members, who believed that the proposal should be referred to the Public Works Committee, so that the relationship to the Brisbane-Kyogle section of the whole scheme of standardization could be examined to ensure it would be part of the general scheme, and that other States should not have to pay for a section of railway in New South Wales and Queensland and not get their portion of the work done. That their fears were justified has been shown by the regrettable-lack, of leadership and action since that time. The committee stage occupied only a brief time. The bill was put through without amendment in. an hour and a quarter of which time Opposition members occupied only ten minutes. These details are given only because of the grossly unfair attempt of the Minister for Commerce to make it appear that the Labour party attempted to block the Government's efforts to proceed with the first portion of the scheme for standardizing the gauges. If any attempt at delay took place-and I submit that there is not a tittle of evidence to support the charge-it originated among Government supporters, and the reflections on Labour made by the right honourable gentleman are without foundation. I emphasize this matter because something better is expected from a gentleman occupying the high office that he holds. Such misrepresentation causes a contempt for the parliamentary institution. I regret to have to say these things, but that is only one example of many that could be cited. Greater activity should be displayed in the search for oil. Honourable members can visualize the position in which this country would be placed in the event of war, for it would be without the means carrying on essential transport services. The Government has not placed before us any evidence that it is in earnest in this matter. When honourable members ask for information on the subject, they are told that the reports which the Government has received are secret. Some time ago I asked for information about the Railways War Council, and on repeating the question, the Minister wrote a brief note to the effect that the council had met on the 13th July, but that he regretted that he could not give any information because the official reports were secret. On one sion, the information was vouchsafed that the council had met once in ten years. Subsequently, some of its members were replaced by others, but what they did we do not know. What has taken place in connection with the Railways War Council has taken place also in connection with the storage of the oil necessary for defence; the representatives of the people are not given any information, except that a vast sum of money is to bo expended in the defence of the country. We are not told whether, from the moneys voted for defence purposes, a sum will be set aside to enable the search for oil'to be prosecuted more vigorously. It would appear that no strenuous efforts in that direction are being made. Australia has not a dock large enough to accommodate a battleship, yet the Government does nothing to stimulate the shipbuilding industry in this country. Any one who studies the position must realise that the Government has fallen down on its job. I shall take a later Mr Drakeford. opportunity to say more on the subject of shipbuilding. I hope that as the result of this debate something of value will be done. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) pointed out, the share of the wealth of this country which the workers receive is gradually declining. No nation can be successful - in such circumstances, especially'when, at the same time, rents and profits are increasing. That state of affairs may explain why people from other countries are not attracted to Australia. The reason for the Government's inaction is obvious. It is a capitalof ist Government which is controlled by anti-social interests. I do. not say that the men who form the Government are without humane feelings, but the social system under which the Government operates makes it difficult for them to do what they, as individuals, would like to do. There is evidence that the standard of living in Australia is gradually declining, and therefore I hope that even at this late stage the Government will awaken to the seriousness of the position, and do something to improve conditions. Notwithstanding that a great deal of the time of the occa- Government is taken up in patching up internal disagreements, I hope that it will be strong enough to seize the opportunity to put Australia on a sound basis, so that Australia, like New Zealand, may attract desirable people from other lands, and proceed to a brighter future.",188
490,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Hunter) [10.52] - I have listened to many budget debates, but I think that the present discussion is of a higher standard than usual, due mainly to the good example set by the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) in his speech on the constitutional relations of the Commonwealth and the States. His lead .was followed by the Attorney-General (Mr Menzies). It is to be hoped that the constitution session which the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) promised will be held soon. Although a definite pledge was given to the people that if they agreed to the federation the State parliaments would ultimately be abolished, they have never yet had submitted to them in a simple form a referendum to decide this issue. I believe that if they were asked to say whether or not they are in favour of the abolition of State parliaments, the answer would be in the affirmative. In 1925, the electors' were asked to agree to an amendment of the Constitution to give greater powers to the Commonwealth in regard to industrial matters, marketing, and trade and commerce. The referendum was fought more on party political lines than with any idea of benefiting the nation as a whole. Until we can reach agreement among ourselves, and go to the country as one party seeking these powers, I do not believe that we shall ever achieve any material alteration of the Constitution. In 1925, some sort of an understanding was reached by the then Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) and the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) regarding two of the three questions submitted, but when it came to the taking of the referendum, the political parties in the States found themselves at variance on the issue, though one party was no more to blame for this than the other. The Commonwealth Parliament cannot govern in the interests of the nation unless greater powers are ceded to it. I stand for complete unification; for the abolition of State parliaments. I know that any step in that direction will be opposed by certain vested State interests. When I took an active part in industrial matters, I advocated one union for the whole of the coal-mining industry, but 1 encountered much opposition from the officials of craft unions, who recognized that my suggestions threatened their jobs. I am convinced that a similar fear actuates many State members of parliament in their opposition to unification. They believe that if greater powers are ceded to the Federal Parliament, they will lose their jobs. I do not believe for a moment that, if the State parliaments were abolished, the existing representation in the Federal Parliament would be sufficient to enable the work of governing Australia to be, carried on efficiently. The present membership of this Parliament would need to be doubled, at least. Most of the duties now performed by the State parliaments could be more effectiveTv and economicallv performed by this Parliament simply by increasing its membership. At the present time, each federal electorate returns an average of three and one-half members of parliament, State and Federal. My own electorate returns five, while some others return four. If the present federal constituencies were split in such a way that each of them would return three members to this Parliament, I believe that much of the existing opposition to unification would disappear. On one occasion, when I was addressing my constituents on this subject, a member of the State Parliament said to me, "" It is all very well for you to advocate the abolition of State parliaments; you have a job, but what about us?"" That is typical of much' of the opposition to unification. The conflict and turmoil that are so widespread at the present time will continue as-long as responsibility is divided between State and Commonwealth Parliaments. Much of the existing industrial unrest is due to the existence of awards which are not uniform throughout the Commonwealth. Before the Federal Arbitration Court can function, there must be an interstate dispute. Before I entered this Parliament, I had a good deal of experience in regard to industrial disputes in the mining industry. Upon occasions, it was necessary to create an industrial dispute in order to bring the matter before the Federal Coal Tribunal. The recent coal mining dispute was definitely interstate in character, but even then the Commonwealth Government refused to intervene. Its excuse was that the constitutional validity of the Industrial Peace Act was doubtful, but if increased constitutiona' powers were ceded to the Commonwealth, those doubts could be removed, and an important step would be taken towards achieving industrial harmony. Another anomaly is that, while the Commonwealth Arbitration Court can prescribe wages and conditions of labour, the Commonwealth has no control over commodity prices. Sometimes, when awards are made by the Arbitration Court, manufacturers increase their prices by as much as 50 per cent, more than is necessary to meet the increased cost, but the Commonwealth Government can do nothing about it. In the same way, Parliament may grant tariff protection to a manufacturer, even to the extent of totally prohibiting the importation of competitive goods. In the same way under the cloak of the tariff protection given by the Commonwealth Government some avaricious manufacturers, because they have no competition, are able to increase the prices of their commodities above what would give them a reasonable profit. All that the Commonwealth Government can do to check them is to remove the tariff protection. These things are wrong. I could continue to relate anomalies, but what I have said should be sufficient to direct attention to them. There is need for uniformity of the basic wage. When Mr Lang was in power in New South Wales, the basic wage was maintained at £4 2s. 6d., whereas in other States it was forced down to about £3 a week. The result was that Victoria was able to flood New South Wales with goods. The Constitution prevented New South Wales from doing anything to prevent it. All that Mr. Lang could do was to send men around the stores to ask them to indicate on their goods the State of origin. It is grossly unfair that a manufacturer in New South Wales should have to pay higher wages than a similar manufacturer in Victoria. Not for one moment will I allow it to be thought that I am advocating a uniform basic-wage rate on anything but the highest level. I say not that New South Wales should come down to the level of the other States, but that the other States should rise to the level of New South Wales. This Government was returned to office on the catch-cry, ""Follow Britain "". It has done nothing in the coal industry that would indicate that that is its policy. In order to make itself independent of foreign oil and petrol supplies, Great Britain has developed the extraction of oil from coal and shale to a great degree, but this Government, despite constant urging by me and other interested persons, has refused to take similar action. It is of no use for the Minister for Defence (Mr. Street) to boast about the way in which the Australian defence forces are being If r . .Tames, mechanized, because without fuel a mechanized army is immobile. I understand that in Australia there is in reserve sufficient petrol for about twelve weeks. The average weekly use of petrol in Australia is 5,500,000 gallons, and the capacity of the storage tanks is only 60,000,000 gallons. We recently were scared by events in Europe, and if they had developed into war and our supplies of petrol and oil from overseas had been cut off, not only our mechanized defence forces-Army , Navy, and A i r Forcebut also our civil transport would have been immobilized. The new Minister for Defence, who has taken on his task with a will and a determination to give of his .best in the interests of this country, would wish to see Australia made independent of foreign oil supplies, and I urge that he investigate what has been done in Great Britain. On previous occasions I have advocated hydrogenation and a low-temperature process for the extraction of oQ from coal and shale in Australia by methods similar to those employed in Great Britain. I have cited sufficient statistics and adduced sufficient other evidence, including a statement in the House of Commons by the Minister for Mines, Mr Cruickshank, to prove that it would not be an experiment. Great Britain has undertaken this work as a commercial proposition. The product, I admit, is certainly dearer than well oil would be if discovered in this country, but when we realise that to the purchase prices of imported oil must be added the high cost of the dole now being paid to unemployed coal-miners, we must agree that it would be more economical to produce oil from the minerals which I have mentioned, at the same time Great relieving the States of the burden of the dole, than to import our oil requirements.",194
491,Mr FADDEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The oil companies would charge us whatever they liked.,196
492,Mr JAMES,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Yes , in the event of war the combine would be able to charge us any old price they liked. Furthermore, difficulty' would be experienced in wartime in keeping up our supplies from abroad, because of-the risks the oil-tanker8 would have to run in waters infested by enemy craft. I point out that in the Abyssinian crisis the companies which supplied Italy's requirements were chary of running the gauntlet in any region where their tankers might be attacked. Yet, in that conflict the source of was comparatively close to the port of destination. Furthermore, Italy was obliged to pay extraordinarily high prices for its oil supplies, and I can well imagine that we should' be similarly penalized in the event of international conflict. We need to develop sources of supply of our own in order to meet the requirements of our transport services even in peace time. Intimately associated with the problem of the defence preparation is that of relieving unemployment. A sum of £16,000,000 has been appropriated for defence purposes. How is that money to be expended? Will any of the unemployed be absorbed? The urgency for defending Newcastle, which is the centre of our great iron and steel industry, cannot be disregarded for much longer. It is an alarming state of affairs when we find that, owing to the lack of a suitable road, guns cannot be transported to Port Stephens from any point 8 or 10 miles inland. Port Stephens was once considered as a likely naval base, but it remains unfortified. Combined military, naval, and air forco manoeuvres were recently .carried out in this region, and I met a high military officer returning from those manoeuvres who agreed with me that it would be impossible to transport guns over the present road to Port Stephens. In such circumstances a hostile fleet would find it easy to enter that port, and destroy the important steelworks at Newcastle as well as practically all of the principal coal-mines in the vicinity. I sincerely hope that the new Minister for Defence will seriously consider these matters. I condemn the Government for applying the gag in order to curtail the debate on the problem of unemployment, on the motion moved yesterday by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde). I am convinced that it has no sympathy with the unemployed. Yet honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane), have the audacity to say that Labour members have no interest in the, unemployed. The Minister for Works (Mr Thorby) said in that debate, that unemployment supplies was not so serious on the coalfields as we had stated it to be. Unemployment figures based on returns supplied by the Registrar of Trade Unions are unreliable. A census which was recently taken of the unemployed in the northern district of New South Wales recently showed that in that district there were 10,000 youths, from 14 to 26 vears of age, who had never done a day's work. When I became a member of this Parliament the membership of the Northern Miners' Federation was 14,000, whereas today it has decreased to 7,500, due entirely to unemployment. Some of the money which will be expended for defence pm'poses should be utilized in relieving unemployment on the coal-fields. These men h(n« every right to be re-employed. Their position is tragic. Having worked beside them, I know them well, and can well understand their plight, which has been brought about through no fault of their own. I repeat that conditions on the coal-fields are appalling, many towns being stricken still with destitution. Is it any wonder, therefore, that hundreds of these men harbour mutiny in their hearts? Is it any wonder that many of these men are opposed to the present order of society which condones want, destitution, misery, and despair? Prior to the lt)34 elections, the Prime Minister and "" the then Postmaster-General (Senator A. J. MCLachlan), who was Minister in charge of Development, visited the Newcastle district and definitely stated that something would be done to assist the unfortunate unemployed miners. The Prime Minister definitely promised in his policy speech in 1934 that the Government would proceed with the extraction of oil from coal. Instead of redeeming that promise he arranged for Lord MCGowan, the chairman of directors of the AngloIran Oil Company, to report upon the whole project. Is it likely that that gentleman would report favourably upon an Australian project which, if success' fully developed, would compete with th« company with which he is so closely associated? It was merely a means of shelving the whole subject; the Prime Minister had no intention to give effect to his mise. Surely the Government does not expect single men to continue receiving a dole of Ss. a week and display the necessary patriotism in joining with the Government's proposals of enlisting in the defence forces. I invite those honourable members who have said that there is no unemployment problem, to visit the coal-field3 district where they will see for themselves the distressing conditions under which many persons are compelled to exist. During the whole time. I have been a member of this House I have always stated the truth, and have never attempted to mislead any one. Contrast the position of the unfortunate coalminers with that of the wheat growers whom the members of the Country party represent. Whenever the wheat-growers are in difficulties the Government introduces legislation to provide a bounty on wheat or a tax on flour. Measures are frequently brought before this House to assist fruit growers and other producers. Only today several"" bills were introduced to assist wheat-growers who, owing to drought conditions, are in difficulties. Have we ever heard of a wheat-grower who has lost his home or has been compelled to go on the dole? Miners have been compelled to live in tents in the bush, but it is seldom that farmers have to contend with such conditions. The Government should rehabilitate the coal mining industry, by producing oil from coal in the interests of defence. When the flour tax was imposed the unfortunate men receiving a dole of 8s. had to contribute an additional amount of tax. As they consume more bread than anything else the tax fell more heavily upon them than upon any other section. The poorer people must have a sufficiency of vitamins, which they get chiefly from bread. Other more fortunate sections, including members of this Parliament, having higher incomes, can get all the vitamins they require from more expensive foodstuffs. The percentage expended on bread by the parliamentary refreshment rooms is trifling in comparison with the percentage expended on bread in the average worker's home, or tvet the home of a man who is on the diile. Bread should be made available to Mr James. pro- workers on the basic wage at a more reasonable price. The poorer people, being large consumers of bread, make a far greater contribution than other sections to the incomes of wheat-farmers through the imposition of a flour tax, which is most unfair. I have mentioned this matter on other occasions in this House, but it is of no use to appeal to the Government for concessions on behalf of .the poor, because it takes no notice. The provision of Christmas cheer was urged a day or two ago by honourable members on this side, but the appeal brought no response from the Government. In fairness to the Treasurer (Mr Casey) I must say that two years ago he made available to the Defence Department for clothing the sum of £3,000 for the distribution of surplus military clothing to the poor in my district. But what happened ? The Defence Department sent a lot of useless junk, which was immediately condemned by the health inspectors, and it should have been thrown into the incinerators. I do not know whether the Treasury was reimbursed the amount, but it certainly should have been returned, because the Defence Department did not give value for the money voted. I regret that we have never had an opportunity to discuss this important matter in an impartial way, and without becoming heated. If honourable members supporting the Government would accompany me to my home at the week-endI travel approximately 700 miles each week in order to be at my home every Sunday-the y would find in my yard a queue of workless people waiting to interview me and find out if I can do something for' them. These people are not hoboes. They are decent living folk. During the last war the miners responded more generously than any other section of the community to the call to fight in the defence of their country. They sent two battalions of infantry and three battalions of sappers overseas. No one can question the loyalty of the miners, who today have to go cap in hand begging for the dole and left-off clothing. All that this Government can give them is worn-out military uniforms and boots. I have seen this stuff, so I speak from personal knowledge. The soles of some of the boots offered were worthless. The mayor of the town requested me to inspect this clothing, and asked me if I could expect the men to wear it . I said "" Certainly not."" I rememoer the occasion very well, because on returning to my home I had the misfortune to crash into a telegraph pole, and, as the result, had to spend five weeks in hospital. These men have a just claim to the consideration of the Government. If the Government wishes to disp.ay generosity towards one section of the community, let it be towards that section the members of which take their Hves into their hands in the bowels of the earth in order to extract the coal supplies necessary to produce power for transport and industry. I have worked side by side with these men. I have witnessed many disasters, and have seen many of my mates slain. To-day they are subjected to want and poverty. They do not want the dole; they want work. But, because they represent only a small section of the community, and because their parliamentary representatives in this chamber do not sit on the treasury bench, nothing is done for them. The treatment of these deserving people is vastly different from that meted out to another small section of the community represented by the Country party in this House which, because it holds the balance of power, is able to satisfy its most exorbitant demands. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. NEWGUINEA : ADMINISTRATIVE CAPITA L SITE : PROPOSED ROAD : OIL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Motion (by Mr MENZIES) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",196
493,Mr HARRISON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Wentworth-Assis tant Minister) [11.40] - I crave the indulgence of the House to make a statement which, I think, will be of interestto honourable members generally. It has to do with the decision of the Government concerning the establishment of a new administrative capital site in New Guinea. As honourable members are aware, the Government has had this matter under consideration for a considerable time. It will be recollected that, following the disastrous volcanic eruption which occurred at Rabaul, the capital of the territory, in May, 3937, investigations were made by scientists as to the safety of the area with a view to determining whether it would 1*3 wise to retain Rabaul as the chief administrative centre of New Guinea. The scientists reported, after visiting the area, that on account of the possibility of volcanic eruptions near Rabaul, reasonably early evacuation of the site as the main administrative centre must be seriously considered, and they expressed the opinion that the risks involved in the maintenance and extension of the town were incomparably greater than the immediate loss inescapable from early aban-. donment. Acting upon that advice, the Government decided, in November, 1937, that the administrative head-quarters should be removed from Rabaul to a site in the territory to be selected, and a committee was appointed to visit the territory and to advise as to the location to which the head-quarters should be transferred. The committee, after investigation, submitted a report in which the following recommendations were made :1. Lae (on the coast in the Mnrobe district on the mainland of New Guinea) be the site of the administrative head-quarters. 2. Salamaua (also on the coast about 20 miles in a direct line from Lae) be the port for the administrative head-quarters, and to be-developed as the chief port of the territory. 3. A roadway (estimated length, 45 miles) to be constructed to connect Lae and Salamaua. The estimated expenditure involved in the committee's proposals was as follows:Transfer of administrative head-quarters from Eabaul to Lae, including houses and other buildings at Lae, £248.000. Lac-Salamaua road, £150,000. Rabaul district services-provisio n for district staff to be in a safe place near Rabaul£45,000. Total, £443,000. The committee also mentioned the need for the following works in New Guinea, but as they are not directly concerned with the removal from Rabaul they were not taken into account by the committee in estimating the cost of the transfer of the administrative head-quarters:1. The development of Salamaua as the port of the administrative head-quarters and as the chief port of the territory (no estimate of cost given). 2. Road from the coast to the gold-fields (the cost of'this work has since been estimated at £150,000). The Government found these recommendations unacceptable, and, after a visit to the territory by the then Minister in charge of Territories (Mr Hughes) it was decided that Salamaua should be both the chief port and the capital of the territory, and that a road should be constructed from Salamaua-to Wau. It was arranged that a loan of £150,000 should be raised by the Administrator of the territory and that the interest on the loan and the redemption thereof should be met by a toll to be levied on users of the road. The Commonwealth Government agreed to guarantee the loan and the New Guinea Loan Guarantee Act 1938 was passed by Parliament in July last for the purpose. Since then, surveys of possible routes have been made and at present the engineers of the New Guinea Administration are checking the survey of a direct route of an estimated length of 47f miles between the two places. Detailed examination of the Salamaua area by the Administrator and his technical officers raised doubts as to whether sufficientland for the whole of the administrative head-quarters could be obtained there without very extensive works. The Government, therefore, decided to review the whole matter and, in the meantime, to give effect to the recommendation by the vulcanologist, Dr Stehn, for a system of warnings to be established at Rabaul in the form of a well-organized and equipped vulcanological observatory.",199
494,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,Where is the observatory to be located?,200
495,Mr HARRISON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"In close proximity to the scene of the recent disturbance, near Rabaul proper.",200
496,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I suppose that, it will be located on a site reasonably immune from subsequent disturbances.",200
497,Mr HARRISON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The site was selected after the most careful examination of the situation. As a matter of investigations are now being made at regular intervals within the crater itself with such instruments as are available in order that precautionary measures may be taken by residents at the earliest sible moment.,200
498,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"I have no doubt that care will be taken to ensure that the observatory will uot need to be reconstructed at a later date, and that it will be sufficiently far away for safety, yet sufficiently close to enable effective work to be done.",200
499,Mr HARRISON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Dr Stehn expressed the opinion that the observatory should be capable of providing warnings of impending volcanic activity sufficiently in advance of an outbreak to enable the population to remove to places of safety. Steps are now being taken to establish such an observatory as soon as the scientific instruments and specialized staff can be obtained. Other safety measures recommended by the vulcanologist, such as roads of exit from the town, the establishment of a camp in a safe area, and a periodical inspection of the volcanic areas, have been in operation for some time. Investigations that have been made clearly demonstrate that the chief administrative centre of the mandated territory of New Guinea should be located on the mainland of the island of New Guinea. The examinations which have so far been made have not disclosed a site that possesses all the desirable attributes of a location for the chief administrative centre. The possible sites are Salamaua, Wau, Lae, and an area near Madang, but none of these, according to the information at present available, is outstanding as a suitable site. The question of a unified control for both Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea was considered before civil administration was established for New Guinea in 1921, and on several occasions since then the possibility of establishing a combined administration has been investigated. Although the plan has many advantages,""there are also many difficulties associated with it, and until now it has not been found possible to forfact, mulate a workable scheme. The Government considers that the time has arrived for the matter to be further investigated, and, therefore, it proposes to make a thorough survey of the possibilities of pos- bringing about an amalgamation of the administration of the two territories with one administrative centre for both. Pending completion of such investigation, it is not proposed that a separate site shall be selected for the administrative headquarters of New Guinea; but realizing that such a site must be on the mainland of New Guinea, either in the Territory of .Papua or in the Territory of New Guinea, it is proposed that certain functions of government which must inevitably remain at a seaport shall be removed from Rabaul to themainland at the earliest possible date. It has, therefore, been decided that arrangements shall be made without delay to transfer from Rabaul to Salamaua the centralstaffs of the Departments of Trade and Customs, Public Works and other activities of a like nature. The staffs of the other departments of the administration will remain at Rabaul until investigations have been made as to the possibility of a unified administration for both territories. Taking advantage of the provisions of the territorial ordinance for the establishment of an oil advisory committee in each territory, I have appointed Dr Arthur Wade and Dr L. Keith Ward as members of the Oil Advisory Committee constituted under the ordinances relatfollows:ing to prospecting and mining for petroleum in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea.",200
500,Mr CURTIN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"Fremantle) [11.54] I should like the Assistant Minister (Mr. Harrison) to inform me later, whether any steps have been taken by the authorities to proceed with the construction of the road from Salamaua to Wau, or whether the work will be held up pending the result of an inquiry as to the most economical route. I should also like to know whether any steps have been taken by the Assistant Minister or his department to carry out the suggestion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Green) in regard to the calling of tenders for the leasing of a considerable area of forest country New Guinea. The honourable member for follows:Kalgoorlie suggested that the area should be subdivided so as to prevent the estabing2. industry lishment of a monopoly. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPER. The following paper was presented :Northern Australia Survey Act-Aerial , Geological and G-eoplrysical Survey of Northern Australia-Repor t of Committee, fur period ended 31st December, 1037. Ordered to be p r in t e d . House adjourned at 11.57 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers io questions were circulated:« CIVIL AVIATION DEPARTMENT: TRANSFEH TO CANBERRA.",201
501,Mr HUTCHINSON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice I. What will be the cost of transferring the Civil Aviation Department to Canberra? 2. How many officials will be affected by the transfer? 3. What accommodation will have to be provided at Canberra, and at what cost?",201
502,Mr THORBV,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1. The exact cost is not yet available. 2. Approximately 80. 3. About 50 cottages for married members of the staff, and accommodation for about 30 single members of the staff. Office accommodation will cost about £15,000. SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY.",201
503,Mr WATKINS,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has he seen the statement in the press that the United States of America proposes to build 50 merchant ships, and that the Government will make large contributions towards their construction cost? 2. In view of the importance of shipbuilding to Australia, will the Commonwealth Government give similar assistance to shipbuilding in this country?",201
504,Mr LYONS,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The answers to the in honourable member's questions are as 1. Yes. The matter of assistance to the shipbuildin Australia is at present receiving the consideration of the Government, and it is hoped that a decision thereon will shortly be reached. TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY: CARRIAGE  Interior, upon notice I. Arc perishable goods being carried on the transcontinental railway from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie on passenger trains at goods freight rates ? 2. Is this practice continuing despite the provision of express goods trains additional to ordinary goods trains? 3. Is it a fact that the Commonwealth railway authorities have considered that the accelerated transcontinental passenger service cannot suitably cater for the carriage of goods traflia on passenger trains? 4. If the answer to paragraph 1 is in the affirmative, in the light of the effect of this action upon the Western Australian Government Railways and Western Australian producers, is it an unreasonable discrimination between States? 5. Will he ensure that goods traffic carries the rates of freight appropriate to passenger train transit when so conveyed?",201
505,Mr MCEWEN,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner accepts a restricted quantity of perishable goods for conveyance on passenger trains at goods rates, and this practice has been in operation for a number of years. 2. The quantity of goods EO conveyed has been curtailed very considerably since the introduction of the fast passenger service, and the transport at present is confined practically to perishable f r u it traffic. 3. Yes. 4. Perishables are given the fastest possible transit in the interests and at the request of Western Australian consumers. The question of unreasonable discrimination between the States does not arise as if desired it would apply in the transit of such consignments from Western Australia. The fruit-growers and the greengrocers of Kalgoorlie have recently expressed to the Commissioner their sincere appreciation of the facilities provided, and only this month the Kalgoorlie Municipal Council carried a resolution urging the Commissioner to accept an increased quantity of f r u it for conveyance by passenger train. 5. The matter is one of management under the Commonwealth Railways Act 1917-1936, and the practice is consistent with the provisions of that act. WIRELESS BROADCASTING: SESSIONS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES.",202
506,Mr FORDE,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Will he ascertain whether any broadcasting stations are giving daily sessions in foreign languages ? 2. If such sessions are given over the air, OF GOODS. will he take steps to have them stopped?",202
507,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,The answer U the honourable member's questions is as follows:1 and 2. When this matter - was investigated recently it was ascertained that no such sessions were being held. If there had been auy they would have been immediately stopped. Further inquiries will be made.

If so, will the submarine become a permanent addition to the Royal Australian Navy ? 3. Is it proposed to seek the co-operation of yachtsmen in all States in forming anti-sub.marine schools, or is such co-operation to be limited to Sydney?",202
509,Mr STREET,WHEAT INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE,"The answers to the honourable members questions are as follows:1. It is hoped to arrange for a submarine to visit Australia next year, when the opportunity will be taken to carry out anti-submarine exorcises with units of the Royal Australian Navy. 2. No. 3. The anti-submarine school is being estaib lished at Sydney and it is intended to raise the necessary force there. .",202

512,Mr GREEN,MANUFACTURE OF AEROPLANHS IN,"the Minister administering External Territories, upon notice I. Is it a fact that for a considerable period of time there has been a general request from the white population of the Territory of New Guinea for an alteration of the Judiciary Ordinance to institute trial by jury? 2. Will he favourably consider the question of the introduction of trial by jury to the judicial system for the white population of the Territory, and no apply one of the cherished historical institutions generally applicable to British communities?",203
513,Mr HARRIBON,MANUFACTURE OF AEROPLANHS IN,-The answers to honourable member's questions ore as f o l lows :1.

515,Mr HARRISON,MANUFACTURE OF AEROPLANHS IN,.The mandate under which the Territory is administered by the Commonwealth Government prohibits the military training of the natives otherwise than for purposes of internal police and local defence of the Territory and provides further that no military or naval bases shall be. established or fortifications erected in the Territory. The provision of finance to meet the cost of any measures for local defence of the Territory to the extent permitted by the manAUSTRALIA. date is a matter for arrangement between the mandatory power and the local administration.

520,Mr STREET,MANUFACTURE OF AEROPLANHS IN,"On the 18th November the honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) asked the following question, without noticeWhen plans are being formulated for the housing of plant and equipment at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory and other munitions factories will consideration also be given to the need to provide housing accommodation for the employees? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that during the war it was decided to build 100 houses at L it h gow for employees of the Small Arms Factory, but ever siuce then there has been great difficulty in getting purchasers and tenants. Since Hoskins iron works were removed to Port Kembla and some of the coal mines were closed, much residential property at Lithgow has been unsaleable. It is not considered necessary for the Commonwealth to provide further housing at Lithgow, nor is it considered necessary to make provision at other centres.

523,Mr STREET,MANUFACTURE OF AEROPLANHS IN,"On the 18th November, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Rosevear) asked the following question, (Mr without notice:Is it a fact that machinery similar to machinery that is lying'idle at Lithgow has been installed in the annexes to private establishments for the manufacture of munitions? Is the Minister for Defence prepared to give an appears undertaking that in future no machinery wirl be installed in those annexes in duplication of idle machinery in the Government's own munitions works, and that no orders for munitions will be given to private companies until the FOB EMPLOYEES. whole of the machinery at the Government's factories is in use? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that some machines of the type installed at the Small Arms Factory are also being installed at armament annexes, but for different manufacturing purposes. A certain number are idle at present at the Small Arms Factory, but they are required as a reserve for rifle and machine gun manufacture in time of war. A similar position exists in Victoria where machines with suitable tools and gauges are installed at the Government ammunition and ordnance factories, and the. same class of machines is being in stalled at armament annexes. Each group has its particular function in the munitions production programme, and the programme could not be fulfilled if the machines in one locality were diverted to purposes outside those for which the accompanying tools and gauges have been designed.",204
