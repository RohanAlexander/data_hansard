Mr ANSTEY - I ask the Treasurer, in connection with the alleged disappearance of Australian notes, what is the amount involved in the supposed frauds? Is it a fact that the Notes Issue Board has ceased to register £1 and 10s. notes designed for cancellation and destruction ?",12
2,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I have a statement here, which I have obtained from the Acting Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, in which he saysClose investigation has not disposed any fraud, though it is possible there have been some minor irregularities, but the amount in' volved cannot bo large. The alarmist press reports are quite unjustifiable. The Auditor General concurs in the above remarks. I have the following letter also from the Auditor-General, addressed to the Secretary to the Treasury:-In reply to your memorandum of this day's date, I. have to say, for the information of the Treasurer, that inquiries have been made on my behalf by an Audit Inspector with respect to the alleged abstraction of cancelled notes, and of the placing again j n circulation uncancelled notes in substitution for the cancelled notes. No evidence whatever has been produced, so far as I am aware, lhat su:h action' has taken place, nor that any notes were missing. The whole matter is one merely of suspicion, it having been stated that one of the officers engaged in the supervision over the destruction of the notes appeared to be living beyond his income. Another supervising offlcor, namely, the Audit Officer, representing myself at the burning, was charged with being temporarily absent on oacasiun when burns were commenced or in progress. This charge Mr Mills, the officer referred to, denies, and 'says that on one occasion he had to attend to the telephone. Mr E. RILEY - Will the Treasurer say who were the gentlemen who made the inquiries with regard to the alleged disappearance of Australian notes? Were theyinterested parties employed by the Bank? If so,, will the honourable gentletion man have inquiries made by independent persons ?",12

5,Dr EARLE PAGE,RINDERPEST IN WESTERN,"The report is not yet to hand. COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION on the COURT. ALLEGED CONGESTION oir BUSINESS. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - On the motion for adjournment on Friday last the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Coleman) mentioned the matter of the plaint of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the Australasian Society of Engineers, and the Blacksmiths Union. He suggested that there was dissatisfaction owing to delay, and a probability of strikes in consequence. I have made inquiries, and I am informed by the President of the Arbitration Court that the matter is going on quite satisfactorily. The date for the hearing has been fixed. The unions concerned have made no complaints to the Court arid do not ask for precedence over other unions, and before leaving for Darwin the President was assured by their accredited representative .that there was no probability of a strike. NA SERVICE. CANCELLATION OF CONTBACT.",13
6,Mr MAHONY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"B y way of explanaof a question I propose to ask, may I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to the fact that some considerable time ago the House approved of the build* of two ships for the Lighthouse Ser-> Govice. Recently steps were taken by some to cancel the contract for the building of one of these ships. A tender was called for in a public way, the Cockatoo inIsland Dockyard was the successful tenderer, the contract was allotted and the agreement signed. I should like the Prime Minister to tell the House why the contract for one of the ships was cancelled. If he does not know, will he have inquiries made to ascertain the reason for the cancellation of the contract?",13
7,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I shall have the facts on looked into, and shall advise the honorreport has able member later. PUBLIC WORKS OOMMITTEE. AIRCRAFT DEPOT AT LAVERTON. Mr GREGORY, as Chairman, brought up the report of the Public Works Committee, together with minutes of evidence, establishment of an aircraft depot at Laverton. Ordered to be printed. WHEAT GUARANTEE.",13
8,Mr LACEY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"In view of the fact that wheat-growers are awaiting a decision on the subject, will the Prime Minister make an early announcement of the Government's intention with regard to a guaranteed price for wheat for a voluntary pool for the current year ?",13
9,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"A similar question was asked me on Thursday or Friday of last week, and I then indicated that the Government would announce its decision on the subject at the earliest possible ' moment. WIRE NETTING DUMPING DUTY.",13
10,Mr GREGORY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to the imposition by the Customs Department at Fremantle of a dumping duty of £55 on £133 worth of English wire netting, equivalent to £11 per mile, although, the invoice value is only £7 per mile less than the price of Australian wire netting? In the circumstances, will ""the Government seriously consider the repeal of the Tariff Board Act, and the introduction of legislation for the imposition of an absolute embargo upon the importation of manufactured goods into Australia ?",13
11,Mr BRUOE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"My attention was drawn to the facts in this case by the honourable member himself. With regard to the second part of his question, the Government cannot state its policy in reply to questions asked in this House. LABORATORY AT BROKEN HILL .",14
12,Mr BLAKELEY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"In view of the portance of the establishment of a Commonwealth Laboratory at Broken Hill, will the Treasurer sympathetically consider the making of sumcient money available for the carrying out of that work?",14
13,Dr EARLE PAGE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,The matter will be considered when the Estimates are being dealt with. - IRISH BOUNDARIES COMMISSION.,14
14,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I desire to inform the House that the British Government is referring certain difficulties under constitutional law, which have arisen in connection with the Irish Boundaries Commission, to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the Lord Chancellor is most anxious that Dominion Judges should sit as members of that Committee. An invitation has been issued to Australia to consent to the services of the Chief Justice of the High Court being made . available. It is understood that a similar invitation has been issued in regard to the Chief Justice of Canada. Although it is extremely difficult to make the services of the Chief Justice of the High Court available, the Government has felt that thero is an obligation to comply with the wish of the British Government in this matter, and it has accordingly cabled agreeing to Sir Adrian Knox serving upon the Committee. He will leave for Great Britain by,.the Moldavia, which sails on the. 10th June. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.",14
15,Mr COLEMAN,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the fact that the British Government promises a statement regarding wireless developments, and of the fact that by the beam method the possibility of transmitting the human voice between England and Australia has been successfully demonstrated, he is in a position to make an announcement on the subject of wireless telegraphy generally?",14
16,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I assume that the honourable member's question refers, not to broadcasting, but to wireless telegraphic communication generally. During the past week-end, not merely was telegraphic communication possible, but the human voice was actually heard by i m - the beam method of transmission. It is evident from this that the discoveries which have recently been made in further advancement of long-distance wireless transmission, suggest the very greatest prospect of some satisfactory arrangement by which we shall have direct communication with the Mother Country in the near future. At the moment, however, I have no statement to make, although I am in communication with the British Government in regard to the matter. NEW GUINEA TERRITORY.",14
17,Mr FORDE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) been drawn to the serious disclosures being made in Tha Labour Daily, of Sydney, in connection with the administration of the mandated territory of New Guinea? If so, has any action been taken in consequence thereof?",14
18,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"My attention has been drawn to the newspaper articles referred to by the honourable member, and the fullest inquiries are being made into them. I hope, during the course of the day, to bo in a position to make a statement to the House. CINEMATOGRAPH FILMS.",14
19,Mr BAMFORD,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Some days ago I asked the Prime Minister if he could inform the House who are the censors charged with the duty of inspecting and passing cinematograph films,. and if their practice is to examine the filmsthemsolves, as they are thrown upon the screen for public inspection, or if they are satisfied with the synopsis of the story of pictures? The Prime Minister was good enough to say that he would make inquiries and let me know later. Is he now in a position to make a statement ?",14
20,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I certainly feel that I owe the honourable member an apology. The information he has asked for should have been available already. I have not . it by me now, but I shall certainly get it for him in the course of the clay. I regret the delay that has occurred. WAR DEBT TO GREAT BRITAIN .",15
21,Mr WEST,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Prio r to his departure to attend the Imperial Conference the Prime Minister promised to get certain details concerning Australia's funded war debt to Great Britain of £92,000,000, and to say what he accomplished at the Conference. It is an important matter for me, as I want to make up my balance sheet.",15
22,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,What is the question?,15
23,Mr WEST,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I asked the Prime Minister, some time ago, in reference to the £92,000,000 owing by Australia to Great Britain, and he promised to make a statement to the House. I thought this a convenient opportunity to revive his memory.",15
24,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,That is not a question. NA INFORMATION. FOBMAL MOTION or ADJOURNMENT.,15
25,Mr SPEAKER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing an urgent matter of definite public importance, namely, "" In correct and misleading information deliberately supplied to honourable members of this House and others by departmental omcers in connection with the case of exPrivate William Holland, No. 3088, 38th Battalion, to the detriment of that ex-soldier."" vvue honourable members having risen in their 'places, * - - -» ' Question proposed.",15
26,Mr BRENNAN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL," [3.15] The motion is a formal one, and is moved for the purpose of discussing a matter of the greatest importance, which you, sir, have just stated. I am only sorry that, notwithstanding my desire to compress my observations into the smallest reasonable compass, it will be, I am afraid, impossible for me to deal with the whole subject in the short space of half an hour. I shall, therefore, have to ask the indulgence of honourable members for a slight extension. I take it that it needs no argument to establish the seriousness of supplying misleading de« partmental information to this Chamber, to its members, or to representative organizations outside. The case is much more serious when the misrepresentations are considered and deliberate, as in this case. Honourable members know perfectly well that Ministers, for the information they give to this House in answer to questions, are largely dependent upon the good faith and integrity of our public Departments. Honourable members know, equally, that the House itself is largely dependent, in respect of its legislation for the whole of Australia, upon information so received. I am happy to be able to say that it has been, I think, our general experience that the trust which we have placed in our public Departments has not been abused. It would be a very grave matter if we had in this country a secret bureaucracy, working behind closed doors and acting in contempt of Parliament. I undertake to prove that this case is an exception to that good record to which I have referred and admitted. I undertake to prove that the members of the Repatriation Commission, and at least one senior officer of the Department, have deceived and misled members of this House in circumstances that show conclusively wilful deliberation on the part of one or more of the persons concerned. I am in the happy position of being able to base my case upon records already published in Hansard, and upon written communications bearing the signatures of the officers concerned. Some few gaps I shall fill in during this address. The persons to whom these misleading statements were deliberately made-the case goes back: a considerable time-were Mr W. M . Hughes, the present member for North Sydney and then Prime Minister; our late colleague (the late Mr Frank Tudor), then Leader of the Opposition; last and least, as far as this House is concerned, myself; and, outside the House, members of the Fairfield Branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Association, members of the Fathers Association, and others. The substance of the deceit, for so I call it , is(1) The statement by, or on behalf of, the Repatriation Commission, that the medical opinions in Defence, Pensions, and Repatriation Departments were unanimous that military service had not caused nor aggravated Holland's physical condition; whilst, in truth and in fact, the bulk of the medical testimony in possession of the Commission declared plainest possible language that Holland's physical condition was either caused by, or aggravated by, his military service. (2) The statement by, or on behalf of, the Repatriation 'Commission that there was no evidence to show that Holland's condition was attributable to war service, either by way of origin or aggravation; while, in truth and in fact, there was a great deal of evidence by Medical Boards and medical men of high standing supporting the view that Holland's condition was attributable to war service, either by way of origin or aggravation. ('3) The persistent suppression of material facts relating to the medical testimony in the case. In this case Holland is not the defendant; the defendants are the Repatriation Commissioners and their omcers, and I do not want honourable members to be sidetracked into a detailed investigation of the merits' of his claim. I am satisfied that he has been cruelly wronged, but if I refer to the details of his case it is merely for the purpose of establishing the proposition I have set out to prove, which is a much more serious matter than the wrongs of any individual case could possibly be. The following is a short history of Holland's case.:Now living at 57 Gotch-street, Northcote South. Enlisted, 8th January, 1917, at Melbourne; embarked on s.s. Ballarat, which was torpedoed and disabled; and, whilst being transferred to a destroyer with other troops, he slipped off the ladder and was drenched. He spent five or six hours on the deck of the destroyer, and a night in a shed at Plymouth, all of which resulted in a bad cold, which developed, and, after four weeks' training, he was .sent back to Australia and discharged medically unfit. 22nd December, 1917. Tuberculosis had not manifested itself as early as that date, but now Holland is at an advanced stage of that disease. I do Mr Brennan. not guarantee the accuracy of minute details which are not essential to my case, but I guarantee the accuracy of every essential detail. On the 8th July, 1920, the late Mr Frank Tudor wrote to the Repatriation Commission as follows:Ex-private W. Holland, 2088. 57 GotchBtreet, Northcote South - Enliste d on 8th January, 1917; embarked on 19th February, 1917; and returned on 22nd December, 1917. He was. on the Ballarat when she was torpedoed, and later contracted asthma. He has been in the hospital on and off ever since. Only recently he left the hospital after being there ten months. Mr Holland is in need of assistance. Will you kindly look into his case to see what can lie done for him? I ask honourable members to note the fact in the - althoug h they may not see the importance of it for the moment-that the letter contains no request for a pension for Hol land, but is simply a kindly inquiry from a man who is now dead, but who was grossly deceived in the reply he received from the Repatriation Department on the 13th of July, 1920. That letter, which was signed by Major Ryan, Deputy Commissioner, was as follows.: - Re ex-No. 3088, Private' Holland, William, 38th Battalion - Enlisted , 6th January, 1917; discharged, 22nd December, 1917; served, England; disability, over age; pension, nil. In answer to your communication of 8th July regarding the above-mentioned man, I have to inform you that Holland served in England only; he continued camp training until 2nd August, 1917, when; on account of his age, he was medically boarded and returned to Australia. He was not in hospital during this time, and on his return was medically boarded at No. 11 Australian General Hospital, and discharged immediately for senility. His incapacity due to war service was assessed as nil. He was 60 years of age when he enlisted, but gave his age to the Defence Department as 44 years. Several Medical Boards have examined this man between 2nd August, 1917, and 4th February, 1920; on behalf of the Defence, Pensions, and Repatriation Departments, and their opinions are unanimous that military service has not caused nor aggravated his present physical condition, which is due to age and constitution. Re s.s. Ballarat - Hi s claim that he suffered from the torpedoing of the Ballarat is not feasible, in that he continued training without any hospital attention, nor has he claimed his Ballarat experience as a cause of his asthma until last March. It is noted that the troops disembarked from the Ballarat into boats, and were not subjected to extra hardships or immersion. Mr Holland's case has been fully considered by this Department and the honorary medical consultants, and also by the Commission, which body has decided that, as hiB present trouble is not due to nor aggravated by his war service, repatriation benefits cannot be granted in this case. At this stage I acquired certain information from Mr Ratcliffe, secretary of the branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League to which I have referred, acting for his organization, and from Mr Clayton, president of the Fathers Association. Too much credit cannot be given to these gentlemen for their services in this case. Mr Ratclifte, in particular, has displayed not only remarkable perseverance, but also marked ability in laying the foundations of the case which I am presenting to the House. As a result of the information which these gentlemen supplied to me, I wrote to the Repatriation Commission on the 11th of February, 1924 - this is more modern history-askin g for the production of the file of the Holland case, and on the 13th of February, 1924, I received a reply from Major Ryan in the following terms: I am in receipt of your letter of 11th February, 1924, requesting that you be allowed to inspect the file relative to - the above named. I regret to state that your request cannot be acceded to, as. all the records of this Depart- statedment are confidential. I am, however, prepared to answer any questions relative to Mr. Holland's applications for benefits from this Department which you may be pleased to ask verbally or addressed to me in writing. Perhaps, however, the necessity for further action on your part may be obviated by perusal of the attarhcd copy of a letter addressed to the late Mr F. G. Tudor, M'.P., who made representations on behalf of Mr Holland in July, 1920. Thus in the most solemn manner did the Commission, on the 13th of February, 1924, confirm the letter written on the 13th of July, 1920. The deliberately in correct and misleading statement in that letter was contained in the following passage : Several, medical boards have examined this man between the 2nd of August,. 1.917, and the 4th of February, 1920, on behalf of the Defence, Pensions, and Repatriation Departments, and their opinions are unanimous that military service has not caused nor aggravated his present physical condition, which is due to age and constitution. That statement was false in all material particulars, but, recognizing that these - gentlemen were in the place where they were demanded of conscience to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, the communication from the Department was falser in what was suppressed than in what was incorrectly expressed. On the 3rd of February, 1920,. which date falls with in the period deliberately chosen by Major Ryan, a Board, consisting of Lieutenant-Colonel Enabling,, who was Holland's commanding officer, Colonel W . Summons, and M a j or H . I r v in g , all eminent medical men, reported on Holland's case as follows:Private Holland is suffering from chronic asthma and bronchitis. He is at present requiring further hospital treatment, and is totally incapacitated. His disability was aggravated by military service, and the Board recommends that he be granted extension of halfpay. That statement alone destroys the validity of M a j or Ryan's letter in regard to the unanimity of the declarations of the medical men. But it is by no means all. M a j or Ryan has taken the period from August, 1917, to February, 1920. When he wrote to me he had before him another report, submitted on the 11th of March, 1920, about a month later than that above quoted, by a Board presided, over again by Colonel Summons, and of which M a j or H . I r v in g was a member. That report Has been in hospital continuously for last four months. Suffering from chronic bronchitis and asthma, and is lately much improved. Aggravated by war service. Present condition weak, and still suffering from chronic bronchitis and' asthma. Disability is permanent; 100 per cent, incapacity. Recommend hospital for one month. I amtold on excellent authority that these Boards were brought about in this way. The first Board was constituted by Lieut - Colonel Embling, who, I have already said, was Holland's commanding officer. He had had this patient under observation for no less than two years. He associated himself with the two other doctors as a Board, and it found as I have said. As the result, of that, the Principal Medical Oflicer, Dr Sturdee, constituted what is known as a Finalization Board. That was the second Boards As a result of its finding, Holland was detailed by the Principal Medical Officer for a pension, and the whole matter was - minuted by General Brand, the State Commandant for Victoria, so that in the most solemn way possible these medical men, who knew best, declared that H o l land's condition had been "" caused by or aggravated by his military service."" Mr R. GKEEN - What was the date of that last Board?",15
27,Mr BRENNAN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"The 11th March, 1920. But that is not all. On the 17th November, 1919, between the dates arbitrarily selected by Mr Ryan, D r Ronald G. Stott, a medical officer at the Australian General Hospital, Macleod, reported as follows regarding Holland:I certify that he is complaining of dyspnoeacough duo to asthma-whic h was, in my opinion, caused through his employment . in war-like operations. The doctor went on to say that Holland needed hospital treatment. ""We have in Dr Hiller an eminent physician. On the 10th December, 1919, he was Senior Medical Officer at the Australian General Hospital, Macleod. W it h Dr Stott he had this man under personal observation, and he declared and certified that, so far as he could ascertain, the bronchial condition was not present before, the claimant went on service, and was directly the result of service abroad. In addition to that, if furthe r support of this part of m y case is needed, on the 17th October, 1923, Dr MACGillicuddy, the Commonwealth Medical Referee, after a perusal of the whole file, and careful examination of the patient, reportedFrom a careful inquiry regarding his. history, and from my examination, I am of opinion that his present condition of ill-health dates from the exposure to which he was subjected after the torpedoing of the Ballarat on the 25th April, 1917. At the time Mr Ryan wrote to me, when he had had three years to consider the matter, and the Commission had had special reasons to consider it, the recorded opinions of six highly qualified medical men were against him. Tliose opinions were contrary to what he reported, when he had the audacity to tell me that ""several medical Boards had examined the claimant, and their unanimous opinion was that m i l t a r y service had not caused or aggrasion vated Holland's present physical condisoldiers. tion."" I have established to demonstration that the letter of the Deputy Comlenge missioner contained grave mis-statements, sion ? and I say that these were deliberate and w i l f u l , because there was correspondence on the file which directed the attention of this gentleman and the members of the Commission to the reports which I have quoted as favourable to Holland. At stage I propose to refer to a communicathe tion addressed to Mr Hughes. I note in passing thab poor Holland, having been refused a m i l it a ry pension, applied for an invalid pension. H is application for a m i l it a ry pension was rejected on the ground that his in validity did not arise outside Australia or while on military service, and his application for an invalid penson was rejected on the ground that his invalidity was occasioned outside Australia. I , therefore, leave' it to the House to say where the invalidity arose. Mr Ratcliffe addressed a letter to Mr Hughes, who at this time ""was famous as "" The Little Digger."" A f t e r forma l inquiries by Mr . Deane, representing the Prime Minister, we have a letter from Mr Deane to Mr . Ratcliffe, detailing the result of his investigation, in these terms:Further to iny letter of the 27th February regarding the case of ex-Private William Holland, 38th Battalion, I desire to inform you that the Chairman of the Repatriation Commission advises me ' to the following effect:Ex-Private Holland enlisted at the age of 60 years, although when he enlisted he gave his ago as 44 years. He served only a few months in England and was not admitted to hospital whilst there. He was returned to Australia because of his enlistment over age, and was discharged solely on account of senility which, however, was in no way attributable to his war service. Since he first claimed a pension be has been medically examined on a number of occasions, but, in the opinion of the medical omcers, his health is in no way impaired as a result of his service in the Australian Imperial Force. The Commission cannot admit Mr Holland as being eligible for a war pension. It is regretted that, in view of the finding of the Commission (and it should be borne in mind that the Commission includes a representative of the soldiers) it does not seem possible to accede to the request contained in your letter of the 21st February. I ask the House to consider the supreme i - irony of the remark about the Commisincluding a representative of the",18
28,Mr MAXWELL,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Was this the first chalof the rejection of a military pen,18
29,Mr BRENNAN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"No . The representative, so-called, of the soldiers, is Mr . Teece, to whom I shall refer later. This communication refers to the Chairman of the Repatriation Commission, and I have this been quoting also a letter signed by Deputy Commissioner for Remay patriation, but I say that there is the strongest possible internal evidence that the man responsible in this case, the man - who is deeply involved in it, is Mr Teece, the Deputy Chairman. I declare, without the slightest hesitation, that he continually prevaricated in connection with the matter, sometimes audaciously and extravagantly, and sometimes with subtle' hypocrisy, but where he had to choose between candour and its opposite, he shunned the truth, and deliberately went the way of those who, by tradition, are required to have long memories. The sentence beginning with the words "" Since he first claimed a pension "" is an audacious perversion of the truth. To prove it , I turn now to the answers to questions which I asked in this House. When I asked for the names of the members of the various Boards, and details of the medical opinions upon which the Commissioners relied for the statements they had made in the letter just quoted and in the letter of the Deputy of the 13th July, 1920, I receive4 this reply1. The Boards, whose finding were relevant to the claim for war pensions, and which were referred to in the letter mentioned, were as follows :(a) and (b) Report dated 2nd August, 1917, on Army Form B, 179 Weymouth, England, by Board consisting of Captain E. SleKenzie and Captain Boy Dunn, reads"" Disability stated as over age, origin prior to enlistment. Stated his age was 44| years on enlistment, but was then 60 years of age. To what extent his earning capacity lessened in general labour, marked ""Not at all,"" his disability the result of military service?"" None of these. On the 21st November, 1917, Drs. W. B. Vanee and H. S. Forrest reportedOn the transport Borda-disabilit y over age, emphysema, complained of nothing. Discharged as permanently unfit, present incapacity nil. On 7th December, 1917, report by Lieut Colonel H. W. Bryant and E. Buller Allan readsDischarge recommended, over age, incapacity nil. Honourable members will observe that tbese reports were made before Holland's discharge ancl application for a pension, and also before he had any serious ailment. . The reports are negative in character, and colourless. I do not blame the doctors; they were no doubt quite correct in saying that the man's incapacity was nil. At that time his disease had not developed, and it was not possible to diagnose the condition in which he would be one, two, or three years later. One of these Boards, with a supreme burst of humour, said that his disability was over age, and it added ""not due to war service."" For the reasons I have mentioned, these reports may be disregarded; but I beg honourable members to remember that I am not now attempting to show conclusively that the balance of evidence is in Holland's favour. I ask members to bear in mind that the officials denied that there was any evidence on his side, whilst I am proving that there is very little evidence on their side, and a great deal on the side of Holland. There is one other report on which the Commission relied, and surely that will be revelant, because it relates to a much later time. It is a report by Lieut - Colonel C. C. Macknight and Major G. E. Deravin, both medical men, ancl was dated 4th February, 1920This man could only have been in Britain for a few months (and those summer months), as he enlisted 8th January, 1917, and was i boarded as "" unfit and over age,"" in August, 1917. Complained of nothing on discharge, 7th December, 1917. In our opinion his present condition is not due to war service.",18
30,Mr SPEAKER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. Motion (by Mr Charlton) agreed to by an absolute majority of the members of the House<That the Standing Orders be suspended to enablo the honourable member to continue his speech.,19
31,Mr BRENNAN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"I thank honourable members for their courtesy in granting rae an extension of time. The report I have just quoted is relevant and definite, and within the time when Holland's incapacity developed. Unfortunately for the gentlemen who regarded this report as their sheet anchor, the doctors who signed the report did not see the patient. Of course, I am told by certain departmental officers that the doctors saw the file, and those gentlemen of the Department are worshippers of the file; indeed, I am assured by some of them that I should not take notice of anything but the file, but curiously enough these same worshippers of the file have disregarded about three-quarters of its most important contents. Let it not be thought that I am casting ridicule upon Drs. Macknight and Deravin. Those gentlemen were, and arc, discharging a useful office in connection with repatriation, and I have no doubt that their report was honest, and, to a certain extent, it may have been useful. One of those gentlemen I personally know to be the soul of honour and efficiency ; but note what follows. I find a letter addressed by Mr Eyan, Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation, to Mr Holland, ou the 5th of March, 1920I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st March, and in reply to inform .you thiat your presence was not necessary when the honorary consultants considered your case, the medical evidence on the file being sufficient to show that your present disability is neither due to nor aggravated by your war service. Honourable members will see that the officials have disregarded the last report, pointing out that the medical men merely concerned themselves with what was already on the file. Mr E. . RILEY - A layman could have done that.",19
32,Mr BRENNAN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"E x a c t l y ; though possibly not so well. .The gentlemen who depend upon that report admit by letter that the examination by Drs. Macknightand Deravin meant little in that it was merely retrospective, and that the application was governed by what""ha.d taken place earlier. We, therefore, get this amazing result, that whilst the Commission referred to the examinations that took place after the man applied for his pension, the startling truth is that after making his application he was never examined by a Board or medical men who gave a report adverse to his claim. In other words, whilst the officials 'declare that the medical evidence is iinaiiimously on their side, as regards the statements they made relating to the period subsequent to the application, the medical evidence is unanimously in Holland's favour. Mr Ryan added in his letter, "" This decision - must be regarded as final."" Then, of course, f o l lowed formal expressions of regret from Mr Hughes that in the circumstances nothing cotild be done, but Mr Ratcliffe and his Xeague, with exemplary .perseverance, persisted in their efforts to get a pension or other redress for Mr Hol land, and their activities drew from Mr Teece a letter dated the 19th May, 1922, in which he said"""" The Commission has now made .a complete perusal of Holland's file, and has decided that it cannot admit him for treatment at Macleod Hospital as there is no evidence to show that his present condition is attributable to war service, either by ""way of origin or aggravation. I can find no new words to describe that letter, but I shall make an attempt by saying that it would be difficult to compile a communication of six lines more fully charged with the elements of deceit and suppression. Mr Ratcliffe continued the correspondence on a certain aspect of the invalid pension claim, and an alleged compassionate allowance which he was endeavouring to get for Holland. Curiously enough, even in this matter, Mr Teece broke faith and distorted the obvious meaning of the language which he had used in regard to a promise he had made. In a further - letter dated the 13th June, 1922, Mr Teece wroteIn reply to your letter dated the 11th June, 1I have to advise you that, on the medical evidence submitted to it, the Commission had no option but to refuse Mr Holland the pension which he claimed. Mr Ratcliffe pursued the matter, and directed Mr Teece's attention to the reports. He wrote asking if he had seen them, or had had them before him when arriving at his conclusion. Mr Teece, in a characteristically evasive communication, repliedThe Commission has .again carefully considered the case of Holland, to which previously it had given careful scrutiny, and can do no more than set out in my letter dated the 13th June, 1922. He was asked a simple question. There is a. well-known distinction between the suppression of the true and the allegation of the false.; and Mi*. Teece's reply can best be described as - an unmixed falsity of suppression. On the 19th July, 1922, Mr Ratcliffe repeated by letter the straight-out and simple question, in perfectly polit'i language, whether the Commission, when the letter was written, nad had before them the three medical reports already referred to, and, if they had, on what ground they had disregarded them. Really, the way that Mr Ratcliffe hung to his quarry in this pursuit almost converts me to the truth of the well-known refrain about "" boys - of the bull-dog breed""; Mr Ratcliffe is certainly - one of them. On the 1st August, 1922, ' Mr Teece wrote this letter, another masterpiece of, must I say, - disingenuous""nessI n reply to your letter of the 19th July, I have to advise that the 'Commission has disiregarded none of the medical reports which were in the possession of the Department connection with the application of the named for pension. When Holland first applied for pension, the Medical Referee stated- "" In our opinion his present condition is not due to war service."" The present being made by the Commission is purely of a compassionate nature, and is certainly not admission that Holland was eligible in the first instance to receive a pension. That letter reveals Mr Teece practising dishonesty mare carefully than hitherto. He raised a mean littl e quibble, which, however, has no legs, to which I shall refer in a moment. His passion for in accuracy is shown by the statement that when Holland first applied for a pension, the medical board reported: "" In our opinion his present condition is not due to war service."" That report was made, not when Holland first applied for a pension, but two years afterwards, if the answers given by the Commission to my questions are correct.",20
33,Mr CUNNINGHAM,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Who made that requestions port?,21
34,Mr BEENNAN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"It was made by medical gentlemen who had not seen the patient. Mr Eatcliffe pressed the farther, and Mr Teece, finding himself lost in a maze of inconsistencies sions, eventually took sanctuary in safety zone of the prevaricator, by clining to answer anything further. I would have been much better for him if he had refused to do so earlier. questions will naturally ' suggest selves to honourable members. will ask, why should these liberate statements be made when the less file is on record to disprove them? answer to that question is happily at hand. Through the courtesy of Colonel attention Luscombe, of Base Eecords, the Defence files were made available to Mr Ratexistence. cliffe and Mr Clayton, of the Soldiers' Fathers' Association, and they ous extracts from them. The Repatriation Commission at first did not know this. H ad the file not been thus revealed, this sad case would have ruary, been still embalmed in the archives of the Repatriation Commission, and opinions nothing would ever have been heard of it . physical One wonders how many such cases there are of unfortunate returned men, who have not had the friends that this man has had to fight his case untiringly. wonders what the records would disclose if some single-minded Commissioner of in honest pur-pose were appointed to make aboveinvestigation into these matters. When Board I asked for the file of documents, the Treasurer immediately over-ruled the grant Deputy Commissioner and, very properly, an I think, made it available for my inspection in the library. Then Mr Teece and his confreres, knowing that other men had inspected the file, had no option but to surrender, and make the best excuses they could. I shall be asked whether - these gentlemen conspired together. I do uot think so, as it will be possible to show that both Colonel Semmens and Mr Ryan knew little about the matter. The case was in the hands of one Commissioner; it was his case-h e was dealing with similar cases-and he knew all about it . I do not allege conspiracy. It is important to consider the excuses that were made by these gentlemen, and I ask honourable members to bear with me a moment while I examine them. The show that reliance is placed on a p it if u l quibble. It is stated that no medical board "" with access to all files has considered this man's condition as due .to or aggravated by his service,"" and matter numing through the answers is the suggestion that none of the medical and evaevidence I have quoted was worth the even mentioning, because, although the deBoard had access to it and had it , t it was not incidental to Holland's application for a pension. For that reason, Some apparently, the. Commission thought that themwhat I have quoted this afternoon was They not only unworthy of mention to honordeable members of this House, but so worththat it could not be extracted from The them, by Mr Ratcliffe. It was so unimportant that when Mr Ratcliffe called to it , Mr Teece would dp anything rather than disclose its worthless I remind honourable members of the sweeping phrase in Mr . took copiRyan's letter, which readsSeveral Medical Boards have examined this man, between 2nd August. 1917. and 4th .Feb1920, on behalf of the Defence, Pensions, and Repatriation Departments, and their are unanimous that military service has not caused nor aggravated his present condition. Honourable members w i ll notice that Mr . Ryan there surveys the whole field of One this man's military history. He is not concerned merely with his application, for a pension; he mentions the date of his enlistment, throws doubt upon the fact that he was ever cast into the sea, points out that he was older than he said he was when he enlisted-though that was not regarded as a very great offence during the war-and that he served for only a short period in England. In a word, everything connected with this man's military history, from the time he enlisted to the present day, has been carefully paraded if in the remotest degree it is calculated to throw discredit on the man; but nothing in his career, however significant, or from however exalted an authority it might come, which tends in any way to establish his reputation or. the sound basis of his claim, is in any circumstances to be admitted or disclosed. It must be remembered, also, that two of the three reports upon which the Commission rely to holster up their excuses were made prior to Holland's application for a pension. I have already shown that those reports are negative in character, colourless, and of little avail. Honourable members well know that the Repatriation Commission took over the Defence records. The Pensions Branch was first administered by ithe Treasury. In 1920,- the Repatriation Commission was established by an Act of this Parliament, and it became the bounden duty of that Commission to have before it the record-and especially the medical record-of every man with whom it had to deal. If anything further on that point is necessary, it is supplied in the fact that the Commission had before it these records on this man's file. They were there when the file was shown to me and when it was examined by Dr MACGillicuddy, the doctor who made the latest examination of the case. I do not expect honourable members to assimilate the whole of these facts in a moment. I do not expect the Government to act-I' am sure it will not-upon ex parte statementsmade by me in this House. But I do say that I have made a mo3t searching examination of the merits of this case, and of the relevant documents, and I have come deliberately to the conclusion that, not only is Mr Teece utterly unfit for the position which he holds, but that he is unfit to hold any position in the Public Service of this country. Mr Brennan.",21
35,Sir GBANVILLE RYKIE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member has stated that one Board reported favourably on this man's case, and stated that his condition was due to war service. Was that a departmental Board?",22
36,Mr BRENNAN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Certainly . Two Boards and at least three independent medical men reported in that way. I once heard the honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie), whilst he was a Minister, say, from his place in this House, that "" somebody had sold him a pup,"" and that he had inadvertently deceived the House. I have often, in debate, had occasion to cross swords with the honourable member; but I assure honourable members that I would, nevertheless, cheerfully leave it to him, if necessary, to decide whether, on the documents, I have not absolutely established my case. The truth is that somebody started off by practising deceit. He forgot the adageOh, what a tangled web we weave When first we practise to deceive. He went from bad to worse, until he reached the position that is now disclosed by the records. I do not anticipate that in a reply lasting fifteen minutes or half an hour the Minister can deal adequately with the matter - I do not expect honourable members, at a moment's notice, to measure the truth of my statement of the position; it would not be fair to ask them to do so. I remind them, however, that if ever there were a matter from which the party aspect was absent this is such a matter. It will become a party matter only if the Government, because of a mistaken sense of its duty and of the position which it occupies, stands behind officers who have deceived honourable members. We may, indeed, "" throw up the sponge,"" if we are to be supplied by the Departments with distorted reports, and cannot rely upon the probity of our public servants. We may say harsh things about each other, but we have always confidently believed that at least we have been and are being honestly advised by the officers of the Departments. I leave the matter where it is, for the Government to take whatever action it thinks fit. If it does not take action, I shall endeavour to take such action as commends itself to me.",22
37,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4.6] - A few days ago, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) asked me, as the Ministerial representative of the Repatriation Office, . certain questions, and I gave him very full replies. I point out that since I have been administering this Department I have made available to honourable mem^bers, without any reservations, whatever files have been asked for by them. All I ask, as a medical man, and as one who knows exactly the point of view of patients, is that a man's private medical history should not be made public if to do so would be prejudicial to him. It was for that reason that, last year, I proposed the appointment of the Soldiers' Committee to deal with these cases. files are always available to honourable members when they make application for permission to peruse them. debted to the honourable member for Batman for drawing my attention to this case. I confess that a perusal of the files to enable me to prepare a reply to the honourable member disclosed stupidity in the handling of the matter that was beyond my ability to comprehend-. It had been held, on the one hand, that this man was not entitled to a war pension, because his invalidity had not been caused by war service; while on the other hand he was refused an invalidity pension because his invalidity had occurred outside Australia!",23
38,Mr WATKINS,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,There have been similar cases.,23
39,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,I know of no other similar,23
40,Mr WATKINS,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,I brought one to the honourable gentleman's notice.,23
41,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"When I found bilities how the matter had developed, I at once and asthma. asked the Commissioner for Invalid and Old-age Pensions to tell me exactly what the position, was, and to make certaiu that, at any rate, an invalidity ports? pension was granted to this man, who had gone overseas ancl shown a willingness to fight, even though he not fought abroad. I found that, some two years previously, the Departments themselves had realized what a. stupid position had arisen, and instead of giving an invalid allowance-which , technically, it was not possible to give-the RepatriaColonels H . W. Bryant and tion Commission had made available Mr Holland a compassionate allowance equal to the invalidity pension of per fortnight. That allowance was riven to him on the 5th May, 1922, and it has since been increased by the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Board to 35s. a fortnight. Accordingly, during the whole of this year, he has drawn an amount equal to the present invalidity rate. The fact that the Repatriation Commission took action to secure that the invalid pension should not be withdrawn from Mr Holland discounts to a great extent the charge of animus on the part of the Commission towards this unfortunate soldier, which has been suggested by the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan).  The charged with having given false testimony.",23
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"We must rememI am in- ber that the Repatriation Commission has to administer an Act which was passed by this Parliament after due deliberation. That Act contains a provision for the making of regulations. Whatever the desires of its members may be, the Commission can consider only the Act and the regulations made under it. Officers of the Department - have been charged with having made false statements, but what are the facts? Altogether six Boards have deliberated on Mr Holland's case. Of these, four were appointed for the purpose of ascertaining his right to a war pension. The other two were military Boards, quite inde-' pendent of repatriation, their object being to determine his capacity to remain permanently in the home Forces. All the four Boards which inquired into the question of a pension were unanimous, as the letter of Mr Ryan states, that his disawere those of old age-emphysem a",23
43,Mr BRENNAN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Can the honourable gentleman give us the dates of those re,23
44,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"The first Board, consisting of Captain E. MCKenzie' and had Captain Roy Dunn, reported on the 2nd of August, 1917. On the 21st of November of the same year the second Board, comprising Drs. W. B. Vance and I-I. S. Forrest, furnished its report. The third Board, consisting of LieutenantE. to Buller Allan, presented its report on the vth of December of that year. The 30s. report of Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. MACKnight, and Major D. E. Deravin, who comprised the fourth Board, was received on the 4th February, 1920. The two military Boards were those conducted by Lieutenant-Colonel W. Summons and Major H . Irving. Their purpose was to determine whether Mr Holland was cap^ able of continuing in the home service. The first four Boards had before them Mr Holland's whole medical history, as well as his application for a pension, or for discharge. They had access to the whole of the files, and their conclusions were based on that evidence. The Boards which inquired into his capacity for further service did not have regard to his past war service. They were not concerned whether his injuries were due to war service or not. They merely had to determine whether he was fit to .remain in the service in the future. There is a material difference between the objects sought by the two Boards. It is admitted that this man was over age when he was accepted for military service, although he gave his age as 44 years. Dr MALONEY.;-How old was he at the time ?",23
45,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"I do not think his birth certificate has ever been produced to the authorities, but on various occasions he has given the year of his birth as 1857, 1863, 1864, 1865, 1867, 1868, 1869, 1872 and 1873. - Dr MALONEY - Was he examined those times?",24
46,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Thos e are the different years stated by him on various occasions as the year of his birth. One can understand that a man who was anxious to go to the Front might set his age down at 44. It is also conceivable that, having reached the other side, and having had a taste of the effects of the climate there on his weak chest, he should omit to dye his. hair and moustache and endeavour tb make himself appear his correct age.",24
47,Mr OKEEFE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Coul d not a medical man have told if his hair and moustache were dyed ?,24
48,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"That might not always have been considered politic. The Ballarat, on which Holland was travelling to the Front, was torpedoed, but he did not apply for medical treatment on that account. Instead, he went into training on Salisbury Plain, and it was not until a period of a month or six weeks had elapsed that he made application for treatment, because of the effects which he said the torpedoing of the vessel had had ou him.",24
49,Mr MATHEWS,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,That shows he is not a schemer.,24
50,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"It is not suggested that he is. I regret the stupid bungling which has taken place in connection with his application for a pension. The torpedoing of the Ballarat had practically no effect on him at all. All the medical statements of his condition while in the Forces are conclusive evidence to me, as a medical man, that he was suffering from chronic bronchitis and asthma, and that the conditions existing on the other side of the world were the cause of his return to Australia. I understand that, at present, although he is not a tubercular patient, he is suffering from chronic asthma and emphysema.",24
51,Mr MAXWELL,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Ha d the Government his medical history before enlistment?,24
52,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,No .,24
53,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Were those four Boards asked to report regarding his continuance in the service, or regarding his pension ?",24
54,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"The first two inquired regarding his fitness to continue in the Australian Imperial Force, and the others regarding his pension. Their reports, which may be read by honourable all members, show that there was no necessity for further exam'nation, and that in December, 1917, Holland was in a condition which, in my opinion, Was permanent, . for whatever he might do, or wherever he might go, his chest condition would get worse. They dispose of the suggestion by the honourable member for Batman that the medical evidence regarding this man's condition was obtained, not by personal examination, but from files, and they prove that his capacity for further service was practically n.l. I am not able today, with the limited material at my disposal, to answer the charges made against Mr Teece, a member of the Repatriation Commission. Although the honourable member for Batman spoke about the "" bias"" of Mr. Teece, he did not establish against him any definite charge of intent to interfere with Mr Holland's rights. Although Mr Holland, Under the Acts which control pensions, was technically not entitled to a pension, the Repatriation Commission did what lay in its power, by granting him a compassionate allowance, to meet the special circumstances of the case.",24
55,Mr SPEAKER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Rt. Hon. W. A. - The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,25
56,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Hunter) [4.22] The House is indebted to the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) for by bringing the case of Mr Holland under notice. If inquiry is made it will found that this case is typical of many others. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) has endeavoured to cover up the shorttime comings of his officers rather than answer the statements made by the orable member for Batman .i I am pleased to say that in the Departments of the Commonwealth generally we have very or competent and reliable officers, who try to give honourable members all neceswrecks. sary information for their guidance. It would appear, however, that there is room . for a searching investigation garding the action of the particular officer referred to by the honourable ber, who stated that he did not charge officers generally with conspiracy, but that he charged only one officer. That man, I understand, is the representative on the Board of the returned soldiers.",25
57,Mr LISTER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,He was.,25
58,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"It is as well that he is so no longer. The honourable memtheir ber for Batman charged that officer with giving misleading information to honorservice able members and to the House. When a case is presented to honourable members they should be able to obtain reliable information from officials controlling Department concerned. It has been shown that the late Mr Tudor was miswent led because he was not supplied with complete information, and the honourable member for Batman has been similarly misled. Even the Treasurer, when he answers questions in the House, is in possession of the fullest mation. He has stated that at least two Boards out of four reported that the man was not suffering from any disability to war service. The other two Boards were asked to report upon his ability continue in the military Forces. As against that, the honourable member for Batman has shown that two other Boards, making six in all, have also reported the case, and that they reported that was suffering from incapacity resulting from war service.",25
59,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Thos e Boards examined him with a view to determining Watt). his fitness for home service.,25
60,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Of the four Boards referred to by the Treasurer, two reported against the man, and two in favour of him. In addition, there are four opinions doctors stating that the man is suffering in consequence of war service. There be are two Boards opposed to two Boards, and four medical testimonies in favour of the man. His disability occurred some after he was discharged. Every to member of the House has had similar honcases brought under his notice. Men known personally to honourable members have been discharged asfit,but one, two, three years afterwards, have become, as a result of their war services, physical",25
61,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,I have in my repocket particulars of two such cases.,25
62,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"And I have prememsented many others to the Government. It is one of the most difficult things in the world to get a medical Board to testify that their condition is due to war service. It does not matter whether this man was over age when he enlisted. I can recall the time when we applauded men who were over age and enlisted, for it was argued that their action was evidence of anxiety to serve their country. The question is, ""Were they fit for active ?"" If a doctor appointed by the Government passed an applicant as fit to go abroad, that man surely has a claim upon this country when his health is imthe paired by the service he rendered. If he was accepted for active service, if he abroad, and if , as a result of active the service, he is incapacitated in any way, how can we shirk our responsibility?",25
63,Mr MAXWELL,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,The misstatement as not to age in this case has not been used possible inforagainst the man.,25
64,Mr CHAELTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"No , and it should not be. There are many more who, like due him, enlisted when they were over the age limit. I have a case in my mind of to a father of seven sons. He and four of the sons went to the war, and one of the sons was killed. The father was over age when he enlisted, and upon his reon turn to this country he was discharged he from the forces as fit. Within twelve months, as a result of shock received at the front, he became an inmate of an asylum. He received no recognition from the Government, notwithstanding the services that he and his family had rendered. The time has arrived when, in justice to such men, the Government should issue an order providing that when there is any doubt about the cause of an ex-soldier's incapacity, he should be given the benefit of it. I am quite certain that honourable members will agree with me when I say that there are many young and middle aged men who have come back from the front and, with large hearts, have commenced to work, who, after a year or two, when they have found themselves partially incapacitated as a result of their war services, have had their applications for pensions rejected because incapacity was held not to have occurred as a result of war service. Is it likely, that the health of these able-bodied men Would have broken down except as a result of war service ?",25
65,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,The conditions of war service contributed to their breakdown.,26
66,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Exactly .,26
67,Mr FENTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,The honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse) expressed a similar opinion.,26
68,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes . This Department should be administered sympathetically. Such a man cannot legally be granted an invalid pension under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, because the disability arose overseas. The authorities, however, have granted a compassionate allowance of 10s. a week, which is a ""munificent"" sum to pay to any person in such circumstances. question very much whether the Board has the power to grant even a compassionate allowance, although it has done so in this instance. In addition to the paltry sum just mentioned, this man is allowed an invalid pension of 5s. a week, and, as the incapacity occurred overseas, even that amount cannot, I think, be legally paid. This unfortunate man is receiving a paltry 15s. per week when the invalid pension is 17s. 6d. per week.",26
69,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,He is now receiving 17s. 6d.,26
70,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"That is.a ridicuThis lous sum to pay a man.against whom f u the only charge that can be laid is that he enlisted when over 45 years of age. Whatever his age may have been at the time of enlistment, he rendered good service to his country, and, prior to enlistment,' was passed by the doctor as sound. Subsequently he became incapacitated, and the Board, which is supposed to treat such cases sympathetically, has declined to recognize his claim. This case is similar to many others, and, although it is necessary to reduce expenditure in this Department as far as possible, such expenditure should only be reduced legitimately, as Parliament or the Australian people do not want an injustice to be done to any man who served in the Great War. When we were seeking recruits, it was said, from every their platform, that we would stand by those who offered their services, and would see that they were provided for. We have now no right to quibble in regard to matters of this kind, and to deny sustenance to the man who has perhaps a wife and family to keep, and who rendered excellent service at the war. This case is so glaring that it demands immediate attention. Every one disregards the question of age. It must be admitted that an incorrect age was given, not for the purpose of deriving any benefit, but simply with the desire to serve.",26
71,Mr MAXWELL,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,And the country connived at it.,26
72,Mr CHARLTON,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes ; and the action of such men was applauded. I do not think the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) should endeavour to protect the officials by covering up their conduct. A searching inquiry should bo made, not I only into this case, but into others of a similar character, so that justice may be done 'to those who have been unduly penalized. It is heartrending to listen to the stories told by many similarly placed. The case of a married man with a wife and two children has been brought under my notice. When he came back from the war, he returned to his employment at the ' Newcastle Steel Works. He had some trouble in his left knee, which he thought was due to a bump, but which afterwards extended up the left arm, ancl is today so acute that he cannot work. man is receiving only one-half the l l pension rate, as he is regarded as 50 per cent, incapacitated. He cannot work at all, and his claim for a full pension is turned down on the ground that his incapacity is not due to war like operations, although he was 50 per cent, incapacitated when he returned. One could quote dozens of such cases. Although we wish to reduce the heavy repatriation expenditure we should nob deny justice to these men. I trust the Government will see the necessity of acting promptly in an endeavour to clear this matter up, and if any one in the Service has been guilty of misleading Ministers or honourable members that person should not be allowed to remain in the Public Service. I do not say that any one has wilfuly misled Ministers, but if it can be proved that that has been done the guilty person or persons should be dismissed, as such action would be a deterrent to others. The Department of Repatriation should, as I have said, be administered sympathetically and on the same lines as the Invalid and Old-age Pensions branch. I doubt very much whether the time has not arrived when the Repatriation and Invalid and Old age Pensions branches should be amalgamated and placed under the control of those now administering the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, as the officers in that branch know how to deal with these cases. Something should be done immediately, and a decision should be arrived at in order to prevent cases such as that mentioned by the honourable member - for Batman (Mr Brennan) being brought before this House. Nearly one-third of our time is occupied in discussing repatriation matters, and the Government should decide to recognize the claims submitted in this and other similar cases; and thus put an end to the controversy which prevails in regard to men who have become incapacitated after being discharged, and whose incapacity is undoubtedly due to war services.",26
73,Mr LISTER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Corio) [4.36] - I am immediately very glad the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has brought this matter before the House today, but I tremely sorry that there should have been any necessity for doing so. As, however, there appears to be a necessity, it is as well the case has been ventilated order that we may know exactly the attithe tude the Government intend to adopt regard to the numerous complaints subfor mitted. I.know the individual concerned, and if he had been one of my constituents I should have brought the matter now shed. forward myself prior to this. Knowing what I do of the case, and having read a good deal of what is contained in the files in connection with it , I can come only to the conclusion arrived at by the honourable member for Batman, that there is an urgent need for the appointment of either a Select Committee or a Royal Commission to make the fullest inquiry,, not only into this case, but into scores of others of a similar nature. Most honourable members will admit that they, too,, have heard of cases, perhaps not so glaring as this, in which the injustice shown to returned soldiers and their dependantshas been very marked. I have had personal experience in connection with a number when it has been necessary to ask that the filea be brought to the House for perusal, and I have been amazed at the apparent lack of .sympathy which has characterized the decisions of those in authority. Reference has been made to the fact that this man incorrectly stated hi3 age when he enlisted; but, as other honourable members have said, he was only one of many. DR. MALONEY - There were thousands.",27
74,Mr LISTER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes , there were probably thousands. I know a member of the remount section of the Light Horse who, after the doctor had questioned him very critically regarding his age because of a breakdown overseas, admitted to me that he would be 70 years of age on his next birthday, which was then only a few months ahead. By reason of a clean and industrious life he appeared to be at least fifteen years younger than he actually was. That man answered his country's call. If Holland had been drowned when he was submerged in the torpedoed Ballarat, would the Government have questioned the right of hi3 wife and dependants to a pension?

77,Mr GABB,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,How can we get over that position ?,28
78,Mr LISTER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"The only way to overcome it ^s to appoint a Board of Inquiry of persons outside of the Department. The Treasurer referred to a recentlyappointed Committee of ex-soldier members of this House. If the members of that Committee spent all their time im quiring into cases which could be put before them within a few. weeks, they could not keep up with the work.",28
79,Mr GABB,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,They are practically powerless.,28
80,Mr LISTER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"They have the right to examine departmental files, and if they see anything in the file which is contradictory to the report furnished to the Minister by the departmental officials, they may draw the attention of the Minister to the discrepancy. In such a iiase, the Minister would be bound to .give attention to the case. Medical testimony, sufficient to satisfy any body of reasonable men, is available to prove the justice of Private Holland's claim. A Special Board, composed of Lieut - Colonel Embling, Colonel W. Summons, and Major H . Irving., inquired into his case cm the 3rd February, 1920, to determine whether, whilst he was on home duty, h-.i was entitled to an extension of halfpay during his continued hospital treatment. The following is a copy of the finding: Private Holland is Buffering irom chronic asthma and bronchitis. He is at present requiring further hospital treatment, and is totally incapacitated. His disability was vated by war service, and the Board recommends that he be granted an extension or half-pay. That Board went very carefully into his case. Mr ScoiLi'N - After he had applied for a pension.",28
81,Mr LISTER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,Exactly .,28
82,Mr MAXWELL,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,It was really a Board of .review.,28
83,Mr LISTER,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Othe r Boards investigated the case on the 21st November, 1917, the 7th December, 1917, and the 4th February, 1920. A report was also made in March, 1920. Ib stated thai HollandHas been in hospital continuously for the last four months. Suffering from chronic bronchitis aud asthma, and is lately much improved. Aggravated by war service. Present conditon weak, and still suffering from chronic bronchitis and asthma. Disability is permanent; 100 per cent, incapacity. Recommend hospital for one month. The Board of the 3rd of February recommended that Holland should be granted' a continuation of half pay, but the, later Board determined that he was 100 per cent, incapacitated. Possibly it recommended that he should undergo hospital treatment for one month so that he could be under observation. I have seen Holland recently, and one has only to look at Mm to realise that the Treasurer spoke truly when he said that there was. no possibility of him recovering from his disability, which undoubtedly has been aggravated by war service. I sincerely trust that the Treasurer will cause a careful inquiry to be made into this case, and that he will also make provision for inquiry into similar cases in which returned soldiers or their relatives claim to be suffering from adverse departmental decisions. I hope that it will not be necessai-y much longer to bring such cases before this House.",28
84,Mr SCULLIN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Yarra) .[4.48] - I do uot think that the general question of the treatment of returned soldiers should have arisen in this debate. The most important element in the speech by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) was the serous charge he made against an officer of one of our Departments. I suggest to the Treasurer that it is his duty to promise the House that a proper investigation will be made into this matter. If the Government does not appoint a Committee of Inquiry, honourable members aggrawill be given an opportunity to say whether or not such a Committee should be appointed. The Treasurer endeavoured, but failed lamentably, to answer the serious charge made by the honourable member for Batman. He quoted three dates in 1917, and one in 1920, on which inquiries were made into the case of Private Holland. The first three inquiries were made before the man applied for a pension and the last one mentioned by the Treasurer was made by a Committee which did not even see him. The Treasurer gave us what he said was the 'unanimous finding of this Board, that Holland, was not entitled to a pension. Judging from the speech of the Treasurer, one would think that the inquiries ho mentioned were the only ones made into the case.",28
85,Dr EARLE PAGE,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"I mentioned Holland's home service, and quoted the dates - the 3rd"" of February, 1920, and the 11th of March, 1920.",29
86,Mr SCTJLLIN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"The Treasurer quoted the decisions of three Boards which considered Holland's case before he applied for a pension, and one other Board which met on the 4th of February, 1920, and decided against him without even seeing him. The honourable member for Batman produced the opinion of the two medical Boards, after the date on which Private Holland applied for a pension, that his inability was aggravated by war service. How can the Treasurer get over the opinions of those Boards, and also the opinions of four different medical officers? Although two Medical Boards and four doctors declared that Holland's condition was aggravated. by his war service, the Eepatriation Department wrote, stating that Boards appointed uncier the Defence, the Pensions, and the Eepatriation Departments were unanimous in the decision that this man's condition was not due to war service, nor was it aggravated by it . What is the answer to . that ? It is of no use to say that the honourable member for Batman has suggested animus. He did not say that there was animus, but that there was deception. The Treasurer says that the honourable member has not made a definitecharge, but he has made several definite charges, and has produced the official replies of the Department. If ever a case for investigation was made out in this House, surely this is one. I direct attention to something significant in the reply by the Treasurer. . He said that it was found that a very stupid position had arisen. He said that this man was refused a military pension because his disability was not due to war service, and was refused an invalid pension because his disability did not arise within Australia. It was admittedly due to war service. When the Government discovered this stupid blunder, did it make good this man's loss? It promised that he would be given back pension. The amount due was something like £30, but such was the animus of some one against the man that he was given none of this money. They said that as his condition was not due to war service he was entitled to receive an invalid pension, but he was not given an invalid pension because the officials knew full well thab his disability occurred outside Australia, and consequently he could not be given an invalid pension under the In valid and Old-age Pensions Act. That was the reply given to the man when he made his application for an invalid pension. The Eepatriation Department, of which the Treasurer is the head, just as he is the head of other Pensions Departments, had to get out of the difficulty as best it could. The Government had said that it could not give this man an invalid pension because, his disability occurred outside Australia, but that he would be given a compassionate allowance under the War Pensions Act, admitting that the disability occurred through war service outside Australia. The case, as presented by the honourable member for Batman, was one of the most carefully prepared that I have listened to. I commend the honourable member for his industry, and for the courage with which he has faced - the position, because it is not a pleasant one. Nor is it pleasant for honourable members to have to support this charge. I have received numerous replies from officials, and have accepted them in good faith. Most honourable members are in the habit of doing so. Whatever our differences of opinion may be we accept communications from the heads of Departments as honourable and straightforward statements of the matters with which they deal. It is clear, from the facts presented by the honourable member for Batman, that the reflection upon one officer in particular is a serious one, and the matter should not be allowed to rest where it is. If the Government desiresto face the position in a proper manner it will have an investigation made into this case, or the House will be asked to do so by specific motion.",29
87,Mr YATES,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"Adelaide). [4.55],- I commend the honourable .member for Batman for bringing this matter before the House. It affords an opportunity to the Treasurer to give practical effect to a suggestion made last session. The Soldiers' Committee of members of this House, appointed to consider these cases, has not yet been clothed with sufficient powers to give effect to"" the wishes of honourable members generally. Committee would be amenable to this House, and would be more likely than officials to give - a decision in each case based upon the facts as it found them. The f a u l t in these cases does not lie entirely with the Repatriation Commission, but with the policy of the Government in 1921, when it made a drastic out into pensions all round. There was an outcry everywhere against that action. One case was brought forward by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) when I was not present owing to the misleading report supplied to the House with regard to me. In connection with that report, some person who ought to have been removed is still holding his job. He unfairly assailed my honour and courage, and, though I do not wish to parade them, I can say that my work, so far .as my limits permitted, was equal to that of any other man. In the present case, in all probability, Mr Teece will continue to hold his job, although he has been responsible for doing a man out of his rights. The man to ""whose case I refer was paid a pension for four years because of disability due to rheumatism contracted in Egypt. He was a navvy on the East-West railway when he passed the medical officer and went overseas to fight for the country. Por four years he was paid a full pension, but at the close of the year, 1920, he received this reply to an application he madeI have to advise you that the Eepatriation Commission. Melbourne, having considered all the facts of the case, decided that your dis- upon noticeability was not due to war service, and cancelled your war pension, but the principal departmental medical officer recommends that you apply for an invalid pension, as you are apparently eligible for same. When this man was joining up to fight for Australia he left a job of navvying on the Nullarbor Plains, which only a phynecessary sically-fit man could carry on. He contracted rheumatism in Egypt, and his return was paid a pension. result of the policy adopted by. the vernment there was a drastic and cruel revision of pensions, and this man was informed that he was not incapacitated through war. service, although he had been paid a war pension for four years. upon noticeHe was told to apply for an invalid pension, and he is now to be seen with Mr Yates. the members of the Pig-tree Club opposite the post office in Adelaide, where the That derelicts of the city are accustomed to . gather. Apar t from his rheumatism, he is an able-bodied man, and, if the Treasurer doubts the statement, he can see him marching about the streets of Adelaide today, an illustration of the generosity of the nation to a man who gave service overseas as a soldier. The case was ventilated by the honourable member for Angas away back in 1921, and the facts are' as I have stated them. If he had so desired, Mr Teece might have interviewed this man personally in his native town of Adelaide, and might have seen for himself whether the doctors had made a mistake in his case or not. He did not choose to do so. The only way I see out of the difficulty is to clothe the soldiers' committee of members of this House with authority sufficient to deal with these cases. It would be an independent authority which would decide upon facts outside the records, and, if necessary, interview applicants, and it would be responsible to this House for the decisions at which it arrived. If that course were adopted this case, as well as others which may arise in the future, might be satisfactorily and justly dealt with. Debate interrupted under Standing Order No. 119.

97,Mr BOWDEN,INCORRECT DEPARTMENTAL,"On the 7th"" May, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr . West) referred to the recent murder of a seaman on the HMAS. Brisbane, aud stated that instructions had already given for a departmental inquiry to be held. I have now received the report of the Court of Inquiry, which shows that a strict and careful investigation into the taxacircumstances attending the deaths on board the Brisbane of Ordinary Seaman profit George Eitchie, and Cook George Brown, was made. The Court is of the opinion l l that Ordinary Seaman Eitchie met his death at the hands of some one unknown, but that, from the circumstantial evidence produced, Cook Brown, who afterwards committed suicide, is indicated strongly as having been the murderer. No motive was apparent, but some evigoes to show that Brown was a man of low mentality. The Court is further of the opinion that a considerable amount of rumour was going through the ship* that the man Brown was suspected of having been responsible for other assaults, and it is considered that a lack of initiative was shown by petty omcers in not bringing it under notice that these rumours were current in the ship. The finding of the Court is concurred in by the Commodore Commanding H . M . A . Fleet, who considers that while no actual blame is attributable to those who failed to report the rumours, they should have taken more energetic action to investigate them. The whole matter was considered by the Naval Board, which recognizes that where only rumour or bare suspicion exists it is difficult to present a case officially, but in view of other acts* of violence with which the name of Cook Brown had been associated, the Board considered that the Petty Officers concerned should have taken furthe r action than they did in bringing to the notice of the officers of the ship the feeling that existed in regard to Brown, although in the entire absence of evidence it is difficult to see what could have been done except to take care that the suspect was kept under observation. In view of the fact that in the case bare suspicion was the only thing the Petty Officers had to go upon, the Naval Board concurred in the report of the Commodore Commanding, and no further action was considered necessary. I concur in the opinion of the Naval Board. PAPERS. The following papers were presented: Excise Act-Regulation s Amended-Statu tory Rules 1024, No. 74.

Upon which Mr NELSON had moved, by way of amendment That all the words after "" members"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" one of whom shall be a pastoralist elected by the pastoral lessees in the Northern Territory, two to be appointed by the Minister.""",31
98,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Northern T e r r it o r y ) [ 5 . 9 . ] - I was hoping that the Minister (Mr Atkinson) would give the Committee some information concerning this clause. The attitude of the Government in this matter is in marked contrast with their attitude when the constitution of the Federal Capital Commission was uncier consideration. Honourable members were advised as to the cost and duties of the Commission. This Board will, in all probability, incur an expenditure of £10,000 per annum, and yet the Minister has given no information as to its duties. The language of the clause, so far as the appointment of a pastoralist of the Northern Territory is concerned, is in definite. The machinery to set up such an important Board should be precise and definite. We should know where we stand. The other day the honourable member for ""Bass (Mr Jackson) stated that a section of the Board had already been appointed.",32
99,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I did not say that.,32
100,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,In effect the honourable member did. He said that the names of three persons who had been nominated pur- by the pastoralists were already in the hands of the Minister.,32

In of this Bill . this matter the Government are not consistent. There was no suggestion, in conthat nexion with the appointment of the Pedealso ral Capital Commission, that the two members who might draw in fees as now much as £2,000 per annum should not engage in any other occupation. Likehonorable wise, there should be no restriction upon the business or occupation of members the Northern Territory Land Board, beremind cause we want on that Board men who have done the pioneering work, and are in the best position to advise as to policy for Northern Territory developwrit. ment.",33
110,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,It might be worth man's while to give up his interests pastoral leases in order to obtain a seat on the Board.,33
111,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,Is it likely that a person nominated would dispose of his in terests merely on the chance of receiving the appointment 1,33
112,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I think the Minister means that a person nominated would be able to relinquish his holdings after appointment.,33
113,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"That is different. If the Board is to be so constituted as to be able to advise as to the development of the Northern Territory, these men should not be shut out. The Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) hinted that be one. man might assume control of the Board. That is absurd. It is not likely say that the two persons appointed by the If the Board is constituted from the persons who met at Scott's Hotel it will not be conversant with the details of Northern will Territory pioneering.",33

115,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The Bill acknowledged of the right of pastoralists in the Northern Territory to representation on the Board, but this clause is so framed that it will be impossible for those who have spent a lifetime in pioneering the Northern to be directly represented. The Minister has stated that the Bill is not a developmental Bill , but when it us was introduced honourable members were led to believe that it was to serve that",33

I him that, in the election of a parliamentary representative of the Northern Territory there was only six weeks be the tween the issue and the' return of the As a matter of fact, very little time would be occupied in electing a rea presentative of the pastoralists on the in Land Board, because the opinions of the pastoralists could easily be ascertained by making use of the telegraph.",33
118,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"If the honourable member's desire is to have a leaseholder in the Territory elected, his amendment does not show it very clearly.",33
119,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The person elected need not necessarily be a leaseholder, bub if the people of the Territory wish one of the small leaseholders to be appointed to the Board, they should have the right to nominate him, and the person so chosen should be given time to dispose of any property in the Territory in which he might be interested. There are many leases in which there are fourteen or fifteen persons interested, and, if one of those persons were chosen, it would be an easy matter for him to dispose of a fourteenth or a fifteenth interest in a lease. The Bill, as it stands, prevents such a person from being a member of the Board. The choice of a man who knows the Territory from A to Z will obviate the necessity for the Board spending many months in - going over the Terriritory to become acquainted with it. There will be no chance for the representative of the pastoral industry to dominate the Board, seeing that the Board will contain two Government nominees. The honourable member for Bass referred to the possibility of a surveyor being chosen. I am not enamoured of the idea of having a surveyor on such a Board. As a rule, a surveyor is one who has specialized in his own profession, and honourable members who have had any experience of surveyors' reports on pastoral areas know that they are far from being reliable, and are often misleading. No one is more qualified to furnish a report upon the pastoral capabilities of the land than is a man who has a knowledge of the pastoral iudustry, and practical experience in it. When the honourable member for Bass declared that Mr. Playford knew more about the Territory than any other man I took exception to the remark, because, although I know  am also aware that there are other men who know more about the Territory than he does. Clause 11, which precludes any Northern Territory pastoralist from occirpying a position on the Land Board, is inconsistent with the principle the constitution of the Canberra Commission.",34

The only persons in the Northern Territory who are interested in this Bill are those referred to in this paragraph, and they will be unable to become members of the Board, although they are the best fitted to give advice to it.

147,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Northern Territory) [6.14] - I move That the following new paragraph be inserted :(i) A covenant by the lessee that he will fence the land as prescribed. In all the existing Commonwealth Acts and Ordinances, and also in the South Australian .Acts, there are covenants for improvements such as fencing. For quite - a number of years they have not been enforced in the Northern Territory, and in many cases I agree - with the attitude has been adopted by the Minister in control in not enforcing them. that in untimbered country, without railway facilities, it is very costly to fence, - and, from 1899 onwards, those the Territory have seen fit to exempt lessees from the fencing conditions. it was competent for Governments to do in the. past it will be competent for them to do in the future, until the enforcement - of these conditions is warranted by the provision of a railway or other means of - transport. This proposed - should be included in the Bill, but remain inoperative, until such time as its enforcement is warranted. If a railway vvere constructed through timbered try, and thence through the heart of a station, there would be no reason why that holding should not be fenced. Minister to accept the I do not think it fair that the Commonwealth should be asked to spend millions of pounds on railways through these particular leases if improvement conditions are not to be enforced. Of course, I am aware that the Bill contains a provision which the Board can impose on subsequent lessees, but I fail to seo why exemption should be granted to those who at present hold absolutely the best of our land in the Northern Territory. appears to me that this is not a developmental Bill, and it ought to be made developmental by the insertion amendment. I am unable to see in what way the settlers would harassed. If suspension be possible under existing Acts, it should be possible under this measure. I believe that, by agreeing to the amendment, we would be safeguarding posterity, and would obviate the possibility of repudiation by future ments. I know that repudiation horred by members of the Government. Ministers should, fore, tackle this matter cal manner, and thus prevent possibility of it. The Minister probably attempt to argue that stocking clauses will determine the extent of the improvements effected. see how they will prove advantageous in that direction. We have had something like .50years' experience of stocking conditions, and improvement of the holdings Mr Nelson. has not resulted, nor has the stock become better in quality. Clause 41 that reads1. The Board shall, by notice in the Gazette, We know determine for each district the minimum extent to which tlic land in the district shall be stocked. administer- Honourable members must see what will happen under that provision. The TerWhat ritory is to be divided into four sections, each comprising something like 125,000 square miles. In each of those there is good, bad, and indifferent land. The Board will compute the average carrying capacity, and consequently the capacity paragraph fixed for the good areas will be no greater than that of the poorer land. I do not, therefore, anticipate that any material benefit will result from the stocking procoun- visions. We know, also, that at present consideration cannot be given to what the land can actually carry. Take a I ask the run embracing 10,000 square miles; peramendment. manent water is to be found in certain parts, but there are thousands of miles of country on which water is. not procurable. I contend that the Board will have no power to estimate the carrying capacity of the land when improved; it must make its estimates in the light of under existing conditions. Speaking on the conditions motion for the second reading of the Bill , the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) stated (Hansard, page 930)It In South Australia, pastoral leases are issued under the Pastoral Acts for terms of 42 years, at rentals fixed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands. Re-appraisements are made of the after fifteen years. The lessee must expend 1.0s. per square mile per annum on improvements, as recommended by the thereby be Pastoral Board, and certain conditions are made in respect to stocking. : . . I submit to honourable members that the conditions which prevail in other parts of Australia must, necessarily, be the basis that this House must accept in fixing the conditions which should apply to leases of the Northern Territory pastoral lands. We should Govern- not be justified in disregarding the long experiis ab- ence of the States of Australia in respect to present leasing pastoral country. there- If we adopted the practice of requiring in a logi- the expenditure of 10s. per square mile any per annum on improvements, the annual will expenditure of the lessee of an area of the 12,000 square miles would be £ 6 , 0 0 0. If we intend to proceed with the developI fail to ment of the Northern Territory, we should provide the machinery in the Bill . If that duty is neglected, a subsequent Parliament will be forced, in the interests of Australia, to repudiate these covenants, and insist that the making of improvements shall be one of the conditions.",37
148,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m.,39
149,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Before the adjournment I was pointing out that the Treasurer had supported my contention, in that he said he must he guided by the experience of the States. H is exact words were: "" We cannot disregard the long experience of the States."" That statement followed a reference to the improvement conditions. In another place the Treasurer said, "" And , a3 I have already pointed out, the best of the lands in the Northern Territory are held under South Australian Acts. They are closer to railways already constructed, and are likely to benefit most by railway construction in the immediate future."" That is my chief contention-that these properties will benefit most by the construction of railways in the future. We should have some provision whereby the Board may impose conditions upon the holders of land which benefits from the construction of railways. The Treasurer said that there was nothing in the Ordinance itself to prevent improvement conditions from being imposed in any new lease, if the Government saw fit to do so. Paragraph b of clause 39 provides that pastoral leases shall contain reservations, covenants, conditions, and provisions as follows:(b) A covenant by the lessee that be will stock the land in accordance with the provisions of the lease and keep the land so stocked during the continuance of the lease. It is not fair to give a total exemption to those persons who, the Treasurer admits, are holding the very best of the land, while at the same time improvement conditions are imposed on the new lessees. It is the more unfair when we realise that subsequent leases will be for very inferior land to that held by the present big landholders. Yet, under the conditions of this Ordinance, new lessees can be forced to fence their holdings. The present leases are fast expiring. B y their surrender the present lessees will secure a great concession, as they will obtain another 42 years' use of the land. I fail to see the justice of imposing on new lessees conditions fro m which the-present land-holders are exempt. I would like the Minister to throw some light on clause 89, which readsNotwithstanding the repeal of the Northern Territory Crown Lands Act 1890 of the State of South Australia, the Fences Act 1892 and the Fences Act Amendment Act 1903 of the State of South Australia shall continue to apply to all freehold lands, and all lands held under agreement or lease from the Crown, in the Northern Territory, and in the application of those Acts the word "" fence"" or the words "" dividing fence "" wherever used therein shall bo deemed to mean any fence ordinarily, sufficient or capable of resisting the trespass of cattle or sheep. That clause seems fairly definite. Both the Minister in charge of the Bill in this Chamber, and the Minister who introduced it in another place, stated definitely that land-holders were being encouraged not to improve their holdings. The Committee should be informed whether clause S9 will be applicable to all leases, whether under the new Ordinance or uot. That would probably save a lot of unnecessary discussion. It is quite obvious that the Fences Acts are not to be repealed. In the event of a railway being constructed, or the conditions being made such that people, without any great hardship, could improve their lands for the better rearing of cattle or sheep, it would be possible for this clause to be put into operation. The statements to date have been very confusing. There is nothing in the covenants to the effect that the improvement conditions are to be continued. The Minister said that the covenants in respect' to. improvements were the most stupid ever provided in an Ordinance. I desire to know whether the provisions of this clause could be enforced on subsequent lessees, as well as on the present ones. The Minister said we must first get r i d of the big land-holders, but if we have not the power to force them to improve their leases, we shall never get r i d of them. I would like the Minister to give us dome information resj>ecting clause 89, as it applies to the various leases in the Northern Territory.",39
150,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [8.8] - The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) desires to insert in every lease a covenant requiring the lessees toi fence as prescribed. In the original Ordinance there was a clause to that effect, but the Department-found it was'-impracticable. Instead of causing the land to be used, it proved a bar to settlement. The effect was particularly hard in case of the small settler. The object of the Ministry in leaving out of the Bill any obligation on the part of the lessees to effect improvements, is to encourage Ordinance by surrendering them. settlement. We have endeavoured, indirect means, to secure the same result. Por instance, the Bill contains stringent stocking conditions. If the lessees are to put the land to its proper use, improvements will be necessary. But they will have the right to say what those improvements shall be, and will nob be subject to - dictation from some one outside. Experience has taught us that that is the best way to proamendment. ceed. If we accepted this amendment accept now, we should be working against that principle. If the honourable member w i look at clause 39, paragraph 6, he see the provision with reference to stocking. In paragraph c there is requiring the lessee to comply with thelaws for the destruction of vermin. If the lessees are to keep sheep-as we hope they will-suc h a covenant will force them to provide some form of vermin proof fencing. The object of the honourable member will be attained by the Bill in its present form , but it will be done by different means than he has suggested. In 1922 the Queensland Act was amended, with a view bo improving"" the fencing conditions. Section 40,. paragraph e, of the Land Act Amendment Act of 1922, reads(e) And any other improvements whatsoever specified in the notification shall be made within a time specified. Clause 25, paragraph j , of this B i l vides that leases under this Ordinance shall contain reservations, covenants, conof ditions, and provisions, as follows: (-/) any other reservations, covenants, ditions, and provisions which are prescribed, or which are considered by the Board to necessary under the circumstances of any particular case, and are specified in the Gazette notice that the lands are available for leasing. All leases which come under this Orditure."" nance will be subject to that so that the Land Board will have power to impose improvement conditions, should follows: it think fit to do so. That applies only to leases which come under the Ordinance; the provision could not be made he to apply to the leases until the lessees elected to come under the Ordinance. Mr Atkinson.

155,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,Northern Territory ) [8.15] - The Minister (Mr Atkinson) has not given the Committee much in formation. He certainly said that clause 89 had no bearing on the leases.,40
156,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I - s a i d I understood that that was so.,40

We are asked to enl prodorse a certain clause, and we have a right to look to the Minister in charge the Bill to give us the necessary in formation. I believe, with the Minister, conthat the clause has no bearing on existing leases, but in the conditions to be imposed be upon pastoralists there is nothing relating to fencing. I refer the Minister to those parts of the Bill relating to cultivation, under the head of "" AgriculClause 68 says that agricultural provision, leases shall contain reservations, covenants, conditions, and provisions as (a) A covenant, in the case of lands for mixed farming or grazing, by the lessee that will stock the land to the extent prescribed by the regulations and will keep the land so stocked; (b) a covenant by the lessee that he will establish a home on the land within two years after the commencement of the lease, and, subject to any exemption granted by the Board for cause shown, that he will thereafter reside on the leased land for a period of six months in each year in the case of land for cultivation and four months in each year in the case of land for mixed farming and grazing; (c) a covenant by the lessee that he will cultivate the land to the extent and in the manner notified by the Board by notification in the Gazette in which the lands have been notified as available for leasing; (d) a covenant by the lessee that he will fence the land as prescribed; and (e) a covenant by the lessee that he will observe and comply with the regulations under this Ordinance for the time .being in force. If it is reasonable to enforce such stringent conditions upon the agricultural section of the community, it is fair to enforce them also upon other sections. The agriculturist has to build a home, he has to fence his land and reside on it for a period of the year, and, as prescribed by the Board, he has to cultivate certain portions of its The Minister did not explain that in all leases issued under Commonwealth Acts there are provisions for improvements.",40
158,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I said there were provisions.,41
159,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"But the Minister did not explain why the Board had power to grant exemption from those improvement conditions. I want the Government to be safeguarded in the future, after it has spent millions of pounds on the building of railways. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) is reported on page 933 of Hansard to have saidAs I have already pointed out, the best of the lands in the Northern Territory are held under South Australian Acts. They are closer - to railways already constructed, and are likely to benefit most by railway construction in the immediate future. Ifthese men will benefit by the construction of a railway, it is logical to have a covenant so that they can be madeto improve their land according to scientific requirements and the progress of pastoral development. I admit that in many instances, under present conditions, it would be impracticable and unfair to. ask people to make improvements, but with the advent of railways that objection could be entirely dismissed. . ways will go through timbered country, and it will be to the advantage of the pastoral industry as [44] have the land fenced. ""When a man holds 10,000 or 12,000 square miles of country he will hesitate as long as possible before fencing it . There should be a clause in the Bill so that when the railway is built lessees can be compelled to improve their land. It is idle for the Minister to say that they w i ll naturally do these things. Some of them have been there for 50 years, and have done nothing to improve their land. It is very significant that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart) has not spoken on this Bill , although he went through the country. Is the Minister in charge of the Bill afraid that the Minister for Works and Railways^ being a practical man, may tell the Committee what he has seen? I am satisfied that if he would tell the Committee what he saw on his recent trip , a different complexion would be put on the matter. Apparently he has been designedly prevented from speaking. Some of the holders will not. even put a pick in the ground to conserve water. They rely entirely on the. permanent waters, and will continue to do so u n t i l the end of their leases. The Minister has told us that the stocking siich conditions will force them to make im . 7 provements. I reiterate that it is i m possible for any one to form an intelligent estimate of the stocking conditions of any lease of 10,000 square miles of land without an ounce of. water on it . When dealing with such land one must saythat its carrying capacity is n i l , but the M in ister for Works and Railways knows that a little expenditure of money and energy by the station owners would so improve.it that it would be capable of carrying thousands of stock.",41

If the Board and the Government of the day so decided, it need not be enforced. That is another argument for not inserting an unnecessary clause. I cannot see my way to accept the amendment on any grounds. In the South Australian' leases the Government do not guarantee the correctness of the boundaries, but retain the right to correct them when surveys are completed. If the land is not surveyed, why should the Crown be put to the expense of making a heavy survey to delimit the boundaries to be fenced? When the leases are granted they are granted approximately, and are worked out from a given point.

192,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"If the conditions are reasonable, they will be able to hold on, and possibly some day make money. I ask honourable members to consider the proposal of the honourable - member, who says that his amendment includes the words "" as prescribed."" What does that mean ?",44
193,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,What the Board prescribes.,44
194,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"No . Parliament, and not the Board, will prescribe. honourable, member think that Parliament will allow the Board to lay down the conditions affecting the development of the Northern Territory? The jsoard is to administer what Parliament Assuming the Government prescribed that a boundary fence had to be erected, what is a boundary fence in the Northern Territory ? What would it cost ? "" Fencing conditions as prescribed."" What does it mean ?",44
195,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,What it says.,44
196,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The honourable member has only a vague conception of what it means, because such things cannot be learned in the metropolitan area. The Government have been sinking bores for some years, and it costs a good deal more to cart and erect a boring plant on the site than it does to sink the bore.",44
197,Mr LAZZAJUNI,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"What has that to do with boundary fencing ? . Mr Foster - The honourable member is yet another who is more conversant with the conditions in the metropolitan area than in the way-back country. If it means the expenditure of more capital to provide and transport a boring plant to the site than to actually sink a bore, it would necessarily cost more to supply and cart the fencing material to the site than to erect the fence.",44
198,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The cost of transport is 2s. 9d. per ton per mile. ' Mr Foster - Yes . ' Will honourable members agree to the inclusion of such a ridiculous provision in the Bill , which would be the mean's of seriously retarding development? It will drive men out rather than encourage them. "" Fencing as prescribed "" may mean not only boundary fences, which would be bad enough, and useless enough in cattle country, but also fencing into paddocks. The more one looks at this amendment the more r i d i culous, absurd, and. impossible it becomes. The day will come when sheep will take the place of cattle in the Northern T e r r i tory, and honourable members will find then that the men who occupy the land will put the improvements there.",44
199,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,You are quite right there.,44
200,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The honourable member for Adelaide is improving wonderf u l l y this session. When I have educated him a little more in the ways of the Never-Never, he will be a most valuable member of the House. When men with Does the capital find that it will pay to improve the land, they will improve it , and they will not do it before. The history of the development of our pastoral areas shows that the greater the improvements, the , provides. greater is the carrying capacity of the land, and, therefore, the greater are the profits. Men who command capital will put sheep on the Territory land, or subdivide it into smaller areas for cattle, as soon as they find that it will be profitable to do so, and they will do it without being asked to do it . I - t r u st that the Committee, for the sake of its reputation for common sense, will not agree to such a wild and silly amendment.",44
201,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Gwydir) [8.47]. - I am afraid that the Minister in charge of this Bill (Mr Atkinson), and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Foster) have entirely missed the point of the argument advanced by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson). While we may admire the enthusiasm of the honourable member for Wakefield, we cannot help realizing that he fails to visualize the position that may arise if leases are granted without improvement conditions. I strongly support the view submitted by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. The argument is frequently used in this chamber that the construction of railway, lines in new country leads to development and closer settlement. We are legislating tonight for the years that are to come. The leases which will be granted under this measure will not expire until 1965. In the meantime the North-South railway line may be built. Several undertakings-, that were made at the time of Federation, such as the building of the Federal Capital, and the construction of the East-West railway line, have been, and are being, honored, and it is quite with in the bounds of possibility that the next five or ten years may see the completion of the North-South railway line. members have, therefore, to take cognizance of the position that will then arise respecting the leases which will be granted uncier the provisions of this Bill . We should provide that the lessees must improve their holdings after the construction of the railway line.",44
202,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,The lessees will do it themselves.,45
203,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The view of honourable members on this side of the chamber on that question is different from the view held by the honourable member for Wakefield. The electorate which I represent should be closely settled. Our experience has been interesting. Over 30 years ago railways were built in the outlying country in that electorate, in order to increase the settlement on the lancl, but closer settlement has not followed.",45
204,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"What sort of "" mugs"" hold the country, that they do not use it?",45
205,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The sort of "" mugs"" who support the honourable member. Because of these experiences many complaints are heard today about the d r if t of population from the country to the city. Large areas of land in Australia are not available for the young Australian, and therefore he cannot remain in the country. I defy any honourable member to say that there has not been in every State in Australia a huge expenditure of public money on railways which have been built practically under false pretences.",45
206,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,That has certainly happened in New South Wales.,45
207,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"And also in Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) is not in a position to cast reflections upon the Legislatures of the mainland States, for he represents a State that comes regularly cap in hand to the Commonwealth Treasurer for financial assistance because the Government of his State has not taxed its wealthy squatters.",45
208,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,That is Figures do not bear it out.,45
209,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"It is essentia] to make provision foi' the development of the Northern Territory leasehold lands after the North-South railway line is constructed. That railway line will be built by public money, and-as in the case of the East-West line, which is operated at a loss of about £60,000 every year - the electors all over Australia will have Honourable to bear the loss which its working will incur. In those circumstances it io only right that the people who reap the benefits from it shall improve their land. The honourable member for the Northern T e r r i tory has not made a revolutionary proposal. Every lease that is granted in New South Wales has attached to it i m provement conditions prescribed by the Minister, on the advice of the surveyors.",45
210,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,So have the leases granted in every State that has inside land.,45
211,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"B y the time the North-South railway line is built a good deal of development may have occurred in the Northern Territory. Mineral deposits may be discovered, for instance, which will cause land to become very valuable. It is most significant that the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr . Stewart), who journeyed through this country a few weeks ago, has not spoken during this debate. As a member of the Cabinet he cannot oppose his colleagues on the measure, and he is man enough not to stand up and tell deliberate lies to the Committee. If he opened his mouth he would have, to support the views expressed by the honourable member for the Northern Territory.",45
212,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,The honourable member has no right to say that.,45
213,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I have. The honourable member for the Northern Territory stated deliberately that during the visit of the Minister for Works and Railways and himself to the Territory scarcely a man spoke to them who did not ask for improvement conditions to be put into the leases.,45
214,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,The honourable member knows that it is not the custom for several Ministers to speak on one Bill .,45
215,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I challenge the Minister in ^charge of the Bill to bring the Minister for Works and Railways into the Chamber. not right. Mr ATKINSON - There is no need to do so, for there is nothing to reply to. "" Mr CUNNINGHAM - The Treasurer '(Dr Earle Page) had to be brought into make a speech on this measure the other day, so where is the Minister's consistency? The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) and myself quoted in this House recently innumerable instances of damage done to the western division of New South Wales, by the ""Kidman blight."" Miles of fences in those out-back areas were deliberately torn down because unpatriotic Australian land monopolists refused to pay the wages and to observe working conditions awarded by an independent tribunal. They said, "" No longer will Ave be at the mercy of the Australian Workers Union. We will cut out sheep and run cattle on the laud."" The price of cattle has dropped, however, and these gentlemen now come to the Government, cap in hand, to ask for help. We should not barter away the birth right of the people in dealing with the Northern Territory lands. When the railway is built, it will be possible for the Northern Territory leaseholders to make reasonable improvements. Only reasonable improvements would be asked for by any Minister. If we are not careful, we shall find the same state of affairs ;in the Northern Territory that exists in ;.some of the States. Public money will be .spent on gigantic railway projects, and the Jowctts and the Kidmans, through - whose land these railways will go, will not.be under any obligation to improve their holdings.  immense sums of money in improving his holdings. . Mr CUNNINGHAM - And he has got immense profits from theni.",45
216,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,But have these people yet paid their land tax?,46
217,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"No. They have repudiated taxation placed on them by this Parliament; but that, of course, is beside the question. Because some of the leaseholders occupy 10,000 square miles or more of country, the Minister has told us that fencing would be impossible. I must remind him that these men receive nnormous profits from their enormous holdings, and that when the railway is ^constructed it will run through their 'country for hundreds of miles. Mr M . CAMEBON - We hope it will soon be built.",46
218,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I think that the great majority of honourable members on this side of the Committee are in favour of the Government doing its duty with respect to any promise that may have been made to the people of South Australia, in the same way that it kept the promise made to the people of Western Australia. No one could have supported the building of the East-West railway line as a business proposition, but honourable members supported it .because an understanding was entered into with the people of Western Australia that it would be built. The same kind of understanding is supposed to exist with the people of South Australia.",46
219,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,It does exist.,46
220,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,The understanding with the people of Western Australia was not nearly so definite as that with the people of South Australia.,46
221,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I remember reading a report of a debate in another place in which it was vigorously contended that there wa3 no understanding. Mx. M . CAMEBON' - That was entirely wrong.,46
222,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Fro m the point of view of honourable members representing South Australian constituencies, I suppose everything that is detrimental to the interests of that State is wrong. It is generally accepted, however, that an obligation rests upon this Parliament to Construct the North-South railway line. I do hot think, therefore, that we should handicap ourselves in respect to these leases by failing to make provision that they shall be improved after the railway is built. The honourable member for the Northern Territory is not asking for anything unreasonable. He has pointed out that the improvement conditions may be waived until the proper time for their enforcement. I presume that the Minister who will have the administration of this measure will seek the advice of the Board before attempting to enforce any improvement conditions. We know that all the Governments of Australia have treated the large land-holders very well-muc h better, in fact, than they have treated the small land-holders. The holders of large areas of land are being treated better in this Bill than the holders. of smaller areas. The honourable member for the Northern Territory has rightly pointed out that drastic conditions are proposed for .men who will occupy, land for agricultural purposes. They will be obliged to cultivate certain areas, and to construct certain fences. The honourable member for Wakefield made no complaint about that. He is not fighting for the small landholder. Mt. FOSTER - I will tell the honourable member for Gwydir presently how ridiculous that provision is ",46
223,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,Why did not the honourable member tell the Minister about it when .he.was speaking? If the land is worth holding the Government should see that proper safeguards are included in this Ordinance to ensure the improvement of these holdings.,47
224,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,There are proper safeguards provided for in clause 25.,47
225,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The Goveniment relies upon the fact that certain stocking conditions are provided for, and the Minister contends that it would be ridiculous to make the provision for improvements which the honourable member for the Northern Territory suggests.",47
226,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I have already said that , in paragraph j of clause 25, we do provide sufficiently for improvements.",47
227,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Under the paragraph to which the Minister refers, it is provided that leases under the Ordinance shall contain amongst other thingsany other .reservations, covenants, conditions, and provisions which are prescribed, and which are considered by the Board to. Be necessary under the circumstances of any particular case. But the Minister is not likely to prescribe a condition for a lease which he now says is ridiculous. Unless the provision is specifically included in the Ordinance we cannot expect that the Government will prescribe it . I am confident that the successors of the present Government will, after public money has been expended in the construction of a railway through the Northern Territory, bitterly rue that expenditure if no provision is included in the Ordinance to enable them to force leaseholders in the Territory to improve their leases; and I am speaking as a land-holder possessing the freehold of agricultural and grazing land, which is taxed at the rate of Is, per acre. I "" venture to say that no other section of land-holders in Australia pays taxation as high as that paid by holders of agricultural and grazing land in the district in which I live. I am not speaking without experience in this matter when I say that what is retarding the progress of country districts in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, ancl South Australia, is the fact that men are allowed to hold large areas of land without adequately improving them. Many of these, large"" holders of land will not even build a decent house for their employees to live in. It is most difficult to induce the holders of the largest areas to-carry out improvements. These are held very often by companies whose shareholders are in Great Britain and other parts of the world, and are represented here only by managers. The passing of this measure and - the possibility of the construction of the North-South railway will probably lead to speculation in land in the Northern Territory. Big companies, represented here only by managers, will probably be formed to take up the country. They will put a few stock on the runs, and let them roam at will. They will not bother to fence or otherwise improve the areas they hold. They will carry out only the most meagre improvements, as is done by those holding land in the western district of New South Wales, which is at present suffering from the evil effects of the "" Kidman blight."" So long as these people make profits, Australians may starve. The reason the large holders in the western district of New South Wales have changed from the grazing of sheep to the grazing of cattle is because they are disloyal to their own people. They employ only one or two boundary riders, and three or four gins on a station. These are the pioneers, and not the Kidmans and Jowetts and the pastoralists who meetat Scott's Hotel. These gentlemen are the persons who believe in private enterprise, but yet, on every occasion when they think they can get a little out of the Commonwealth, they come to this Parliament with their hats in their hands. They will not pay the legitimate taxation imposed by this Parliament, and the present Government is assisting them to avoid its payment. We on this - side desire that the birth right of Australians yet unborn shall be preserved for them. I am supporting the amendment because I believe that those who will reap the benefit of immense expenditure upon railway construction in. the Northern Territory later on should be prevented from allowing the country to remain a wilderness during the currency of their leases. If the land is of the quality which the honourable member for the Northern Territory has led ns to believe it is, I do not think that holdings in the Northern Territory should be a3 - large as they are'.",47
228,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Everybod y knows that, but leases have been granted for them.",48
229,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The honourable member desires to perpetuate that condition of things, and, by opposing a condition for improvements in the leases, would hamper the efforts of any Government in the f u t u r e to alter it . The amendment is not moved with any view to personal gain, because it is very unlikely that any honourable member on this side will have any interest in the Northern Territory except to legislate for its advancement. We are here, however, as representatives - of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, who will be taxed to pay for the construction of a railway through the Territory, and, once leases are granted under this Ordinance, we will have no power to force the lessees to improve their holdings. The railway, when constructed, will go through large areas utilized only for the grazing of cattle, and they w i ll provide but very littl e revenue for the line. If the Government of the day is in a> position to compel lessees to improve their runs to for the grazing of sheep, a much ""larger revenue can be expected from the iiiie. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) tells us that there is good country there, capable of supporting a great many people on smaller areas than are now held, but the big lessees will hold their country under this Ordinance,, and, if any attempt is made later on to vary the terms of their leases to secure the adequate improvement of the runs, they will raise the cry of repudiation. I hope that the Minister will, by accepting the amendment, take the necessary steps now to safeguard the - future interests of the people. If the amendment is not acceptable in the form in which it has been submitted, the Minister might d r a f t an - amendment which he would consider satisfactory. He could take the power to prescribe from time to time certain area's which must be "" fenced or otherwise suitably improved."" Honourable members should bear in mind that we are dealing with Crown lands, and are contemplating the expenditure of millions in railway construction' in the Territory which will greatly improve the value of the lands held by the pastoral lessees. That being so, we should have the right to force those lessees to carry out improvement conditions which will tend to make the railway pay.",48
230,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Adelaide) [9.10] - I hope that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) will press his amendment. ' It is simple, and would be very effective. Notwithstanding the perfervid remarks of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), I believe that it would be beneficial in years to come. The honourable member challenged my knowledge of the Northern Territory, but I may inform him that I learned to swim in the Alberta River. I doubt whether the honourable member knows where that river is.",48
231,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I do. That is about the only thing the honourable member did in the Northern Territory.,48
232,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"- I do not mind the honourable member twitting me with being a representative of what in South Australia is known as a "" gaslight area,"" but I remind him that, when matters affecting in dustrial areas are under discussion in this House, he always rises in his place and professes to know more about metrofit them politan areas and industrialism than we do on this side.",48
233,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I know one side of the industrial question.,48
234,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The honourable member takes a very "" cock-eyed"" view of it . Though the honourable member questioned my knowledge of the Northern Territory, I suppose that he knows little of it him self, beyond what he has read on the subject and what came under his notice as a member of a Government in South Australia. H is career for the last 20 years is well known in Adelaide, and I doubt whether during that time he has been very much outside the metropolitan area.",48
235,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I have not been very long inside it .,48
236,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I am a f r a i d that the honourable member did not properly carry out his job as a representative of the Newcastle district in the South Australian Parliament.,48
237,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,It extends right up to the Northern Territory.,49
238,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I doubt very much whether the honourable member went in the direction of the Northern Territory beyond Oodnadatta.,49
239,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I did.,49
240,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Then we may grant the honourable member a little knowledge of the subject. He has told us that men with only a little money cannot make improvements on their holdings, and that those who have a great deal of money will make improvements when they believe they are needed. I challenge the honourable member to say whether it is not a fact that Tom Butterfield, the present member for Newcastle in the South Australian House of Assembly, who, I presume, does know something about the northern areas of South Australia, moved for a Royal Commission last year to go into the question of the non-compliance by lessees in that part of South Australia with the conditions of their leases. He complained of their neglect to keep improvements made with the taxpayers' money in a proper state of repair.",49
241,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,The improvements were made by the lessees themselves.,49
242,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The original lessees may have made the improvements, but the leases fell into the Government with the improvements, and were released to others who have neglected to keep them in proper repair.",49
243,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,And why?,49
244,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Because the ""Kidman blight"" has extended over a certain portion of South Australia, as well as over the western portion of New South Wales. Some such safeguard as the honourable member for the Northern Territory proposes should be included in the Ordinance as an evidence of the fact that in this liament we look forward a little. Some of these leases will extend for 42 years.",49
245,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,And the present lessees will be given a preference for their release after that time has expired.,49
246,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"That is so. honourable member for Gwydir reminded us that the railway would be built before the present, leases mature. An immense sum of public money must be expended on that undertaking, so it is desirable that the lessees should be required to do something, in view of the added facilities for profit-making which will have been furnished at the public's expense, to conserve the interests of the general taxpayer. It is only a reasonable safeguard, and one which, I am sure, the honourable member for Wakefield would provide in the case of his own business. But the railway has not yet materialized. Why has not the honourable member for Wakefield displayed more energy in this matter, seeing that he represented part of the Northern Territory in the South Australian Parliament for many years, and has been in this Parliament ever since he was turned down in his own State ?",49
247,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I fought tooth and nail against the proposal to part with the Territory.,49
248,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I want to see more of this tooth-and-hail fighting on the part of the honourable member. I am afraid he cannot scratch very deeply, or he would have moved something before now. More Ministers for Home and Territories and Works and Railways have come from South Australia than from any other State, yet we bave not got what Western Australia secured within a few years, simply because that State was represented by a man who fought tenaciously for its interests. ""He played the "" Pear's Soap "" trick in this Parliament, and got what he wanted. As a representative of a metropolitan area., I want this Parliament to realise its responsibility, and build the North-South railway, not because I have anything to gain personally, but because I think it is about time we began this big national undertaking. If I were in the position of the honourable member for Wakefield, I would be asking this Government, in season and out of season, why.the railway was not being built. When the Government policy vras Par- brought down without any reference to this national undertaking, I suggested that the honourable member for Wakefield should move, and the honourable member for Barker (Mr M . Cameron) should second, the Address-in-Reply, in order The to be able to twit the Government with not having recognized their obligation to South Australia in respect of the NorthSouth line.",49
249,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,The Hughes Government adopted the North-South railway a - i part of its policy.,49
250,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I am aware of that, but the; honourable member did not "" p r o d "" the Hughes Government sufficiently.",50
251,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The honourable member should do some "" prodding "" now.",50
252,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I am. l a m "" prodi ding "" the honourable member, cause I want to see the consummation of his efforts before he passes hence. I should not like . him to be disappointed.

253,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I hope so still.,50
254,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,I wonder where the wheel-barrow is now ?,50
255,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN, Order ! I must ask the honourable member for Adelaide to confine his remarks to the clause.,50
256,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I hope I am doing so, Mr Chairman. If that wheel-barrow is still in existence it may be used for turning the first sod of the North-South line, which will improve the values of these pastoral . leases. Unfortunately, the South Australian members representing the northern districts have not put forward their best efforts to see this project carried through to completion. Can they say what has become of the machinery used for the construction of the East-West line ?",50
257,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,It is all there still.,50
258,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Yes , and it has been rusting for years, notwithstanding that we have had many National or Economy Governments in the Federal Parliament.",50
259,The CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The honourable member is again digressing"".",50
260,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I am sorry, Mr Chairman, that you do not follow the ramifications of my argument. I can assure you that it is connected with these Northern Territory leaseholds. However, I shall pursue this subject at a more opportune time. .The amendment submitted by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) asks that the Government shall call upon the lessees to fence the land as prescribed by the Board. - Mr Foster - The Board will not prescribe, as the honourable member suggests. Mr YATES . ^ Then the Government will prescribe in the regulations to.be promulgated, and I suggest that when the next Labour Government are in power I hope I shall be supporting them from the Ministerial benches-the y will see to t that the regulations are of a beneficial benature.",50
261,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"And they may build the North-South line, .which the previous Labour Government failed to do.",50
262,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The previous Labour Government built the East-West line, the only railway in Australia that is owned, not by the British bond-holder, but by Australia. I can assure the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) that, as a supporter of the next Labour Government, I shall not f all down on the job in urging the Government to bisect Australia with a railway running north and south. Turning to the amendment, it is, I submit, right that the lessees should be obliged to do as suggested. It will not hamper the Government in their dealings with the pastoral lessees of the Northern Territory. Surely the Government are entitled to prescribe the manner in which leaseholds shall be fenced ? W it h regard to land held under agricultural leases, there is no hesitancy on the part of the Government. . The conditions proposed are more drastic than those suggested by the amendment in respect, of pastoral leases. Clause 68, which deals with the terms and conditions of agricultural leases, providesIn addition to the niatters provided for in Division 1 of this Part, agricultural leases ' shall contain reservations, covenants, conditions, and provisions as follows :(a) A covenant, in the case of lands for mixed farming or grazing, hy the lessee that he will stock the land to the extent prescribed by the regulations, and will keep the land so stocked; (6) A covenant by the lessee that he will establish a home on the land within two years after the commencement of the lease, and, subject to any exemption granted by the Board for cause shown, that he will thereafter reside on the leased land for a period of six months in each year in the case of land for cultivation, and four months in each year in the case of the land for mixed farming and grazing.",50
263,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,Thos e conditions are i u all closer settlement leases.,50
264,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I suggest that the habitues o i Scott's Hotel, Melbourne, who evidently will be represented on the Board, never . live in the Northern Territory. The honourable member knows them. One of those who attended the meetings there was Senator Greene. Has he ever seen the Northern Territory? . "" Mr Foster,-Does the honourable member think that the rubbish he is talking will help the Northern Territory?",51
265,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I hope it will help the Committee to a proper understanding of the rights of posterity, as the honourable member for Gwydir so aptly put it just now. Clause 68 provides, further, that an agricultural lease shall contain(c) A covenant by the lessee that be will cultivate the land to the extent and in a manner notified by. the Board by notification in the Gazette in which the lands have been notified as available for leasing. Mr M . CAMERON - They will never get any one to take up the land.",51
266,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I do not know, but I am optimistic enough to think that the members of the Board, as common-sense men, will iiot impose unreasonable provisions upon the holders of agricultural leases, or do anything to drive people off the land. The provisions of clause 6S w i ll not frighten prospective ' leaseholders, especially if they have reason to believe that the North-South railway will be constructed. We have spent many thousands of pounds on developmental railways, but, unfortunately, in many cases, land for miles along railway lines is being held but of use. Consequently, those railways are losing propositions. Unhappily, owing to the conditions under which the land is held there is no power to resume it , except by paying exorbitant prices. The experience of the Queensland Government has demonstrated that we cannot get money from London unless we ' ' come to h e e l "" in regard to the conditions under which pastoral areas are held under leases made many years ago. Notwithstanding what may be done to develop the Northern Territory, even this Bill provides that any re-appraisement of leasehold values must not exceed the rentals paid prior to the re-appraisement by more than 50 per cent. We are assured by honourable members supporting the Government that the lessees would not remain on their holdings unless these concessions were granted. Paragraph d of clause 68, already referred to, also requires an agricultural lessee to fence the land "" as prescribed''. This is all that the honourable member for the Northern Territory is asking in respect of pastoral leaseholds. The agrarian will be called upon to do what the Government are not prepared to make the pastoralists do.",51
267,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,Does the honourable member assume that many agrarians are likely to go to the Northern Territory?,51
268,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"That is a question I will answer without notice when I become a Minister. Paragraph e requires a covenant by the lessee that he"" will observe and comply with the regulations under the Ordinance. Those are the restrictions placed on the agrarians. The Government do not mind putting the iron heel on the poor "" cocky,"" but for the habitues of Scott's Hotel the straw must be put in the drink every time. The amendment is not asking for more than ought to be done. The Minister should not oppose the honourable member representing the Northern Territory, who has seen the country and knows the leases there and the opportunities there are for extension of settlement. Last week' the House listened attentively to the honourable member for Bass, advancing reasons for building a railway through the Territory, and I think every honourable member acquiesced in the conclusion that he had made out a good case on the knowledge he ' had gained through one trip through the country about which he was speaking. As a matter of fact, honourable members generally were prepared to accept his advice, but here we have the Minister opposing the advice of a man who has spent his life in the Territory, who knows the land about which he is talking, and who indicates what he in his wisdom thinks will bring about that development we all hope to see in the Territory in the future. The Minister really could not put up any argument to the contrary, and the honourable member for Wakefield, who attempted to do so, merely spoke in broad generalities, saying that the "" shy bird "" would take flight. I once read that Sir Joseph Cookmade the remark that we must be careful of thab shy bird, the capitalist, or else he would fly away fro m our shores, yet almost immediately afterwards we found capitalists standing on chairs to get in through the windows of the offices of the Metropolitan Board of Works, so anxious were they to subscribe to a loan which was over-subscribed two hours. As a matter of fact, one has only to hold out a bait and capitalists come at it like hungry fish. I want the Minister to show a little statesmanship and a broad outlook and to accept an amendment which is designed to improve the Bill and benefit Australia. MrPRATTEN (Martin) [9.34] - We it have had a long, earnest, and, at times, eloquent discussion upon the rights and the House. wrongs of this Bill, but I want to knuw whether it is a measure that cannot be altered except by the deliberate' act of this Parliament, or whether it is merely an Ordinance subject to alteration at time at the will of the Minister. Northern Territory is now governed by Ordinances.",51
269,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The Ordinance contained in this Bill will be issued as Ordinance. It was introduced as a schemation. dule to a Bill in order to give the House an opportunity to discuss such an portant'subject as a land policy for Northern Territory.  readsThe Ordinance may be amended, added or repealed by, Ordinances made under Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910, as if it were an Ordinance made under Act.

The Government had issued an Ordinance, and it had been lying on the table almost up to the day it would automatically become law, before objection was taken to it by the be honourable member for the Northern Territor y (Mr Nelson), who took the opportunity afforded to him to criticize it . As a matter of fact, the terms of this Ordinance were settled by the Hughes Government, and, as the present Government had no desire to score an advantage over any one, it took the course of introducing a Bill embracing the Ordinance as drawn up by the previous Administration , and giving the House an opportunity to thoroughly debate what should be the land, policy for the Northern Territory.",52
275,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"It was introduced last year by the present Government as an Ordinance, and I protested very strongly against it as an Ordinance.",53
276,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The honourable member is quite right in saying that he protested against the Ordinance, but if he had known as much about it then as he knows about it now, he would not bave said a word against it , because now be says that the Ordinance is a common sense arrangement..",53
277,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"The conditions are; but I still say that it should be a Bill , not an Ordinance. We should have a Land Act for the Territory.",53
278,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"- I differ from the honourable member in that regard. Although it may not be the best system, we always govern territories by Ordinances, and it would be peculiar to have Ordinances on some subjects, and Acts on others relating to the same Territory. However, when the Bill was introduced i h July last, I saidThe Bill now under consideration comes before the House in a somewhat unusual form. The Ordinance to which I have referred appears as a schedule to the Bill. proposed to pass the measure as it stands into law. It is proposed that when honourable members bave bad an opportunity to determine the terms of the Ordinance, the Bill shall the withdrawn, and the Ordinance as finally determined thereupon promulgated in the ordinary way. The honourable member for Martin (Mr . Pratten) seems' to think that if this measure is .promulgated as an Ordinance the Minister can. alter it as he chooses. Such is not the case. Leases or agreements made under the Ordinance will be in just the same position, from the point of view of good faith , as if they were made under an Act of Parliament; and if a Minister wishes to amend the Ordinance he will be obliged to issue a new Ordinance, and lay it on the table* of the House for a specified time, after which, if it is not disallowed, it will automatically become law.",53
279,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,What is the use of objecting ?,53
280,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"I have seen an Ordinance disallowed by this House. The first Ordinance brought in by the Labour Government led by Mr Fisher dealing with the Northern Territory was objected to, and the Opposition of the day in duced the Government to withdraw it .",53
281,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,That is the exception that proves the rule.,53
282,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"On other occasions honourable members have raised objections to Ordinances laid on the table. I do not know that the House has actually disallowed those Ordinances, but honourable members have had the opportunity to deal with them. The unfortunate position, at present, is that this Ordinance was lying on the table of the House, and no one took objection to it u n t i l practically the last day before that on which it would automatically become law, and then the honourable member for the Northern Territory was given the opportunity to discuss it . I think that the Government has acted very fairly, for it has given an opportunity to all members to discuss the whole matter. It was made clear that when the terms of the measure had been settled it would be embodied in an Ordinance and promulgated in the usual way.",53
283,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Wakefield) [ 9 . 4 5 ] - I intend only to deal with salient facts, and not with rambling statements that have nothing whatever It is not to do with the Territory. The Minister was quite in error in saying that Territories are always governed by Ordinances. If he looks at the schedule to the Bill he will see a reference to the Northern Territory Crown Lands Act, which South Australia passed in 1890, and a number of amending Acts. A territory extending over half a million square miles is too great to be governed by means of Ordinances, which are laid on the table of the House for a given period, and which, if not disallowed, then become law. There should be a Land Act for an enormous area like the Northern Territory, so that people may become accustomed to the conditions of land tenure. South Australia has had a Crown Lands Act for the Territory for the last 50 years.",53
284,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"In practical effect, there is no difference between an Ordinance and an Act.",54
285,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Peopl e made a great stir because they did not know what the Ordinance, as originally introduced, provided. When they asked to sec the Ordinance, it was found that only three copies existed. I .managed to secure one of these, and took it to South Australia. A great deal has been said by way of criticism of"" Mr Jowett and Sir Sidney Kidman. As the honourable  interjected, Mr Jowett has spent an immense sum of money on the country held by him, and, but for that fact, ho would not have made money out of wool. The greater part of his land was taken over from men who walked out bankrupt. He did not pay a penny for improvements which had been insisted on by a Government that subsequently enforced stocking conditions instead of improvements. What led to the ruin of those land-holders was, in the first place', the low price of wool, and then the rabbit and wild-dog pests. It will require the expenditure of a fortune to bring such holding's back to a productive condition. The Government cannot put iip the improvements, but, it will have to help finance the land-holders.",54
286,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,It will be necessary to fence land in the Territory to keep back the rabbits.,54
287,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"It will be impossible to erect .fences until railway facilities provided. I hope that honourable members opposite will be reasonable, and realise that we cannot have closer settlement and small land-holders in the Territory until big men have'gone well into the interior and have spent half a lifetime in blazing the track. Reference has been made to the visit of the Minister for Works and Railways to the Macdonnell Ranges, but we need have no misgivings concerning that country. There will be no occasion for 42 years' leases in that district, for it is blessed with the finest climate imaginable, and has an annual rainfall of from 10 to 22 inches.' It is the sanatorium of tory, and will make 'the development"" of that portion of Australia further north certain.' Had South Australia not parted with the Northern Territory there would have been a railway to the' Macdonnell Ranges ten years ago, and the country would have been populated today. I Urge the Oommittee not to insist' on improvements being carried out before railway communication is provided. ""Extensive improvements will come when a railway makes them possible.",54

A large portion of the Northern Territory is similar to the pastoral country in my own electorate. The honourable memher for Wakefield (Mr Foster) stated, in reply to an interjection, that fencing would be practicable if a railway were provided. I are yield to none in my desire to see the outback portions of Australia settled, and I trust that, in order : tb ""disarm the criticism of honourable members opposite, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) will agree to substitute for his amendment the following paragraph, which I shall move, later on, to insert:A covenant by the lessee that he will fence the land within a period of five years after railway facilities have been provided within 25 miles from his holding. That seems to me to be a fair compromise. Mr F.OSTEH - That Would not touch the Terri- the fringe of the Territory. Mr A .

Without fencing it is - impossible to' keep sheep""' and the ""Minister for ""Home arid 1 Territories (Senator Pearoe) has declared in another place that he desires to see the Territory carrying sheep.

294,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY CROWN,"Now they are ruined. Mr A GREEN/ - They had to ask Parliament to grant them a bonus on the export of beef. We voted for that bounty. I shall not be prepared to vote for such a bonus again this year. The whole of the country in Western Australia north of the Tropic of Oapricorn is held by 6,000 people, because the pastoralists there have devoted their energies solely to cattle-raising. admit that there is a difficulty in raising sheep in the Kimberleys-whic h is different country from the Barkly Tableland-becaus e the grass seeds make it impossible to run sheep there. It is duty to see that the Northern Territory is put to its best possible use, and that involves the running of sheep. 'If we allow pastoralists to hold land for 42 years without any obligation to fence it , they will 'continue to do as Sir Sidney Kidman and others have done-simpl y stock vast areas with cattle, and have the stations worked by a few blackfellowB under the direction of one or two white men. Apart from the problem of settlement, we have to consider the question of defence. The only way to defend our northern shores"" is tb have a large white population 'there. We have been told that twelve men ' in the Northern Territory hold an area of '90,000 square miles, which is larger than Yictoria. Western Australia 24 men have between them an area representing 1,000,000 acres each, and it is by no means the least rich portion' of the State. that basis, 55 men would control an area equal to the whole of Victoria. We should be lacking in our duty to posterity if we did not protest against these huge tracts of country being held by men who do not put the land, to its best use. Neglect to erect fences and make other provision for carrying sheep is not a policy that wilt commend itself to the people, and if , when the railway has been built, the lessees are iidt prepared to do something., to stock'the land with sheep, I do uot think any honourable member will be justified in voting to allow those men to retain their vast, holdings. It may be true, as the Minister has said, that population is leaving'the Northern Territory; but, on the other hand; land grabbing is increasing from ' y e a r to year, as these figures prove: In 1917, 103,000,000 acres was' held under pastoral . lease; in 1918, 114,000,000 acres; in 1919, 117,000,000 acres; in 1920, 133,000,000 acres; and in 1921, 136,000,000 acres-a n increase of 33 per cent, in four years. Do not honourable members realise that if we do not insist upon the land being put to its best possible use, this land grabbing will continue to increase, and no genuine settlement will be possible? I am not I opposed to the pastoralists. I recognize that they pioneer remote areas, but this ""Parliament has a sacred trust-on e might almost say, a trust reposed in it by Providence-to develop the 500,060 our square miles of country in the 'Northern Territory. It is our duty to insist that instead of the land being monopolized by a few men, who make little use of it , it shall be developed . to its utmost capacity.",55
