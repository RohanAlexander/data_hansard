2,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"As all honourable members will know, on Monday 15 May we saw the death great Austrahan. The loss to the nation is a heavy one, and I move: That this House express its deep regret at the death May 1978 of the Right Honourable Sir Robert Gordon Menzies: Knight of the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle; Knight of the Order of Australia; Companion of Honour; Queen's Counsel; Fellow of the Royal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1928 to 1929; a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly 1929 to 1934; Deputy Premier of Victoria from 1932 to 1934; a member of this House for the Division of Kooyong from 1934 to 1966; founder and for many years Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia; a Minister of the Crown for over 25 years; and Prime Minister 1941, and from 1949 to 1966; places on record its appreciation of his long and highly distinguished service to the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and fanuly. Sir Robert Menzies was born 83 years ago in the small Victorian town of Jeparit. By his own ability, his own determination, his own courage and his own will he became one of the greatest Australians this nation has brought forth. His towering influence helped to mould this nation. He stood uncompromisingly for the abiding traelection ditions and values of Austraha. His temporary defeat in 1941 served only to lift him and to redustry, veal his extraordinary resources of energy, the strength of his beliefs and the fortitude of spirit. He led Australia through the boom years of the 1950s and into a period of unprecedented national development in the economy, industry, agriculture, the arts and learning. Sir Robert's rise to eminence was meteoric. 1917 he graduated in law from the University Melbourne with great distinction and one year later-at 23 years of age-h e was admitted to the Bar. Within a remarkably brief period at the Victorian Bar in which his practice ranged over dustrial, common and constitutional law and Menzies built a formidable name as a brilliant legal intellect and an outstanding advocate. greatest triumph as a young barrister was remarkable appearance in 1920-at 25 years age^-in the celebrated Engineers Case. After that historic case, in which he successfully stood against several notable King's Counsel, he appeared in many famous constitutional cases before the High Court and the Privy Council. This outstanding constitutional lawyer had few rivals and in 1929-at 34 years of age-h e became Australia's youngest King's Counsel. In all Sir Robert's days his love for the law never waned. But it was no narrow interest. For him law and civiUsation were inseparably bound together. Opportunities to speak and write on law and public affairs were always welcome to At the age of 72, when most professional scholars have put down their pens, he made a of a distinguished contribution as scholar-inresidence at the University of Virginia, where he lectured on the Austrahan Constitution with all on IS the authority, clarity and wit we knew so well. It is scarcely surprising that a man of such formidable talent for the law and such high regard for Society; a its sanctity should be chosen to serve as Attorney-General in both the State and Federal from spheres or that he should have distinguished those ministries with his commanding legal experience. Sir Robert turned to politics in 1928. He first of Australia from 1939 to entered the Victorian Parliament, where he served nearly six years. Characteristically, he quickly made his mark as parliamentarian and Minister, holding several portfolios, and within four years, at the age of 37, he became Deputy Premier. In 1934 he contested and won the seat of Kooyong and held it for the next 32 years. His unfaiUng interest in his constituents and his commitment to them earned him their loyalty, their trust and their admiration. Immediately upon his to Federal Parliament, Sir Robert was appointed Attorney-General and Minister for Inportfolios he held untU 1939. In that year - jus tfiveyears after his election the the House his of Representatives-h e became Prime Minister. His first Prime Ministership was from 1939 to 1941, and in that time he administered the portfolios of Treasury, Defence Co-ordination, Trade and Customs, and Information. These were years of extraordinary activity in which Sir In Robert had achieved what for many men would of have been the work and ambition of many lifetimes. But hisfinestyears were yet to come. History has recorded that the United Ausintralian Party splintered, turned from its leader feU apart. Inevitably there was a change of government. The trials of these years may have His left most men embittered and unnerved. They his served only to spur Menzies to embark on a of program of reshaping, rebuUding, remodeUing and reassessing the needs of those Australians alone who had pinned their faith to a Liberal alternative. He struggled with adversity and won. From the ashes of the United Australia Party and through the vision and undaunted determination of one man-Si r Robert Menziesthere arose the Liberal Party of Australia. This was a party which he designed to serve all Austraha-to govern for all Austrahans-owin g no special allegiance to any group or section. He travelled Australia's length and breadth persuading and inspiring. In 1949 he triumphed. The Liberal and Country parties won office and remained undefeated for 23 years. That period is now a matter of history. Above all, it is the history of Menzies. Menzies' return to the Prime Ministership in 1949 came at a time of great domestic and international uncertainty. Depression and war had had a devastating effect. The world was tired of conflict, fearful for the future. But for Menzies these were to be the years when all that he had passed through was simply preparation for his finest hours. His great task was to restore the confidence and stabUity of a nation recovering from the rigours and the distress of war, and this he did. Drawing on his considerable will, knowledge and experience, he guided Australia for 16 years with the steadfast hand of a leader sure of his ground and sure in the judgment of the Australian people. His years of strong and stable government gave strength and confidence to this nation, to the Australian people, and set this country firmly on a course of recovery and uprecedented development. Sir Robert was recognised by aU as one of the Queen's men. He saw clearly the place of the Crown in the Australian body politic, and stood by the principles of constitutional monarchy which are the fundamental base of our poltiical Ufe. Many people will recall Her Majesty's first visit to this country in 1954 and how she was escorted with dignity and with a profound sense of the occasion by her Australian Prime Minister to the opening of this Parliament. We are all honoured by the gracious tribute Her Majesty has now paid to her former Prime Minister. It will be a source of comfort to Sir Robert's famUy. Sir Robert's rich sense of the nation's history, his vision of its vast potential, his evident love for its soU and its people, his presence and his elostature quence ensured that Australia's place in intersome national affairs would become morefirmlyestabbut Ushed, more widely known. He was one of the Commonwealth's most eloquent spokesmen, his and in time became one of her best loved statesUghtful men. He attended the Prime Ministers' Conferwas ences in London, striving through difficult and changing times to consohdate Commonwealth love. ties and to strengthen Australia's relationship with Britain. His admiration and respect for the country that had fathered the traditions of the rule oflaw, the country of Blackstone, of MUton, of Shakespeare and of Burns, earned him a special place in the hearts of the British people. Undoubtedly, the stature of Australia's Pnme Minister during these years greatly added to the international prestige and influence of this nation. His attachment to the Commonwealth did not blind him to the changing reality of new international horizons. As one of the founders of ANZUS and the South East Asia Treaty Organisation, he was fully aware of the need to consolidate Australia's natural bonds with its neighbours. He was equally aware that we should retain our relationship with the more powerful and more distant nations of the world. He conducted his relationship with both the new and old friends with ease and assurance. His loyalty and reliability was never in question and he brought his great authority to every councU. He earned the respect of all. Upon his retirement, Sir Robert was invited to name two achievements for which he would most Uke to be remembered. He nominated his Government's encouragement of tertiary education, something in which he had had a close personal interest, and the development of the national capital. Learning was for Sir Robert Menzies the cardinal privilege and his consuming passion because he believed that where there was learning there could be wisdom. Sir Robert established the Australian Universities Commission and encouraged the growth of the Australian National University. He was convinced that all Australians should have opportunities to share in a fuU educational experience and his Government presided over a vast expansion in tertiary education in this country. Again, it was characteristic of his pride in the nation that he should wish to enhance its capital. The Canbena of today, the city of lakes and fine public buildings, is a great and enduring monument to his vision. Mr Speaker, such were the achievements and of the man that it was to be expected that would say he was a distant political figure, he won the respect not only of his political supporters but also of those who never voted for Party. To his friends he was a warm and decompanion. To those who served him he always courteous and considerate, and to his famUy he was a constant symbol of devotion and He endeared himself to Australians from all walks of life by his love of cricket and, in Victoria by his support of the Carlton Football Club. Austrahans will have many memories of Sir Robert Menzies: Memories of him as a Prime Minister who led this country for 16 consecutive years; memories of him as a Prime Minister who strove to enrich the resources, the opportunities and the talent of this nation; memories of him as a Prime Minister who cemented and extended our relations with Britain and the Commonwealth; memories of him as a Prime Minister who continued to nurture our relations with other allies such as the United States of America; memories of him as a Prime Minister who saw the need for and fostered the highest standard of professionalism and intergrity in the Pubhc Service; memories of his consumate skills as an orator, his mastery as a political tactician, his unerring sense of pohtical timing and his integrity. Mr Speaker, anyone who had the pleasure to hear Sir Robert speak will remember his devastating wit. He had the rare abihty to make a jibe at his own expense. He once recalled that on the previous Sunday he had read the lesson at the Presbyterian Kirk, a reading which had included the Ten Commandments. 'To a practising pohtician', he said, T know of no document more disturbing-unles s it be the Sermon on the Mount'. But, above all, his. parhamentary colleagues will remember him for his abiding belief in our great democratic principles, in the central role of Pariiament and in the rule oflaw. He was a champion of the concept of responsible government in the Westminster tradition. Over many years he strove to develop our Cabinet system into that which we know today. In the past few days I have received numerous messages of condolence and sympathy from leaders around the world. President Carter has referred to Sir Robert as 'a great statesman whose leadership and influence extended far yond Austraha'. Prime Minister Callaghan has than this? written of'His courage, his devotion to duty and his wisdom (which) have ensured him an honoured place in the history of ourtime'.There is one message which I should like to read in for it captures in essence the feelings expressed by many during the last week. It is from Mr Kwan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, and reads: I send you my condolences on the death of Sir Robert Menzies. He was one of the great men ofhis era. He had a commanding presence, a powerful intellect a rare eloquence. His robust approach to Ufe enabled him to than Australia's contribution and stabUity in an age of rapid and revolutionary changes. He has left his imprint on the history of Australia and of the region. Mr Speaker, in 1937 Sir Robert was created a Privy Councillor. In 1951 he was created a Companion of Honour. In 1963 the Queen created Sir Robert a Knight of the most ancient and most noble Order of the Thistle. In 1965 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1966 after his retirement from politics, he was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, following in the path of Sir Winston Churchill. In 1976 Sir Robert was created a Knight of the Order of Australia-the first Australian to receive that accolade. The honours showered on him over many years are a fitting tribute to Sir Robert's stature as an Australian and Commonwealth statesman. As generations pass it is easy to forget those who have gone before. But Sir Robert Menzies has left an indelible mark upon countless facets of Austrahan life. He will be remembered as a leader, a statesman, a scholar, an ally, a friend, and to his family as a loving and devoted husband, brother and father. He gave to each of these roles the full measure of his being. To this one man-Rober t Gordon Menzies-Austrah a owes an immense debt. It is a debt which future generations of Australians can honour by holding fast to the virtues he brought from his forebears and carried into his hfe-the virtues of sincerity, integrity, loyalty, steadfastness and courage. And we can honour him by following his example of unstinting service to this nation, serving all the people and working to reinforce those fundamental values which unite us as one nation, as one people. I beheve that Sir Robert would wish to be honoured by no more than this. Mr Speaker, we are in the midst of mourning Robert Gordon Menzies, but we should also console ourselves that here was a great man who left a great name for himself and for this country. beWhat more can we possibly ask of any citizen",14
3,Mr HAYDEN,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE," Mr Speaker, the late Sir Robert Gordon full, Menzies became in his ufetime what few people ever achieve. From a modest family background Lee he became an outstanding student and an eminent practitioner at the Bar. He achieved early entry to the Victorian Parliament, and became a remarkably young Deputy Premier of the State of Victoria at 34 years of age. He proceeded to the national Parliament, immediately entering and the Ministry, and became Prime Minister at the still young age of 45 years. From 1949 to 1966 he make more served a record unbroken term as Prime to the world's quest for peace Minister. Regardless of the differences which one might have had with his pohtical views and pohcies, one has to concede- I do so in generous measure-that in those 17 years of service as Prime Minister of Australia he proved himself to be a masterful pohtical tactician and a shrewd and effective parliamentarian. The course in the national Parliament from his entry in 1934 up to 1949 was not without its hurdles for him, nor would anyone suggest he found it, nor even caused it to be, uneventful. The period from 1941 to 1949 must have been a somewhat fretful one for him in many ways. It was, however, in this period that he so successfuUy refashioned the disintegrating conservative political forces in this country into a cohesive and lasting poltiical party-the Liberal Party. It was a remarkable achievement and now, some 30 years after its formation, that Party continues to funcuon with the longest continmty of public service of any conservative nadonal poltiical party in the nation's history. Another of the late Sir Robert Menzies' important poltiical successes was to draw the Country Party mto a lasting national coalition with his Liberal Party. These were no small achievements, especiaUy for a man whose sharpness of intellect gave him, according to record, an impatience with so much of the time consuming, mundane, but important basic organising and arranging which is part of the political scene. The period 1941 to 1949 gave him, it would seem,timeto reflect on his earlier pohtical setbacks and to regenerate his pohtical tnuiking and tactics. When I entered this Parliament after the 1961 election the late Sir Robert Menzies was then close to the end of a long and significant career. He had just survived a remarkably close election. I remember the period well. It was not only the time of my first election House but also the occasion of the rather novel experience of discovering, on the good advice of the then right honourable member for Kooyong, that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) was 'magnificent'. I leave the history of the late former right honourable member for Kooyong's service in public office, spanning nearly half a century, to those better quaUfied than I am to write, more fittingly, as a suitable epitaph to a long and notable career. I restrict myself to those last five years during which he served in this Parliament whUe I was here. One's recollection is of a big, robust man who obviously reveUed in the action of the parUamentary scene. This was the period of serious economic rethinking after the 1961-62 recession when the Vernon Committee of Inquiry was set up to recommend on the development of future economic poUcy. Re-equipment of the Air Force with a new tactical bomber was entered into as a matter of great urgency. The controversial commitment to the Vietnam war was made. Some initiatives were also undertaken in thefieldof education. Right to the very end of his parliamentary career the late Sir Robert Menzies was in the thick of public debate over measures he proposed or had undertaken. He was never faint hearted; nor did he hesitate to put his case firmly on the issues he took up. Perhaps the most enduring recollection I have of him, apart from his readiness to enter into the rough and tumble of parliamentary exchange with a quick and entertaining verve- I seem to recall being bruised a few times in such unwise encounters in my earliest years- was his clear, consistent and impressive devotion to the parliamentary institution. In this, I believe, he displayed a respect for the parUamentary system since lost but which could well be rescued with advantage to its reputation and influence intiiecommunity. Let me quote the comment of one observer of the late and formerrighthonourable member for Kooyong: Sir Robert Menzies was one of the most effective politicians in Australia's history. He had a way of identifying the attitudes of the average Australian and appealing very vividly, clearly, and incisively to those attitudes, showing a skill and understanding that I didn't suspect he had. He didn't appear to have the common touch. I thought he was consciously or naturally aristocratic and it surprised me to find out he had an ability to know what the average man felt. I don't know how he did this, but I would say he had a good deal of natural flair for it. The quotation is important because it comes to this from a man whose poltiical values were as different from those of the late Sir Robert Menzies as is the quality of chalk from that of cheese. Yet they are the comments formed from the careful, long and fair minded assessment of a poltiical opponent and they are clearly the comments of respect. The commentator was the former honourable member for Lalor, Dr Jim  Australian Prime Ministers 1901-1972. The Opposition joins the Government in expressing its condolences at the passing of Sir Robert Menzies and extends its deepest sympathies to his widow, Dame Pattie Menzies, and to members ofhis famtiy.",16
4,Mr ANTHONY,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE," I feel very proud to be associated with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in speaking to the condolence motion before the Parhament. I am proud to be able to speak on behalf of the National Country Party, because of my party's long association with Sir Robert Gordon Menzies and because of my personal association with him. I probably knew Sir Robert as long as any member in this House. I , along with a few other honourable membersyourself included, Mr Speaker, the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon) and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair)-were selected and served in his ministries. My father served in Sir Robert's first Ministry before the war and also in his post-war Cabinets. I feel that I can speak about Sir Robert Menzies, and in doing so I classify him as Australia's greatest statesman, a brilliant orator, an outstanding parliamentarian and a great leader. Sir Robert's funeral last Friday was a remarkable occasion for this nation. We saw people from throughout Australia and from around the world pay a triumphant tribute to this great man. Thousands of people lined the streets. Many of them expressed their sorrow. The remarkable thing about that occasion was that it was some 12 years after he departed from pohtical Ufe. As we aU know, most pohticians are forgotten the day after they retire. Not Sir Robert Menzies. He had welded for himself a lasting place in the history of this nation. It is a matter of history that the close relationship which everybody knows existed between Sir Robert and my party in the 1950s and the 1960s had been, in earUer years, not always a happy one. There is no doubting that the relationship between Sir Robert and the Country Party during the years of the coalition in the 1950s and 1960s was a matter of great significance to him and, I believe, to Australia. I tbink it is worth recalling some of the things he said to the nation on the day he retired from office, on 20 January 1966. He referred to the immense loyalty he had enjoyed from both parties-the Liberal Party of Australia and the Country Party-and went on to say: It is not always understood that over these years ility of government, the continuity of government . . . have been based upon an alliance between my party and the Country Party which in all these years has never been broken, and in the whole of which I have been profoundly indebted to the members of both parties who, though they may be critical and, ofcourse, undoubtedly are from ume to ume, have been staunch and loyal. Sir Robert's answer to a question about what he saw as his most lasting achievement was most important, especially to members of my party. He referred firstly to the creation of the Liberal Party in 1944 and then said: I look back with great satisfaction on the fact that there has been a fruitful and constant alliance with the Country Party . . . We have for all these years been a joint government. I have had the most tremendous loyalty not only from Country Party Ministers-in panicular Mr MCEwen, who is a most distinguished man-bu t also its private members. It is not always easy to have a marriage of this kind. He went on to say: If at any time over these years I had come back with an absolute majority of the Liberal Pany on the floor of the House, I still would have said to the Country Party, T want you to be in'. There are people who tried to deny the magnitude of the contribution that Sir Robert Menzies made to Australia whUe he was Prime Minister. They bring forward the fatuous argument that there is nothing of real significance for which he can be remembered. That is obviously untrue. Australia's progress infieldssuch as education, national development and trade during the Menzies-Fadden and the Menzies-MCEwen period makes that quite clear. If these critics are saying that Australia under Menzies lacked drama, lacked division and lacked instabiUty, if they are saying that Australia under Menzies enjoyed solid economic and social progress, enjoyed poltiical stabUity unmatched in any other country, enjoyed full employment and enjoyed inflation rates which, if we had them today, would make us the envy of the world, these critics are unconsciously pointing to the tilings for which Sir Robert deserves to be remembered. No other Australian has occupied the place that Sir Robert Menzies held. Whether people were for him or against him they regarded him in a way in which no other Australian has ever been regarded. I think the only way to describe his unique place in Australian Ufe and history is to say that he was an institution. The meaning of the word institution in this context is very simple but I think it is appropriate. It means a famUiar object. Sir Robert was a famiUar object. To many Austrahans he was the goverament. He was the rock on which our stabUity and our security were the stabbuUt. To the world, Menzies was Australia. To those who knew him personally there are many memories one could reiterate today. I go back to when I was a young school boy, having to view some movies ofhis travels overseas. I recall them as not being very exciting. I remember him most as Chairman of Cabinet. Many stories are written about him being a very frightening man; certainly he was a taskmaster. Whenever he placed responsibUity on Ministers he expected them to perform. He was very hvinuUating to a Minister who had not done his homework and tried to bluff his way through. He inculcated into members of his . Ministry the need for integrity and honesty which I beheve will last for a long time in the Austrahan pohtical scene. I remember clearly his great interest in the velopment of the national capital while I was Minister for the Interior. Modern Canberra is greatly indebted to him. Canberra was stagnant for years and years until Sir Robert Menzies decided that this was the national capital and needed to be reflected as such to Austraha and the world. He took upon himself the responsibUity of a revived Canberra by developing the lakes and bridges, buUding the National Library and making it the great capital which it is today and of which we are aU proud. I shaU always tbink of Sir Robert Menzies as being a Queen's man. His aUegiance to the Queen and his readiness at aU times to defend the monarchy was something for which he deserves great credit. He was not defending the monarchy because of any personalities, but as a lawyer and as a person who understood the Constitution of Austraha. He knew that, inherent in our democratic system, in our parUamentary way of Ufe and in our common law, it was necessary to recognise the monarch if we were to preserve that system. When I visited him on one occasion during his retirement I quite clearly recaU him telling me about the various other types of parUamentary systems around the world and finishing his remarks by saying: 'Give me another one that is better than ours. If it is not, why should we want to change our situation?' No tribute, no testimonial, to Sir Robert would be complete without reference to Dame Pattie. Like so many of us in Parliament who rely heavUy upon our wives, so did Sir Robert Menzies. Dame Pattie was the perfect example of what a. parUamentarian's wife should be. She gave to Sir Robert Menzies strength, encouragement and support in the heavy duties and onerous responsibUities he had as leader of the nauon. To her I pay a great tribute. On this sad occasion I express sympathy on behalf of aU the members of my party and myself. I should Uke Dame Pattie to convey those sympathies to the members of her fanuly.",17
5,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"I tbink it is fair to say that I knew the laterighthonourable member for Kooyong for longer than any other person in this House. I certainly knew him as far back as 1934 when he was a practising lawyer. I remember him from before I became a member of the firm AUen AUen and Hemsley. They acted for the Legislative Council, the Upper House, in New South Wales to prevent its dissolution. And that the Governor of New South Wales had the power to dismiss Mr J. T. Lang, the Premier. We acted for Mr Trethowan and others of the Upper House who were the petdeitioners. Sir Robert gave advice to Sir Dudley de Chair which was contrary to the case we supported. For once we won. The Upper House survived. I knew Sir Robert in other capacities. The firm handled one of the most important patent suits of all time. So much royalty was involved for our clients that we took the case from various State courts to the Federal court and then to the Privy Council. During that case I was informed that R. G. Menzies was slowly but surely convincing the Lords Justices of Appeal, the Privy Council, that there was no invention which could be patented. Sure enough, regrettably, he turned out to be right I did not Uke him for a long period but had to swallow my pride subsequently. I beUeved at that time- I beUeved so more strongly later on when I was associated with him as a nunister-that he was, with Sir Owen Dixon, one of the two greatest jurists ever produced in Australia. He was a deUght to listen to in the courts. He was always persuasive and he always had charm. It was to be said of him that he usually won. Those were my first experiences with him. I then had a passing acquaintance with him when the Liberal Party was being formed. The United Australia Party organisation in New South Wales had disintegrated. Two Liberal Parties were formed and later merged. Sir Robert then took control and amalgamated them and other Uke-minded parties in other States spread throughout Australia into one organisation. I come now to the Parliament itself. NaturaUy I knew of his contribution in the banking case, one of the great cases in Australian history. In the House Sir Robert paved the way for the defeat of the Chifley proposals for bank nationalisation. The final decision again came from the Privy Council. I remember when the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was being debated in the House. I was sitting where the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is sitting now waiting to answer the Labor Party. Sir Eric Harrison came in and said: 'Can I have a look at your notes, son?'. He then painstakingly tore up aU the notes and said: 'This will be your moment of trial; and one of decision. You are rotten when you read but not too bad when you speak without notes'. After that speech I was invited by Sir Robert to join the Cabinet. I had to wait for some weeks, during which time. I was informed on a couple of occasions that somebody else might be appointed in my stead. Then I received advice from a Cabinet Minister. I went to Ezra Norton of the Daily Mirror and sought his support. Within a couple of days I became a member of the Cabinet. I say that in the presence of my leagues to let them know that I learned in those days that there always is someone able to give us guidance of a very helpful kind. I remember the morning he asked me to become a member of the Ministry. I was at the Balmoral Naval Base. He said that I would be Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air. Somewhat reluctandy I said: 'That does not appeal to me very much, Sir. What is wrong with the Treasury?' I thought that he would have a fit of hysterics, but he replied: T don't think I would have the courage to talk to dear old Artie about that'. I managed to survive in those years as Minister for the Navy and Minister for Air, I do not know how, because on at least three occasions I made major and successful decisions without informing Cabinet. As an example, I allowed the war criminals from Manus Island to go back to Japan without informing Sir Robert, and I gave approval for a £2 program for the Sydney dockyard without telling the Cabinet but with the approval of the Treasury officials. I can assure Mr Speaker, they were memorable days. I stuck it out, but only because I had the support of Sir Arthur Fadden and Sir Eric Harrison. I do not want to proceed on that line for long, but I want to give the reasons why I believe Sir Robert must be remembered and what his main achievements were. First, I must stress he changed the outlook of the Commonwealth Parliament to the Constitution. Some amendments had already been made through placitum (xxiiiA) of section 51 of the Constitution, the Evatt amendment which dealt with social fare and health services. Apart from that, those days the Federal Parhament was truly Federal Parhament and did not beheve in interdeaUng fering where therightsand responsibilities were obviously those of the States. Slowly but surely Sir Robert changed this attitude. One of the great constitution changes, therefore, was that over wide range of activities Sir Robert took action which I beheve involved and ensured developFadden, ment and growth in Austraha and, through that, set us on the road to achieving a unity that otheris wise could never have been achieved or achieved so quickly. There was his attitude to education, which liked to take pride in himself as his greatest achievement. I put it no higher than third because there were other things that he did as well. I can remember Artie Fadden coming into Cabinet and saying: 'What do you think, mates? I have to announce that we are giving aid to the church schools in Canberra, and he did not even tell me before he left'. I can also remember that col- in a Cabinet meeting I was pressing strenuously to get aid for independent schools and it looked as though I had lost. I was supported by Sir Garfield Barwick. Suddenly I mumbled: 'Wouldn't it be a wonderful thing, Sir, if when you go to the Christian Brothers in Waverley you give them aid for their Ubraries and their science blocks?' He said that that was a wonderful idea. A couple of days later we had the wonderful announcement. The Prime Minister will know that the Federal Government then went on to provide aid for independent schools. Sir Robert was a remarkable man, and I must stress that no one paid greater attention to employment and unemployment than he did. He estabUshed a totaUy new attitude to unemployment, and as Minister for Labour and National Service I was aware of this. If he saw the rate of unemployment growing to around 1 per cent close to the Christmas period, we would meet to see what we could do to ensure that it was kept you, low. The matter of pensions was another of his great preoccupations. In those respects he was a remarkable man. Above all, he had an instinct for economic trends. On at least two occasions he took independent action to ensure that changes too were made which improved the trends in the economy. He acted despite the opinions given by the Department of the Treasury and despite the that opinions that had been accepted by other members of the Cabinet. In regard to foreign affairs, we lived in times that were temperamental and tempestuous. I rewelmember when he was either in the United in Kingdom or going through to Canada and he a was asked to be the chairman of the committee with the Suez crisis. AvaUable members of the Cabinet were asked to meet in the British Empire Society-h e had asked six or seven of us to be there each with a telephone-to discuss the a chairmanship with him. Despite what has been said, we strongly urged him, led by Sir Arthur not to do so. We felt that on occasions such as that one is Ukely to be undermined. That exactiy what happened. Sir Robert was Prime Minister during the time of the Korean war; he was Prime Minister during the time of the he conflict in South East Asia. He and Sir Percy Spender were responsible for ANZUS and the South East Asia Treaty Organisation. The international changes in those days were of a kind that other than during world wars we had not had to face before and have not known since. As a man, Sir Robert was a person of considerable charm. If one had the good fortune to divorce oneself from politics and go to dinner with him you would find a person of kindness and charm. He loved laughter; he loved pleasure; and he loved children. I remember him suggesting to me that I should read Beatrix Potter's books, and I did. At his suggestion they were the first books I gave to my children when I thought they were able to understand. I must speak of Sir Robert as an unbelievably remarkable person, a very great man. He was probably the most eloquent speaker I have heard. For all these reasons I am glad that I have been able to associate myself with the Prime Minister and other people who have spoken from this side of the House. I must also pay my tribute to Dame Pattie. Wherever Sir Robert went one could be certain that Dame Pattie would be there as his helper and counsellor. She would make certain he remembered young children and the women of this country whenever major decisions were being made.",19
6,Mr LYNCH,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE," I express my deep regret at the death of Sir Robert Menzies and convey my condolences to Dame Pattie and her family. I cannot refer to Sir Robert as a former parhamentary colleague because my election to this House took place shortly after his retirement in 1966. My personal association with him commenced when I became the vice chairman of the Kooyong electorate committee on which I served during the last few years of Sir Robert's term as member for Kooyong. I am indebted to the advice and guidance which he so generously gave to me at that time as well as subsequently, upon my election to this House. Sir Robert Menzies will rank as one of the great Austrahans of this century. His formidable achievements as statesman, parliamentarian, jurist and administrator have been referred to by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other speakers. I take this opportunity to pay my tributes to those achievements and, as deputy leader of the party which he founded, to recognise the formidable contribution which he made to the nation. I also pay a particular tribute to Dame Pattie Menzies. Her support for and encouragement of Sir Robert were unfaihng, and her graciousness was unmatched. The nation owes her, along with Sir Robert, an enduring appreciation.",21
7,Mr LUCOCK,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"As a member of this House and as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, I regard it a privilege to support the motion which has been moved by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Much has been said of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies, and much has been written about the contribution that he made to the pohtical and national life of this country and to the international field. I believe two factors above all others should be emphasised: Firstly, his absolute integrity which has never been questioned and has always been an example to new members of this Parliament; and, secondly, his vision for Australia and all sections of the people. We all recall so well the words that I think can truthfully be appUed to him: 'He walked with kings yet kept the common touch'. The great strength and the inner power which came from the support of Dame Pattie Menzies and the home influence are examples to all of us in this day and generation. We watched that lovely person as she entered the church, sad and yet so serene, with proud memories of the achievement of her partner. From that I believe we all realised that here was part of the strength of the man whom we honoured on that day. All these things were bound up in the certainty of a great reformed faith which set the foundations for community responsibility and service to the people. Much has been said and I do not want to labour the point but I pay a tribute to a friend, a colleague and a true son of Australia. I join with others in sending condolences and prayers to Dame Pattie and her famUy at atimewhen they must be proud of the one whom they loved and who served this country.",21
8,Mr SINCLAIR,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE," I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which has been supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony), the leader of my party. As a statesman, a parliamentarian, a lawyer and a man, Sir Robert Menzies dominated the political scene in Australia for many years. He made a tremendous contribution to it personally and through this chamber. Those of us who sat here with him recall the degree to which he dominated this place by his oratory and the manner of his parliamentary performance. I believe that, perhaps more than in his performance within the chamber, his contribution to Australia lay in the manner in which he presided over successive governments that developed this country into what it is today. Abroad he was seen, admired and respected as the epitome of this country at a time of change. As my leader has said, Dame Pattie was the epitome of the perfect wife of a parliamentarian. She is derful person and all honourable members admire her greatly, both in her fortitude, in present sadness and in the way in which for long she helped Sir Robert in the performance his pubhc and private duties. To her and her that stature. family I would also like to extend my personal sympathy.",21
9,Mr BRYANT,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"Only a handful of to honourable members from this side of the House here this afternoon were members during Sir Robert Menzies' term of office. Over the long period in which I knew him and the longer period in which I knew of him, I always regarded Sir Robert Menzies, both privately and pubUcly as a gracious person. One would not ordinarily apply that term to someone who was such a vigas orous political opponent. I recaU that on the first occasion on which I used that term about him my electorate I was chided by my poltiical suparea porters. But he was accessible to people from our side of the House who wanted to approach him as the Prime Minister or on some matter and on such occasions he was gracious in dealing with the matters placed before him. I recall approaching him during a period in the development of Aboriginal advancement poli1941. cies and asking him to see the Aboriginal people themselves so that they could discuss the matter with him, He agreed to do so. He concurred with the idea that their fares ought to be met. He them in the Cabinet room and they had a lengthy discussion. I learnt a technique of politics from that. I saw on that day, for the first time, that actually saw this as a matter in which he should deal with the people directly, in a personal, tics human way. That does not mean that he did not often deal with other matters in that way. In poliaims. tics it is terribly important to remember that human issues can only be learned and disscene. charged by actual human confrontation and poraries, consultation. So, on a day such as today people are inclined to remember all those acts of grace and those matters on which they concurred over the long period of association with him. There is likely to be butit up an aura of nostalenormous gia about the period in which I entered this good Parliament. It was a time of great tumult in tralian pohtics. I hope that when people rememthat ber the current period they will think of those who sit here today in a parliamentary sense similar way to the way in which they think of the people who were here when I came to office. refer to people on the other side of the House such as Sir Robert Menzies himself, Sir Arthur Fadden, Sir Eric Harrison and Mr Anthony, and to people on our side such as Dr Evatt, Arthur a wonCalwell, Reg Pollard, Eddie Ward, Leslie Haylen and Allan Fraser. I consider them to her have been men of great parliamentary stature. I so hope that when people look back in 20 or 30 of years' time they will see that we had people of I would say that the evaluation of him from my side of politics would be that his contribution the Australian scene was stability. He was a man with a conservative nature. His objective in politics was to continue the status quo with amendments. I would say from this side of the House-perhap s many of his friends from the other side would say it also-that the amendments to the status quo were driven on him, accepted and carried through, often as tentatively possible. However, the point was made here this afternoon by someone on the opposite side in of the chamber that at least he did expand the of activities of this Parliament. He did that gradually but it happened. I suggest that some of the things which are happening now represent a parliamentary reversal of that trend. We need to remember, however, that his life was not one of total victories. He had lost touch with the Australian psyche when he left office in That was not a temporary situation; it was eight years before he came back into office. It should be remembered that in the great tumult of the early 1950s and the confrontation in the met community over civti rights, and in particular over the Communist Party Dissolution Bill and so on, he locked horns with another very great he Australian in Dr Evatt. On that particular issue Dr Evatt was the victor. But that is the way poligoes. Early in his political career I think Sir Robert was pretty ruthless in the pursuit of his In later years, during my time in the Parliament, he mellowed. He was the master of the He was a giant amongst his contemparticularly those who sat on the same side of the House as he did. That is no reflection on those people because he was a long survivor. On this occasion I recognise that the Menzies famtiy has lost a person who must have meant an amount in the family Ufe. He meant a deal in Australian life also. I think that one Ausof the factors of our democracy is that we feel even those who are on the side of poUtics different from our own, even those who in the in a political sense we hold in great contempt or hatred, are part of our own lives. So this afterI noon I record my regret at the passing of a gracious Australian, a man who I think held more to stability than to progress. I think that is the way in which he will be registered in the record books. But he was a man who, whenever faced with a proposition at close quarters, would decide both on the side of justice and on the side of mercy. I think we should remember that one does not win much in the political scene in Australia unless one pursues one's aims with persistence, and often with ruthlessness. I think they were characteristics which he had. But, as I say, they were tempered with acts of grace, whenever the occasion arose, in dealing with his colleagues. On afternoons such as this I heard him pay compliments and tributes to people about whom I could think of little to say. I know that these remarks will be passed on his family, members of whom I know. I recall occasions when his grandchildren met him outcricketer, side Parhament House. Those occasions gave field. one a different picture of the man in his family life. I recognise that on occasions such as this we make evaluations which are probably clouded more with nostalgia and regret than with objecfantily. tivity; but I have no doubt that, even those who hold the political views that I do, which are vigorous opposition to those he held, will still register their regard for those achievements which we approve and even, in many cases, of which we disapprove.",22
10,Mr GRAHAM,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"I shall take only a few moments of the time of the House in supporting the comments that have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), and other speakers who have made a contribution this afternoon. I was privileged in three Sir parliaments-the nineteenth, the twentieth the twenty-second parUaments, between 1949 and 1958-to sit in this place behind the former right honourable member for Kooyong, Robert Gordon Menzies. I agree with all of the comistics ments that have been made because most of tion. them have been made at the personal level, having regard to personal contacts. I felt that contribution might be of a slightly more personal nature by my pointing out that, apart from his greatness, apart from his statesmanship, apart from those great quahties to which we have paid respect this afternoon, he was a very human pertralian son. He had a great sense of humour. He was not without some fantiliarity with personal physical suffering, and in his famUy Ufe from time to time he was subjected to great stresses that were tragic in their nature. I say this because I know that these pressures had to be faced coincidentaUy with the great struggle to lead this nation of ours along the proper path. He also had to sustain family. He had the support of that great lady, Dame Pattie, whom the great majority of people who have known her will always respect. I can say that over the many years since 1949 I have never heard one single word of criticism of that magnificent lady. As I have said, the former Prime Minister was a man with a great sense of humour. He was a raconteur and after dinner speaker par excellence. On suitable occasions he could talk to members of the Parliament about great figures in other parUaments, such as Lord Birkenhead. He talked about cricketers with an affection that was unrivaUed. In my judgment he understood so to much about the game of cricket that one would believe that had it been possible for him to be a he could have known distinction in that Mr Speaker, I hope that you will convey my comments to Dame Pattie and to Sir Robert's He Uved to a great age, after all, from 1894 to 1978. It was with great satisfaction that in he would have witnessed his own family growing up and expanding, the growth and the developof ment of his grandchildren and his family some embarking upon a road of distinction. I am happy that that is the case, and I am sure we all are.  Foreign Affairs)-As the present member for Kooyong I naturally wish to be associated with motion and to confirm again my sympathy to the Dame Pattie and the Menzies famUy. Over the last week very many tributes have been paid to Robert, both in Australia and overseas. It is and worth remembering that had he not outlived most of his distinguished contemporaries there would have been even more tributes from eminent sources. Three ofhis outstanding characterin my view are worthy of particular menFirstly, I refer to his political courage, his wUUngness to take unpopular courses, to express my unfashionable views and even to undertake tasks for which the chances of success were less than even, because he thought it was necessary and right. Secondly, I refer to the breadth of his political perspective. There have been few Auspoliticians less parochial or less constricted by ideological blinkers. In international politics he brought Australia into a larger league, not stridently, not raucously, but with a realistic appreciation of how we could fit into such a larger scene. Thirdly, I refer to his respect for language in politics. By this I mean more than that he made great speeches. In his speaking, in his his writing, in his thinking about politics Sir Robert was concerned to match words to substance, to mean what he said, to say what he meant, to respect his audience. In a world in which rhetoric threatens to become an end in itself, in which pubhc relations threaten to displace substance and jargon constantly presses on good EngUsh, this is not a negligible virtue. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition I believe we have been taught to think of conservatism and Uberalism as alternative and opposed positions. Sir Robert Menzies' career is a salutory reminder that they are not necessarUy so. He was certainly conservative, somebody who valued what was tried, tested and famUiar. But what he wanted to conserve were essentiallytiberalvalues and tiberal institutions. His commitment to those values was not doctrinal or theoretical; it was based on long experience and the fact that they had evolved gradually and were the products of a particular historical tradition. It was a fully earned commitment, immune to changing fashion and confident in itself. In substance, Sir Robert Menzies combined all the essential qualities of leadership: Courage, judgment, integrity and dedication. Such qualities are frequently found in part in other men; Sir Robert had the rare combination in fuU. It is no exaggeration to say that there is a ticular grief in the minds and hearts of the overwhelming majority of people who reside in the suburbs which make up the electorate of Kooyong. Constituents felt great pride in the fact that they were represented by Sir Robert Menzies. To many members of parUament that would be the highest accolade. On all occasions either when one was with him in that electorate or when one Ustened to the views that were expressed quoting him one felt great pride flowing through the constituents ofhis electorate. It is fair to say that he in turn felt great pride in representing them throughout his 32 years as their member. I shall always be in the debt of Sir Robert Menzies for his original interest in me when I was only a law student and standing as a condidate for the former seat of Yarra, which continued through the various positions I held as either President of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party or a member of this Parliament. It was of course an honour to know him, it was an honour to receive his advice, and it was an honour to follow him in this Parliament.",23
11,Mr FISHER,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"I rise to record a tribute on behalf of my constituents in the MaUee electorate to the late Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. On 20 December 1894, R. G. Menzies was born to his storekeeper parents, James and Kate Menzies in the rear of their shop in the small north-western Victorian town of Jeparit. Sir Robert's years in Jeparit were spent attending primary school at the smaU rural school where even in those early years his schoolmates today remember his aggressiveness at play and his abUity and eagerness to participate in pubUc discussion and debate. The influence ofhis fantily in developing an interest in and finally an ambition for a political career must have been significant. His father was a president of the local shire and ultimately became a member of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, serving as the member for Lowan. One ofhis father's brothers also served in that Parliament. Mr Sydney Sampson, who was his mother's brother, also served from 1906 to 1919 as a member of the House of Representatives for the electorate of Wimmera, an electorate geographically identical to the electorate of MaUee that I now represent. Sir Robert Menzies was Prime Minister of Austraha during this nation's period of greatest growth and development. Pohtical commentators and historians may wish to argue the effects of his influence upon the factors in this period but no one can deny his capacity of intellect and ingenuity and his effect on administratparive stabUity. In these matters he has not been surpassed in Austrahan poUtics. Sir Robert Menzies has had, and wtil have, many monuments erected in his honour. But the most enduring monuments and achievements, however, will not be represented in granite or by plaques. The development of Canberra as the nations capital and the extension of Commonwealth responsibUity into the field of education, particularly at the tertiary level, must rank as enduring policy achievements. On Tuesday, 16 May, the councUlors and staff of the Dimboola Shire meeting that day in Jeparit adjourned to the Menzies memorial erected in 1966 by the community to honour this smaU town's famous son. In a short ceremony the community of today recognised a man of stature who became a great nationalfigureand a world statesman. It recognised a Ufetime of public service and the loyalty and personal sacrifice of this great man's wife and family. To Dame Pattie, her son and daughter and to Sir Robert's 10 grandchtidren, the people of the MaUee and the Wimmera express their sincere condolences.",24
12,Mr SHIPTON,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"I speak today as the late Sir Robert Menzies' local member and as one whose electorate now includes part of Sir Robert's former electorate. Much attention has been given, and properly, to his role as Prime Mmister and statesman, but I want to talk ofhis behef in the role of private members in this place. He had a passionate behef in the responsibiUty and the role of individual members of the House of Representatives. He regarded himself as a constituent, and felt that his views, which were stUl strong and current, were no more important than anybody else's views. That is the measure of the man. I am grateful for his interest in me his local member. A man ofhis status and experience need not have taken an interest in the new local member but he did. He had a great belief in this House. He was a child of it. He became a giant in it and we talk of his legend today. He was a humble person. There was a story in last Saturday's Melbourne Sun by journalist Bruce WUson who recalled getting Sir Robert's autograph at the Windsor Hotel as a young man many years ago. I know of another story, that of a 12 year old girl who drove him up and down the elevator at the Windsor on two or three occasions, with an anxious mother waiting. That was the measure of the man again, that he would let this litde girl take him up and down in the elevator. I know that story to be true for the girl is now my wife. He had a continuing interest in current events, in the progress of Australia and the future of Australia. I am sorry to say that, whUst I agree with what most of the honourable member for WUls said, he was wrong in one regard: Sir Robert Menzies was stUl current. His thoughts were still current. His beUef was in the future of Australia. But, whilst he had those views, he was not anxious to impose them on anybody; they were there for those who wished to benefit from them. His belief in this House lasted with him until the very end. When he had finished his day's reading he Ustened to the broadcasts of this House. His interest in this place was paramount and with him to the very end. The spirit of Menzies was rekindled last week. Let us reflect in the weeks and months ahead and consider an appropriate national memorial or monument to him. FinaUy I refer to his famUy. In doing so Mr Speaker, I note that his daughter Heather and three ofhis grandcluldren are in the gallery here today. It is not easy for the famUy of a pubUc figure to share that pubUc figure with the nation, but I thank Dame Pattie and his son Ken and daughter Heather for allowing the nation to share their sadness and to pay tribute to its famous son last Friday.",24
13,Mr CONNOLLY,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"I wish to be close associated with the Prime Minister's motion of condolence on the death of Sir Robert Menzies and to express my deep sympathy to Dame grandfather Pattie and to his famUy. I had the honour to meet Sir Robert for the firsttimewhen I, too, was 12 years old. Like most of my colleagues here I grew up during the Menzies era and he always remained for us the brightest star in the AustraUanfirmament.WhUe we can-in fact, mustleave history to judge his works and deeds, there can be no doubt that he has earned a lasting as place in the hearts of the vast majority of the Australian people. Sir Robert walked in no man's shadow. He was the quintessence of an outstanding national leader, a man of whom we could be and were immensely proud. Last Friday week in Sydney we inaugurated an oration, given by Lord HaUsham, in Sir Robert's name. We wanted to do him due honour in the twUight of his life. We were not to know then how short the day would be, but happUy Sir Robert did live to see that, 12 years after his retirement from public life, the people of Sydney had not forgotten him. He very kindly sent us as his representative his daughter Heather to be with us on that occasion. Sir Robert Menzies loved poetry. As I searched for words to express my feelings adequately and to make a small contribution to his verbal epitaph on this occasion, I came upon these words, which I beheve adequately express the essential characteristics of Robert Menzies, the man: He has achieved success who: Has Uved well, laughed often, and loved much, Who has gained the respect of intelligent men, the trust of women, and the love of litde children, Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task, Who has left the world better than he found it, Who has never lacked appreciation for earth's beauty nor faUed to express it, Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had, Whose Ufe was an inspiration, his memory a benedicdon.",25
14,Mr SHORT,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE," Mr Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of Ballarat I wish to join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and other speakers in expressing our sadness at the passing of Sir Robert Menzies and extending to Dame Pattie Menzies and her family our deep sympathy on their loss. The citizens of Ballarat held a memorial service for Robert Gordon Menzies last Sunday evening in the church in which he worshipped as a boy. It was a fitting service for several reasons, but particularly because much of Robert Menzies' formative years were closely linked with Ballarat and district, and throughout his entire life he continued a association with and appreciation for the city. It is to this association that I would Uke to refer briefly today, because Robert Menzies' settled in Ballarat on his migration from Dumfries in Scotland in 1855, and it was in Ballarat that Sir Robert's father was born. His mother was also from the district. Her name was Kate Sampson. She was born in Creswick, a small town only 10 miles from Ballarat. Robert Menzies' family lived in Ballarat for many years, his father being a coach painter at that time. His three elder brothers and sister were born there. His parents did not in fact move from Ballarat until about two years before his birth in 1894. Several of Robert Menzies' early school years were spent in Ballarat. He attended Humphrey Street primary school, which still exists and which is only 200 yards from my electorate office. He then attended Grenville College before winning scholarships to Wesley College in Melbourne and from there to Melbourne University. While attending school in Ballarat he lived with his widowed grandmother in a small cottage in the centre of the city. Robert Menzies was in later years a very frequent visitor to Ballarat, a city which he said ' I always come to with pleasure and leave with reluctance'- a city of which in his book Afternoon Light he said 'had many years ago developed a civic sense of beauty, the products of which are still notable'. I had the privilege of working within close range of Sir Robert Menzies during the final two years of his Prime Ministership, when I was private secretary at that time to his much-loved and loyal deputy, the late Harold Holt. Even though I was a young and very junior cog in the machine of government at that time, I shall always recall with great gratitude that Sir Robert Menzies still took the trouble to speak to me when he saw me. He was the same with all his own staff and with all those with whom he came into contact. In passing, on this occasion I would also like to extend my sympathy to Miss Hazel Craig who was a devoted secretary to Sir Robert Menzies over a very long period. Whilst mourning the passing of Sir Robert, I do not believe that this should be a time for grief; rather, I believe that this is a time for pride and for giving thanks. As a citizen of Ballarat, I take pride in the fact that Robert Menzies' life was so closely linked with my city. As a citizen of our nation, I give thanks that we were blessed with having in our midst a man of such abihty, wisdom and dedication to improving the well being of all the citizens of Austraha. He was a man to whom all Australians will say 'Thank you. We will not easily forget you because it is unlikely will see a man of your stature in the ing of that term pass our way again for a very longtime'.  my support to the motion of condolence moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and supported by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). The death of a truly great Australian is a rare event, and the death of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies is such an event. Austraha has lost a great statesman. His family has lost a husband, father, father-in-law and grandfather. Many thousands of Austrahans have lost a true friend, and a number of present and former members of Parliament have lost a former colleague. As I look around this House, it is with the realisation that a significant number of members from both sides of the House grew up under the Prime Ministership of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. This wonderful man gave so much to Australia. The debt and gratitude that this nation owes are beyond measure. The most notable achievements included sound government after a terrible war, of the rebuilding of Australia's war torn industries and the development of Australia's newly discovered riches. The growing importance of Australia in a world context was assisted and guided by the steady, firm and sure hand of a man who had the vision and belief of what our potential as a nation and a people was. My gratitude for Sir Robert Gordon Menzies knows no bounds. I add my deepest sympathy and prayers to those offered to Dame Pattie Menzies and her family at this time of sorrow. I wish that my few words be added to those already spoken here today. I do this of my own volition and on behalf of the many people who reside in the federal division of Brisbane who knew and loved him.",25
15,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"It is unusual for a Speaker to accord himself the privilege of speaking in the House, but I do so today on a rather special occasion, as we all know, to support this motion of condolence. I knew Sir Robert Menzies when I was a young candidate in Fremantle, aged 22. He went out of his way to enable me to speak to an audience which was larger than I had ever seen before, let alone spoken to. He encouraged me and won from me an admiration for hum which lasted his life. I spent time with him in Melbourne Scots, a very fine organisation I will have the House know and one which is dear to me. Other people feel as deeply about it, including leading politicians such as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premier of Vicwe toria. They were very pleasanttimesfor us all in fullest mean- the company of Sir Robert. It was my privilege to serve in his last Ministry. He had the wisdom, some would say, or he made the mistake, others would say, of asking me to be his Attorney-General. He telephoned me and said: 'Billy, would you be willing to be my Attorney-General?' I hesitated for about a millionth of a second and answered yes. So I was able to serve him, learn from him and carry my admiration to new pupils. He was a great man in the Cabinet. He did not dominate it other than by his sheer intellectual capacity. He gave leadership in the Cabinet. He gave leadership to the Ministers and the Parhament. Outside the Cabinet room, the ante-room was a place to which Ministers liked to go and hear from him the lore of the Parhament. Much was to be learnt there from him, for he was a great parliamentarian. This chamber had a deep significance to him in the constitutional sense, in the poltiical sense in the national sense. It was here that he was at his best, He recognised the importance of the institution of Parliament for the maintenance of the pohtical stabUity of the nation, and he contributed to the development of this Parliament in a way which aU of us might emulate. As a pariiamentarian, he deserves our thanks and appreciation. He deserves that thanks and appreciation as a national statesman. As human beings, we might remember that the greatest achievement that Australia had was during the 1950s when we evolved social standards, indusyoung-t trial standards and achievement standards of kind that we had not known for a century. needs to go back in history 100 years to ade of thefiftiesof the last century and the great gold rush to find any comparable period of growth and development of the nation. In the 1950s, under his leadership, the foundation which will carry us through into a great nation the next century was built. So much of this is to him and his understanding of the need for Australia's social patterns to expand, diversify and to be enriched by the great migrant flow came to this country under his national States; leadership. I had the privUege also to know his wife, Dame Pattie, a very dear lady and one who can give the same example to the wives of parliaor mentarians that Sir Robert Menzies himself gave to members ofParliament. I support the motion. I ask that honourable members show their apdevelopment proval of the motion by standing in their places. Question resolved in the affirmative, able members standing in their places. NA NA Ministerial Statement",26
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TRUST,"by leave-The question has arisen as to the way in which, as a nation, we might best mark and commemorate, now and for posterity, the great contribution of the late Sir Robert Gordon Menzies to the nation. There has already been enthusiastic and helpful discussion on this by some publicfiguresand by some newspapers, and I am indebted to them. A preparatory committee has already begun work, directed to the creation of a special appeal and fund to be known as the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Trust, and I am happy to announce to the House and the general direction and scope of the arrangements that are in mind. The appeal will be established on an Australia-wide basis, and the funds resulting will be appUed to objectives of a practical and continuing kind within the particular interests of Sir Robert Menzies. He had no static view of Australia and he would wish, as those who contribute will, that the funds should be spent in terms of future benefit to Australia. The objectives are still to be finally determined, but it can be said already that the fund will be designed to assist Australians of all ages-bu t especially the o obtain in serious and worthwhUe dia rections, academic training or practical experiOne ence or opportunities to compete which they the decmight otherwise be unable to obtain. Some of the particular interests identified with Sir Robert Menzies and which might therefore be drawn within the purposes of the fund are the of law, with particular reference to constitutional due matters and Federal-State relationships, studies concerned with Australia's role within the British Commonwealth and with Australia-Britain rethat lations; studies of Australia and the United studies of relations between Australia and the Pacific nations. Another possibility which would have been of interest to Sir Robert Menzies and from which major benefit would accrue is to bring to Australia for public meetings or special consultations, speakers of distinction young persons of promise and interest to us. There are two other matters at least, one is the of skills in the use of the English language, since we all know he loved the English tongue. The other is sport of many kinds because as he watched it and took interest, it gave him a honourparticular and agreeable relaxation and companionship. Although much more discussion will be needed, I am able to say now that the appeal and the fund will be under the authority of a national committee and a series of State committees. It is my honour to have been asked to accept the office of National President. Leading Australians will be invited to accept office with connection with the Trust. It will be necessary, in addition, to have a strong and operative executive national committee and a series of State executive committees. I am pleased to announce that Sir William Vines has accepted office as head of the national committee with the title of National General Chairman. Sir William Vines has a high record of achievement in Austrahan commercial and agricultural communities and of service to government, both Commonwealth and State, involving all political parties over a long period. He will be assisted as Deputy National General Chairman by Sir Walter Leonard. The other members of the Executive Committee will be similarly distinguished people, representative of the States as well as the Commonwealth, and, it is hoped, from a variety of callings and backgrounds. To assist this Committee, a distinguished public servant and close me in confidant of Sir Robert's for many years-Si r John Bunting-wil l be co-ordinator. Sir Robert Menzies was the leader of one political party. But he was, at the sametime,a representative and a leader of all the people. He sought to serve the whole community-as the fund now in mind will do and in fact must do. NA",27

Antarctic Marine Living Resources Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: Has Australia been in touch with any countries that are not parties to the Antarctic Treaty concerning the conservation of Antarctic marine Uving resources pending the entry into force of the definitive regime for their conservation recommended by the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in London (29 September-7 October 1977).  member's question is as follows: Many countries have expressed question of the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources. Australia has been involved in some multilateral discussions about this, especially in the context of the Food and Agricultural Organisation. However, the definitive regime which the honourable member refers to is presently being negotiated by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. It was agreed at the Ninth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in London last year that a Special Consultative Meeting be convened in order to elaborate a draft definitive regime. This meeting began its work in Canberra from 27 February-16 March. It will continue its task in Buenos Aires in July. Our discussions on the regime for the conservation of Antarctic marine living resources have consequently been confined to the Antartic Treaty Consultative Parties.

Qantas has three eastward and three westward flights a week to and from Bombay, and the number of Australians travelling through has increased quite dramatically. Reopening a Consulate-General in Bombay will provide a valuable second channel for representation and contact with Indian regional authoriues and important business interests, constitute an additional consular facility for Australian travellers, and facilitate handling of migration matters in the area. Los Angeles-Since the Consulate-General was closed in June 1976, the expansion of Australian consular, trade, information and general political activities in the United States has meant that the Consulates-General at San Francisco and Chicago which took over the areas previously handled from Los Angeles have borne a disproportionate responsibility which is now judged handled better on the spot. In 1976, Southern California's trade totalled SUS 17.3 billion (about the same as Australia's total trade) and 66 per cent of it was with Asia from where we face intensive and growing competition which needs to be met. The problems associated with obtaining visas by mail from San Francisco have had some impact on our tourist potential in Southern California. The additional burden on the Australian Tourist Commission in Los Angeles needs to be relieved. At present, about 4,700 seats are available each week on flights from Los Angeles to Australia. Australian tourism to the United States (with associated consular work) is expected to increase dramatically in the next few years. A major world exposition is to be held at Los Angeles in 1981 in which Australia will need to panicipate if it intends to bid for the venue of Expo 88. An office of substantial status will need to be established at Los Angeles well before 1981 to provide preUminary faciUties for the Australian Exhibit Organisation. UNESCO-UNESC O is a major international organisation with more than 140 member governments and significant activities in almost every field of education, science, the social sciences, culture, communications and development. The scope of UNESCO's programs has been steadily Los Angeles Rental on sublease of portion of office Bombay Sale of assets UNESCO: No accommodation and property services costs were incurred in the withdrawal of the Ambassador to UNESCO in 1976. The estimated accommodation and property costs involved in reopening the above posts are as follows: Los Angeles Bombay NA (5) Yes. See (4) above for the actual cost of reopening. (6) No. increasing and the extent of our own involvement in these programs has widened significantly, panicularly in the Asian and Pacific region. The appointment of a full-time Ambassador will assist Australia's contribution to the development of UNESCO's future programs and help ensure that our own growing interests in these programs are reflected in them. UNESCO is the most politically sensitive of the UN Specialised Agencies and the poltiical aspects of Australia's role in the Organisation have assumed increased importance. It is appropriate that this and the other factors noted above should be recognised by the appointment of a full-time Ambassador to UNESCO. On the withdrawal of the previous full-time Ambassador to UNESCO late in 1976 his functions reverted to the Ambassador to France. Since that time significant areas of consultation and cooperation have opened up between Australia and France and continue to develop steadily, including our relationship with the European Communities, nuclear matters, cultural relations, defence exchanges and our interests in the South Pacific, Antarctica, the Middle East and Indochina. As a result, the Ambassador to France cannot without prejudice to his principal functions give to UNESCO the attention that its importance in the international community and its significance to Australia deserve. (2) No. My letter to the Prime Minister is a classified document. Arguments put forward in that letter are outlined in (1) above. (3) While no specific proposals for opening posts were made in my Department in the Review of Australia's Overseas Representation, a set of criteria used in deciding whether to establish a mission or post was submitted. Decisions to open the posts were taken against these criteria.

Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: Which of the positions in the Department of Education have been identified as those where at least 10 per cent of the occupant's time is spent deaUng with clients in a language other than English (Hansard, 2 June 1977, page 2529, and 4 April 1978, page 969).",36
27,Mr STALEY,ATTACKS ON DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR,"The Minister for Education has provided the following reply to the honourable member's question: The Department of Education has six positions of Assistant Grade 1 located in Darwin locally designated Home Liaison Officer. The work of these officers involves considerable contact with non-English speaking parents of students attending schools. These parents are mainly of Greek, Italian and Timorese origin and competence in any of their languages is stressed as a desirable qualification for recruitment purposes. Preference is given to applicants with the appropriate language skills. Where it is not possible to recruit persons with the appropriate language skUls then every effort is made to appoint persons who can effectively communicate with non-English speaking parents despite the lack of competence in the parents' native language. In addition, there are just over 300 Aboriginals employed in the delivery of educational services who use their own vernacular as well as English in their normal duties. Employment of Public Servants after Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: When Dr W. A. S. Butement resigned as chief defence scientist did he seek or receive ister for Supply to become a director of Plessey Pacific Pty Ltd. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Dr W. A. S. Butement was Chief Scientist (not Chief Defence Scientist), Department of Supply. There is no record of Dr Butement having sought or been given approval to become a Director of Plessey ignation from the Service on 31 December 1966. The honourable member would appreciate that there was at all relevant times no obUgation on Dr Butement to seek or receive the approval of the Minister. Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: (1) Did he teU me in answer to question No. 1748 (Hansard, 23 Februaiy 1977, page 406) that several studies involving the estimation of transport costs were underway, and at that stage he was unable to say whether any of the studies would result in formal reports and be tabled. (2) If so, what is the nature of these studies. (3) Can he now say whether any of these studies have resulted, or will result in formal reports and be tabled. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) and (3) Since I detaUed work being undertaken by the Department of Transport and the Bureau of Transport Economics in my answer to question No. 1748 (Hansard, 23 Februaiy 1977) two further studies have been completed and tabled. These are, 'Cost Recovery in Australian Transport 1974-75' and the 'Darwin and Northern Territory Freight Transport Study'. Other BTE studies in progress are an updating of the 'Index of Road Construction Prices' which provides a basis for determining the impact of changes in factor prices, a study of'Transportation of the Australian Wheat Harvest' (now in the final stages of report preparation) and a 'Rural Products Movement Study' (expected to be completed later this year). I will consider the matter of publication of these reports after they have been presented to me. I have generally adopted the position that the results of BTE studies should be given as wide a circulation as possible. Pensioners Resident Overseas",38

The general position is that a pension once granted in Australia is continued once the pensioner leaves Australia. Conditions for payment (Question No. 823) are substantially the same as apply in Australia but supplementary assistance and fringe benefits are not avaUable abroad. Aid to Countries Accepting Refugees (Question No. 838) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: What financial help has the Government given or offered to other countries accepting refugees and evacuees from lndo-China and East Timor?  member's question is as follows: Most countries accepting refugees for permanent settlement from lndo-China and East Timor are developed countries and therefore would not require financial help from Australia. Australian bilateral assistance to developing countries who may have accepted refugees from lndo-China and East Timor is not specifically aimed at helping those countries resettle refugees, but is intended to promote their economic and social development. Most of Australia's financial contributions to help with the care and re-settlement of refugees have been channelled through the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which has a mandate to seek solutions to the problems of refugees. Australia makes regular annual contributions to UNHCR and in 1978 Australia will contribute $740,000 to UNHCR's General Program from which UNCHR's worldwide refugee activities are funded. Funds are allocated from this source for assisting refugees cluding those from lndo-China and East Timor. Immediately after the cessation of hostUities in lndoChina Australia contributed $4m to UNHCR programs in lndo-China in the period 1974-75. More recently, Australia has made substantial contributions to UNCHR's Special Program for Indo-Chinese refugees in Thailand and other countries in Asia, including the boat people. In 1977, Australia contributed $ 1 m and in 1978 $ 1.3m. Australia also gave $250,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1975, and $250,000 to the Indonesian Red Cross in 1976 for the relief of refugees in East Timor and Indonesian Timor. Pensioners: Fringe Benefits Mr Hodgman asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: (1) Is it a fact that when a single pensioner's come exceeds $33 per week and a married pensioner couple's income exceeds $57.50 per week, all fringe benefit entitlements of that pensioner, or pensioner couple, completely cease. (2) If so, were the figures of $33 and $57.50 per week set in 1973. (3) Have the figures been subject to any review by the Government or any other body since that date to take into account increases in the cost of living. (4) Has consideration been given to the introduction of a scheme to taper-on* fringe benefits a specified figure instead of the present system whereby all fringe benefits cease immediately the figures of $33 and $57.50 a week are exceeded. (5) Is it a fact that persons ation are, with the exception of New South Wales, not permitted to renounce their increases of superannuation where to accept an increase would lead to forfeiture of all pensioner fringe benefit entitlements. (6) In view of the widespread use of the pensioner medical service card for transport concessions, local government rates rebates, etc and the obvious injustice of the present system where many pensioners who have enjoyed fringe benefits over a number of years suddenly lose them as the direct result of a superannuation increase, to which a prudent spouse has contributed many thousands of dollars over many years of working Ufe, will the Government give urgent considerauon to reviewing the present system in pre-Budget discussions with a view to (a) substantially increasing the present levels of $33 and $57.50 respectively, (b) possibly indexing thefiguresto take into account future increases in the cost of living and (c) possibly introducing a tapering-off system whereby pensioners do not lose all fringe benefit entitlements in one fell swoop.",39
30,Mr HUNT,ATTACKS ON DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Entitlement to Commonwealth pensioner fringe benefits ceases when income, other than pension, reaches $33 a week for a single person or $57.50 a week for a married couple. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) Yes. Because of the nature of the services and conin- cessions available to pensioners holding a Pensioner Health Benefit card, there would be major difficulties in providing for entitlements to be 'tapered' as non-pension income increases; the proposal would also involve additional cost to revenue. Alternative options relating to fringe benefit entitlement are under consideration by my Department. (5 ) The question whether persons receiving State superannuation are permitted to renounce increases in their superannuation is a matter solely for the State Governments. It is understood that the New South Wales and Victorian State Superannuation Boards have discretionary power to withhold superannuation increases or part thereof. (6) Matters relating to eUgibUity for pensioner fringe benefits will be reviewed in the context of the 1978-79 Budget, along with the whole range of programs of Government expenditure.

(5) How many complaints have been received from servicemen and their families in relation to the standard of acin receipt of State superannucommodation avaUable. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On the assumption that 'domestic accommodation' means housing my reply to the question is: (1) In that context the expenditure incurred by the Department of Defence on maintenance and improvements to housing in the Holsworthy, Moorebank and Ingleburn areas since December 1975 is $354,648. (Note the figures cover the period Januaiy 1976 to June 1978 and include estimated expenditure to the end of the financial year 1977-78). (2) Initial Group Rent Scheme (GRS) rents were levied in April 1976 based on costs as at December 1975. An increase in rents, in the order of 40 per cent, was applied in June 1977. No increase in rents has been made in 1978 but Cabinet has approved increases of 9.6 per cent to be applied in July 1978. Under GRS there are seven groups into which all service married accommodauon is grouped. Rents foreach group by year and percentage increases are as follows: Group 1976 1977 IB 15 1AA , 7 IA 1 43 2 49 3 55 4 61 (3) (a) No Commonwealth owned married quarters have required the installation of hot water in kitchens and bathrooms after completion.

Since the appeals system 1977 there have been six appeals from tenants in the Holsworthy, Moorebank, Ingleburn areas.

39,Mr VINER,ATTACKS ON DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: None of the States have introduced changes in their birth and death notification forms so that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders may be separately identified. Several of the States, however, have suggested that they will follow the Federal Government's lead in this matter. In this connection, the Minister for the Northern Territory has advised the Minister for Health that appropriate amendments to birth and death notification forms in use in the Territory could be effected by administrative action. Accordingly, the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages in the Northern Territory is in the process of adjusting the information sheets so that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders may be separately identified. An amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Registration of Births and Marriages Ordinance 1963 is required to enable Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to be identified.

Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In conformity with the practice of previous Governments, the matters considered by Interdepanmental and their reports are not normally made public. The scheme adopted by the Government applies only to public an Australia galleries, libraries and museums. In response from the honourable member on 13 April 1978 I indicated that difficulties would arise in drawing the line in relation to tax deductions if the scheme was extended to places and buildings. I believe it would be beneficial to the community however, if the institutions participating in the scheme of Tax Incendetection tives for the Arts were to set aside their collections which would be available for display in parks, squares or buildings open to the public. A proposal for an Art Bank, which I am currently considering, might be a better medium for assisting greater pubor lic access to works of an and other cultural that we can advance the establishment ensuing 12 months and I will ensure that the honourable member's suggestion is carefully considered. The Government has already announced will be abolished in relation persons who die on or after I July 1979.

47,Mr HOWARD,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) and (2) Treasury provides the chairman of a working pany that has been established to repon generally on the matter of a deposits insurance scheme. during the last 4 years. (3) The working party was constituted on 17 February 1978. (4) While no specinc date has been set for the working pany to repon, it can be expected to repon at the earliest date consistent with full discussion and consultation with officers of the State Governments and financial institutions. (5) The question of Proclamation of Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act is not encompassed within the working party's task. Housing Outlays rates prior to that was 7.0-7.25 (Question No. 677) Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 21 March 1978: Why were Federal Government outlays on housing $24,300,000 smaller in the 8 months to 28 Februaiy 1978 than in the 8 months to 28 Februaiy 1977. (Question No. 608) Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The net reduction estimated at the time of the Budget is more than accounted for by the run-down in expenditure on housing by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission and the or functional re-classification for budget purposes of some other expenditure on housing in the Northern Territory. Expenditure on housing that is financed from the allocation in 1977-78 to the Northern Tenitoiy Legislative Assembly is accounted for under the General Public Services function rather than the Housing function. Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme (Question No. 680) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 March 1978: In view of the fact that a Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme has been under intensive examination since Februaiy 1974, when can Australia expect concrete proposals relating to a viable Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme to be tabled in the Parliament. that the program will recommence",49
48,Mr HOWARD,VICTORIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Work is proceeding in accordance with the anangements (Question No. 671) announced in Parhament on 8 December 1976 by the then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Mr Eric Robinson. The Technical Committee established to undenake relevant technical examinations has recently completed a repon and the Working Party, which is co-ordinating work and policy advice on this matter, is in port. A Mitigation Committee has also been established to provide advice on appropriate mitigation poUcies directed at improving natural hazard risks. The Mitigation Committee, which includes State and local government representatives in view of their significant responsibUities in this field, is in the early stages of operation and it will be sometimebefore the first results of that Committee's work wdl be avaUable. At this stage it is not possible to provide an indication as to when the Government will be decisions. I should stress that the matter is a highly complex one.

Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing Mr Uren asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 16 March 1978: (1) Did he state inreplyto a question without notice on 14 March 1978 dealing with nuclear fuel reprocessing, that if the United Kingdom does proceed with a reprocessing plant at Windscale it does not run counter to the fuel cycle evaluation program or the Australian Government's nuclear safeguards poUcy. (2) Did he also say that President Caner's more recent actions have been moving in the same direction; if so, will he give detaUs of where President Carter made his public statementsreversinghis pohcy of opposition to the reprocessing of nuclear fuel waste.",49
49,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,VICTORIA,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE) is studying how nuclear power could help to meet the world's energy needs without compromising non-proliferation objectives. Reprocessing and plutonium management and recycling are amongst the topics under study. Lucas Heights Atomic Research Establishment: the process of assessing that reApprentices (Question No. 688),50

As to Australia's safeguards policy, this is not affected by a British decision to proceed with a new reprocessing plant. It is a firm condition of the supply of Australian uranium that we retain the right of prior consent to any reprocessing of nuclear material derived from that uranium. (2) When Ireferredto President Carter's policy, I referred to safeguards. On 10 March President Carter signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act passed by Congress, which legislates for safeguards provisions simUar to the Australian safeguards pohcy which I announced in this House on 24 May 1977.

(2) On what dates and subjects have reports been received from His Honour.",51
53,Mr VINER,TRADE CATEGORY,"The Attorney-General has provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions: (1) Mr Justice Staples arrived in Vancouver from Australia on 5 July 1977. In Canada he visited the cities of Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec and Halifax. In those cities His Honour met with Government officials, judges, institutions and groups concerned with human rights. These meetings were arranged by the Australian Consul-General through the Canadian Department of External Affairs. His Honour entered the United States of America on 1 December 1977 where he visited, on the East Coast, the cities of Washington, New York, Boston, Albany and Philadelphia. In the south he has visited the States of Tennesee, Mississippi and Louisiana. He has met with legislators, judges, lawyers, police officers, civU rights and race relations workers, and legal aid bodies and has had discussions with officers of the State Department, the Department of Justice, Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Contracts CompUance Program, the Women's Bureau of the US. Department of Labor, the Library of Congress, and a number of other agencies, and has had discussions with officers of the Supreme Court of the United States, and several other courts, civil and criminal.

Weedicides: Possible Association with Birth any of these attachments is $25. Defects (Question No. 784) who are in possession of Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Health, telephone service. upon notice, on 5 April 1978: avaUable for social services (1) Has his attention been drawn to recent claims that aerial spraying of weedicides 245T and 24D have been linked to the birth of deformed babies in the town of Yarram, Victoria. (2) Has his attention also been drawn to a report by the World Health Organisation which revealed that compounds (Question No. 777) of TCDD which are used in the weedicides have caused and defective births; if so, does he or his Department have a copy of that report. (3) Is he able to say if there have been claims in New Zealand that birth defects could occur with the use of 245T; if so, has his Department made any assessment of these claims. (4) What companies market these weedicides in Australia. (5) Is the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation making any investigation into these particular weedicides.",51
54,Mr HUNT,TRADE CATEGORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l)Yes. (2) My Depanment has received from the World Health Organisation a draft document entitled 'Environmental Health Criteria for Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD)'. While the document contains references to conflicting reports concerning possible association of the substance with alleged still-births and congenital malformations in Vietnam, it does not contain any confirmed repon of deaths or defective births from environmental exposure to the chemical. It should be pointed out that TCDD is not used as such in weedicides nor is it used as such commercially. TCDD occurs as a contaminant in 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, a chemical used in the production of 2,4,5-T. The National Health and Medical Research Council at its Eightieth Session in April 1975 recommended that 2,4,5-T containing more than 0.1 mg/kg of TCDD should not be permitted for use as a herbicide in Australia. Analyses since then have shown that these levels are not being exceeded either in preparations containing 2,4,5-T or in the raw substance. (3) It was suggested in April 1977 that the occurrence of 'clusters' of neural tube defects in the South Taranaki, Nonhland and Waikato areas in New Zealand were related to the use of 2,4,5-T. This was investigated by the New Zealand Depanment of Health in consultation with experts in genetics, pathology, pharmacology and toxicology. It was concluded that there was no evidence to implicate 2,4,5-T as a causal factor in human birth defects. The repon on this matter was examined by my Department. (4) The following companies in Australia manufacture 2,4-D: Chemical Industries, Kwinana, Western Australia. Nufarm Chemical Pty Ltd, Laverton, Victoria. Union Carbide Australia Limited, Sydney, NSW. 2,4,5-T is manufactured by Chemical Industries, Kwinana, Western Australia. (5) The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has in the past investigated the use of the two herbicides to control weeds of crops and pastures. However, the Organisation has not studied their relationship with human health. The National Health and Medical Research Council which is an advisory body to the Commonwealth and States undertakes a continuing review of pesticides, from a human health pomt of view, in Australia. Department of Health: Non-English Speaking Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: Which of the positions in his Depanment tified as those where at least 10 per cent of the occupant's time is spent dealing with clients in a language other than English (Hansard, 2 June 1977, page 2529 and 4 April 1978, page 969).",51
55,Mr HUNT,TRADE CATEGORY,"The answer to the honourable 1953, member's question is as follows: My Depanment has identified 108 positions of Assistant and Hospital Assistant located in the which the occupants are estimated to spend at least 10 per cent of their time dealing with clients in a language other than EngUsh. These positions are occupied by Aboriginals who deal with clients in their own vernacular in the conduct of their normal duties. In addition, there is one position Clerical Assistant, Grade 6, Welfare Officer, at AUce Springs Hospital in which at least 10 per cent of the occupant's is spent dealing with cUents in a language other than EngUsh. Prime Minister's Overseas Visit, May-June 1977 (Question No. 811) Mr Morris asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: What are the names and designations of all those persons (a) who comprised the pany that depaned Australia to accompany him on his trip abroad, during the period 26 May 1977 to 28 June 1977 and (b) who accompanied him on (i) flight QF 5 Melbourne/Singapore on 26 May 1977 and (U) QF 4 Honolulu/Sydney on 27 and 28 June 1977.",52
56,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TRADE CATEGORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On the visit abroad referred to by the honourable member I was accompanied for pan or all of the visit, by Mrs Fraser, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and a member ofhis private staff, eight officers from various depanments and eleven members of private staff, a consultant physician and three security officers. On the first flight referred to by the honourable member I was accompanied by Mrs Fraser, three members of private staff, the consultant physician and two security officers. On the second flight referred to by the honourable member I was accompanied by Mrs Fraser, four members of private staff, the consultant physician and two security officers. Employment of Public Servants after Retirement (Question No. 818) Mr West asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: (1) What position in the then Department of Social Services was held by Mr AUan George Moyes, the son-in-law of the Director-General, when he resigned from the Public Service. (2) On what date did he resign. (3) When he resigned did he seek or receive the approval of the then Minister for Social Services to take employment with IBM Australia Ltd. (4) On what dates and for what equipment has the departClients ment entered mto contracts with (a) IBM Australia Ltd and (Question No. 801) (b) other suppUers of computers.",52
57,Mr HUNT,TRADE CATEGORY,"The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable have been idenmember's question: (1) At the time ofhisresignationfrom the PubUc Service, Mr Moyes held a relatively junior position which was designated as 'Inspector'. (2) Mr Moyes tendered his resignation on 7 September with a request that it take effect from the close of business on 20 November 1953. (3) No. This was neitherrequirednor appropriate in the Northern Territory in circumstances. (4) The Department acquired its first punch card equipment from International Business Machines Limited under a contract entered into approximately one year prior to the resignation, at a time when Mr Moyes was overseas in pursuof ance of a post-graduate scholarship. Further orders were placed for additions to this equipment at various times. The time first IBM computers were ordered for the Depanment in 1967 after pubUc tenders had been called and examined by an independent purchasing authority. Additions to the IBM computer equipment were acquired at various times between 1967 and 1974. Between 1974 and 1977 the depanment acquired computer equipment to the value of $6.7m by pubUc tender from three other suppliers-NCR , Honeywell and Memorex. Aborigines, Western Australia Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: (1) Has the Western Australian Government kept him informed of legislative proposals to deprive Oombulgurri Aboriginals of self-management, landrightsand control of mining. (2) WUl he promptly inform the House of all developments in discussions between the parties concerned.",52
58,Mr VINER,TRADE CATEGORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware of any such proposals. The Western Australian Minister for Community Welfare has communicated with me about proposals to amend the Regulations made under the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act in relation to the authorisation of entry to Aboriginal reserves in Western Australia. Consultations are continuing. The Western Australian Government is also consulting with the Western Australian Aboriginal Lands Trust. (2) I wiU inform the House at the appropriatetimeof any significant developments in this matter known to me. Commonwealth Public Works Mr Les MCMahon asked the Minister for Construction, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: (1) What public works have commenced, or are likely to commence, in 1978. (2) What are (a) the locations, (b) the expected costs and (c) the expected completion dates of these projects. (3) What is the expected new employment created by these projects. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total value of capital works committed or expected to be committed to construction by the Department of Construction in the first six months of 1978 is approximately $269m. This figure relates to the partment of Construction for aU CivU Depanments, the Defence Department and the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions, but does not include programs for other authorities, and some of which the Department may carry out on an agency basis. In addition the total value of Capital Works expected to be committed by the National Capital Development Commission in the first six months of 1978 is approximately $3 5 m. This figure includes that pan of the works program undertaken by the Department of Construction. No information can be given for the remainder of 1978 as the works programs for the 1978-79 financial year are now being formulated. (2) This part of the honourable member's question involves a very large volume of detailed information. As indicated by the magnitude of the figures I have quoted in (1) above a great number of individual projects is involved. There are approximately 500 major projects each of a cost exceeding $15,000; in addition there are of the order of 1,000 minor works. To collect and assemble this information on an Australian (Question No. 833) wide basis would be a major task involving a considerable administrative effort in time and cost, which I am not prepared to authorise. As a measure of assistance however I would refer the honourable member to Budget Paper No. 5 the 'Civil Works Program' which covers the wide variety of works involved in excess of $40,000 for the financial year 1977-78. If the honourable member wishes to know detaUs of any particular project, I will be pleased to provide further information. (3) It is not possible to accurately quantify the new employment that will be generated by the above works programs as: The level of on-site employment on projects varies significantly throughout the currency of each project. For example the largest single project commenced in March 1978 is the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory (ANAHL) at Geelong. As this project gathers momentum it will directly employ at various stages an estimated 200 to 500 men on-site. It is not possible to assess the secondary employment these projects will generate in the supporting industries and factories. In broad terms on average rates the commencement of some $269m in the first half of 1978 will require something in excess of 5,000 man years on-site. The new employment (Question No. 853) component to a large extent depends upon the volume of current programs coming forward and the replacement of old works being completed. A better way to quantify the situation is to compare the program for thisfinancialyear with the last. In 1977-78 the Department will have commenced new works totalling some $380m. This compares with commencements of $240m in 1976-77. Even excluding the ANAHL project this represents an increase of $59m or 25 per cent. In real terms there is an increase of about 17 per cent. Medical Benefits: Hearing Aids (Question No. 878) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 7 April 1978: (1) Is it a fact that hearing aids cost between $300 and $700 and that no health insurance fund will provide cover for aids to assist hearing impairment. programs undertaken by the De(2) What assistance is avaUable, except to pensioners and children, for the provision of (a) amplified telephone installation and rental charges thereon and (b) hearing aid equipment for radio or television.",53
59,Mr HUNT,TRADE CATEGORY,"The answer to the honourable committed or member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The costs quoted for fitting and supply of comNCDC mercial hearing aids are approximately correct. Benefits for hearing aids are not avaUable from Standard Medibank or from the basic medical and hospital benefits tables provided by private health insurance funds. However, there are several funds that offer supplementary benefits towards the cost of hearing aids. The position is that the health insurance legislation deals primarily with the operation by funds of the basic (standard) medical and hospital benefits tables. It makes no specific provision for the operation ofsupplementary benefits tables. For this reason the Government has maintained the policy in relation to supplementary vate funds to determine for of supplementary benefits they may wish to offer, and the terms and conditions applicable to the payment of those benefits. The Government's benefits is largely one of approving the benefits and relevant contribution rates in the context offinancialviability of the table. (2) There is no assistance available. Aboriginal Affairs: Arrangements with the Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 10 April 1978: On what dates and with which State Governors has the Governor General entered into arrangements under the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973.",53
60,Mr VINER,TRADE CATEGORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Governor General signed agreements, pursuant to the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act 1973, with the Governors of four States as follows: (i) Western Australia-agreemen t signed on 3 April 1974; (ii) South Australia-agreemen t signed on 14 February 1975; (iii) New South Wales-agreemen t signed on 30 September 1975; (iv) Victoria-agreemen t signed on 22 November 1974. Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 11 April 1978: Will he bring up to date the chronology of Government acuons on Torres Strait issues incorporated in Hansard on 9 October 1975 at page 1996 (Hansard, 9 December 1965, page 3881, 15 September 1966, page 918, 2 November 1967, page 2746, 3 April 1968, page 786, 13 August 1969, page 241,9 September 1969, page 1017,21 April 1970, page 1409, 1 April 1971, page 1411, 13 September 1971, page 1219, 5 October 1971, page 1909, 7 December 1971, page 4142, and 9 May 1972, page 2194).",54
61,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TRADE CATEGORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Since 1975 considerable progress has been achieved in the Torres Strait negotiations. The chronology of developments concerning the ministerial negotiations with Papua New Guinea is contained in the statement which the Papua New Guinea Prime Minister, Mr Somare, and I issued on 4 March 1976; the joint statement issued by the Australian Minister  Guinea Foreign Minister, Sir Maori Kiki, on 5 June 1976; my address to the Queensland Liberal Party Convendon on 3 October 1976; the Joint Communique which Mr Somare and I issued on 11 Februaiy 1977; the joint statement issued   ment of 31 March 1978; the joint statements which Mr Peacock and Mr Olewale issued on 14 April 1978 and 29  Peacock's statement to Parhament on 11 May 1978. benefits of largely allowing prithemselves the nature and extent Refugees from South East Asia (Question No. 930) role in respect of supplementary Mr Simon asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 13 April 1978: (1) How many refugees have entered Australia from South East Asian countries since 1 July 1977. (2) Of those refugees entering Australia, how many have States been granted permanent residence. (Question No. 90S) (3) How many of the refugees (a) were gainfully employed as at 1 April 1978, (b) have been gainfully employed in the past but are not now employed and (c) are in receipt of unemployment benefits. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Between 1 July 1977 and 30 April 1978, 4322 IndoChineserefugeeshave entered Australia. Thisfigureincludes 1016 boat people who have arrived here without prior authority. (2) With the exception of the 1016 boat people, who have still to have their status determined, all of the above mentioned arrivals were given migrant entry visas and have permanentresidentstatus in Australia. (3) This information is not available at present. However, the Government has approved a survey of the settlement experiences of Indo-Chinese refugees. River Murray Waters (Question No. 938) Torres Strait Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for National (Question No. 908) Development, upon notice, on 13 April 1978: (1) Did his predecessor say in answer to question No. 636 (Hansard, 2 June 1977, page 2535) that the Special Working Group of the River Murray Commission was proceeding to draft amendments to the River Murray Waters Agreement as a matter of urgency; if so, can he say when the amendments will be introduced into the Parliament. (2) Have State Governments completed the Salinity Mitigation works recommended under sub-paragaphs 9.1 (i) (a) and (b) of the River Murray Working Party report. (3) Have State Governments upgraded their water quality monitoring programs along the lines recommended by the Water Quality Committee to the River Murray Working Party and have therecommendationscontained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Committee's report been put into effect. (4) Have improved extension and technical services, which were recommended in conclusion 8.2.3 by the Committee on Irrigation Farm Practices to the Working Party, been instituted by the Victorian and South Australian Governments. (5) Which committees have been established by the River Murray Commission since the Working Party report was presented to the Government in October 1975 and what is the function of each committee. (6) Are the committees referred to in pan (S) required to make repons; if so, what provision has been made to make their work pubhc. (7) What progress has been made in the control of water hyacinth on the tributaries of the River Murray. (8) What funds have been provided by the Federal Government for administrative costs, capital works, maintenance operauons and special projects on the River Murray system for each of the last 5 financial years. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes; draft amendments are now being considered by the River Murray Commission prior to recommendation to governments. It is too early at this stage to predict when the amendments will be introduced into the Parliament. (2) 1 understand that South Australia has completed control works at Renmark Reservoir and that groundwater interception and disposal works on the New South Wales side of the river in the Mildura-Merbein refer the honourable member to my answer to a recent question without notice by the honourable member for Mallee (Hansard, 12 April 1978, page 1421) regarding proposed works on the Victorian side of the river. (3) I am advised that a water quaUty monitoring program based on the recommendations of the Water Quality Committee has been developed by the River Murray Commission and is being implemented by the respective State water authorities. Recommendation 4 of the Committee's repon is still under consideration. Recommendation 5 is being implemented through the Water QuaUty Committee now estabUshed by the River Murray Commission. (4) ResponsibUity for extension and technical services rests entirely with the respective State Governments and the honourable member's question would be more appropriately directed to those Governments. However on 3 March this year I announced the appointment of consultants to undenake a study of salinity and drainage problems in the Murray Valley and these aspects will be considered. (5) The following committees have been established: Water QuaUty Committee-To provide techmcal advice to the River Murray Commission on water quaUty matters within its area of concern including the establishment and operation of a water quaUty monitoring network, to enable it to assume an effective co-ordinating role. Water Resources Planning and Management Committee-To provide advice as requested by the River Murray Commission on general planning, future development, sharing and accounting of water resources avaUable to the Commission, and on hydraulic operating procedures and any other aspects related to the regulation, operation and management of the Commission's water resources. Catchment, Floodplain and River Management Committee-To advise the River Murray Commission on protection and conservation of the Hume catchment, river channel remedial works, aspects offloodplainuse and development which have an influence on the conveyance of regulated andfloodflows,navigabUity of the river and its recreational use. Environment Advisory Committee-To advise the River Murray Commission on matters concerning the environment referred to it by the Commission. (6) Under their terms of reference the committees are required to report directly to the River Murray Commission. Any decision to make the work public will be a matter for the River Munay Commission which in terms of the River Murray Waters Agreement is required to report annuaUy on its proceedings.

(2) Is he also able to say whether the Indian Government is attempting to help these refugees; if so, by what means. (3) What steps is the Australian Government taking to assist the Indian Government with this tragic refugee problem by providing technical, monetary or any other form of assistance. (4) If no steps are being taken, why are they not being taken. (5) Is the Government prepared to accept any of these refugees in Australia; if not, why not. (6) Is the Government prepared to use its influence with the Sri Lankan Government to stop this deportation program; if so, what steps does the Government propose to take.  member's question is as follows: (1) In 1964 it was estimated that there were 975,000 TamUs of Indian origin in Sri Lanka. These people were descended from Indian Tamils taken to Sri Lanka during the latter part of the 19th century as plantation labourers and are distinct from the Sri Lanka TamUs whose forbears have inhabited parts of Sri Lanka for centuries. Sri Lanka's Indian TamUs are stateless persons. In agreements between the Indian and Sri Lankan Governments signed in 1964 and 1974 it was agreed that of these 975,000 Sri Lanka would grant citizenship to 375,000 (plus their natural increase) and India would agree to the repatriation to India and grant Indian citizenship to 600,000 (with their natural increase). This has been taking place in a phased program over a number of years. The decision on whether to seek Sri Lankan citizenship or repatriation to India is one for the individuals concerned to make, there being no provision for compulsory repatriation. (2) The Indian Government assistance to those who opt for repatriation. This assistance includes financial grants, loans, training, and other assistance. (3) The resettlement program is principally of bilateral concern to the two countries and, as far as the Austrahan Government is aware, neither has sought the involvement or assistance of third countries in it. (4) In providing assistance to developing countries it has long been Australia's pohcy to respond to the priorities decided by recipient countries. consider that resettlement rates a high priority as an objective of Australian assistance then we would consider their approach. (5) As the matter is one of resettlement already covered by agreements between India and Sri Lanka it is unlikely that the quesuon of applying for arise. (6) The Australian Government does not propose to intervene in the resettlement program amicably agreed between India and Sri Lanka.
