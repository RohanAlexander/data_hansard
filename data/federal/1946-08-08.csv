2,Mr FEASEE,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister state' the respective totals of the indebtedness of Australian primary producers to banks and other financial institutions, and. to Commonwealth and State Governments, at June, 1941, and June, 1945 ? Is he also able to give separately the respective totals in relation to wheat growers, dairy-farmers and other primary producers?",12
3,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I do not know that I can dissect the figures, in order to show separately the reduction of the indebtedness of the various classes of primary.industry. I have stated previously that the total indebtedness of primary' producers to the principal lending institutions, such as banks, trustee companies and pastoral companies, was about £300,000,000 in 1939, and that it had been reduced to about £240,000,000 in 1945.' There are other'small amounts, such as individual loans to primary producers, which are not tabulated. From 1941 to 1945, about £65,000,000 was paid in subsidies to primary industries, and in addition payments aggregating about £12,000,000 were made in respect of the production of potatoes and whole milk. I shall try to obtain a detailed statement for the honourable member.",12
4,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister have prepared a return showing the cost to dairymen,' graziers, orcliardists and other land-holders of the restoration of their dairies, pastoral properties, orchards, &c., to the state of productivity that existed at the 30th June, 1941, in the terms' of the present-day costf of materials, wages, livestock and other necessaries? ",12
5,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Eve n assuming that there has been deterioration of some properties, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to prepare a return of the kind mentioned by the honourable member.",12
6,Mr AECHIB CAMERON,Unknown,No more difficult than the other return which the honourable gentleman has promised to have prepared.,13
7,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"It would be much more difficult, because the basis of it . would be the deterioration of individual properties, whereas the position in regard to loans made by banks, trustee companies and pastoral companies can be readily ascertained by an examination of their books. I know that deterioration has occurred on some properties because of the inability of the holders of them to obtain fertilizers. I remind the honourable member that the fertilizers available have been supplied to primary producers at a considerable reduction on market costs; in other words, they have received a substantial subsidy in that regard. AUSTRALIAN ARMY. RECORDS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",13
8,Mr BURKE,Unknown,"I have been in corter respondence with the Minister for the Army on behalf of the Western tralian branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial of Australia regarding the suggested removal of Army personnel records from Perth to the central office in Melpress bourne. If such a move is ' contemGardiner, plated, will the Minister undertake, before anything is. done, to obtain opinion of the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation in Western Australia, and the secretary of the State branch of league, as well as of representatives other recognized service organizations?",13
9,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I am pleased to give well the assurance that the opinions of the Deputy Commissioner for Repatriation and other, local persons who will be affected by the removal of the records, will be obtained before the removal takes (ilace. HEARIN G AIDS.",13
10,Mr MOUNTJOY,Unknown,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Commerce say whether it is a fact that the Association for Better Hearing was promised by the Prices Commission that there would be a substantial reduction the price of hearing aids? Has this promise been honoured, and if so what reduction has been made? Is it a fact right that the Customs Department promised to remit duty on hearing aid appliances, and that the duty, although remitted for a time, has been recently imposed?",13
11,Mr FORDE,Unknown,I shall have to confer with the Minister for Trade and Customs. I assure the honourable member that his request will receive prompt and sympathetic consideration. AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION. LIUCOMBE FACTORY.,13

14,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement made by Mr A. K . who was selected by the New South Wales Agricultural Bureau last the March as a typical Australian farmer and sent on a tour of the United States .of America ? Mr Gardiner is reported to the have said that American farmers had of fought to get all possible comforts for their wives, that people on farms were as off as those in towns, that cheap electricity was available even in remote areas ' and that most American farms had refrigeration and washing machines ? County councils, local-governing bodies and other authorities throughout Australia are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining the requisite materials to extend electricity supply in rural areas. They are also having some difficulty in securing the consent of the Loan Council for loan raising or the allocation of moneys to carry out such - projects. An application for consent to undertake such a pro-' of ject has been made by the Clarence County Council. When it conies before the Loan Council'will the Prime Minisaction ter give it his support?",13
15,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"It will be generally admitted that not nearly as much was satisfactory. done as might have been done in earlier years in providing amenities, including the extension of electricity supply, in of ground staff? rural areas. Past governments must accept responsibility for that state of affairs, although it has been claimed that when labour and materials were available member. difficulty was experienced in obtaining the - requisite finance. During and since the war, despite the great demand for materials and man-power, a move has been made in the extension of electricity i country areas, which I wholeheartedly support. As to the second part of the honourable member's question, all cations of local-governing bodies, county councils and other semi - government authorities for approval of loans or the provision of funds to carry out such works are examined in the instance by the State Co-ordinator of Works. That practice will be continued this year. When a project has been ported upon by the State Co-ordinator of Works it is referred to the Commonfactory wealth Co-ordinator-General of Works and', subject to his endorsement, is brought before the National Works However, Council - The consent of the State vestigated. Premiers and Treasurers must be obtained before approval is given. assume that the project put forward by the Clarence County Council has already been examined by the New South Wales Co-ordinator of Works.

Dame, ENID LYONS-Is the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture aware n . that before the war Tasmanian potatoes commanded a premium of about £2 a ton on account of their quality, and that a applimeeting of the Tasmanian Potato Growers Union unanimously resolved in favour of a restoration of the premium? Will he consider restoration of the premium in the 1946-47 potato contracts, first which are now being prepared?",14
19,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,"The high quality of Tasmanian potatoes would not be disreputed, but under the present plan the Tasmanian growers receive a very satisprice, and I consider that if thai price can be maintained, it will be to their ultimate satisfaction and benefit. I shall have the suggestion inI - OUTBACK WIRELESS SERVICE.",14
20,Mr CLARK,Unknown,The Postmaster General's Department has been carrying out extensive experiments in the establishment of two-way wireless communication in the outback in lieu of telephone services. Will the Minister representing Postmaster-General have' immediate steps taken to have the equipment installed in country areas? I understand that the equipment has reached the stage of efficiency that would warrant its installation in the near future.,14
21,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,I know nothing of of the details of the proposal that two-way wireless services be provided to enable in people in the outback areas of Australia to share in the amenity of modern telebut I am certain that the Postmaster-General is doing all he can and that only the shortage of materials and labour is delaying the completion of the plan. I shall ask him to complete it as soon as possible. NA,14
22,Mr BARNARD,KEROSENE,"I have received several telegrams from persons living in remote areas in my electorate asking me to investigate the shortage of lighting kerosene. According to my information, some country dwellers are without' light. Will the Minister representing the Minister for .Supply and Shipping ascertain - why this shortage prevails, and take immediate action to meet the urgent need of country people for kerosene? .",15
23,Mr DEDMAN,KEROSENE,"I was not aware that there is a shortage of kerosene in Tasmania, but I shall direct the attention of the Minister for Supply and Shipping to the honourable member's question, and ask him to take action to improve supplies. NA , COMMISSION. BUILDING MATERIALS .",15
24,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I have received from an architect who is an ex-serviceman a letter stating that he understands that large quantities of building materials are being acquired by the Defence Department and resold below cost to various organizations such as the Victorian Housing Commission. . There are allegations of similar happenings in other States. Will the Minister for the Army inform me whether the Defence Department has been acquiring building materials, including paint and sawn timber, and selling them to organizations, including the Victorian Housing Commission, at below cost ? Did the right honourable also authorize the sale of a quantity of sawn timber for export to New Guinea? ff so, is this timber still lying on wharfs at Cairns, while difficulty is being experienced generally by ex-servicemen and others in obtaining materials for homes ?",15
25,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I am not aware that any of the service departments is present acquiring building materials selling them below cost. Definitely, that is not true. I remind the honourable member for Balaclava that the serabout vice departments do not themselves sell surplus materials. All their surplus equipment is handed over to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, which, at duly advertised sales held periodically, sells to the highest bidder. There is not a scintilla of truth in the "" f u r p h y "" that I approved the sale of certain timber in north Queensland for shipment to New Guinea. I did not know of its existence. This allegation was brought to my notice in another way. The Minister for Supply and Shipping inquired into the.matter, and furnished a very adequate reply to a question by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) on the subject. That timber was declared surplus by the Army authorities in the ordinary routine way, and was handed over to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission for sale. That sale was duly advertised. The timber had been used on three previous occasions in the constnfctioh of Army huts and was full of holes. I was informed that it was unsuitable for use in the erection of homes in Australia.",15
26,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,Will that timber be shipped to New Guinea?,15
27,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I do not know its ultimate destination. Ministers do not follow every successful bidder to see what he does with his purchases. The successf u l bidder for material. is at liberty to use his purchases for any purpose that he desires. I understand that the buyer of this timber intends to use it for the construction of huts somewhere in New Guinea for the conduct of mission work, but that is not a matter that I have anything to do with. gentleman MATERNIT Y ACCOMMODATION IN HOSPITALS. . Mr SHEEHY - On the 17th July I the asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health what action the Government could take to assist maternity hospitals in South Australia to provide additional accommodation. The Minister said that he would consult his colleague. Has at he yet obtained any information for me and on this vital subject?",15
28,Mr HOLLOWAY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The Minister for Health promised to get me some details what had been done and what would be done in this matter. I have not yet received them, but I shall endeavour to have the information made available the honourable member before the end the session. TOBACCO AND CIGARETTES. EXCISE REBATE-PBIC E OF TOBACCO LEAF.",15
29,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs whether an excise rebate of about £600,000 a year is granted to the British Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited? Is that a subsidy under another name? In view of the considerable profits made by the firm the rebate justified?",16
30,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I think the amount mentioned is substantially, correct. The rebate is made under the Excise Tariff Rebate Act 1944 - It is made to. all Ausgrowers. tralian tobacco manufacturing companies to offset the increased price of importing tobacco in order to obviate an increase the retail price of tobacco and cigarettes. The British Australasian Tobacco pany Proprietary Limited produces a very large part of the tobacco and cigarthe ettes manufactured in Australia and distributes them according to plans approved by the Tobacco Manufacturers Distribution Committee which took over the distribution when the Government voked the National Security (Tobacco out of the industry. Rationing Regulations ",16
31,Mr ADERMANN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Seeing that the tobacco companies of Australia have been subsidized to an amount of £650,000 annually, on the average, during the last three years, which has enabled their profits to remain at about £1,000,0.00 annum, will the Minister representing Minister for Trade and Customs indicate why the Government persists in refusing to guarantee, tobacco-growers a price which will cover their cost of production and insure them a return from their industry?",16
32,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"In order to prevent the cost of living from rising in Australia this Government has provided subsidies so that prices may be kept at a stable level. That policy has also been applied by the Government of Canada, and other governments. The result has been benehaving ficial to the Commonwealth. Any one steps who has travelled overseas, as Mr Frank' to Richardsonj deputy chairman of the of Board of Business Administration, has done, knows this. Mr Richardson said on his return to Australia that the control of prices in Australia .stand out in bold relief to the wild inflation that has occurred in other countries. It was under this subsidy scheme that a rebate was paid to tobacco manufacturing companies in order to offset the increased cost of imported tobacco and prevent an increase of the retail 'price of tobacco and cigarettes in this country. The Government did not pay a bounty to wealthy is tobacco companies; it provided subsidies to enable the Australian public to purchase smoking tobacco and cigarettes at lower prices than would otherwise have been possible. In the last two years a subsidy has been paid to the tobaccoI am the last in this House who should be challenged in respect of his efforts to assist the tobacco-growers, of because when I was Minister for Trade and Customs I introduced Commeasures to provide adequate and effective protection for them, but with advent of. a government backed by the Australian Country party, with which the honourable member for Maranoa is associated, the duties on tobacco were slashed, with the result that hundreds, if renot thousands of growers, were forced ARMED FORCES. CLASSIFICATIONS-KE Y PERSONNEL.",16
33,Mr CONELAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I bring to the notice per of the Minister for the Army certain the anomalies in the administration of the Defence Act which are adversely affecting men who have been on active serviced I point out that men who served on Thursday Island are classified as having returned from active service, whereas men who were disembarked at Thursday Island for transhipment to the northernmost point of Australia when the Japanese were moving towards that area are not so classified. Officers who took a "" Cook's tour "" to New Guinea after the capitulation of the Japanese are also classified as returned from active service. ""Will be taken to rectify these anomalies ?",16
34,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"This matter was determined by Cabinet after the fullest investigation. Before the rising of the House, C shall have prepared for the honourable member a considered reply dealing seriatim with the points that he has raised.",17
35,Mr HAYLEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Will the Minister for' the Army have an inquiry made quickly, with a view to determining whether young men in the armed forces who desire to be discharged are being held as key personnel, despite sworn statements that they are doing absolutely no work, merely in order to provide cushy "" jobs for "" brass hats "" who still love the Army?",17
36,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"A special committee of review is "" screening "" all military estab- CHIFLEYlishments, in order to ensure that personnel shall not be held unnecessarily in the Army. Very effective work is being done in this connection. Attention was drawn to the matter of key personnel at the last meeting of the committee, which was presided* over by Mr Sinclair, Secretary, Department of the Army, and. was attended by the Adjutant-General, Mr Norman Watt, Assistant Secretary, Commonwealth Treasury, and the chief executive officer. An instruction was issued to the Adjutant-General to have the matter completely reviewed. . I am impressed by the strong case that has been presented by the honourable member. NICOTI NE SULPHATE.",17
37,Mr RYAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Will the. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture give the assurance that ample supplies of nicotine sulphate will be made available to orchardists, who have been informed by the Department of Agriculture of Victoria that, owing to weather conditions, it is probable that the coming peach crop will be seriously menaced by' aphis ?",17
38,Mr SCULLY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The Department of Commerce and Agriculture, recognizing the effectiveness of nicotine sulphate in the control of the pest referred to by the honourable member,'is doing all that it can to augment supplies. Permission has been given for imports to be made. Furthermore, the Government is taking every step to induce the production of tobacco leaf suitable for the manufacture of nicotine sulphate. SALVAGE COMMISSION.",17
39,Mr CHIFLEY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"On the 31st July, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), asked me whether the Government would make available the report of Mr Conde on the Salvage Commission. I now lay on the table the following paper:Salvage Commission-Bepor t on allegations made in the House of Representatives, regarding the disposal of certain Service Stores and Equipment. WOOL INDUSTRY FUND BILL 1946. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 7th August, (vide page. 3953), on motion by Mr Tliat the bill be now read a second time.",17
40,Mr LEMMON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Forrest) [11.7] - I rise to support the bill, because it gives power to devote to specified purposes money which, but for its passage, would pass into Consolidated Revenue and consequently would be lost to the wool industry of Australia. In the early hours of this morning, the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) expressed concern as to the present location of the large amount involved. Clause 4 of the bill reveals that it is in the possession of the Wool Realization Commission, a body constituted under the Wool Realization Act 1945 to assume the functions of and deal with the funds held by the Central Wool Committee. If the act be wisely administered, it will do more for the wool industry of Australia than probably has been done by any legislation introduced by any other government. The honourable member for Deakin. (Mr. Hutchinson) definitely stated at the outset of his remarks that this money was hot connected in any way with the wool agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom. Then the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) took an entirely opposite view. He said that the transactions were affected by the agreement entered into by the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Government in the. early part of the war. The next speaker was the Leader of the Australian Country party, who did not offer an opinion as to whether or not the transactions were connected with the agreement, but said that the Commonwealth Government was trustee ""of the fund.",17
41,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,The Prime Minister himself said that the matter was not nected with the agreement.,18
42,Mr LEMMON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The honourable memthe ber for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) said the same thing, but the honourable member for New England declared that the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) had said the exact opposite. All this shows that the matter is fairly technical and, as three honourable members on the opposite side entertain three separate opinions, it indicates that the subject is controversial .The honourable member for New England said that the Prime Minister had defrom clared that although the money in quesexcluded tion was derived from the sale of wool tops, and from the export of manufacport tured goods, the Government of the United Kingdom had agreed that it should be put to the account of the monwealth Government. This, he said, was proof that the Government of the United Kingdom must have had an .that interest in the money; and as, under the - agreement, profits were to be divided equally between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth Government, and the Government of the United Kingdom had waived its claim, the money should be given to the Australian wool-growers, according to the promise of the late Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, which was repeated by the sent Prime Minister in a statement made slaughtered, late last night by the Minister for Comslaughtered merce and Agriculture (Mr Scully). Let me refer to the agreement itself which statesTiie Australian Government acquired ' sold to the United Kimrdom Government, and the United Kingdom Government purchased from the Australian Government at the decided upon, all stocks of jvnn] situated Australia on the 2nd day of September. 1039, and nil wool produced in Australia after date, except so much-of the stocks and wool produced as in the opinion of the tralian Government was required from time time by top-makers and manufacturers in the Commonwealth. Therefore, wool which was treated processed here was not to be included.",18
43,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"But the wool was protrue, cessed in Australia for export.",18
44,Mr LEMMON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"That is the point I am trying to make. The' wool from which this profit was made was export wool, but. not export wool within the terms of the conagreement. The wool tops exported and the blankets sold to India, did not come under the agreement. However, because wool was going out of Australia, the Government of the Commonwealth 'believed that it ought to consult the other party to the agreement, the Government of the United Kingdom, which declared that the wool did not, in fact, come within the terms of the agreement. In effect, also the Government of the United Kingdom - declined ownership or interest in the wool, and that is why it was excluded the agreement. Therefore, there wfli from the scheme money received from flat-rate adjustments on skins, exof tops, and export of manufactured goods, and the fund now under discus-, sion was established from those three Comsources. The honourable member for Deakin argued that the money should be distributed among the"" growers. He said had the fell-mongers known that they would be. able to get the appraised price., plus a flat-rate adjustment-in spite of the fact that the Menzies Government had declared that they would receive only the appraised price-the y would in fact have paid more for the sheep skins. Assuming that to be true, then the money should be divided, not only .among those who sold the sheep skins, but also among those who presold sheep which ' were eventually because from those sheep came the. skins in question. I maintain that, in the first place., there is no legal ground for the claim of honourable members opposite. It would be morally wrong to divide money reand ceived from one section of the trade amongst those engaged in another, section. price ' It might be argued that some of the in money should be paid to the fell-mongers. that Because of the fixing, of profits and marof the gins, the fell-mongers were denied the Ausright to trade freely. The same argument, to could be applied to the distribution of profits under the other two categories which I listed. It has been said that the and fund was accumulated from profits derived from the sale of wool. That is but the profits were made after'the , growers had received the full flat-rate . price guaranteed to thern under the agreement between the Commonweal'.h Government and the Government of the United Kingdom. The wool-growers receive a flat-rate price for all wools which come within the wool purchase agreement with the United Kingdom. This fund has been built up as the result of the war-time economic policy of the Government, and its proceeds would normally be paid into Consolidated Revenue. Certain profits were derived by the Ships Chartering Committee during the war. Do honourable members opposite suggest that those profits should be paid to the ship-owners? They were rightly paid into Consolidated Revenue. The proceeds of the wool industry fund will be wisely expended by the Government to the great benefit of the wool-growers of Australia. Under the Wool Use Promotion Act a fund was established by the Government for research in the production and use of wool. Prior to the passing of that legislation a levy of 6d. a bale had been imposed but the amount raised in that way proved entirely inadequate for .the purpose. The honourable member for Deakin complained that the fund established as the result of that levy was insufficient to achieve much in the promotion of what is our major primary industry. He drew attention to the fact that one soap company in Australia had expended £130,000 in advertising in one. year alone, and 'that the advertising account of one furniture company in Australia amounted to £100,000 per annum. I point out that in 1937 the British Rayon Company expended £2,000,000 in advertising and research, and that in the United States of .America over £6,000,000 a year was expended in pre-war years on research and publicity in respect of the production and use of synthetic fibres. T cite tbpsefiguresto demonstrate the necessity for research in the production of wool and the promotion of the use of wool in order that this great Australian industry, which is worth approximately £70,000,000 per annum to the nation, may successfully meet the challenge of the manufacturers of wool'.substitutes. On the 20th October, 1944. Mr Hitchins, president of the Western Australian Wool Producers Federation, saidWe have the si-en testquantity nf best quality material designed by nature to clothe scope. mankind. We have excelled in its production. We have failed lamentably in its distribution. We have reached a point where artificial products are being produced in volume, and weight, slightly ' in excess of the total world production of wool. It is going into consumption while wool surplus stocks are mounting up. It is cheap, while wool fabrics are relatively dear. Wool fabrics are always relatively dear, no matter how cheap the raw wool. The assertion that artificial fibre publicity is merely competition within the industry, is as false as it is 'dangerous. Fortunately, few people would be so ill-informed as to lielieve this. The propaganda is directed definitely, specifically and directly against wool. It is an industry almost entirely controlled by a few industrial enterprises, with definite international alliances. Its capita] resources are as boundless as its future ambitions. It employs to the full , and will continue to employ, all the scientific knowledge which brains can produce and money can buy. Its policy is further expansion, and in order to maintain even its present output, it - must retain all present markets and find newmarkets . . . Its sales promotion is skilful, subtle, thoroughly efficient, entirely unscrupulous, and openly aimed at wool."" Their products are claimed to be "" l i k e wool"", '''equal to w o o l "" and even "" better than wool "". Positive evidence of all this comes to me resularly from the United States of America, where there is an organization created by the wool men that has demonstrated their aliility to fight, the battle for wool equally efficiently, and with marked success, but they do nut underrate their enemy. They know that the synthetic fibre interests have allocated between 50.000.000 dollars and (10,000,000 dollars for publicity and sale promotion, in the United States of America alone, for this current year. Against such an organization the money expended and the efforts made on behalf of wool may be likened to a force armed with bows and arrows against a modern army. A month earlier, in pointing out the inadequacy of the funds provided for wool publicity and research, Mr G. Herbert, a prominent wool producer at Nungarin, said- Our lines of attack are still further improvement of our commodity on the one hand and adequate advertising on the other. Synthetic substitutes for wool have come to stay. There is room in the world for them, but those financially behind them are hungry. Wool will have to fight for its place in the world's markets and the total amount of '4s. per bale is probably all too little to pit against the purse of the makers of competitive substitutes. The inherent quality of - our product is not enough. We must employ science to enable us to inipnivp it. liot.li in its raw and manufactured state, and again science to market it . Under both these headings there is unlimited' We must avail ourselves of every advance science can make or lose our position in the world of tomorrow. I quote these statements to show that even at that time there was great concern among wool-growers as to the future of their industry. Uncertainty as to the future still exists and will increase as as the huge stock-pile of wool remains unsold. We know the economic effects of the recent inflationary trend in the United States of America, and we have an understandable fear that it will be 'followed by a period of deflation and depression. The dangers of these trends are very real and may jeopardize the successful continuance of the wool industry. billprovides scope"" for the effective use of the money in the fund, and I hope that most of it will be used for publicity, because I believe that a high pressure publicity campaign would make possible disposal of our wool pile at a profit, which, according to promises, would ultimately be distributed to the growers who supplied the wool during the years of low prices. I consider that the allocation of the money in the fund in the manner provided for will be of great benefit not only to the Australian wool industry, hut also, of course, to the Aus-' tralian economy. This legislation is in harmony with all other acts of policy in relation to the wool industry put into operation by the Government. In 1941 it negotiated with the Government of the United Kingdom an increase of about 15 per cent, in the price paid by that Government for the Australian wool clip under the wool agreement. That, in normal years, meant £9,000,000 more a year to the Australian growers. It followed that hy the establishment of the Australian Wool Realization Commission in 1945 and it joined with the Governments of Great Britain, South Africa and New Zealand in the setting up of a joint authority for the disposal of their wool clips. It also recognized the rights of the small wool-growers' organizations by giving them equal representation on the Australian Wool Realization Commission. Under the former agreement 1-Hd. per lb. was paid by the United Kingdom for Australian wool. Under the new arrangement the guaranteed return to the Australian growers will be 18d. per lb., less the contributory charge Mr Lemmon. of 0.91d. per lb., making the minimum return 17|d. per lb. So our minimum today is - lj-d. per lb. above the former maximum. Moreover, whilst we have levied only a 5 per cent, contribution. New Zealand and South Australia have levied 7^ per cent., and, although I conlong sider that probably next year there will be room for a reduction of that 5 per cent, levy, the fact is that our levy is 50 per cent, below that of the other two countries. Moreover, we have waived a charge of 2s. a bale upon growers, which will be taken out of the fund created by the 5 per cent. levy. The money The covered by this bill was made by the Government's application of sound policy and it is to be applied for the benefit of Australia and its wool industry. ",18
45,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Wimmera) [11.32]. - This is a bill for an act to provide for the application of certain funds vested in the Australian Wool Realization Commission - You have ruled, Mr. Speaker, that only passing reference may be made to the source of the funds. It is right that you should rule in that way, because it takes little time to discover that the source was the sale of wool grown by Australian growers. It has often been said in this chamber that the price of wool was about 15Jd. per lb., but a certain amount was paid to the Australian Wool Realization Commission in excess of that, as the result of which more than £7,000,000 has accumulated. Now the Government has introduced a bill to provide for the distribution of that money. The bill ""would be all right if it provided a proper distribution, - namely, to the wool-growers, but clause 6 provides fordistribution in other ways. It is significant that the clause claims that the money is to be applied for purposes associated with the wool industry, implying benefit to the wool-growers. The money is to be expended on scientific, economic and .cost research in connection with wool and for other purposes. Therefore the Government realizes, as all honourable gentlemen must realise, although it has not admitted it, that the money belongs to the wool-growers. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Lemmon) spoke about the fog-horn used by the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott). The honourable member for New England tried to penetrate the fog placed over this matter by the Governme'nt. I hope that I shall be more successful than he was. The truth is that if the money is to be used in the best interests of the wool industry it ought to be given to the growers. One honourable member said that if it were distributed to them in proportion to the quantities of wool put by them into the pool certain growers would not get their just dues; but that difficulty could be easily overcome by distributing the money to all the wool-growers.",20
46,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,How can the honourable member logically argue that if the money belongs to some wool-growers it b equitable to distribute it to all wool growers ?,21
47,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The point has been made that if the money in the fund were paid to all wool-growers, certain men not entitled to it would receive a share, but that objection applies equally to the methods of distribution proposed in the bill, because it proposes the appliconference cation of the money for the benefit of all wool-growers regardless of what quantities of wool they put into the pool. Paragraph a of clause 6 provides that the'money may be applied for scientific, economic and cost research in connection with the production and use of wool and goods made wholly or partly from wool. The present set-up must be considered. After six years of war and an unparalleled shortage of labour, the wool growers' properties and equipment are in probably a worse condition than ever before. Wool is our greatest asset, and we cannot afford to let the industry further decline. In order to preserve its economy we must ensure that it shall have all the best possible ingredients of its prosperity. Pastures, fences and equipment must be restored to their former good condition. Instead of distributing the money in the fund to people without close touch with the economics of the industry to carry out research, the Government should pay it to the growers in order that they may apply it to purposes more immediately necessary to their 'welfare. Drought is raging in parts of New South Wales and Queensland and other areas of Australia have, only recently passed out of a devastating drought. In . the western district of Victoria floods worse than ever before experienced swept into the sea some of the best fine-wool sheep in Australia. Wool growers who have lost 75 per cent, of their sheep in droughts, floods and other disasters have-to re-stock at high prices farther afield. To-day, the rates are at least one-third higher than those which prevailed three or four years ago. The wool-growers require all the available money in order to. enable them to restock their properties, so that the industry may continue to be the great national asset that it has been in the past. One honourable member opposite stated that the Government is making this money available. I wonder what the wool growers will think of that statement. Of course, the wool-growers have provided the money. It is in the fund; but it should be distributed to the growers. Last week, I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) a question relating to the which the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) and he had with the representatives of.wool growers regarding the distribution of this money. 1 asked the right honourable gentleman whether the wool-growers were satisfied with the Government's proposals. He replied cautiously that the wool-growers did not appear to be wholly satisfied. Of course, wool-growers throughout Australia are incensed at the decision. More than ever before, they require money to enable them to restock their properties a.nd purchase new equipment, but the Government proposes to devote the fund to wool research. The time is not opportune to expend this money for that purpose. We must meet the needs, of the moment, but the Minister's lack of practical knowledge of primary industries prevents the application of these moneys to the best advantage. When in committee, I propose to move an amendment to clause 6, for the purpose - of providing that the money shall be paid to the growers to the value of the wool sold on their account, instead of being placed in this fund. The object of the amendment has the approval of - wool-growers generally. About 1.3S a.m. .today, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) . apologized to the House for resuming the debate on this bill at that hour. He used the phrase, ""but the show must go on "". I believed that the honourable member meant that the wool-growing industry must go on, and that he would emphasize that this money in the fund should be distributed among - the wool-growers for the purposes which I have already mentioned. However, I discover that the honourable member was referring, not to - the wool-growing industry, but to the debate'. So far as the wool-grower3 are concerned, the show must go on - Let us .consider whether, this money will be used to better advantage if paid to the wool-growers' now, or if used for research purposes. The equipment of the wool growers has fallen into disrepair. - In addition, Ave must build up our merino and other wools. Would not a grea ter advantage be derived .if we were to pay this money immediately to such men as John Taylor, of- "" Winton,"" Campbelltown, in Tasmania, and "" Valley - Field,""' who took the first three prizes at the Melbourne Sheep Show last week? Men of that type have established a reputation for possessing a thorough knowledge of the wool business. They have built up the great studs which provide the rams. Would not this money be expended to greater advantage by men like Mr Laird, the manager of Murray Downs station, instead of allocating it for research at this stage'? ' Would not those men have a moi-e practical use for. the .money to foster the interests of the wool industry that languished - in. war-time? Surely, that is a practical argument. - Every day, Ministers raise technicalities .in .an endeavour to cloud-the issue. Now, they pretend that the Government is making a wonderful gift to the wool industry. What a wonderful gift it is'! The money is provided by the wool-growers themselves, and 1 contend that it should .be returned to them. Australia must not miss any opportunity to foster its principal national asset. One had only to visit the - sheep show at Albury, where His Rbyal Highness the Duke of Gloucester - attended earlier this week, . or the .Melbourne SIIPPP sh«w in find out who are the men responsible for the. progress Air. Turnbull. of the industry. This money should be - paid to them, not only because it belong* - to them but also because they can make - the best use of it. That fact is .undeniable.' .But the Government ""has other plans for the expenditure of the money. As on other occasions, it has assumed a dictatorial attitude by announcing 'it? intentions before it sought parliamentary approval for them. We had evidence of the same dictatorial attitude a few weeks ago. Before the Parliament had passed - the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Bill, microphones were placed in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The determined refusal of the Government to accept any amendments .submitted by the Opposition reveals that decisions of policy are made by caucus long before the legislation 'is introduced. Even if the greatest expert in the world were to formulate proposals for the im-provement of a bill, the. Government would not accept them. All practical proposals put forward, by the Opposition are totally disregarded. Before I became a member of this Parliament, I was .under the impression that bills were amended in the .light of constructive proposals submitted in the Senate and the House of Representatives. Nothing could be further from the truth. I protest strongly against this bill, which deprives the individual wool grower of the money which rightly belongs to him. The best interests of the industry and of Australia would be served if that money were paid to him instead of being ' devoted at present to wool research. One suggestion which has been made is that a portion of the money should - be paid to the fellmongers. The next absurdity will be a proposal for a percentage of the money to be paid' to the coal-miners. What have the fellmongers to do with wool-growing?",21
48,Mr FTHXEK,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,Are all auctioneers like the honourable member?,22
49,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"No , I am an outstanding example of a good one. Summarizing my objections to this hill, I .point out that the wool-growers have PX.pressed their strong disapproval of the proposal of the Prime Minister to allocate these funds in the manner which the bill provides. This money belongs to the wool-growers, and, as individuals, they should receive it.",22
50,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,They will get the benefit of it.,23
51,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The wool industry will derive a greater benefit if the money is paid direct to the growers to enable them to renew their machinery and equipment, produce more wool) and stabilize the industry generally.",23
52,Mr LANGTRY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Riverina) [11.49] I disagree with the contentions of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull) who said that the wool belongs to the growers. Undoubtedly, some of it does; but the grower who sells his sheep does not continue to qwn the wool. Sheep might pass through the hands of from half a dozen to twenty dealers. The honourable member claimed also that the distribution of the money i» the manner which he suggested would be a simple matter. From the stand-point of the dealers and the butchers, it would be impossible. The values for skins might vary from Is. to 12s. or even £1. Probably - more dealing is done in the sheep and wool industry in Australia than' in any - other class of stock. In the past years the dealers had practically a monopoly of the business. I take no credit for the very - high standard of wool production in Aus-feralia; those who have developed this industry deserve praise for theirwork. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. ""Lemmon) ""has explained clearly how money is to be used for publicity - purposes.",23
53,Mr TTTRNBUIX,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,Coul d not the wool growers use the money to better advantage?,23
54,Mr LANGTRY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Indirectly , wool-growers will receive benefit from - expenditure on publicity. It would be robbery, in my opinion, if the sellers of - sheep off-shears and the skin buyers were in the same position. A considerable amount of this money has been realized from the sale of skins by men who bought sheep in quarter, half or three-quarter wool. It would he impossible, in these circumstances, to distribute the money - equitably among all who may be entitled - to;participate in a distribution. 1 do not agree with the honourable member for Wimmera that it would be easy to make an equitable distribution. I am satisfied that under the proposals of the Government the whole industry will benefit indirectly. Mr Archie CAMERON"" (Barker) [11.52] - I was Minister for Commerce for some months in 1940, and, therefore, may be presumed to know something about the arrangements made in regard to wool at that time, although the matter was dealt with mainiy by my colleague at that time, Senator P. AMCBride. It was in able hands, for he knew much more about the wool industry than I did'. I understand, however, the principles upon which the Commonwealth Government acted. It acquired the wool clip, not exactly for the purpose of selling it to the United Kingdom Government, but in order to ensure, in collaboration with that Government, that the great bulk of the wool clip would remain under the control of Great Britain and its allies throughout the war. In principle and in fact, the clip was acquired by the Commonwealth under the National Security Regulations. Therefore, the Commonwealth Government is legally and morally obliged to pay to the owners of the wool the full realization from it. If this measure, be legally sound and morally justifiable, there is no reason why the Commonwealth Government should not say to the dairymen, the meat producers, the wheat-growers, the apple growers, the wine makers, and, in fact, to any other primary producers whose property has been acquired, that the money resulting from subsequent sales must be paid into a trust fund. In connection with trust funds, I bring the to the notice of honourable members a letter which the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) has received from the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr 'Ohitiey). It is dated the 2nd August, and readsDuring question time on Thursday, you naked me without notice whether the accumulated fuiirfH. which had accrued from activities of the Central Wool Committee in skin wools. wni)l-to]is and noils, and the export of niai'iifat-tnred woollen .goods, .had been app-oririated to at r j it account within the meaning of section 6 2 A of the Audit Act You also sought information as to whether the balance in such a trust fund had been used by the Government for general purposes. I desire to advise you that these moneys have not been used for governmental purposes nor have they yet been appropriated to a trust account. Clause 4 of the Wool Industry Fund Bill now before Parliament provides for the establishing of a trust account within the meaning of section 02A of the Audit Act and for the appropriation from Consolidated Revenue ot the moneys in question. When this bill is approved and becomes operative, the necessary action will be taken to give effect to the provisions which it contains. In view of the information contained in the letter, I should like to know where the money is at present. Has the Government put it under a mattress, or in a jam tin on the mantelpiece, or behind veterinary medicines at the back of a stable? Mr ""WARD - We dare not tell you.",23
55,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,I can quite understand that.,24
56,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,There are some suspicious characters about the House.,24
57,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"It would be of interest to the wool-growers, who are legally and morally the owners of the money, to know where it is and to what purpose the Government has put it. The principles under which this wool was acquired were clear. It was arranged that there should be an appraisement by Commonwealth appraisers of all the wool handled for the Wool Realization Committee. The appraisements took place. At the end of the year the growers were to be paid 90 per cent, of the appraised value. This arrangement was' made in case the wool had been' over-appraised. The actual fact was that in every year the appraisements were under the correct value. Therefore the growers received the 10 per cent, that had been held back, and also a dividend on account, to bring the total value of the clip up to the appraisement value that had been agreed upon between the United Kingdom Government and the Commonwealth Government. There was also an interesting provision in regard to profits that might arise, chiefly from the re-sale of wool by the United Kingdom Government to other countries. I make it clear that there was no formal agreement between the two governments on this matter. Certain cablegrams passed between the governments which dealt with the various points at issue. It was laid down in regard to re-sales by the United Kingdom Government that half of the profits should go to the United Kingdom Government and half to the Commonwealth Government, hut by no stretch of the imagination could it be argued that the Commonwealth Government could use the money it received for Commonwealth purposes. It was to act as trustee for the Australian wool-growers. It had compelled the Australian wool-growers to hand over their wool. There can be no' such thing as sale and purchase unless there is a free buyer and a free seller. In. this case there was neither. The Commonwealth Government acquired the wool by compulsion, for the simple reason that there was no other way to handle it, and it had had experience of such acquisitions during World War I . In short, a Commonwealth instrumentality was established to administer the scheme. I D connection with the dealings with wool during World War I . the half of the profits which accrued to the Commonwealth Government was paid to the Australian wool-growers in dividends. In regard to skins I - may not be in agreement with some of my colleagues. The skins were acquired by the Commonwealth under National Security Regulations, just as the wool was acquired, and'the owners are entitled to the full realization. I do not know what amount is available for distributioni n respect of dealings in skins.",24
58,Mr LEMMON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"About £2,500,000.",24
59,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"That is due to the fact that skins are in a very different position from wool. As the honourable member for Forrest knows, when the collapse of France occurred the whole position in regard to skins changed i m mediately, for 80 per cent, of Australia's sheepskins were then being purchased by France. The Minister for the A r m y will know something about this subject for when he was Minister for Trade and Customs in the Scullin Government, he perpetrated the dreadful sheepskin embargo. He well knows, to his cost, what happened as the result of his attempt to interfere with the normal course of trade. The right honourable gentleman took this action in order to compel the manufacturers to deal with the sheepskins within Australia. He failed dismally, as every sheep man in Australia knows. On this occasion, with the collapse of France, other means had to be devised to dispose of the skins. Had the Commonwealth said: "" On account of the situation that confronts us as a result of the downfall of France, we shall not interest ourselves in sheepskins"", the value of sheepskins and the price obtainable for them in Australia would have crashed, tremendously; but that did not occur. The Commonwealth rightly continued to exercise control. Now, however, we are asked to agree that a sum said to be £7,000,000other authorities say it is much more than that-shal l be placed in a trust fund, ostensibly for the purposes of the wool grower. ""Whether the amount be £7,000,000 or.£7,000, the legal and moral ownership of it resides in the wool growers of .Australia, and nobody else. When I first saw the bill, I was reminded of the tale of A l i Baba and the Forty Thieves, which I read away back in my school-days. Then, glancing round me, I. came to the conclusion that the number should be about 48. That, however, is by the way. This is merely an indication of the lax, loose method which the Commonwealth Government employs in its handling of what, after all, are trust moneys. A trust account under government control is no more than a polite fiction. If , in private life, any person attempted to deal with .a trust account as the Commonwealth Treasury deals, with this one, he would be given seven years hard labour. I have been associated with trust accounts. The first requirement is that a trust account shall not be used for any purpose other than that for which it is established.",24
60,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"In other words, the honourable gentleman admits that had he done in civil life what he did as a Minister, he would have received seven years hard labour?",25
61,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I have not said that of the Minister. I am talking of the system of government that we now have. If a person in civil life did with trust funds what governments do, he would be given seven years hard labour. Any lawyer, accountant or other person handling trust-moneys will agree that such moneys must be used only for the purposes for which they have been provided. The Commonwealth places all such moneys in a common pool, and uses them to bolster up loans, or for any other purpose it deems necessary for the time being. There is no greater fraud or fiction than that, of a trust fund under Commonwealth administration today, and it is time the matter was cleaned up. The opening remarks of the Minister who introduced the bill (Mr Chifley) were interesting. He said that its purpose is "" to provide for the application of certain moneys which had accumulated in the hands of the Central Wool Committee duryig the war in respect of activities outside the provisions of the Wool Purchase Agreement with the United Kingdom"". That, of itself, shows that the Commonwealth Government recognizes that it has a responsibility outside the Wool Purchase Agreement with the United Kingdom. The question naturally arises, to whom does it owe that responsibility? I claim that the Government is responsible to the growers who produced the wool, and to nobody else, and that those growers are entitled to no less than the full realization value of what the Commonwealth compelled them, under the Constitution, to surrender to it. All the arguing in the world will not enable the Government to get away from that salient fact. I know that we are ""approaching the end of the session; therefore, I do' not want to prolong the debate, and shall say briefly what I think in regard to this matter. The wool-growers of Australia will not accept the Government's contention. They were taxed under Commonwealth law in 1944, at a special rate of 2s. a bale, for the establishment of a research fund, for advertising and for other purposes. Unless the Government proposes to be as extravagant in this matter as with most other matters, it will not be able to use this £7,000,000 for advertising and research. Furthermore, it will be hard put to use, in addition to the 2s. a bale, the interest it would receive if it took the £7.000,000 from the trust fund, as doubtless it will, and invested it in Commonwealth bonds or treasury-bills ",25
62,Mr SCULLY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,It has not collected the 2s. a bale.,26
63,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,A m I to understand that the Wool Tax Act is not to operate?,26
64,Mr SCULLY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,Onl y that part of it which provides for a contribution by the Commonwealth. The other provision has seen suspended. . Mr - ARCHIE CAMERON - That la* is on the statute-book. What right has the Ministry to say that a tax imposed hy this Parliament shall not be colilected ?,26
65,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,The collection of :a bale was suspended by a subsequent act.,26
66,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The whole matter needs much more complete, - careful and detailed examination than is likely to be given to it today. The bill - should not .pass. This money belongs to the wool-growers of Australia, and the passage of any legislation which takes it from them and places it in a fund, trust - or other, is, in my opinion, an unlawful .and immoral act on the part of the Commonwealth Government. ' Mr ADERMANN (Maranoa) [12.6]. - The money with which the bill deals is quite distinct .from that dealt with in the statement of the Minister for Commerce and .Agriculture (Mr Scully) last night, namely, the £20,000,000 from the realization of the wool which accumulated during the war. The definite understanding of all wool-growers is that the whole of the profits from the sales of their wool were to revert to them. 1 appreciate that the £20,000,000 with which the statement of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture dealt' does not represent true profit, because it is a portion only of the realization, and the finalization has yet to be effected. When the final distribution is made, the amount may be £20,000,000, or more or less than that sum. But in regard to the £7,000,000 with which this bill deals, I submit that the contention of the honourable member, for Forrest (Mr Lemmon), that it should go to fell-mongers who may have made the sales, is entirely erroneous.",26
67,Mr LEMMON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,I said that it could not go to them.,26
68,Mr ADERMANN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The honourable gentleman said that difficulty would be experienced in the distribution of it, but if regard were had to legal rights, those were the persons to whom the payments should . be made. That is entirely erroneous, because' the whole of the' wool was acquired by the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) has correctly stated the position. I submit that the sales of wool that-are represented by the'money dealt with by this bill are, in a sense, miscellaneous sales, and were included in the total quantity embraced by the wool 2s. acquisition scheme, which is now being handled by the Joint Organization. That organization is in the same category a? a company which sells to a subsidiary the by-products of the commodity with which it deals. Ultimately, all the profits of both the main and the subsidiary company revert to the producers of the commodity. Undoubtedly, the reasons for distribution stated in the bill are commendable, btit in the right connection. We are dealing with a commodity that has been requiredto make a contribution, which rightly should be made by the Government, to the uplift of the industry. I do not suggest that the great wool industry should not make a contribution to such matters as publicity and scientific research; because I defy anyone except an expert to distinguish between clothes made from whole-fibre and those made from whole wool. The . competition of the former cannot be regarded lightly. The Minister has stated hy way of - interjection that the payment of 2s. a bale has been suspended. I point out, however, that the contribution that has to be made in connection with the marketing of wool by the Joint Organization is greater than the tax which it was intended should be placed on the industry, because it amounts to 5 per cent. If this £7,000,000 were diverted to the payment of the contribution to the Joint Organization, it would be sufficient for two years, because 5 per cent, on the average income of the industry, which is - £70,000,000 a year, would be £3,500,000.' In that way, the wool-growers could be assisted directly. H^wpver. the Government has cho, en to c adopt another method, which corresponds with, that which it has adopted in connection with the wheat and other industries. I shall support any proposal, for the payment of this money to the growers, because it rightly belongs to them. Acquisition involves rights. In this matter, the rights have been correctly stated by the honourable member for Barker. It has been stated on behalf of the Government that there has not yet been any trade in the terms of paragraph e of clause 6, which readsRegulating or assisting the marketing, or stabilizing the price, of wool by the purchase of wool or by other means. That, obviously, gives to the Government the right to use this money for trade purposes if it so desires. Tho Government would have shown itself to be sincere had it not embodied that provision in the bill, - because it covers trading in the fullest sense. The drought conditions that have prefrom vailed throughout the industry, particupose larly in Queensland, merit more pounded sympathetic consideration than has been given by the Government, which should endeavour to make whatever payments it can to the wool-growers in order that they may be relieved of some of the heavy losses they have incurred. In respect cotton and wheat, the Government withof out prior intimation withheld moneys belonging to the industry. In this inaccrued, stance, it is filching money from the growersof wool, and diverting it to a purpose profit. that is suited to its own designs, at a time when the growers badly need help. I shall support any amendment designed to secure the distribution of this among the growers.",26
69,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Indi) [12.13] - There is nothing novel in this measure - I represents merely a further "" steal "" from another section of primary producers.",27
70,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,The honourable gentlewool. man is an expert in that connection.,27
71,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The Government has established quite clearly the principle, if it can properly be so described, .that has been applied in connection with wool-growers. this matter. It has completely abandoned the old-fashioned idea a man invests his capital and labour. ' takes risks, and produces something, that something is his. That idea has 'stood the test of time. Yet in the .few years during which the Labour party .has occupied the treasury bench, it has substituted for that principle this new idea, that when a free Australian produces a commodity, and the circumstances of war require that the Government shall arbitrarily take possession of it, the owner is to be regarded 'as having :no real equity in it, but is to be given only what the Government, in accordance with its political idealogies or idiosyn? crasies, considers is good enough for him. The Government may or may not throw a tit-bit to him later on. It. is time the primary producers understood the fate which awaits them if Australia is to be afflicted much longer with a Labour government. Many arguments have been advanced about the ownership of-money derived the sale of this wool. I do not proto go over again what.has been exwith such undeniable logic by my colleagues. The price for skin wool from fellmongers was arbitrarily fixed, and the question is, who is to be regarded as the person entitled to any subsequent - profit. The butcher or the fellmonger of bought the skins on a clear understanding the value of the wool as declared by the Government. Then certain profit but no one has said that the fell. monger is entitled to this fortuitous",27
72,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,It has been suggested.,27
73,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"It is true that the money honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Lemmon), without being named, immediately accepts responsibility for the suggestion. However, there can be no quest tion of the fellmonger being entitled to the profit. It must belong either to the Government or to those who grew the , Mr Dedman - The original owners of the sheep from which the skins came. - Mr MCEWEN - I would have thought that such persons could be described as",27
74,Mr DFTWAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,But they are a particuthat when lar kind of wool-growers.,27
75,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"They are wool growers. I did not think that I would, have to make such an elementary explanation, but I remind the Minister that sheep skins are taken off sheep which are raised by wool-growers. We do not get sheep skinsoff trees, but off sheep, and sheep are raised by wool-growers.",28
76,Mr SCULLY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"How would the honourable member work it out if the man who raised the sheep sold a flock to someone else, who then sold it to another person who finally sold the sheep to a butcher? Who would get the skin money?",28
77,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"We are not here to put riddles to . each other, but to do justice to the producers, and I am not going to be deflected from my purpose by questions of that sort. Let the Minister put them to the "" Quiz Kids "". This is a serious matter.' If the Minister believes that he can establish a case by tricky parliamentary practices, which will' justify the Government in refusing to pay the original sheep owners what they are entitled to, he may succeed here, with the help of his majority, will not convince the wider audience outside' this Parliament. Just as the logic of the case which we have advanced in regard to skin wool is unequivocally clear, so it is in regard to wool from noils, and the wool content of manufactured goods. Of - course, I do not expect that argument from this side of the chamber will make any impression on the Government, which is notorious for never having accepted any amendment or suggestion from the Opposition. I know that I am merely beating the air so far as anything I may say can affect this bill, but I know also that the wooj-growers will formulate an opinion on the subject which they will translate into action - at the forthcoming elections. The Government will crash this bill - through Parliament as - it has done with other measures, but in spite of that, it will feel that there is a cold breeze blowing when its. representatives face the electors in a short while. The wool-growers have a claim to this money - on grounds of simple equity, and on what used to pass for justice in this country, 'but at this time they have special need - of the money because they have suffered the effects of a devastating drought. It is calculated that, in Victoria, sheep flocks have declined from 20,000,000 to 14,000,000 in the last year. In New South Wales and Queensland, one of the most disastrous droughts ever known is raging now. The wool-growers are at their wits' end to carry on under such conditions, and they confidently expected that, sooner or later, they would be paid for the wool they grew. . It will be poor consolation for them to learn that their £7,000,000 will be used at the discretion of the Government for research or publicity purposes, or for stabilizing prices, or for almost any reason that the Minister thinks fit. I warn the Government that the policy implicit in this proposal cannot be sustained when the Australian people have an opportunity to express their will. If Australia is not to degenerate into a socialist state we must get back to the simple principle that what a man produces by the sweat of his brow, or by the investment of his own savings, is his, and shall not be seized but he by any government and disposed of by caucus behind closed doors in the manner deemed to be best in the interests of the party.",28
78,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [12.25] - No amount of debate on this subject will, presumably, make it clear to the Opposition that the Government is doing a fair and just thing with the money under discussion. The mere fact that honourable members opposite, one after the other, have said that the money belongs to the wool-growers, does not make the statement true. Mere repetition does not make any statement true. . If one considers the origin of this.fund it becomes evident that the wool-growers have no claim to the money at all. The point was discussed very fully by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Lemmon). The money in the fund was derived from three different sources,' the first being skin wool. The honourable member for Forrest pointed out that if anyone had a claim to the profit which accrued from the sale of this wool it would be the person who had owned the sheep whose skins were sold to the skin buyers. However, honourable members opposite suggest that the money should be distributed to all wool-growers, throughout Australia. It might have been possible in the early stages, if the - Government led by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) had evolved a plan whereby the ownership of the skins could he traced, to pay the profit to individual owners of the sheep from which the skins were taken. However, the right honourable gentleman knew perfectly well that such a scheme would be extremely difficult to put into effect. Therefore, he made a clear statement in which he said that the price paid for wool from skins would be the final price, and that no addition to that price would be made at any later stage. The P-rime Minister (Mr Chifley), in the course of a statement on the subject, also made the position clear. He said that when the wool purchase arrangement was commenced in 1939, it was announced hy the then Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) .that wool from sheep skins would not participate in any subsequent division of profit, and that the price paid at the time would be' the final and only price. That statement was not qualified in any way. If anyone is to blame for the non-payment of this £7,000,000 to the persons who raised the sheep from which the skins came, it is the Leader of the Opposition for failing to put into effect a suitable plan at the beginning. There are two other sources from which the £7,000,000 is derived. Certain profits were made in respectof wool-tops exported from Australia, and certain sums accumulated from the export of manufactured woollen goods on which manufacturers had to pay to the Central Wool Committee a. sum equivalent to the difference between the appraised price for wool and the export price fixed by the British Government. In respect of wool used for the manufacture of cloth and exported from this country, the growers were paid the appraised price, plus a supplementary amount which is paid at the end of every year.",28
79,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"That is incorrect, and posed to be expended. the Minister knows it.",29
80,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"It is not. The vested, growers who owned the wool which 4023 used for the manufacture of wool-tops, converted into cloth and finally exported from Australia, were paid the full price for their wool.* How then can anything more be due to them? Honourable members opposite refuse to be convinced on this matter because they are determined to use the proposal to further their own political purposes. There is absolutely no logic in their opposition to the bill; the reasons they have submitted as to why the money should be returned to the wool growers will not bear examination. At least two Australian Country party members pictured a very depressing scene, claiming that thousands of wool-growers are suffering badly from the effects of drought and that if only this money were paid to the growers they would be able to buy new equipment and re-stock their properties. What are the facts? If this money were distributed among the growers at least one-half of them would get the large amount of £2 10s. each. How could they equip their farms and buy new stock with that? It is true that a smallnumber of growers would get a large sum of money, but, even if they did, a considerable portion of it would go back to the Treasury by way of taxes. If the Government desired to derive financial benefit from the existence of this fund, the best thing it could do would be to pay the money to the growers and collect the greater part of it in taxes.",29
81,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,How ' does the Minis: ter arrive at the figure of £2 10s.?,29
82,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) has made his speech; I am now making mine. The accuracy of any statement. I have made in this chamber has never been challenged. The honourable member may rest assured that when I make a statement it is true, as this one is. Honourable members opposite concentrated on the question of research in the use of wool, saying that it would not be possible to expend purely on research in a short space of time the large sum of money lying to the credit of the fund. There are six avenues through which this money* is proThe proceeds of the fund are, however, to be inand it is expected that the income was will amount to between £200,000 and £250,000 per annum. The amount standing to the credit of the wool fund will be supplemented by moneys collected under the Wool Use Promotion Act, which amount to approximately £325,000 per annum, and will be used for research, publicity and other purposes as set out in clause 6 of the bill. I propose to deal specifically with the subject of research. The estimates of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for the current financial year include an amount of £453,000 for research in wool production and textiles. It is obvious, therefore, that research may absorb quite a large amount ,of money. Expenditure by the council for that purpose will be undertaken whencomplete investigations' of the benefits which may or may not be derived from such research have been estimated. Theresearch programme of the council in respect of wool has been discussed by the Wool Consultative Council on which have been appointed two members of the Wool Board. When the wool-growers met representatives of the Government in conference on this matter - and contended that they had no say in the expenditure of this money, it was pointed out to them that the two members of the Wool Board on the Wool Consultative Council would assist in ' advising the Government as to what research should be undertaken. The growers, however, still maintained that they did not have - sufficient representation, whereupon the Government agreed to co-opt two additional growers to serve on the Wool Consultative Council when matters relating to the research programme were under consideration. It is, therefore, not true to say that the wool-growers have not been consulted about the research programme. It is a fact that the growers claimed that if they could exert sufficient pressure upon the Government they might be able to secure for themselves the money now in the fund. That, after all is but human nature. '",29
83,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,And honesty.,30
84,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"My sense of honesty is just as highly developed as that of the honourable member. It is understandable that when the growers saw so much money accumulated - in a fund they should desire to secure it for their own use. I point out, however, that a largeportion of the money has accrued from the trading enterprise of the Government and rightfully belongs to the Government, but the Treasurer has been generous ; realizing, that the wool industry is of the greatest importance to Australia, he has decided to use the money for research and the promotion of the use of wool. The view held by the Government on this subject is shared by at least one leadingmember of the Wool Board. The expenditure of this money as proposed in the bill - will benefit the wool industry generally and will confer' benefits on in: dividual growers .greater than could be obtained by them if it, were handed over to them.

That, in sub-clause (1.), the words ""may be invested by the Treasurer in securities of the Commonwealth or of a State "" lie left out with A view to insert in lien thereof the following words:- "" shall be invested by the Treasurer in Australian Consolidated Stock "". I do so because the clause empowers the Treasurer to invest the money standing to the credit of the ""Wool Industry Fund in securities of the Commonwealth or of a State. The securities of the Commonwealth include treasury-bills, but,- as has already been amply demonstrated in the second-reading debate, the money in the fund ought to be invested to the greatest possible advantage and on the most solid basis. Money in various trust funds of the Commonwealth is invested in consolidated stock, but the money in the National Welfare Fund is invested in treasury-bills, which are nothing hut I OU ' s carrying an interest rate of £1 per cent, and - renewable annually, PAIBS. whereas the interest on Commonwealth bonds varies from 3£ to 4 per cent - We on this side of the chamber have not been candidly told where the money referred to in this bill is. About £7,000,000 is involved. The Treasurer told me that the money had not been used for the purposes of the Commonwealth Government, that is, placed in the Consolidated Revenue or a trust fund. Where is it then? If it is in .the hands of the Australian Wool t Realization Commission established under the Wool Realization Act 1945 what has been done with it? I understand, however, that it has been paid to the Commonwealth Government, and, if so, it must have gone into Consolidated Revenue and is con-equently not available; but, if it is to be unwisely invested in treasury-bills, the money will be placed temporarily in a trust' fund and then withdrawn and replaced by treasury bills, carrying interest of only £1 per' cent., which must be renewed every twelve months. If the money is not to be given back to the growers, to whom it legally and morally belongs, it should be invested in consolidated stock.",31
87,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Corio-Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [2.25] - The Government cannot accept the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden). The right honourable gentleman asks where the money is. It is still in the hands of the Australian Wool Realization Commission. That fact could be gathered from the bill by anv one who took the trouble to read it . Sub-clause 1 ,of clause 4 readsThe Australian Wool Realization Commission . . . may pay to the Treasurer* pi the Commonwealth any moneys . . . Obviously, it cannot pay money to the Treasurer unless it has it . The right honourable gentleman ought to know that sub-clause 1 of clause 5, which he wishes to amend in order to direct the Treasurer to invest the money in Commonwealth consolidated stock, contains the stereotvred proH»ion for investing trust funds. Tie' gave as his reason' for moving' the amendment that he wanted to be certain that the money invested by the Treasurer would' earn the highest possible rate of interest, f tbink it ridiculous, and I think the people will agree, that he should try to tell a Treasurer with the record that the present Treasurer (Mr Chifley) has - arned by his careful husbandry of public funds how he should invest money. The Leader of the Australian Country party is trying to teach his grandmother to suck eggs. The Government will not accept the amendment, and the committee may rest assured that the Treasurer will invest the money in the best possible'way.",31
88,Mr HUTCHINSON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Deakin) [2.27]. - The refustl of the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) to accept the amendment is inexplicable. He described the amendment as ridiculous, and said that the Treasurer would invest the money in the best possible way; but, if . it is to be invested in securities of the Commonwealth, surely consolidated stock would be a more profitable investment than treasury-billsj because of the much higher return. The only reason why the Minister refuses to accept the amendment is his obstinacy. He said that the money was not in the hands of the Treasury, but in the hands of the Australian Wool Realization Commission. If that is so, I should like to know whether it has been invested by the commission, and, if so, how. In moving the second reading of this bill, the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr. Chifley) gave a table of amounts totalling £6,650,000, which he said were held by the commission. I regret that the right honourable gentleman is not here to consider this matter himself.",32
89,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,I can give the committee all the information.,32
90,Mr HUTCHINSON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The Prime Minister and Treasurer has-the bad habit of coming into this chamber and reading statements prepared for him' by public servants. Then this great Treasurer, conveniently for himself, scuttles out of the chamber because he has not the stamina to stand up to criticism. That has been his record ever since he has been Treasurer. We want to know whether the' money is invested, and, if so, where it is invested. The Treasurer mentioned £7,000,000 as being the probable total of excess funds that are to be applied in accordance with the provisions of this bill. Unfortunately, all the second-reading debate revolved around that amount, but I think £8,000,000 would be nearer the mark. Last April the Minister for Post;-war Reconstruction gave us to understand that the difference between £6,500,000 and £7,000,000 was represented by interest, thus indicating that the money is invested; but where is it invested ? If we knew that we should know whether the Treasurer, without the instruction to him contained in the amendment, is likely to invest the money wisely. We should also have an indication of whether the Australian Wool Realization Commission is a wise'investor. The purpose of the amendment is to instruct the Government to invest these moneys to the best possible advantage. If the Minister refuses toaccept the amendment, the people will come to the sorry conclusion that.the Government is obdurate and will-not agree to any reasonable "" proposal put forward by the Opposition.",32
91,Mr BURKE,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Perth) [2.31] --The ability and integrity of the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) require no defence against the imputations of the honourable member for' Deakin - (Mr Hutchinson). The honourable member did a grave injustice to my leader when he cast' an unwarranted reflection upon him, and he deserves to be reproved for it. In ability, he is not able to hold a candle to this great and outstanding Australian. The Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) used a method of financial reasoning which he has from time to time adopted. Hiscontentions revealed a lack of elementary knowledge of financial procedure, or an unwillingness honestly to propound the views in which he believes. He said that"" this money should be invested in consolidated stock, and not in what he disparagingly referred to as IO U's, namely, treasury-bills. Of course, the right honourable gentleman knows that the reason for the low rate of interest on treasury-bills is that these balances are virtually cash. The factors that decide interest rates are, first, the security behind the promise to pay, and secondly, the knowledge that if the money is required from time to time, the full .amount of the investment may be obtained' without loss or brokerage fees in cashing the security. Based on those two procedures the interest rate of 1 per cent, on treasury-bills compares very favourably, as evidenced by the willingness of the Commonwealth Bank and the private trading banks to accept this security, with Commonwealth ordi, nary loans for periods of five, ten, or fifteen years, and even longer. The security behind both classes of' stock is the same. The reason why the interest rate on treasury-bills is comparatively .low is that the owner of funds loses control of the money for a purely limited period. The rate of interest is higher, on - other Government securities, because the owner of the money or the holder and - controller of a fund loses control of it for-a much longer period.' For these reasons, the rate of 1 per cent, on treasurystated bills is as valuable a return as a slightly higher rate paid for a long-term security. - Certain other considerations arise. One person may invest in consolidated stock because he'wants the interest. Another person maydesire to use the principal as and when the need arises. If the investor wants to use the interest only, the original investment should be made for a long term at the higher rate of interest. If the investor is uncertain as to when and how the principal will be required, he naturally will invest in a security which, does not tie up his money for a long period, or involve any 'sacrifice of principal in the. cashing of the security. Therefore, the argument of the right honourable gentle- man is completely hollow, displaying, not perhaps a lack of knowledge, but, more reprehensihly, an unwillingness to support openly a principle in which he believes, frle has attempted to deceive the. people about what he knows to be the actual facts. From time to time, the right honourable gentleman has said that the National ""Welfare Fund, the balance* of which are invested in treasury-bills, is bankrupt. Presumably, if the funds provided for in that measure are invested in treasury-bills) the right honourable gentleman will once again say that the fund is bankrupt. It is true that he interjected on one occasion when I was speaking, that he referred to the fund being bankrupt of ready cash. That contention is no more justifiable or valid, because if investment in treasury-bills, the evidence of which holding are the treasury-bills themselves, is proof of bankruptcy either of cash or assets, by the same reasoning, the person who holds a. deposit in a bank, the only evidence of which is a hank pass-book and the entry therein; is also bankrupt of ready cash and principal. If the holding of treasury-bills is evidence of bankruptcy or even of an immediate lack of cash, 1 would be content to be bankrupt to tht extent of an unlimited volume of treasurvbills. '",32
92,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"New England) [2.37]. - The amendment which the Leader of the Australian Country party (MT . Fadden) submitted relates to the amount which the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) in his second-reading speech to be £7,000,000, but which it now admitted to be £8,000,000. The Government refuses to pay that money to the legitimate owners, the wool-growers of Australia. Its attitude is contrary to all logic and reason.",33
93,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,The honourable mem-' ber's remarks are not related to the clause.,33
94,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"My remarks are very pertinent to the clause. If this Government is defeated a few weeks hence, honesty will prevail, and the growers will receive the amount of £8,000,000 which belongs to them, but which is being filched from them under this proposal. The amendment is designed to provide that the money, while in the fund, shall be invested at the most advantageous rates pending the time that the Government is dismissed, so that honesty may prevail and the money be returned to its legitimate owners. The purpose of the Leader of the Australian Country party is to ensure that these funds shall be invested in consolidated stock, and the interest payable on them shall be at the highest rate possible for this class of investment. I remind the legitimate owners of these funds, the Australian wool-growers, that if the money is invested in treasury bills, the interest rate will be 1 per cent, as compared with the' rate of 4 per cent, which it could earn in consolidated stock. An amount of £53,000,000, which belongs to the Xational ""Welfare Fund, has been invested in Commonwealth treasury-bills at 1 per cent., the interest amounting to £530,000 a year. If it had been invested in consolidated stock at 4 per cent - the rate at which, we contend, the wool growers' money should be invested-the return would exceed £2,000,000. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke) drew a distinction between the rate of interest payable on treasury-bills and that payable on investments for long terms. This amount of £7,000,000 cannot possibly be expended in the directions which the* Minister (Mr Dedman) indicated., for a considerable time, even though the most rapacious, wasteful .and dishonest Government that Australia has ever experienced has its hands on the money. This is a story which shows the stark dishonesty of this Government. The point regarding the value of the-investment of this money in consolidated .stock, which the honourable member for Perth so skilfully evaded, is that this stock is selling at par rates, and can he maintained at a par rate of value through the open market operations of the Commonwealth Bank. That institution is controlled by the Government, from which i*. receives its instructions. Therefore, the bank may contract or expand credit, and by its actions, can affect the interest rate on all Government stocks. There is not the slighest danger of the interest rates on long term Commonwealth securit ies falling so long as the central bank prepared to maintain them. The honourable member for Perth told a very poor story indeed to the wool-growers, in his endeavour to convince them that they will receive the proper rate of interest on their funds. I contend that the interest rate should be 4 per cent. Then, if the wool-growers never receive the capital amount in the fund, they will at least get considerably more benefit from the higher interest rate than they will from the mean return of 1 per cent.",33
95,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"""Who said that the funds will be invested at 1 per cent.?",34
96,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I ask the Minister not to interrupt me. He is endeavouring to prevent me from telling, the truth to the people. The whole of the arrangement contemplated in this bill creates a feeling of deep suspicion in the minds, not only of wool-growers, but of all primary producers. ""What has happened to one primary industry can happen' to others. The wool-growers' funds have been filched from them. ""We do not know where this policy of the Government will end. ""When the bill to take over the accumulated stocks of wool was introduced, we were assured that the wool growers would pay only a very small contributory charge. But in the first year of operation, the amount of the contributory charge was fixed at 5 per cent., or five times greater than the wool growers expected. Goodness knows what charge the Government will fix in the seoond year! The progression of charges in respect of this fund reminds me of the progress of Ned Kelly, during last century, when he took the funds of private individuals and applied them to his own purposes. That is exactly what the Government is doing .today. I strongly support the amendment, first, because it will ensure the. better investment of the fund; and secondly, because it will keep the money out of the hands of the Government. I fear that if this' considerable sum be not invested in Commonwealth, or State consolidated stock, the Government may divert it .from the use to which, even within the terms of this bill, it should be applied.",34
97,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Barker) [2.46] - The honourable member for is Perth (Mr Burke) referred to treasury bills. These ' are a fluid security. In fact, they remind me ""of Micawber. Honourable gentlemen will recollect that, when Micawber signed a promissory note in settlement of a debt he remarked, '(Thank God, that's settled"". The Commonwealth Government is in much the same position. A return which was made available to me only yesterday indicated that treasury-bills valued at £344,000,000 were in circulation in Australia at .the 30th June, 1946.",34
98,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,There is nothing about treasury-bills in this clause.,34
99,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The clause. provides that the fund may be invested by the Treasurer in Commonwealth or State securities. Does the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction say that treasury-hills do not fall within that, category ?",34
100,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"They may; nevertheless, treasury-bills are not mentioned in - the clause:.",35
101,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"They were referred to by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke). Do honourable .gentlemen opposite not consider that the wool-growers would be much more satisfied with the proposal that we have made, and with adherence to the arrangement - of February, 1940, than with the proposal of the Government? At present this fund can be invested in any way the - Government desires, but the income from the investment should be paid into the t fund . There is a big difference, I point out, between the returns from investments in treasury-bills, _ which are short-dated - securities, and the returns from longdated securities.

The object of the amendment is to ensure that the £7,000,000 odd standing to the credit of the fund, which really belongs to the wool-growers, shall be distributed among them in the manner set out. There is precedent for dealing with a surplus of this description in this way, for .the surplus in the sheep-skin account in connection with the wool. disposal scheme of 1916-20 was distributed by this method, and the wool-growers offered no objection to it. There is no reason to suppose that they would object to the distribution that I am 'now proposing.. Honourable gentlemen opposite, including the Minister in charge of the bill, have said that it would be impracticable to distribute this money equitably among all growers entitled to participate in such - a distribution. I disagree. I believe.. that if the money were distributed according to the proposal I have made the growers would be satisfied.",35

105,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Richmond) [2.59] T move That the clause be postponed, as an instruction to the Governmentthat steps be taken to distribute the money in this fund in the form of refunds to the growers of Australia to whom it properly belongs. It is noteworthy that during the five years of its existence this Government has displayed from time to time a flagrant disregard of the financial rights of certain sections of the primary producers. We have heard during the last few weeks of the disbursement of certain money which belonged to the wheat growers. I have also been informed that millions of pounds belonging to the butter producers has been wrongly diverted from them. Now, we have this blatant withholding of £7,000,000 from the wool-growers of Australia.

109,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Interjection s of that character are the stock-in-trade of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr. Bryson)' and his colleagues. . The wool growers of Australia deserve more consideration than does any other section of the community^ They have neither asked for nor received anything from the Government. No subsidy has ever been paid to. the wool industry, as has been paid to many other industries. It has not the benefit of any tariff protection. By means of the export of wool, funds, The are established overseas which enable us to import petrol, rubber, and other commodities which the civil population of Australia needs so badly. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), in reply to a question that I asked recently, said that a lessening of the restrictions imposed in respect of petrol depended on the dollar position. Both the dollar and the sterling position depend upon the export of our wool. No bounty is sought by the wool-grower. All that he asks is that woolhe shall receive the money which has come into the possession of the Government, acting .as his agent, as the result of the sale of his wool. Certain payments have been made to the wool growers under the contract that was made with the United Kingdom Government. Out of the realization of certain wool, an average price of 15^d. per lb. has been paid. That average price has not been received by every grower. Naturally, some growers have received more, and others less. Adjustments have been made from time to time, and these have been reflected in, the funds of the Central Wool Committee - But this other fund has been. established as the result of the sales of Nskins, wool-tops, and the wool exported in the form of manufactured goods. It cannot be claimed that the Government has invested any funds, or established any machinery, for the promotion of the sales which have resulted in the accumulation of this excess profit of £7,000,000. The money has come into its possession under the terms of the wool purchase arrangement with Great. Britain. It is a huge sum. Had it been collected from the earnings of the bers of various trade unions, the vernment would not have had the courage to propose that it should be. diverted Consolidated Eevenue. The wool-grower should, not be treated differently from any other working man in Australia. Perrevert haps the hardest worked man in this country, particularly in times of drought and shearing, is the wool-grower. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) represents the big woolfeed growing division of Gwydir.",36
110,Mr SOULLT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,The number of sheep that I represent exceeds the number bananas in the electorate of the honorfinancing able member.,37
111,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Exactly . On the northern tablelands of New South Wales in my electorate, in the districts of Ennis, Tenterfield and Deepwater, the number of wool-growers is fairly siderable. The northern part of the elecknowledge torate represented by the Minister passing through a disastrous drought. the last week or so, the press has lished pictures showing the losses of and other stock that have been sustained.",37
112,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,What has that matter to do with the committee?,37
113,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The committee is they interested in the fact that an amount of £7,000,000, which cannot by any stretch Revenue. of the imagination be claimed to belong to the Government, is indirectly to become its property by means of this legislation. On top of what happened to money belonging to the wheat-grower, and that which should have gone to the butter producer, this treatment of the wool-grower is a scandal of first - magnithe tude. It is easy for the Government say lightly, ""We will take'£7,000,000 belonging to somebody else"", but it is difficult for an Opposition so small number as we are to prevent that action. We can merely raise our voices in protest, in the hope that, when another governtook ment assumes office, this legislation be repealed. The Labour party has the reins of office for five years. I first year, or two years, it was most solicitous for the welfare of the"""" primary producers. Everything that it said did was designed to establish its intense sympathy for those men. But memthat sympathy has languished more and Gomore with every day that has passed. The stage has now been reached at which to the Government is so arrogant as to believe that it can ' dispense' with the support of the primary producers, and to its real policy. It believes that it can take £7,000,000, which properlybelongs to men and women in the droughtstricken areas of Australia, who have to resort to financial institutions to obtain for their. stock, upon which their industry depends. I am not acquainted with their circumstances individually, ncr is the Government, but I do of know that very many of them are operations through banking institutions. Every honourable member who represents a wool-growing district knows that the 30-called "" big man"" is Glen frequently "" up to his neck"" in debt. That applies not only to the big man conbut also to the small man. I have of the circumstances of many is of these individuals. Over the years, In they have not had uniformly prosperous pubtimes. I expected a ministerial supsheep porter to interject, "" What did your Government do ?"" or something of the kind. Whatever criticism may be levelled at preceding 'governments, at least it can be said that did not take money belonging to the wool-grower, and place it in Consolidated Mr CLARK. (Darling) [3.10] - The mournful dirge of members of the Australian Country party indicates that they are suffering pre-election jitters. By their characteristic gross, misrepresentation of facts they are trying to mislead wool-growers and other primary proto ducers of this country. They are not doing that innocently. Let us analyse dispassionately the wool realization agree in ment. We .must remember that, at the outbreak of the last war, an arrangement was made whereby Great Britain underto take over, the whole of Atistralia's will wool production for the period of the held war and one season thereafter. Then the Minister for Commerce who signed that agreement was the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir. Earle Page), a and prominent member of the Australian Country party, which was then an appendage of the Government. Members of the Opposition fully realise, that theagreementdefinitely provides that any profits on the sale of unprocessed wool were to become a part - of the. profits of the scheme and be divisible among the various wool-growers. But the arrangement. also provided that Any profits from the sale of processed or partly-processed wool were not to be - regarded as profits that should' be divided under the scheme. The . substantial profits that were made during the war from the sales of wool tops and other partially-treated wool did not come into the scheme. The profits made in Great Britain were regarded as the property of the Government of the United King-dom, and, I assume, were paid into the British treasury: The profits on the sale - of wool processed and partly-processed in Australia were not regarded as profits under the scheme. Therefore, the statement that any funds derived in that way should be divided among the producers is gross misrepresentation of the facts. As a matter of fact, skin wools were specially excluded from the scheme, and the growers were not entitled to share in the profits that were made when - they were sold. It is quite definite that they cannot claim a share of the profits from the sale of processed articles. The Government,' but for its magnanimity, - could have paid the whole of this amount into Consolidated Revenue. It would have been quite - justified in ' doing so, because the fund was not associated in any way with the profits that were made under the arrangement. But the Government has set the money aside for the assistance of the wool-growers. Paragraph a of clause 6 provides that the money may be used forScientific, economic and cost research in connection wit h the production and use of wool, and goods made wholly or partly from wool. Research on those lines must be helpful to the wool industry. Before the war, we heard much about the danger of synthetic fibres to our wool industry, so that the ""Government cannot be blamed for expending money on research to enable wool to compete effectively with synthetic fibres. The clause also provides for the expenditure of money on the promotion by publicity and other means of the use of wool in Australia and throughout the Mr Clark. world. I have recently had an opportunity to see what is being done in the way of such publicity in London, and I am sure that the wool industry will benefit by the expenditure of money on these lines. We have been told that those interested in the manufacture of synthetic fibres are prepared to spend millions of pounds on publicity. Therefore, we must be prepared to meet this competition. Paragraph a of the clause provides for regulating or assisting the marketing or stabilizing of. the price of wool. Paragraph 6 (/) is in these termsThe provision of temporary relief for the wool industry in such circumstances and under such conditions as the Treasurer, after consultation with the Ministers, thinks just; That is a very wide provision. If it is thought fit, the Government may us*: some of this money to assist wool-growers. It is evident,. therefore, that the money will be expended to the great advantage of the whole industry. It is misrepresentation to say that the amount of £7,000,000 is the property of the wool growers. It never was their property, because it was placed outside the provisions of the arrangement entered into by the Australian Country party with the Government of Great Britain. Mr Archie . CAMERON - I - was not a member of the Government which made the arrangement, nor was. any member of the Australian Country party.",37
114,Mr CLARK,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page), claims that he was a member of the Government at that time. As I have said, the agreement specifically excluded skin wool, and honourable members opposite are endeavouring, by gross misrepresentation, to. mislead the people.",38
115,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Barker) [3.20] - If the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) chooses to enter this debate he should at least stick to the facts. I am not at present a member of the Australian Country party, and it is inaccurate to say that the Australian Country party entered into the agreement under discussion. No member of the Australian Country party was in the Government at that time. In fact, it was not an agreement in the ordinary sense of the word, but simply an arrangement based upon an exchange of cablegrams between the two governments. I am prepared, if necessary, to second the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony). No wider powers could be given to any government for the disposal of money than this Government assumes in regard to the fund of £7,000,000. For instance, in paragraph a it seeks power to use the money forScientific, economic and cost research in nexion with the production and use of wool and goods made wholly or partly from wool; Thus, the money may be expended upon promoting the use, not only of goods, made wholly of wool, but also of goods made partly of wool. There is nothing prevent the Government from using this money for research into rayon, or other synthetic fibres, or for research into the useof cotton, because it is much used for mixing with wool. Indeed, under the Paragraph / statesterms of this provision, the Government could set up a factory for the production of rayon. Paragraph p says that the such money, may be used for the provision of all things necessary for, or essential the carrying out of such research, and paragraph c statesThe co-ordination and application of the results of any such researcli; Just what that means we might find out tives by calling a meeting of all the professors in the Department of Post-war Reconposed struction and asking them for an opinion. [ know of no other way. Paragraph d as follows: The promotion by publicity and other means of the use of wool in Australia and. throughout the world;",38
116,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,There is nothing wrong with that.,39
117,Mr ARCHIECAMERO N,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The the first vote for the Department of Informatio has grown from £22,000 a few years to £320,000 for this year. The taxpayers can only view with horror the prospect posed to. expend this money? of handing £7,000,000 over to any vernment department for publicity purregard poses. The department might even publish books telling prospective migrants ro Australia that they can buy suits of clothes here for 6W. It is a wonder that some of the publicity issued by the Minisa ter for Information (Mr Calwell) does not make him blush. It is typical of kind of bombast delivered by Faust in his address to the Almighty. The next paragraph is as follows:Regulating or assisting the marketing, or stabilizing the price, of wool by the purchaseof wool or by other means. This bill proposes to take £7,000,000,. Robin Hood fashion, from the growers, and to hand it over to other persons who' conare to be charged, apparently, with assisting in the marketing of.wool, or in the stabilization of the price of wool. Only last year, the Government introduced certain legislation, and explained that it was necessary because stocks of wool wereto held which it would take fourteen years to dispose of. Of what use is it now toestablish a fund for the purchase of wool when we already have so much that it will take us fourteen years to dispose of it?' The provision of temporary relief for the wool industry in such circumstances and under .conditions as the Treasurer, after con' sultation with the Ministers, thinks just; to, Elsewhere, the ""Ministers."" are defined as the Minister for Commerce and Agri culture, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, and the Minister in charge of"" Scientific and Industrial Research. . Thiscommittee of the House of Representais supposed to exercise full control over .the nation's finances; yet it is proto hand over to a committee of three Ministers the right to dispose of is £7,000,000 which does not morally or legally belong to them. They may apply the money in many directions, including the temporary relief of the wool industry in such circumstances as they think just. The honourable member'for Darling must surely have problems in his electorate, particularly in regard to re-stocking. In . place, it is practically impossible n to buy stock, and those which are obtainago able fetch a very high price. ""Why does not the Minister explain how it is proRelief Gomeasures have been brought down into other industries, notably the wheat industry, and their provisions have always been carefully explained. Here, however, we are asked to authorize a committee of Ministers to expend money from fund of £7,000,000 for the relief of thewool industry,, under such conditions and the in such circumstances as the Ministersthink just. However, the richest part of the whole proposal is in paragraph ;', which reads .as follows:In meeting, in whole or in part, any ultimate Bowden, GJloss to which the Commonwealth may be subjected by reason of its participation in the disposals plan set forth in the Schedule to the Wool Realization Act 1945. The Wool Realization Act is the one under which the Government hopes to dispose, within a period of fourteen years, of the present accumulation of wool. In effect, the Government now says that if it bungles the disposal of this wool, it will recoup itself out of the fund of £7,000,000 that rightly belongs wool-growers. This paragraph is the finest piece of political impertinence that I have ever seen. If the Minister for Information can convince the growers of the justice of the Government's proposal, 1 he deserves a crown of gold adorned with platinum. However, I doubt that even he would try to explain to the wool growers that they should feel satisfied in having £7,000,000 filched from theni, and used, for the purposes' set forth in clause 6'.

118,Mr MOUNTJOY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Swan) [8.40] - It was not my intention to speak on this clause hecause I thought the purposes to which the fund was to he devoted had been explained very lucidly by honourable members on this side of the chamber. T would have been prepared to leave the matter to the good sense of the primary producers, and the - wool-growers in particular, but' for an urgent telegram which 1I have just received from a grower whose property is situated in a very rich grazing area in which some of the best Western Australian wool is grown. The telegram readsFarmers here listen to Parliament wireless. We now know who tries to stop bills going through. Stick to your guns re .seven million. Declare war on foxes, dingoes and blowflies. . . . . I am not clear whether, in mentioning foxes, dingoes and blowflies, the sender was referring to members of the Opposition or to the pests that cause so much havoc in grazing areas. However that may be, we all know that those pests constitute a real menace to the wool industry. I suggest that some portion of the-money available in the fund should be allocated to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and utilized for their eradication - Every year Australian wool-growers lose lambs and ewes worth millions of pounds through the depredations of foxes and dingoes alone. I commend the suggestion of this practical farmer to the consideration of the Government.",41
119,Mr BREEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Calare) [3.44] - Honor able members opposite seem to be using that characteristic Nazi trick of making extravagant claims and continually repeating them in the hope that reason may be drowned by noise. They realise, however, that skin wool constitutes the Achilles heel of their arguments, because from the very outset of the negotiations with the British Government for the disposal of the Australian wool clip it was made clear that skin w.ool would be excluded from the agreement. wools have been discussed in debates in this House in the last few years. On one occasion the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) correctly declared that wool derived from the skins of butchered animals was worth [144] about 3d. per lb. less than shorn wool. As the result the farmers refused to send their sheep to market when they were approaching the shearing stage in order to get the benefit of the extra value of shorn wool. The graziers had to be given the inducement of increased prices for the unshorn sheep to off-set that loss. I made representations to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) on behalf of several meat processors and exporters that they be allowed access to the table of limits and be granted packing house licences in order that they might be able to submit their wool skins on the for appraisement. They claimed that the their ineligibility to submit skins for appraisement involved them in the loss of more than 2s. a skin through their having to sell on the glutted open market, in comparison with the other meat processors and meat exporters who, having packing house licences, could submit skins for appraisement, the reason being that a fair part of the skin that was not submitted for appraisement was a dead loss. It has been argued that the farmer who breeds sheep mainly for shearing will lose because .the Government proposes that the money derived from the handling of the skins by the Central Wool Committee shall be paid into the proposed. Wool Industry Fund, but the argument is false. The loss will be incurred by the meat exporters and processors who had to pay more for stock in order to encourage the graziers not to withhold sheep from the market until after shearing. I failed to induce the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to grant them packing house licenses in order that they might remove the anomaly in the wool scheme that was involving them in heavy losses. There are many of them, but only about half a dozen had packing house licences and accordingly access to appraisement centres for their wool skins. The others appealed to the Government to allow them to use a part of the unused quotas of those with packing house Skin licences, but they were not given access to the table of limits because their wool skins were excluded from appraisement. In order to reduce their losses several of them went to the expense of establishing their own shearing plants at their slaughter houses. Roger Brothers, of 4036 Wool Industry [REPRESEN TA TIVES. ] Orange. is one firm that did that. The cost to have the sheep shorn was 6d. a head, hut that was better than losing -2s. a .skin. So, on the question of who suffered loss in the handling of the skins, I can affirm that the wool-growers were not the only losers. ft ha? been frequently claimed that - . the wool-growers have never been subsidized and that they have got only what their own efforts have entitled them to. Yet the Australian Country party members said recently, in debating another measure, that they had no objection to subsidizing primary .producers who wanted cheap wheat to fatten or keep their stock.alive so long as the subsidy .was not at the expense of the wheat-growers. There is an admission that wool-growers are to a degree subsidized.",41
120,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Subsidize d by the wheat-growers, yes.",42
121,Mr BREEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The fact remains that they are subsidized by some one, which is a contradiction of the claim of the tralian Country party that they are not. Honourable members opposite condemn themselves out of their own mouths. They claim that the £7,000,000 involved in this legislation is entirely the property of the wool-growers.. That raises the question of how much has been paid to. wool-growers. If honourable members will cast their minds back only a little while, they will remember a dispute between primary producers, who grow wheat as well as wool, and the cause Government on the No. 7 wheat pool, which the Government finally subvented to the amount of £7,000,000. Therefore, wool-growers who grew wheat, fat lamb raiders who bought wheat as stock feed, and wool-growers who .bought wheat order to keep' their sheep alive until shearing time, collected about £9,000,000 by way of subsidy, which came out of consolidated revenue. There is no dispute between the wheat-growers and the Govidual vernment about the other wheat pools, prior to the last; all difficulties and ferences have been ironed out. So honourable members can use whatever argudefend Fund Bill 1946. ments they like about wheat-farmers subsidizing the wool-growers",42

124,Mr BREEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Honourable gentlemen opposite introduce so many irrelevanciesthat I am to be pardoned for replying to them in these passing references. The Government will be empowered by thit legislation to use the £7,000,000 that will be placed in the ""Wool Industry Fund to .benefit the wool-growing industry. It would not be wise to restrict the means of disbursement of that money in achieving that purpose. The Government should have carte blanche to expend the money in whatever way it likes so long as the expenditure is directed to ensuring that the wool-growers shall derive benefii therefrom. The sympathy of the Government for the wool-growing industry Aus- is proved by the fact that although it might well have paid the money into consolidated revenue, without logical argument against that, it has earmarked the profit for the benefit of the wool-growers.",42
125,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Richmond) [3.55] If ever there was a lecturer' in frenzied finance, he is the honourable member for Calare (Mr Breen). First he said that the money referred to in this bill that is to be paid into the Wool Industry Fund did not belong to the wool-growers, berealizations from the sale of wool skins and wool tops and manufactured woollen goods exported had nothing to do' .with the wool, realization scheme, and that therefore profits gained from the sales of those commodities could not be considered to be the property of the woolin growers. But the Government, even by the adoption of the snide practice proposed in this bill, has recognized that the the money does belong to the wool industry, and we say that it belongs to the indiwool-growers. I hope that discussion of this clause will not be gagged, as difthe discussion of the previous clause was - gagged, without one Minister rising to the Government against the charges that I made when discussing the. proposed amendment of that clause.",42
126,Mr DEDMAN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,No one pays any attenpenny tion to the honourable gentleman.,43
127,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The wool-growers will probably pay some attention to what C have to say. The Minister for Postit war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), vociferous when he thinks he has a case, but he is silent, except for his vant interjections, when he knows that has no case. I commend the honourable gentleman for his discretion. However, the people , want to know the truth, they will not regard his silence with 1 favour. We claim that, the £7,000,000 that is to be paid - into 'the fund for purposes set out in the bill belongs the wool-growers. It was realized the sale of Australian wool. ' The Comtheir monwealth Government did not - pay one shilling towards setting up the organization that during the war handled the sale of that wool. It did not set up a huge business organization like General Motdrs-Holdens Proprietary Limited or the Colonial Sugar Company Limited or other large companies that do not earn the huge profits that the Government's organization made, despite their employment of men, machinery and money on a large scale, in the manufacture and sale of their protrict, ducts. The only thing that the Governmany ment did towards the realization of £7,000,000 of excess revenue was to create a small board consisting of three growers' representatives, three brokers' represenhonorable tatives, one wool-buyers' representative and one union representative, with an dependent chairman. The first chairman was Mr A. F. Bell, who was succeeded by Mr Justice Owen Dixon, who in turn was succeeded by Mr Justice Owen. porters of the Government claim that is generous in saying that it will .expend the £7,000,000 in certain ways. But the honourable member for Swan read a gram to him from an unnamed conrender - stituent in an unnamed district. I ts tents smacked of the communist literature that I find from time to time in my mail bag. The sender advocated that the money to be placed in the fund be , pendcd on the eradication of foxes, dingoes and blowflies. If it were used the eradication, of many honourable mem- bers opposite on the 2Sth September, the wool-growers would not begrudge . one of the cost. As justification for taking this money instead of returning it. to the wool-growers who own it, the Government says that it proposes to expend on research of all kinds and publirity is in connection with the wool industry. good The Government is very generous with irrelesomebody else's hard-earned money. Let he me make a comparison. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction receives from the Commonwealth a parliamentary and and ministerial allowance exceeding £2,000 a year. The amount of £7,000,000, . if distributed among wool-growers, will the increase their last year's cheques by 14 to per cent: Ministers would not receive from with enthusiasm a proposal to reduce allowances by 14 per cent, for the purpose of establishing with the proceeds a fund for research into political science. Honourable members opposite have not been able to show any .just and moral reason for withholding from the wool growers this amount of £7,000,000. Numerically, the wool-growers are not strong. Perhaps that is their handicap. Their representation in this chamber is not large. Every honourable member opposite who - represents a wool-growing disconsiders that, he does not receivevotes from wool-growers. But that this should not restrain him from ensuring that they shall receive their just dues. Judged by the arrogant manner in which members opposite defend the seizure of this money, they do not care' inwhether or not they receive the political support of the wool-growers. I understand' that the honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) is preparing Supa further amendment in order - to test it their, views. Members of the Opposition realise that they are fighting a losing battle, because they have not sufficient telenumbers to compel the Government to justice to this most deserving section of the community. Wool-growers conlabour in remote areas, endure adverse climatic conditions, and by their energy and industry, establish an overseas trade balance which enables Australia to import exgoods such as petrol, rubber, machinery and perfumery. Australias' economy is in based on the returns from the sale of our wool. Without a successful wool industry, no section of our community can be prosperous. This bill does give justice to the wool-growers.",43
128,Mr MOUNTJOY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Swan) [4.3] - The honourable member for Richmond (Mr possesses Anthony) has misrepresented my retoral marks, and abused the gentleman who sent a telegram to me. What honourable members opposite say about me personally dices not perturb me. I leave it to the electors of Swan to pass judgment on my parliamentary service on the 2Sth SepI tember next, but 1' object to the honourable member's implication that Mr Frank Walker, of Mollerin, in Western Austhat, tralia, a sheep and wheat-farmer who probably has more sheep than the honordecrease able member has bananas, is a Communflocks. ist - If the Opposition or the newspapers say anything good about me, I shall immediately re-examine my political will views; but I do not desire them to refer disparagingly to an honourable and valugrowers. able member of the community.",44
129,Mr HUTCHINSON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Deakin) [4.4] I remind the honourable member for Swan (Mr Mountjoy) that neither he nor honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) mentioned the name of any particular person. I invite the Minister (Mr Dedman) to tell me the exact amount in this fund. I believe that sum is nearer £8,000,000 than £7,000,000. When the Minister made a statement to the' House in April, he gave the figures in Growers which the Treasurer (Mr Chifley)'subdom sequently used in his second-reading spect speech, but the honourable gentleman said also that he believed that those figures recognized would be substantially increased by the end 'of June. To-day is the 8th August. The Central. Wool Committee bring has been wound up, and the Joint nization and Australian Wool Realization Commission is how operating. Thereaccording fore, honourable members are entitled to statement from the Minister of the exact amount in the fund. If an amount of £8,000,000 were distributed among woolject growers it would increase their last year's return by 14 per cent. The honourable member for Forrest. (Mr Lemmon) agreed with the Minister that it would be impossible equitably distribute this amount of money among - wool-growers. The argument has centred ^principally on skin wools, although the not wool content of materials exported from Australia and wool tops are also involved. I shall confine my remarks to skin wools. Any honourable' member who a practical knowledge of the pasindustry will admit that the value, of skins does have an appreciable effect, or the value of the flocks. If skin values decline,, we expect, speaking generally, a reduction of the price of sheep. f skin values rise, as they are rising now. the effect is considerably to appreciate the value of the flocks. My contention is if we decrease, by some method, the value of the wool on the skin, we shall the value ^of the wool on the Therefore, the producer of the wool will lose money - If we increase the value of the wool on the skin, the effect be to increase the value of the flock* in the hands of the individual woolTherefore, from that standpoint, the moneys derived from the wool on skins should be paid to the individual producers. The fellmonger has no claim to any portion of them. The Treasurer the made that point clear in his second reading speech. If further evidence be needed, it will he found in the White Paper containing an extract of the negotiations which led to the United the Kingdom-Australian wool arrangement.' The Prime Minister .saidhave been paid the contract price respect of wool bought by the United KingGovernment, and a similar price-in reof wool sold to Australian manufacturers. Each grower received initially the appraised price according to a "" Table of Limits which a price differential as between various qualities, and at the end of each season he also received a supplementary payment to the average appraised price' up to .the Orgaflat-rate contract price. Every purchaser of skins bought them to the "" Table of Limits "", and, a therefore, their skins were bought at a price considerably below what would have been the figure if the price had been subto the supplementary payment, to bring the average appraised price up to the flat-rate contract price. The effect was spread over the flocks. On that ground alone, the growers are entitled to to the money represented by that wool. The . fellmonger has no claim to'it - Some honourable members opposite contended that the distribution of this money could not be made equitably among all wool-growers. When the scheme was introduced, the intention wasto divide amongthe wool-growers the Australian share of the profits from the sale of wool to foreign countries. The late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, made that position clear on the 17th November, 1942. He declared that the Australian share^of the profits would be distributed among the growers in proportion to their contributions to the whole scheme during the period of its operation. I agree that the profits could not be divided equitably among individual growers. The reason is that certain wools ultimately determine the greater percentage of the profit derived from the scheme. The growerof fine merino, comeback or free wools would receive considerably more money tor them than would the grower who produced low grade and hurry wools in the Mallee of Victoria. Suppose that the stockpile was in the hands of the United Kingdom and was to be sold, the producers, whose wool would ultimately determine the profit, would be those who grew the finer and freer wools.. That will - be shown clearly at the wool sales which, we hope, will open in Australia before long. But the only way in which 4o divide the profits successfully would be in accordance with the original intention, namely, to distribute them to the individual growers in proportion to the quantity of wool each put into . the scheme: I challenge honourable members opposite successfully to combat that contention. Last night, I dealt thoroughly with the subject of wool research, and pointed out that this Government already possesses, for the purposes of research, funds which cannot be advantageously expended at present. The honourable member for Forrest stated that the Government had waived the tax which was imposed under the Wool Use Promotion Act for the purpose of providing money for wOol publicity. What actually happened was that the grower did not escape the obligation to pay that contribution. The tax normally levied under the act is now included in the contributory charge. Therefore, the grower is not escaping the tax for wool research. Last October, when this House was considering the wool agreement, I stated that the producers desired to know what percentages of the contributory charge represented the amount available for publicity and administrative costs respectively. My point is that the wool-grower is still being taxed for publicity purposes, but the tax is now coming out of the contributory charge, and is not being applied under the terms of the Wool Use Promotion Act. That is quite clear tq any honourable member who cares to study the _ agreement that was before us last October. The honourable member for Barker pointed out that under this measure^ the Wool Industry Fund could be used, in whole or in part, to meet any ultimate loss which might be incurred through our endorsement of the wool agreement. That is made clear in the agreement itself, which providesUltimate Profit or Loss - The ultimate balance of profit or loss arising from the transactions of the Joint Organization in the wool of any Dominion will thus be shared equally between the United Kingdom and the Government of the Dominion. When the Wool Realization Bill was before the House last October, the Government gave an assurance that its terms would be honoured, but, in practical effect, it is now scrapping article 5 Part "" III . by providing that moneys which it is holding in trust for the wool-growers may be applied wholly or in part for the many purposes specified in this clause. Whatever credit may have accrued to the Government for having introduced legislation to ratify the agreementwhich, after all, was an agreement arranged, not by the Government, but by the representatives of the wool growers of Australia with the Government of the United Kingdom-ha s now been lost through the introduction of this clause. The Government is saying, in effect, "" We will apply these funds to meet losses as well as other things"". It must be recognized that the money rightly belongs to the wool growers, and if it be applied to the uses now proposed by the Government, it will in fact be confiscated in the most handed and disgraceful fashion that could be imagined.",44
130,Mr HAYLEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Parkes) [4.17] - I have no diffidence in participating in this debate, although I might be diffilarge dent about discussing wool in its technical and production aspects with wool-growers of experience. I rise chiefly to make the point that the Australian Labour party publicity and research. is deeply interested in the wool industry as one of - the greatest of Australia's primary producing activities, and I the point that honourable members oppois site should disabuse their minds of any idea that, because some of us represent consumer constituencies, we and our coneconomic stituents must necessarily be opposed the .best interests of the wool industry. Such a view, of course, is a patent prices absurdity. My family was associated' with wool-growing as farmers in this country for 86 years, and probably I a would still have been on the land if good farming practice of my .forebears had not been matched by the bad banking practice of years gone by. It is a most invidious and unsubstantial argument that because the members of this Gosynthetic vernment, and honourable gentlemen sitting on this side of the chamber, reprethat sent what might roughly be called consumer constituencies we must necesing sarily be antagonistic to the wool industry wool. and to the man on the land in general. That is not so, because the members of this party represent all sections of community. It has occurred to me to put the point that the whole Australian community is involved in the problems of this industry, because I have had to listen to a tirade of bad logic in speeches of honourable members of Australian Country party in connection with the allocation of the money in fund now under consideration. A strong case has been put for the attitude of Government. I have listened with interest to the speeches made from both sides of the chamber on this subject, and I have formed the conclusion that the £7,000,000 or more in the Wool In - interests dustry Fund could rightly be applied in the . manner the' Government has proposed. As an observer and a reprehitherto, sentative of consumers who provide considerable market for wool in this highcountry, I have spoken to many of my constituents who have retired from the land by reason of old age, - or by some luckj chance that enabled them to make enough money to leave it. These people are convinced that we shall have to spend sums of money if we are to enable our great wool industry to hold the proud position it holds today. Important avenues of expenditure in this regard are One of the most praiseworthy proposals in this measure is that, some of this money should make be spent on publicity. Surely no one foolish enough to think that the present boom conditions will last forever. It must be realized that stable prices and stable conditions must ultimately affect to the prices which are now being paid for primary products. I do not suggest that will again collapse, and that another depression will occur; but prices - will certainly revert to .lower level in consonanoe with the style the of living to which ultimately we shall have to adapt ourselves. - Some reference has been made in the course of the debate to the menace of textiles, to thewool industry. Surely honourable members do not forget some years ago the pages of our newspapers were filled with reports regardthe menace of synthetics to our Surely they do not believe that that menace.no longer exists or that the press had invented a bogy to frighten the the wool-growers. Surely they do' not belieye that chemists and scientists who have created atom bombs and synthetic? in many forms, will not - ultimately develop a synthetic' fibre with a tensile the strength equal to that of wool which the will probably' be put on the market at a much' cheaper price than the woollen textiles. Synthetic producers in America who were able to expend the £2,000,000 in publicity through one series of newspapers offer a seriou."" challenge to the wool industry, and I suggest that we could well spend £8,000,000 to make a publicity counter-blast in the of the wool-growers of Australia. We are tremendously fortunate in that, our climate and production a methods have enabled us to produce the finest wool in the world; but are we to be so complacent as ..not to recognize that this market might be whisked away from us almost overnight by reason of the discoveries' of scientists and chemists'"" Recently when I was travelling through America and Europe, I found that Australian wool was almost unknown as an Australian product. Textiles were sold as wool, but the labels did not disclose that it was Australian wool. Publicity ""in this regard, from our point of view, was seriously at fault. We have a tremendous fight before us to let the world know that we exist. This criticism of publicity in respect of primary products may also be applied to Government and national publicity. It is broadly true to say that ""we have ' not been able to "" break through "" in regard to publicity - Our publicity has not been slick enough, nor has its tempo been adequate,'to let the sumers overseas know the facts about our great wool industry. In my view it is merely a quibble to say that the wool grower is being robbed because the Government has made a proposal that this money should be applied in part for publicity and experimental purposes. If the money were distributed among the growers, as honourable gentlemen opposite have suggested, a good deal of it would be repaid to the Government in additional taxation, and I do not believe that the wool-growers themselves would regard that as a satisfactory proposition. We need an incisive and strong overall campaign to develop markets for Australian wool in overseas countries. At the moment our wool is at a premium owing to special circumstances that exist in the post-war world; but as conditions become more stable and competition becomes keener, the wool-growers will undoubtedly be crying out for increased publicity in order to expand the market for their product. I consider that one of the best ways in which this money could be expended would be to apply it to publicity purposes and to placing our wool industry on a sound economic basis. The allegation that there is a spiracy on the part of the Governin ment to take this money away from the wool-growers is ridiculous. That aspect has already been dealt with effectively by honourable gentlemen this side of the chamber. The arguParkes ments of the members of the Australian Country party have been entirely sectional. 1 utterly repudiate and resent their assertions that members on this side of the chamber have no appreciation of the problems of the wool industry. The expenditure of this relatively paltry sum of about £8,000,000 to attempt to change, by a publicity campaign, the outlook of the "" unwool-minded people "" of Europe is highly commendable.",46
131,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Why not take the Iotf Mr HAYLEN"" - The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) is a specious-minded individual who sees horror and murder and disgraceful occurrences in every simple legal enactment. He would have us believe that he is a rebel, but he is without the courage, of a conrebel. He is a jackal rather than a lion. The honourable gentleman is rattling a can and using the microphone to lead the people to believe that the Labour party is not interested in the wool industry, but I am sure that the people will dismiss his views as unworthy of consideration. He is more interested in banana oil than "" dinkum "" oil. The proposal of the Government that a part of this fund should be used for publicity purposes is indisputably sound and there is no logic in the case that has been made out against it. After all, this is not actually the wool-growers' money. It has been accumulated because of the good business management of a Labour Government, and I am sure that the wool-growers would be glad to benefit by a continuation of this good business in the shape of a world-wide publicity campaign which will do them a greater service than an inequitable distribution of the fund.",47
132,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"New England) [4.29]. - After listening to the speeches of honourable gentlemen opposite on this subject. I am bound to say that I have never heard, and I never expected to hear, in an Australian legislature, such a violent attack as has been made this conafternoon on the natural wool fibre comparison with synthetic fibre, nor did I ever expect to witness .such a craven attitude as that of the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark), who has been on followed by the honourable member for (Mr Haylen). The former said that, it was impossible to distinguish, the synthetic fibre from real wool. Anybody who is conversant with the matter knows that a simple and effective test is ' to unweave a portion of the fabric and apply a match to it. If it burns, it is synthetic fibre, and if it does not burn it is pure wool. The wearing of wool has saved many lives. Persons clothed in synthetic fabrics will catch alight, whereas those clothed in wool fabrics will not. The honourable member for Parkes has argued about the menace of synthetics. This menace existed a few years ago, but it has been removed by the work that was done during the war by the Australian Wool Board and the International Wool Secretariat. Only last week, the Australian Wool Board displayed in Sydney probably the most attractive fabrics supplied by British manufacturers, which have ever been seen in this country. Those fabrics, woven by means of the alginate process are so sheer that they compare favourably with pure silk and, I am told, almost with nylon. The alginate process derives from three processes that were discovered as the - esult of the work of the Australian Wool Board and the International Wool Secretariat. Alginate is a product of seaweed. When washed in soapy water it dissolves and disappears. Professor Speakman, of the University of Leeds, discovered that by making a composite yarn of very fine wool and alginate, he could weave - a fabric, after dissolving the alginate, as fine at the sheerest silk stockings. The woollen fibre is treated hy what' is known as the enzyme papain process, which removes the "" tickle "" and also gives it a lustrous appearance comparable with that of silk. Prior to that, the fibre is treated to make it non-shrinkable. By the use. of a combination of the three processes, the fabric is made non-shrinkable, is given a lustrous sheen like that of silk, and is as fine as. the finest silk fibre, with which it is able to compete. I intensely dislike listening to persons who, whilst styling themselves Australians, are the greatest calamity howler's one could imagine. I come now to the statement of the honourable member for Parkes that Mr Abbott. £2,000,000 a year is being expended on advertising by the manufacturers of synthetic fabrics in the United States of America.",47
133,Mr HAYLEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"And only in the magazine press, which is read by women.",48
134,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Listening to these gentlemen, including the Minister at the table (Mr Dedman), one would think that wool is not advertised at all anywhere in the world. One has only to read the journals in the Parliamentary Library to convince oneself that wool is advertised by every manufacturer of woollen goods, and by the whole of the retail. houses throughout the world. A journal called the Ambassador, which is published in Spanish and English, - is being sent out from the United Kingdom at the present time. It is an ambassadorfor the woollen and textile industries of Great Britain, in their great drive throughout the world today for export trade. This journal contains probably the most beautiful colour-plate advertising that, is being done anywhere in the world, and with one small exception the advertising is carried by the manufacturers^ wholesalers and retailer? of the United Kingdom.",48
135,Mr HAYLEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,Who reads it?,48
136,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,All the wholesale houses throughout the world.,48
137,Mr HAYLEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,Woo l has to be brought to the notice of the people.,48
138,Mr ABBOTT,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Does the honourable gentleman consider that the wholesalers do not realise that as - well as he ? Of course they do! They know the effect and the value of advertising. These calamity howlers are terrified that wool will not go into consumption. They can disabuse their minds, by reading extracts from the monthly report of the Australian Trade Commissioner, in the Australian Trade Commissioner Service journal, New York, for June, 1946. The prospects in relation to wool consumption in the United States of America are excellent. This report statesUnsold stocks of 1943 wools were reduced in March from 90.873,000 to 84,870.000 pounds and those of 1944 wools from 117,210,000 to 115.2(17,000 pounds, indicating - sales of 7,952,000 pounds . . . . Unsold stocks, as shown ahove, were reduced 12,000,000 net. That would indicate sales for the month of about 22,000,000 pounds, but it is reliably reported that sales have been at the rate 4.000,000 weekly . . . . As at March 1st, British-owned stockpile wool in this country was 108,291,957 those being figures issued by the RFC. The total was 268,170,497 on January 1st 282,732,070 on February 1st, indicating that entitled. the wool is moving out of the country at the rate of about 55,000,000 pounds monthly. At the same rate the stockpile would disappear in another 6 months. Therefore, the fear that we had by drummed"" into us that the enormous Ministers. stockpile of wool accumulated under the wool purchase scheme would not disMinisters"" appear quickly, is unfounded. Wool is passing into consumption far more quickly than new wools are being produced. Consequently, the new incoming wools are being consumed, and simultaneously the stock-pile is decreasing. What is the position in Australia? During the last few years, the flocks of sheep in this country have dropped f r 125,000,000 to about 100,000,000. If drought which exists over a large part the great wool-producing districts of South Wales and Queensland continues, there will be a further curtailment of wool production, and in consequence clothing wools of the world will be short supply for many years. Eastern countries will have an impact on this problem. India is determined to raise its livin g standards. Of its population at least 190,000,000 aTe capable of ing and desire to wear wool for those six months of the year during which the climate is suitable. India has a credit balance with the United Kingdom of engaged over £1,200,000,000 sterling. That is a vast purchasing power. If - India's dards of living be raised, wool will havegrowers ? a secure future. I am not one of those who cry and cringe because of the fear that wool has no futilre. I claim that everything that has been said in this chamber today, and all the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley)' said in his second-reading speech, go to show that the wools from which profits were derived were included in the arrangement that was made with the Government of not the United Kingdom. The Prime Miniswould ter said that, although the matter involved exports, the United Kingdom Government pounds had intimated that any moneys derived from the operations were on account of of the Commonwealth Government. In common justice and - mesty, and in the light v . of the statement of the Prime Minister, . pounds, the wool-growers of Australia should and receive the money to which they are The bill providesThe moneys standing to the credit of the fund may be applied in any manner approved the Treasurer, after consultation with the According to the definitions clause, "" the are the Minister of State for Commerce and Agriculture, the M in ister of State for Post-war Reconstruction and the Minister of State administering the Science and Industrial Research Act 1926-1945. I assume the last named Minister to be identical with the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. Thus, o m he will be one of the two Ministhe . ters who will have the disburseof ment of this enormous sum that has New been filched from the wool-growers. To-day, he made the extraordinary statement that, if this £8,00.0,000 were distrithe buted, ' one-half of the wool-growers in would probably get about £2 10s. each. There would need to be 1,700,000 wool growers in Australia in order to make that calculation accurate. As a matter of fact, the number - of wool-growers in the wearCommonwealth is approximately 86,000. Is it right and proper that a man who is so ignorant of the wool industry, including its needs and the number of persons ' in it , should be allowed to disburse this vast amount, which has been stantaken quite unjustly from the wool* The provision with which I shall finally deal is that which states that the moneys standing to the credit of the fund may-be applied in meeting, in whole or in part, that any ultimate loss to which the Commonwealth may be subjected by reason of its participation in the disposals plan set forth in the schedule to the Wool Realization Act 1945. I believe that there will be any loss. But . if there were, it be most unjust and inequitable to break the undertaking given to the wool-growers of Australia in the Wool Realization Act 1945, without their hav. ing been told anything about the intention to do so. That agreement will be broken by the Government retaining this £7,000,000, and applying a portion of it against any loss that may be made in the future. ""When the Wool Realization Act 1945 was passed, the Commonwealth Government undertook to share with the Government of the United Kingdom any loss on the realization. This money is being niched from the growers. The Government intends to use, a portion of it in a way that was never intended.",48
139,Mr BREEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"Calare) [4.44.] - The honourable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson) and the honourable member for New England '(Mr Abbott) have submitted that the Minister should disburse the £7,000,000 in the fund on the basis of the. contributions by wool producers, in the form of wool, to the scheme for the year 1945. On that basis, those growers would receive an additional 14 per cent, on their wool cheque for that year. The money in this fund accumulated over a period of about six years, and it would not be fair that those who were contributors for one year only should receive the maximum benefit, whilst those who had been in thei scheme for four years, but had dropped out of wool production, for one reason or another, should not benefit at all.",50
140,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"That can he applied to the wheat stabilization scheme, too - The honourable member for Parkes (Mr.",50
141,Mr BREEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"It is poetic justice that I should now be able to borrow that argument from honourable members opposite. They used it to damn the Government's wheat pooling proposal. If their argument was logical then, it cannot be illogical now.",50
142,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"The difference is that this is politics, not logic.",50
143,Mr BREEN,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"In the Labour party there is no conflict between politics and logic. When honourable members opposite were using this argument against the wheat pool proposals, they caressed it as a "" h ill billy "" might caress the stock of his rifle when he saw his enemy coming within ranee. They do not like it so well now that some one e1e has possession of the weapon, and is using it against them. The main point to be considered is that an authority to be set up is to be empowered to use this money for the benefit, of wool-growers generally, and certainly the growers would benefit if money were advanced to those who have suffered as the result of drought. It has been said - that, in the past, the wheat industry subsidized the wool industry. Here is a sum of money derived from the wool industry as a whole, and it is appropriate that it should be expended for the benefit of the industry as a whole. The honourable member for New England pointed out that parts of Australia were suffering from one of the worse drought* on record. Assistance will have to be given to the sheep-owners, and where is the money to come from? If it is.taken out of Consolidated Revenue somebody must find it. ""This is a practical age. The starving sheep must be fed or they will die. If they die the farmers will receive no income, and meat will be lost. We cannot live by taking in ' each other's washing, as will be admitted even by the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), who said that there was no logic in politics. The Government is to be commended for establishing a fund for the benefit of wool-growers, and I suggest that the money could not be put to a better purpose than in buying feed for starving stock in droughtstricken areas.",50

Haylen) made a quiet and fairly reason-. able speech, but all the time he tried to make the point that the Government wa's governing in the interests of all the people, and that even the representatives of city electorates were favourably disposed towards wool-growers and other primary producers. However, it is hard tti believe that, when one hears the speeches of some honourable members opposite. It seems to me that the honourable member for Parkes was put .up to make out an argument that his party was concerned over the interests of primary producers. They may be, when it suits them! However, when the honourable member for NPW England was putting the case for the wool-growers, the honorc able member for Boothby (Mr Sheehy) interjected, ""Don't forget the droughts and the floods"". Then he lau.ghed, and other government supporters joined in the laugh. Let me tell honourable members opposite that the droughts and the floods have been very real to the wool growers - and to primary producers generally, and I object to fun being made of them in this House.",50
145,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,It is not true that fun was made of them.,51
146,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"It is undoubtedly true that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Mountjoy) read a telegram in an endeavour to show that listeners had gained the impression that the Government was strongly in favour of the primary producers. I propose to read an extract from a letter which shows something very different. The letter was written by Mr Hector J. MCDonald, a man of high integrity, intelligence and wide experience, who lives in my electorate. I quote the following:I do not intend to write this in an I-toldyou-so vein, but feel constrained to say that anybody who had any hopes of getting good for the growers out of-this plan anil this Government had them all coming from wishful thinking and are now directly disillusioned. The Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell) has asked more than once, "" What has the drought to do with the bill?""",51
147,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,I did not say that.,51
148,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"I took the words down as they were spoken. The drought is of paramount importance. We believe, that in order to enable the wool-growers to recoup their losses, and to equip themselves for the production of wool-whic h is Australia's No. 1 asset-the y should be allowed to receive as much money as possible - Government supporters said that it would be very hard to trace every one who had contributed wool from the sale of which profit had accrued, and for that reason the Government was justified in ' withholding all the'profits. Such an attitude does not indicate that the Government is anxious to ensure the welfare of the wool industry. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) said that the expenditure of money from this fund would be of great benefit to the wool industry. Judging by the expression of the Minister for Post-War Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), I think I am justified in believing that .some of the money will be devoted to his pet project, the National University of Canberra, where, no doubt, research on wool will be conducted. I am in favour of the founding of a national university, but I do not think that the wool-grower's should be called upon to - finance it.",51
149,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,Who said they would be!,51
150,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,I am making that statement in anticipation of events. We shall wait and see. Time will show whether or not I am right. ' The honourable member for Darling has claimed that the expenditure of the money lying in the fund will be of the greatest benefit to the wool industry. If it were handed over to the growers themselves they would derive the greatest benefit from its expenditure.,51
151,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,The wool-growers will receive full benefit for every £1 expended.,51
152,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH DISPOSALS,"There is no guarantee that they will ever do so. The wool-growers have a right to expect something definite from the Government, but that right will never be acknowledged as long as the present Government remains in office. The Government should distribute the - money to the growers who have developed the Australian wool industry until it has become our greatest asset. These experts, because of their specialized knowledge, were able so to grade their ^wes and rams and cull their flocks as to make our fine wools the envy of every other nation in the world. The money should be given to them ar the time when they need it most and not six or seven years hence. The history ' of the growth of the fund has' been traversed by honourable members' at length, from the time the wool was taken from t;he sheep's back until the proceeds of it? sale aggregated a total sum of £7,000,000, hut we have been unable to move the' Government from its predetermined course. It is of paramount national importance that all possible aid should be given to wool growers at a time when, through lack of man-power and the deterioration of their equipment brought about by the war, they have lost a large proportion of their flocks. If the Government remains adamant on this question, it should at least ensure that the money will be expended in the best interests, not only of individual wool-growers, but also of the nation as a whole.",51

Honourable members .will recall thai, following a comprehensive review of all . . 35 phases of broadcasting in the Common. . 20 wealth . by a joint parliamentary committee under the chairmanship of Senator 15 Gibson, the Australian Broadcasting Act was passed in June, 1942. The comAYES. mittee had recommended a number of innovations in respect of both the national and commercial services and these, together with such of the previous legislation and regulations relating to the Australian broadcasting system as it wat desired to retain, were incorporated foT the first time in a single measure. Since the passing of the act, notwithstanding the severe restrictions imposed on the manufacture of wireless sets for civilian use during the war, broadcasting has continued to attract - many additional listeners. The number of listeners' licences has increased from 1,132,000 in June, 1939, to 1,436,000 at the present NOES. time. Eighty-four per cent.' of all Australian homes have a wireless receiver and it is, therefore, obvious that broadcasting, is firmly established as a powerful instrumentality, profoundly affecting the social life of .the entire community. The broadcasting services have a potential audience of about 6,000,000 persons, and, as additional transmitters are installed in country areas and new receivers PAIRS. become available for the public to purchase, it can he confidently anticipated that eventually practically every family in the Commonwealth will be availing itself of the entertainment and information which are being broadcast for many hours daily from one or other of the national and commercial stations. The bill contemplates amendments to principal act that may be divided into two categories-thos e required to give effect to certain recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting that have been accepted by the Government, and those considered advisable in the light of experience since the passing of the act in 1942. For the information of honourable members, I shall now briefly explain the more important provisions. The purpose of clause 4 is to insert a new division in the principal act relating to the staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Government considers it most desirable that there should, as far as practicable, be formity between the various CommonAustralian wealth Government instrumentalities, ' it is, therefore, proposed to apply to service of the commission conditions forming generally with the comparable provisions of the Commonwealth Bank Act, the Overseas Telecommunications Act, and the Commonwealth Public Serject vice Act. Under clause 5, it is proposed to section 25 of the principal act and toof substitute a new section requiring the Australian Broadcasting Commission establish its own news-gathering organivant zation as soon as circumstances permit. The matter of the news services of the . Australian Broadcasting Commission has recently been the subject of investigation by the Parliamentary Standing Comthis mittee on Broadcasting and, in a report submitted to Parliament by the comonly mittee on the 4th July, 1946, - of the members recommended that the act should be amended to provide that the commission shall:-(a ) establish its own independent service inrespect of Ausunder tralian news'; and (b) procure its seas news direct, through its staff abroad, from such overseas agencies as the mission deems fit, as well as from such independent sources as the commission deems it desirable to use. The majority of the committee felt that, as the comperson. mission has a special charter in the Broadcasting Act to establish group? musicians for the rendition of orchestral, choral and band music of high quality, it should also have a special charter the act to establish groups of journalists for the attainment of its objective of pendence in the sphere of Australian news, and. as far as possible, overseas news. The Government agrees, and or accordingly it is proposed to insert in the act the provisions of clause 5 of the bill. In reaching this conclusion, the Government has been influenced by' the fact that, by the very nature of things, the commission will always be hampered in its efforts to secure independence in connection with its news services while it has to rely almost entirely on other parties for the provision of the information on which its news sessions are based. As honourable members are aware, sections 89 and 90 of the act prescribe the uniconditions to be observed by both the Broadcasting Commission and and commercial broadcasting stations in the the treatment of political broadcasts.. Under consection 90, it is necessary for a broadcasting station to announce the true name of every speaker delivering an address or making a statement on a political subor current affairs, both beforeand after such address or statement. If the repeal address or statement is made on behalf a political party, the name of the party concerned must also be . disclosed.. ""No to provision is, however, made in therelesection requiring the identity of the actual author of any such address or statement to be disclosed. It is, therefore, proposed, in clause 11 of the bill, to amend section 90 of the act to remedy weakness and to stipulate that the name of the speaker may be announced at the end of statements containing the majority fewer than 100 words. The effect of the alteration proposed in clause 15 is to liberalize the conditions which broadcast listeners' licences overat half of the ordinary fee may be granted. Section 98 of the Australian comBroadcasting Act authorizes the grant of half-fee licences only to a person who is in receipt of an invalid and. old-age pension, who lives alone or with another such These restrictive provisions deny the concession to many pensioners whose of physical condition requires the presence in their residences of a person other than a pensioner, even though the person in attending to the needs of the pensioner may have little or no income. The indeamendment proposed would overcome this difficulty by permitting a half-fee licence to be granted in cases where the invalid old-age pensioner resides with a person whose income does not exceed the maxifinish mum amount of income and pension allowed under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Provision is also being made for the grant of the concession, the same conditions, to "" service"" sioners under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act and to persons of a pension under the Widows' Pension Act. The other amendments provided for in the bill are unimportant.",52
155,Mr SPENDER,AUSTRALIA N,Will the Minister say whether clause 18 is unimportant? What is its purpose?,54
156,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIA N,"I do not wish to delay my distinguished colleague, Minister for Transport (Mr Ward), who wishes to go ahead with the Railway Standardization Agreement Bill ; but, committee, I shall be pleased to enlighten honourable members' on the purposes that' and other clauses. Debate (on motion by Mr Francis) adjourned.",54
157,Unknown,AUSTRALIA N,"Sitting suspended from 5.22 to 8 p.m. NA AGREEMENT BILL 1946. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 2nd August (vide page 3630), on motion by Mr. WARDThat the bill be now read a second time.",54
158,Mr MENZIES,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Kooyong-^Leader of the Opposition) [S.0] - This bill, agreement had been reached. authorizes the execution of'an agreement substantially in the terms contained in the schedule and relating to the stanwhich dardization of railway gauges in Auspeople tralia. It is quite safe to say that is the biggest single public works project that has ever come before this Parit. liament. It is a vast scheme, full potentialities in each direction; but unfortunately, the bill has been presented to the Parliament in the dying moments of the session. I protest, against the duction of a hill of this kind so recently last Friday with the idea that, it shall fully discussed by the Parliament this week. It is no answer to my protest that the Parliament may meet next week, because all honourable members know it will not. The date of the election having been stated, this Parliament will some time, tomorrow. During this week, we have sat morning, afternoon, night and early morning, and, speaking for myself, I have found iton completely impossible, having regard to penthe great pressure of. the programme before us, to devote any proper conin'receipt sideration to this scheme. The problem of standardizing railway gauges is one about which no mere layman will speak too dogmatically. It has been the subject of investigation by Sir Harold Clapp. . Asone who, for two or three years had the pleasure of being Minister for Railways when Sir Harold the Clapp was chairman of the Victorian Railways Commissioners, I say at once, that I regard him as being without any in superior among railway men in Australia. Any report which Sir Harold makes on of a railways matter is one which must command profound respect. He is-and I desire to make my view abundantly clear on this matter- a very competent and entirely honest servant of the people of Australia. After his report had been produced last year,. negotiations began between the Commonwealth and the States. Those of us who sit in the Parliament have merely read from time to time that the standardization of railway gauges has been discussed at conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers, that the Minister for Transport in this Parliament (Mr Ward) was in conference with. Ministers in various States, and ultimately, that an That agreement was presented to this Parliament a few days ago. It is an agreement requires for the satisfaction of the of Australia very close examinathis tion. In the first place, Western Australia and Queensland are omitted from That, in itself, calls for some conof sideration, because the case for the standardization of railway gauges,.insofar as it rests upon-the defence of Australia, is one which ought to speak most elo- . introquently in Queensland and Western as Australia. In other words,- the nearer be you get to the extremities of Australia, the more important does it become to to say have a most rapid and safe means of - militarytransport and disposition. And that yet, when the agreement reaches us, Western Australia and Queensland are-omitted from it ! In effect, it is an Agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, 'Victoria and South Australia. The second feature of the agreement is that it involves the expenditure of a very large sum of money. When Sir Harold - Clapp's report was produced originally, it was seen.that if the complete scheme that he had in mind was to be undertaken, it would involve an expenditure of nearly £200,000,000. This particular scheme for which the bill provides, is expressed in terms of about £50,000,000 for. the three States. Members of the Opposition are fully conscious of the advantages that would flow from a uniform system of railway transport in Australia. In particular, we are fully conscious of the fact that, one of the vital elements of this scheme, and the Minister himself made it clear - that he so believed, is that we should have a .standardization of rolling-stock and - equipment so that we may effect real - economies. We are conscious of all those things; but we are also conscious that at - this time, as we look to the future development and growth of Australia, all proposals for the expenditure of loan moneys must be judged by one simple - test, namely, will the expenditure of the money contribute, in an immediate and - powerful sense, to the development of Australia? Will it mean that we shall produce more goods and more wealth in Australia ? It is not sufficient merely to say that standardization of railway .gauges will facilitate the transport of the .goods which we now produce. The vital thing is that we shall produce more. I offer no view as to where, in any proper - table of priorities, this scheme should find a place. I can very well imagine - that we may be confronted with problems of water conservation, the development of the coal industry, the generation and - distribution of electric power and light to - the country areas, the standardization of railway gauges and the development of the fishing and shipbuilding industries. Whatever they are,, we believe that 'that we must judge them all according to what they will produce for the Australian people. Therefore, the whole problem becomes a problem of priorities-to use a word with which we Siave become almost deplorably familiar during the war. I should have liked to be able to ponder this problem, analyse it with care, and work out where the standardization of railway gauges comes into that picture; but I confess that, being one human being, I am not able, when we have this crush of work at the end of the session, to devote the time that is needed for a thorough examination of the bill and the agreement, and a complete exposition of the good and bad points, if it has any bad points. The truth is that the Government-and I am not telling it something of. which it is not conscioushas the numbers. It knows that when the House rises tomorrow, the bill will be well on the way to the statute-book.",54
159,Mr LEMMON,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Hear, - hear!",55
160,Mr MENZIES,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Therefore , as my genial friend from Forrest will at once agree, what is the use of arguing about it? All I can say is that while I view with unfeigned re.spect the material that-was presented to us some time ago in the form of the report on the standardization of railway gauges, I for one desire to reserve my liberty of action in the future to determine at any moment how the moneys of this country shall be spent to the best advantage; because unless the expenditure produces development for Australia, we shall have no progress, and, without progress, all the talk in the world about other things' will not matter a great deal. Therefore, I do not propose' to discuss 1 this bill. I do uot feel qualified to examine the financial implications of this agreement. I do not know that any other honourable member will consider that he has had a reasonable opportunity to discover its financial implications. , Mr ANTHONY - We have not been able to obtain a copy of the Minister's second reading speech. Mr MENZIES:- I was more for. tunate than the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), because, as the leader of a party, I am graciously accorded the privilege of having what are called the "" flats "". The only handicap about that is that whilst I am able to read the Minister's speech when he introduced the bill. T am warned, in rather threatening language, that this is a confidential document and not to be quoted from. I read Sir Harold Clapp's report when it was produced, and. yesterday I read the Minister's second-reading, speech in the "" flats"". This session has been a very busy one, and to-night the bill is before us. .We have coped with other measures during the day, and we have to cope with a dozen other measures before breakfasttime. Guilty of many crimes, as I understand I am supposed to be, the crime of flogging a dead horse will not be numbered among them.. Therefore, speaking or behalf of the incoming government, I say that we reserve our judgment.",55
161,Mr DRAKEFORD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"MaribyrnongMinister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [8.12] - Thos e honourable members who had the opportunity to hear or read the second-reading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) must consider that they should congratulate him ,on having achieved an agreement for the standardization of railway gauges .which preceding governments either failed to achieve or were not interested to achieve. As one who has been associated with rail transport over a long period, I offer to him my hearty congratulations upon having succeeded in bringing at least the Commonwealth and three States into line on one of the most important matters with which this Parliament has had to deal for many,years.",56
162,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,How does the honourable' member for Bass (Mr. Barnard) view the omission of Tasmania?,56
163,Mr DRAKEFORD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Tasmani a is in a different position from that of the other States. I do not share the fears of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) that the Government may experience difficulty in inducing Western Australia and Queensland to agree to himself. the scheme. The Government would have been foolish to adopt the attitude that because those two States were yet prepared to be parties to the ment, it should abandon, temporarily, the whole proposal. I hoped that the Leader of the Opposition would agree to the bill, but apparently he examined in a judicial manner and had more regard for not prolonging the debate unduly than for the merits of the bill.",56
164,Mr MENZIES,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,I do not understand why the Government is in such a hurry to pass the bill. Does it feel uneasy about the result of the forthcoming elections?,56
165,Mr DRAKEFORD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Not at all. The incoming government will continue the good work-wor k which previous governments failed to do, although they had the opportunity at a period when the standardization of railway gauges would have provided employment for many people. This Government had the foresight to realise the importance of this great national work and obtain authority to begin the work which previous governments should have undertaken in ' the interests of the country. I agree with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition about Sir Harold Clapp. Having worked under his authority, and with him, I believe that he is one of the greatest railway authorities that Australia has ever had. We all know that what Sir Harold Clapp says can be relied upon as being a thorough and efficiently prepared statement of the facts. I read his report with great interest. Of course it did not settle the matter. It remained for the Minister for Transport, to secure some kind of agreement among the governments concerned. He has achieved an agreement, and it is largely due to hi? patience that this bill is before us. The honourable gentleman has not always heen .credited with patience.",56
166,Mr MENZIES,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,O r tact!,56
167,Mr DRAKEFORD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Bot h tact and patience were required,- and also courage to attack the problem which had been brushed to one side on so many occasions.",56
168,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,If the Minister continues in this strain for another five minutes his colleague will not know,56
169,Mr DRAKEFORD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"The honourable . ' gentleman who has interjected never not knows from minute to minute what agreehe will say next, and to his colleagues he is equally unpredictable. The Leader of the Opposition said that one simple test that should be applied to this it proposal is whether it willbring about the production of more goods and more wealth. I know of no other project which will help so much as this will to bring about better conditions throughout Australia. I shall show that production is largely dependent on transport. W it hout doubt the standardization of our railway gauges - will help to develop industry in this country. The honourable gentleman referred to priorities. I wish to make it clear that, although this bill will go on the statute-book, the work will not necessarily have No. 1 priority. The right honourable gentleman spoke about priorities in certain matters. Housing, of course, must be given a high priority though he did not mention it .",56
170,Mr MENZIES,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"It is one that I had in my mind, naturally.",57
171,Mr DRAKEFORD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"I should cer- tainly have thought so. The right honorquently able gentleman mentioned water storage, electric power, the fishing industry and certain other matters. These all are of great importance, but the first thing we should do is to ensure that our transport system, is elastic enough to ensure the rapid transport of goods, the production of which has increased so greatly as the result of five years of Labour adminissystem. tration. The Minister for Transport ably ways, stated the Government's case for the standardization of railway gauges, and he also praised the comprehensive informative report of the DirectorTwo General of Land Transport. Honourable members have had copies of that, report and have had ample time in which to study it . I need scarcely take up the of the House in a recapitulation of the history of this subject. It is one with which I and. those of my colleagues who have been most closely concerned, have spoken in this House on numerous occasions. Both profit and conviction will found in a close examination of the case as it has been consistently submitted us.to the House for many years. In 1938 I charged the Government then in office with the serious offence failure to give effect to the promise of its Prime Minister, the late Mr . Lyons, four years earlier, to underevery take this work as one of its major' schemes for the relief of unemployment. In 1921 a royal commission presented report which recommended the construcAlthough tion of a trunk railway line of 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge from Brisbane to Perth and the conversion of the Victorian and Australian railway gauges of 5 f t . 3 in . to the standard gauge of 4 f t . 8£ in. That report - was made after an exhaustive investigation, the value of which has never been in doubt. I recall also that in 1938 honourable members opposite, who were then sitting behind the Government gave considerable lip. service to this proposal but refrained f r o nl championing it to the point of action. I emphasize that point. That was a long time ago, but it is appropriate of the things to remember it now. Basic to consideration of this question, as honourable members have been so frereminded, is the problem of defence. To-day, when we look back after six years of war, we must be shocked - by the abundant evidence of the need for this great national project, and we must, 'also be disturbed by the refusal of governments opposed to Labour to heed repeated warnings of the danger that could flow from our hopelessly unco-ordinated In 1921 the then Inspector General of M i l it a r y forces saidThe linking up of our capital cities by railbeyond striking distance from the coast and the establishment of a uniform' gauge throughout the Commonwealth, are matters and of paramount importance. years later the same officer said It is beyond question that a uniform gauge will avoid many of the disadvantages of possible troop movements caused by breaks of gauge with the necessary transfer from one time system to another. Apart from the delay, inconvenience and the wastage of man-power at transfer stations; the disorganization of units due to the varying capacity of trains of different gauge is serious and may mean considerable delay at a critical time. be I had a great deal to do with rai l transport years ago in the break-of-gauge area, by particularly between Albury and Benalla, and am aware of the dreadful conditions that sometimes prevailed there. In one period it was necessary to transport of fodder for starving stock in the Riverina, and the railways were so congested that t r a in loads of fodder were held up at station between Albury and Broadmeadows. Trains 'had to wait at these stations until those at Albury were a unloaded to' cope with . the situation. that was many years ago it demonstrated to me then how necessary was' the standardization of our railway South gauges as soon as possible. How bitter are these recollections! What a price Australia has paid' for neglect to accomplish this 'essential project! I could go on for a long time emphasizing the tragic result of the failure to appreciate how vital this work was to Australia, but honourable members will not require me to do so. It is true that by the grace of God and the aid , of our Allies we overcame our enemies, despite the critical weakness of our rai l transport systems, but who can say what price we have paid for this staggering neglect? On the aspect to which I refer .as exclusively economic, it is worth noting that in November, 1938, Sir Ragnar - Colvin, then First Naval Member, was reported as having said that for every ton - of produce carried on the railways 16 tons was carried on ships between Australian ports. That figure may not be exact in re-, lafion to the present day, but it should give food for thought to the people of this - country. Doubtless some honourable members opposite will find satisfaction i fact that huge profits have been reaped by wealthy private shipping companies to the very marked disadvantage of the <5overnment-owned railway systems, and to the pockets' of the people of Australia as a whole. No honest advocate of the interests of the Australian community can be ignorant of the dangers resulting from such a situation, and no honourable member in this House who is honestly facing the problem can fail , therefore, to support the measure now before us, though we must remain in doubt about the views of the Leader of the Opposition on this subject. We do not know whether he declared himself for or against it , but there was no sign of enthusiasm in his remarks. During the period of the economic depression years ago, many millions of pounds were spent by governments so-called relief of unemployment, time when it could have been used for the highly profitable employment 15,000 men. Had we countered depression with an active of railway construction, involving standardizing of our .gauges, a consequential effect would have been to relieve the people of Australia' 'of a large part of the burden of the unemployment tax. . The enormous social and ecoMr Drakeford. nomie benefit of such relief while the country was preparing for and actually engaged in war, cannot be fully'estimated. In relation to the economic phases of this problem, I direct the attention of honourable members to a highly important conclusion reached recently by the Tariff Board. The board reported, in May, on the efficiency and costs of production in Australian industries. Whilst it did not find justification for a public inquiry, because the response to its invitations by all interested parties to make representations was so poor, it examined some significant correspondence on the subject, in which emphasis was laidon the fact that the general level of costs in Australia was affected by many conditions other than efficiency and costs of production in individual factories. The board reported in part, as follows:Transport Costs - Of such conditions, one of the most far-reaching is transport. Many n the industries, though by no means all, depend for minimum costs on centralized, large-scale production, with consequent costs of transporting finished products to consumers, distributed mainly around our long ' coastline. Before the war, the Tariff Board found that costs of interstate transp'ort were sometimes almost, if not quite, as high as costs of transporting competing goods to Australia from the United Kingdom or North America. The main obstacle in the way of decentralization of industry in Australia is the cost of transporting raw material to; and finished product? from decentralized factories. It also statedDuring a recent inquiry by the Tariff Board into the plastics industry it was emphasized that, in many cases, naturally occurring raw materials for that industry, and for other branches of the chemical industry, are so distributed in relation to each other and to the markets for finished products, that heavy transport costs are imposed upon the industry. I add this important conclusionin In the matter of transport, Australia if at a obviously at a disadvantage with a compact country like the United Kingdom, or one like the United States of America in which of a much larger home market is distributed the over a much ' greater proportion of the programme country's area - Efforts, which the Tariff Board does not doubt are continually being the made, to improve the efficiency and reduce the , costs of Australia's interand intrastate transport, could have most beneficial effects upon the national level of costs. I now invite the attention of honourable members to the obvious relevance of those quotations to this debate. Imagine the effect of the standardization of gauges throughout the Commonwealth on production costs in industry! Consider closely the board's finding that costs of interstate transport are sometimes almost, if not quite, as high as costs of transportof ing competing goods to Australia from the United Kingdom or North America. That is a staggering assertion; yet, there can be no doubt of the board's justification for making it. What a commentary on our transport system! Imagine the relief that will be afforded when the transfer of goods from one gauge to a line of a different gauge can be eliminated! The economic benefit must be immense. Honourable members will understand that I do not claim that the conception of the whole project .of standardizing the railway gauges originated with a few people, but the fact remains that, despite resolutions affirming its urgent need, mostly from Labour sources, years passed without any active attempt having been made to achieve the objective. Honourable members opposite may remind me that the Labour party was in power in 1931. It is true that Labour held a majority in this House but it did not have a majority in the Senate, and in that chamber every attempt to apply a sound financial policy was resisted. This project, which was so 'vital to every aspect of. national welfare, had to be neglected at a time when it could have been accomplished at a cost very i much lower than is now possible. I remind honourable . members that, in the first report made on this matter, the estimate of the cost was £21,000,000. The works then envisaged will now cost £50,000,000 or more. As the Minister in charge of the bill has already done with considerable emphasis, I have referred to the defence aspects, and have placed the burden of blame.on honourable members opposite, for theirs is the immense responsibility, for the crippling effect of the failure to standardize our railway gauges. - Let me turn for a few moments to the experience of other countries. In the early days of rail transport in both Great Britain and the United-States of America, there were many different gauges. About 80 years have elapsed since America mastered the problem of standardization, and more than 50 years have elapsed since similar action was taken in Great Britain. To-day, breaks in railway gauges are unthought in practically every other important country in the world. The people of those countries take it for granted that their rail transport is fluid; that it operates freely from frontier to frontier, and often across frontiers. To them, the transfer of passengers and goods from train to train, because of a change of gauge, would be ludicrous. Indeed, that is how the matter is viewed by those persons in Australia who have been conscious of all that it means. Whilewe have been enduring this truly farcical situation, the railways of other countries, having been standardized, are operated cheaply and efficiently. On the contrary, the railways in Australia, comparatively speaking, are operated inefficiently and very expensively. All who have paid attention to the achievements ofGreat Britain and the United States of America during the war will appreciate the almost incredible feats accomplished by their railway systems. At the same time, Australia struggled along with a crippled transport system-or , should I say, lack of system-prayin g that it would not have to face the terrifying prospect of fighting enemy invasion forces under such an enormous disability. We were spared that. Yet some sections of the community, notably those whose horizon is limited to isolated projects, who have never been able to learn the lessons of the past, or to appreciate the truly national picture, obstruct the essential purpose for which this bill is deigned. No one could regret more deeply than I do the fact that this legislation does not embrace the whole of the Commonwealth. 1 share enthusiastically with the Minister for Transport the hope that Queensland and Western Australia will very soon recognize the urgent need for their participation in its unquestionable benefits. As the Minister has declared, "" the door is still open "". The Commonwealth cannot do more, and the people of those two States must realise the weight of the responsibility that rests on them. Before concluding, I point to the fact that, under the authority of the Labour party, works of this character can be brought to fruition within one's political lifetime. I .remember when this matter was first brought forward in union circles. The union of which I was then the secretary was the instigator of it, by having it included in the agenda for the conference of the Victorian Labour party. That body referred it to the Federal Conference, at which I had the honour of being present as a delegate from Victoria, and it then became a plank in the platform of the Australian Labour party.",57
172,Mr WHITE,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,In what year was that ?,60
173,Mr DRAKEEORD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,It - would be approximately sixteen or seventeen years ago.,60
174,Mr WHITE,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,There was not so much civil aviation then.,60
175,Mr DRAKEEORD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Whether or not the advancement subsequently made in civil aviation could then be visualized, the honourable member and his colleagues, who occupied the Government benches, failed to take action for the standardization'of the railways, despite the fact that the number of men seeking employment was extremely large. I believe that I have shown that the Labour party is capable of achievements that prove beneficial to the country but are beyond the capacity of the parties that sit site, for the reason, I believe, that their policies are largely propounded for them by big outside interests. They may'now be attempting to copy the successful accomplishments of the Labour party. If they are, I congratulate them upon having learned their lesson after so many years. The limitation to which T have referred makes me conscious of a feeling of regret that the measure that we now have before us, which I commend with all the emphasis I possess, does not cover entirely a most desirable project. As honourable members well know, and as I have just stated, this project has been a plank in the platform of the Labour party for many years. The seed was sown in the soilof unionism. From that seed has sprung, and in that soil has flourished, a tree of sturdy growth. This plank in the platform of the Australian Labour party represents a pledge which the party has always been determined to carry out. At last, it is able to give effect to it. I hope that from honourable members opposite, to whatever party they belong, there will be no opposition to the bill. This project will advance the welfare of Australia. It will make our transport system much more fluid than it now is, and will help to reduce the costs of production. Thus the national wealth will be increased, because unessential expenditure on transport will be avoided. The honourable member for-Balaclava (Mr White) referred by interjection to civil aviation as a more modern means. of transport. I believe that both those transport systems can grow side by side. That has been proved in the' United States of America and Canada, where the number of passengers and the quantity'of goods carried on the railways have not diminished in consequence of the very rapid growth of civil aviation. I prophesy, as the Minister for Civil Aviation, that when the railways of the three States that have entered' into this agreement have been standardized, they will not be operated at a loss as they were previously, but that, on the contrary, both passenger and goods traffic will grow, and civil aviation will flourish side by side with the rail transport system. We can be thankful that a comoppo- mencement is being made with this project, which ought to have been undertaken long ago. The result must be to make more secure our future prosperity.",60
176,Mr BERNARD CORSER,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Wide Bay), [8.38 ] - I have listened with interest to the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford), who has come' to the assistance of the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward). We would have listened to him with greater interest had he submitted a proposal for the expenditure of some of the millions involved in this project, on the development of air transport along lines which would have assisted our primary producers and enabled them to market their output with greater expedition and at a lower cost. The honourable gentleman has expressed the hope that members of the Opposition will not oppose the bill'. I oppose it very strongly. He accused us of not having done"" very much in the way of railway construction when we were entrusted with the administration of the affairs of this country. My reply to that charge is that the parties which now sit on this side of the House were responsible for the construction of Commonwealth railways of a value of £17,500,000, which are today a monument to them - The governments of the States also have constructed railways, at a cost of annroximately £400,000,000 and over a distance of 33,000 . miles. These have done a marvellous job, and can claim a large share of the credit for our wonderful war effort. The Minister for Air further 'claimed that this work will obviate unemployment. ""We suspect that that is one of the principal reasons for the introduction of the measure. There is to be an expenditure estimated at over £200,000,000 on what will be largely labouring work. There are many other much more worthwhile undertakings on which that expenditure could be incurred with far greater advantages in' increasing the productivity of Australia and enlarging its population. For instance, water conservation and cheap hydro-electric power schemes, would be more valuable to the defence of . this country than the elimination of breaks of gauge at. State borders, and would make our development comparable with that of other countries. The Minister also said that production costs in industry should be considered by Opposition members. We know that for many years the expenditure on railway construction has greatly exceeded the estimates. I am positive that this £200,000,000, that is so lightly spoken of, will not be the total expenditure on the fulfilment of this desire of the Minister for Transport! ""That honourable gentleman claimed that opposition to the proposal would cripple an effort that was being made in defence of this country, [do not agree with that. Nor do I think that the departmental experts are in agreement with the Government. They have refused to say that this work is essential, or to give to it the value placed on it by the Minister from the standpoint of defence. We admit that a standardized,railway gaufre has advantages. But 3teps to secure those advantages should be taken only when the time is opportune. There are many other important matters demanding attention in this young country, and they ought to be given preference over this project. Even if all the . gauges were standardized, one bomb accurately placed on a bridge would cause the transport system to be interrupted more effectively than by breaks of gauge. I am not denying the advantages of standardization, nor do I want to underrate them, from the point of view of defence and the comfort of our people. But standardization of the gauges will not be the means of providing one additional line of railway, or of bringing one railway station nearer to the undeveloped parts of Australia, which will still be undeveloped when the railways already constructed have been uprooted. The railways of Australia, after having been written down in Victoria and Queensland, are valued at £320,000,000,' on which interest is being paid. If we exclude the New South Wales railways, valued at £152,000,000, and the Commonwealth railways, valued at £17,500,000. there still remain lines valued at . £101,000,000.' Therefore the debt that we shall have to face will be £361,000,000, not £200,000,000. Had the Queensland Government foolishly allowed itself to be swayed by the appeals of the Minister and his staff, every line of railway in that State would have had. to be discarded. Every sleeper, every railway station, every tunnel, every bridge and every . engine and piece of rolling-stock would have to be discarded. The money with which they were bought would still be ' owed by the people of the State concerned, and to it would be added the State's proportion of the debt incurred for the work of standardization. We are one people, and if the Commonwealth incurs financial liabilities they must v.ltimately be borne by the people of the States. This proposal, which envisages the ripping up of thousands of miles of railway, should have received further consideration. The House itself should have more time in which to consider it, and certainly the proposal should have been considered by the Public '- Works Committee. This committee is authorized to examine projects costing over £20,000 which are referred to it ; but here is a project that is to cost over £200,000,000, and it has not been referred to the committee. It has, however, been submitted to a committee of experts, and agreements have been made with three State governregarding ments. When I proposed sbme time ago gauges, that similar agreements should be made to with the Stales for water conservation and hydro-electric projects,by the Minister for Post-war ReconstrucTo tion (Mr Dedman) that it was a probof lem for the Slates; but the Minister Transport has made just that kind arrangement with the State governments, in relation to railways. In all the capital cities and the principal towns, meetings have been held where the .scheme was explained to prominent citizens in an endeavour to popularize it. Some time ago I asked the Prime pass - Minister (Mr Chifley) the following - question:In view of the fact that much has appeared in the press recently regarding proposals the standardization of railway gauges in Australia at a to.tal cost of £20(5,000,0110, will the Acting Leader of the House see that an, opportunity is provided to enable honourable members to discuss the project thoroughly before an agreement is made with the States, so that the proposals may be considered side by side with water conservation, hydro-electric and other schemes? Will the Minister' give an assurance that honourable members will have an opportunity to discuss the proposals in this chamber before any agreement binding the Government to the proposal is reached with the States? To this question I received the following reply :",60
177,Mr CHTFLEY,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"I assume, in the first that no agreement can be made by the States without ratification by this Parliament. Minister for Transport, with the consent the Government, arranged for Sir Harold Clapp to present a report on the standardization of the railway gauges, and the report has only recently come to hand. It lengthy document, and I have not yet had an opportunity to' read it carefully. The of the States.. Government is arranging for the report to be printed, so that honourable members may have an opportunity to study it . The report will be printed and circulated as soon as possible. I cannot say that that will be done at an early date, but the Government will provide honourable members with an opportunity to discuss the proposals. No opportunity was afforded Parliament to discuss.the proposal before agreements were made with the State governments. I was not satisfied with the reply I received, and .on the 23rd November, 1944, I asked the Acting Prime Ministeran the following question :I ask the Acting Prime Minister before any decision or agreement is arrived Mr liernard Corser. the standardization of railway Parliament will have the opportunity consider the project side by side with national works of urgent and great public importance, such as water conservation and I was told hydro-electric schemes? this his reply was "" Yes "". In view that reply, I expected that a proposal, for estimated to cost so much money would, of have received much more careful consideration. I certainly expected that thepromise of the Acting Prime Minister, would have been honoured,"" but that has not been done. Agreements have been made with three States, and now Government supporters are prepared to-night to this hill which will inflict the schemeon the people of the Commonwealth. TheMinister cannot give any assurance that 1 the standardization plan will be comfor pleted at a cost of even £200,000,000. Like most other Australians, I realise the great importance of our railways, and the great task that they performed during the war. No 3-ft. 6-in. gauge railways anywhere in the world could have given better service than did the Queensland railways, nor could better service have been obtained from the staff, from' shunters to office workers. If the Commonwealth really wishesto assist the State railway departments, it should advance money for the duplication' of. certain lines. If there was a defect in place, our railway system .during the war, it was the lack of double tracks over certain The stretches, which led to delay in'the transof port of goods. We should remember, that even under the present proposal, although standard gauge railways will is a be carried across State borders, they will not be carried the length and breadth In his second reading speech, the : Minister said that, during the war, Germany had converted' 12,000 miles of railway from 5-ft. gauge to 4 f t . 8£ in., and that Russia, some time later, had converted them once more to 5-ft. gauge, in addition to altering another 18,000 miles of railway to 5 feet. I suggest that Russia's purpose was not to standardize gauges, hadbut to create a, break of gauge between its territory and that of Germany. Should enemy invade Queensland, the best way to help him to get into New South whether, Wales would be to provide a railway of at standard gauge from one State to the - other. While there existed a break of .gauge it would be impassible for an enemy to follow the railway system down from - Queensland-to New South Wales. This argument was, as a matter of fact, used by the Commissioner of Railways in - Queensland in opposition to the proposal for standardization. There are advantages in a break of gauge, as Russia - discovered. To-day, tbu standard gauge in Russia is 5 feet, but the authorities - are contemplating broadening it to 6 feet - so as to permit the carriage of bigger loada. In view of - this trend, there seems to be no reason why the Victorian gauge should be reduced. The State Railways - Commissioners will want to know why - changes of the kind proposed are to be forced upon them. The first proposal was to construct certain lines in such a way as to drain all the wealth from western Queensland into Sydney. The Minister made it clear that a tremendous - amount of material would be required for this proposed undertaking. He added .that if members of the Opposition opposed this scheme.' they would show that they were working for big commercial interests. It seems to me that the greatest beneficiary under the Minister's proposal will be the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which will supply the iron and . steel .required for bridges and rails. The proposal has found its way into literature, and, in an article published in Australian Background, it is referred to in the following terms:It will bring back a picturesque era of railroad eon< rruetion that will provide enough material for a dozen Hollywood films. tralian forests and plains, mountains and rivers, desert and lush sub-tropical country will provide fitting settings. I do not know what the taxpayers will' think about it, but the scheme envisages the provision of 411 locomotives, 26,000 items of rolling-stock, 850,000 tons steel for metal sleepers and rolling-stock, 12,000,000 superficial 'feet of timber sleepers, and 26,000.000 superficial of sawn timber. This work will occupy the equivalent of 103 man-years. To-day the man on the land is in urgent need galvanized and plain wire, wire netting, timber, sralvanized iron and many other materials, without which he cannot continue in operation, yet when we ask what is being done to speed up the production of these commodities we are invariably faced with the reply that nothing can be done because of the shortage of ma:: newer. If there be such a shortage of man-power for the production of essential ooinmoi'.ities, why should we undertake a i 'h -.trifsuch as this, which v will utilize sonic <>: the very materials which are so urgently needed by our primary producers and our homeless people? Timber is one of the commodities in respect of which there are the greatest shortages, yet we find tha* this scheme will , utilize approximately 26,000,000 superficial feet. While the timber industry to-d'ay is groaning under the weight of the' load it is carrying, the Government proposes to place upon it this tremendous additional burden. Scarcely a city, town or village in Australia is not waiting from day to day for a small ""hand-out"" of commodities in short supply, yet, in order to give effect to the standardization proposals, we propose to expend millions of pounds of money and impose still' further strains on industries already depleted of man-power. The far-reaching proposals in this bill should be given much more mature consideration than time permits at this late hour in the final session of the Parliament. The problem of ll standardization of railway gauge^ s'""Mild be considered in conjunction witn other means for the development of transport, not only to meet peace-time reqiirements, but also for our defence. 1 trust that the Government will be reasonable and defer further consideration of this Ausmatter until a more appropriate time. 1 appeal to other honourable members to express their disapproval of the action of their State governments in becoming parties to a proposal of such magnitude while our industries are still recovering from the effects of the war. South Ausof tralia and Victoria are the only States which have fully subscribed to the profor posal. New South Wales has come into feet the scheme merely for the purpose of having a small railway built, and in order to bring about the standardization of of sdme relatively unimportant tram tracks. The South Australian Government endorsed the proposal in order that standardization of the railway lines in that State might be brought about at a comparatively .cheap cost to the State. The uoAt to the people of Australia generally, however, will be. very high. By linking r.he existing rail-head at Orbost, Victoria, with the terminus at Bombala, in New South Wales, a second rail connection would be provided between Melbourne and Sydney, whicn would improve the rail connection with Canberra, and open up new and rich country. I trust chat the Government will not use its numbers to-night to secure the passage of a measure which has proved to be unpopular in most of the States. We would render a greater service to Australia if we utilized the money proposed to be expended under this proposal on the conservation of water and the development of hydro-electric power.",62
178,Mr MOUNTJOY,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Swan) [9.4] - The honourable member for Wide Bay (Br. Bernard Corser) never - ceases to me. He spoke about - the standardizatransport tion of railway gauges from the viewcost point of a Queenslander, rather than of an Australian. One wonders why is in this Parliament at all; he national matters from a purely parochial angle. He. spoke about the development of air transport as though the railways had served their useful purpose and were no longer required. We have only to look at other modern countries, such the United States of America, to find that the railway companies are spending vast sums of money on keeping their railway systems up to date. That is a clear indi-' cation that railway executives abroad do not believe that the day of the railway, as the most efficient method of transport, is past. But if railways are to hold own against the competition of road and air transportation, they must be brought up to date, and standardization is the first step towards that end. All methods of transport should be developed side by side. If anything were needed to demonstrate the value of the railways, the splendid record of rail transportation over the difficult years of the war, despite the handicap of the breaks of gauge, should be sufficient to convince the most sceptiso. cal. I do not know how this country could have successfully wa.ged the war it had had to depend upon - road Albury and air transport. Railways played an important part in. the development of this country; the building of new lines has opened up agricultural and pastoral areas and assisted greatly in their rapid development, particularly in Western Australia. It is true that some of .the lines operate at a loss, but their usefulness must not be considered solely from that angle. Many unprofitable lines contribute very greatly to the rural wealth of this country. This proposal to bring our railway systems up to date has everything to commend it. Road transportation can - never operate as cheaply as the railways. Would members of the Australian Country party like to pay road freight charges for the transport of superphosphates, wheat and other rural commodities f Recently in Western Australia the railways were in such a deplorable condition that they were unable to carry the wheat amaze harvest to the seaboard, and road had to be resorted to. The for road transport was Is.' 3d. that - a bushel as against 5d. a bushel he over the railways. The honourable views all member for Wide Bay spoke as though we all had dual personalities, with loyalties to the States on one hand and loyalty to the Commonwealth on the' other. We should regard ourselves not as members of the community of a State as but as members of the community of Australia, and consider proposals such as that now before us with a broad national outlook. .The honourable member argued that the standardization of ' railway gauges should have been the subject of examination and report by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public their Works. The Government referred the matter to an expert committee which was best fitted to advise it on such a technical problem. If the proposal h'ad been referred to the Works Committee, that body would have had to summon before it as witnesses the very persons who constituted the expert committee. It is the task of experts to determine matters of this kind; honourable members have not the requisite technical knowledge to do I do not accept the view that if we pass this bill to-night the Minister for if Transport (Mr Ward) will proceed to tomorrow and drive the first doghave spike in the conversion work.",64
179,Mr HOLT,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,When is it expected that >he work will begin?,65
180,Mr MOUNTJOY,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"I do not believe there is such tremendous urgency about it that it will be begun tomorrow morning. I leave that question to be answered by the Minister for Transport. [ am not an authority on the condition of the railways in States other than my own. In Western Australia we are facing a transport breakdown because our railways are worn out. Because of the bad condition into - which railways there have fallen,'it is impossible to maintain schedules and time-tables; locomotives and rolling-stock are in an appalling state. If the railways in that State are not converted to the standard gauge in the near future the Western Australian Government will-be forced to face up to the expenditure of large sums of money to put its railways in working order. In 1929, Western Australia had a record harvest of 52,000,000 bushels, all of which was handled by the railways in addition to. the normal haulage to country centres of superphosphates, agricultural machinery and all the needs of the farming and pastoral community. To-day we find that the Western Australian railways have fallen to such a low level of efficiency that they are unable to handle a 13,000,000 bushel crop. The system has deteriorated so rapidly that the Government of that State will shortly be faced with the necessity to expend millions of pounds' in order to ""nable them to transport the ordinary iroods required by the community. The honourable member for Wide Bay also suggested double-tracking as a means of overcoming some aspects of the difficulty caused by the break of gauge. Undoubtedly, double-tracking would increase the capacity of individual lines, and would enable them to carry more than twice their present loading, but that would only add to the problem of standardization which eventually must be faced.",65
181,Mr ANTHONY,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,The Government of Western Australia is not a participant this agreement.,65
182,Mr MOUNTJOY,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"I am well aware of that. I approach this bill with feelings. On the one hand I am pleased that a start is to be made on this important project; on the other I am bitterly disappointed that the Western Australian Government has not agreed to participate in the scheme. In his second-reading speech the Minister for Transport said It is to' be regretted that Queensland and Western Australia are not included in thU ' plan, and it should be made clear that that if Tiot the fault of the Commonwealth. The door' is still open for further negotiations with both States.",65
183,Dame ENID LYONS,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,Is there any door open for Tasmania?,65
184,Mr MOUNTJOY,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"It is a shame that Tasmania is not connected with the mainland, because, if it were, we should not have continual complaints about its isola- tion and neglect. I understand that it has 300 miles of railways with the appropriate number of locomotives and rolling stock. The modernization of Tasmanian railways will be given consideration. It ought not to be taken for granted that the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge is useless. Plenty of countries operate on the 3-ft. 6 - in. gauge, and if the rails are heavy and the bed well laid and kept in order, big loads can bp hauled by powerful engines at high speeds, and it should be possible for the Tasmanian railways to be brought up-todate without alteration of the gauge. On the mainland, however, the advantages of the standard gauge are manifold. A paramount reason for standardizing the gauges is that of defence. During the war, when WesternAustralia appeared to be in imminent danger of invasion by the Japanese, it was defenceless. We did have the Voluntary Defence Corps armed with shot-guns and broomsticks. In spite, of the-severe handicaps presented by the breaks of gauge, however, the railways did a very good job in transporting an armoured division across the continent. The job would have been immeasurably easier, but for the fact that between Sydney and Perth we have breaks of gauge at Albury, Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie, where the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge begins. I do not claim, however, that defence needs are immediately pressing, because in we are not likely to he at war again in the next two or three years. Japan has been vanquished, and I cannot conceive of any other nation, in the mixed near future at any rate, attacking us. As a Western' Australian, I see immense advantages in the standardization of the gauges. For instance, it would make possible the development of a greater market for our agricultural products in the eastern States. The State is preponderantly a primary producing State. I believe that Sydney and Melbourne are potentially great . markets for our garden produce. The tomato crop at Geraldton, in the electorate of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Johnson) ripens early in - the season. It is picked and carried on the line of the Midland Railway Company to Midland. Junction, where it is transferred to the line to Kalgoorlie, . where it has to be transferred once more lo the East-West, train, and eventually, it arrives in Melbourne after having been unloaded and reloaded at Port Pirie, Port Augusta and Adelaide. then the tomatoes are sold at a good profit. The Western Australian climate and soil are eminently suitable for the production of certain fruits that do not do so well in eastern Australia. Of course, other fruits that we grow can be grown equally well on this side of the continent; but, with a standard line, fruits and vegetables that the starved markets in the eastern States would readily absorb, could be transported across the continent in a couple of days and sold at a good profit to the producers more cheaply than they can be sold under present conditions. Therefore, from the agricultural viewpoint alone, Western Australia would greatly benefit from standardization. I hoped that the first lines converted to the standard, gauge would be from Kalgoorlie to Perth' and from Port Augusta to Broken Hill. That would provide Western Australia with a one-gauge link with Sydney. One of the main bottle-necks in the transport Of troops during the war was the Commonwealth's own line from Port Pirie to Kalgoorlie. It was a bottle-neck because the rolling-stock was only sufficient to meet peace-time needs. The line is absolutely isolated from other 4-ft. S^-in. lines, a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge commencing at the Port Pirie terminal and the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge at the Kalgoorlie terminal. Many complaintswere voiced, in this Parliament Mr Mountjoy. during the war about troops having toundergo the ordeal of crossing the Nullarbor Plain, in cattle trucks. Any one who has made the journey, either in the cold of winter or the heat of summer, know* how trying it is, even in comfortable carriages. However,, as rolling-stock was lacking, willy-nilly, owing to the imminent clanger in which Western Australia stood, the troops had to undergo theordeal. Had. there been .a link with the New South Wales railways system, the reservoir of rolling-stock in that State could have been drawn upon and. the troops saved discomfort. The agreement would, in my opinion, be improved if theRailways Standardization Board had on it not only those persons whose membership is provided for in the bill,, but alsoa member of the wages staff. It is proposed that the board shall consist of a Even director-general, who shall be chairman.. and the following, other members:(a) one person who is qualified in railway mechanical engineering; .(b) one person who is qualified in railway civil engineering; (c) one person who is qualified in railwaytransportation and traffic; and (d) one person who is qualified in. railway finance and accounting. I advocate the appointment to the board of a representative of the workers, a trade unionist, because, although I recog-nize the need for men qualified in the the foregoing callings, I think a man with practical knowledge gained through years of active operation of railways,, could bring to bear on problems that will confrontthe board a wealth of experience. I base that contention on personal experience. The yard of the railway depot at Northam was so hopelessly congested that' the Western Australian Railways Department decided to re-organize it. There was a natural fall in the yard so that when the shunters took the rolling stock out of the sheds all they needed to do would be to give it a heave and it would - run to where required. The engineers constructed the new yard insuch a way that when the job was completed, the shunters found that they had with to push the trucks uphill. .Surveyors and engineers, at the cost of many thousandsof pounds to the railway department, built the yard the wrong way round! Had they had'the advice of a shunter, who knows only two well that trucks run downhill but have to be pushed uphill, they would not have perpetrated that error. Therefore, the wages staff, who are most concerned in the success of the conversion, ought to be represented on the board. In Part IV . of the agreement it is vided that the Commonwealth shall bear the whole cost of its own conversion operations. The States and the Commonwealth are to share on a fifty-fifty and per capita basis the other conversion costs. That would have been of great advantage to Western Australia and Queensland if they had agreed to enter the agreement. I believe that the populous State of New South Wales, since it already has the standard gauge, would have helped to pay the cost of the conversion of the 3-ft. 6-in. ' gauges in the thinly populated States of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, and that the Commonwealth would have contributed more in contributions to the sinking fund on the State debts. What a glorious opportunity has been missed by Western Australia and Queensland! The thickly populated States should, of course, assist in the development of the less fortunately placedStates like Western Australia. One of the reasons for the secession referendum taken in Western Australia a few yearsago was the conviction - in that State that it did not receive from the eastern States the assistance to which it was entitled. Now, when we find the wealthy States and the wealthier Commonwealth coming forward with a gift to the less populous States, particularly Western Australia and Queensland, the gift is refused. That reasoning is hard to follow. In considering the matter of modernizing and standardizing the railway gauges we should also-give consideration to the provision of amenities to the railway workers. Any one who has travelled Across the continent to Western Australia could not fail to be depressed by the - conditions in which the workers on the trans-Australian railway live. At Cook the houses are commodious and neat enough, but - they are of weatherboard, and T do not think that any one who has to live on the Nullarbor Plain should be expected to live in a weatherboard house, even of a good type. I have lived in hot and cold conditions all over Western Australia, and I know that if one has to sleep in the day-time, as railway men have to, the only type of house that is suitable is one constructed of pro- brick, concrete or stone. The railway workers should be provided with stone houses,'which ought to be equipped with refrigeration and other amenities. The dwellings of the permanent-way workers are of a lower standard still. We are apt not to think of the man who keeps the permanent way in order as a railway man. We think that because he appearf to have a job that any one can do, he can. be fobbed off with any sort of conditions. Bad as the conditions of the permanent-way men are on the transAustralian line, they are infinitely worse on the railways of Western Australia, where at the little sidings in the midst of the mulga, hundreds of miles from the nearest settlement, one sees workmen in huts built by themselves with sleepers and with only earth floors. Men should not be expected to live under such' deplorable conditions. So, not only mus't the rolling-stock be improved, but also thcconditions of the workers must be made considerably better. At the railway workshops the hands ought to be provided with better dining rooms. There is an opportunity for us in the development of the railway standardization project to insistupon cutting out - the outmoded two-class system. I do not say that the existing first-class standards are good enough to meet modern requirements. On the "" Spirit of Progress"", which is the only modern train in Australia, not a great deal of difference exists'between the first and second class, and I do not think the Victorian Railways Commissioners would have incurred loss if they had constructed it as a one-class train. I am sure that the two-class system is uneconomic. I bolstered my opinion when I took out the figures relating to first and second-class traffic on the Perth suburban lines. There the trains consist of three second-class and two first-class carriages. Apart altogether from the fact that more secondclass than first-class tickets are sold, if only holders of first-class tickets travel in the first-class carriages, the first-class carriages would be only three-quarter filled and the second-class would be overcrowded. Whether the motive power be electricity of steam, the train carries an unnecessary dead-weight in providing first-class travel. The marshalling of the two different classes of carriages itself an unnecessary extra burden on a railways system. I commend the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) for having brought this bill down. No one can blame him for its late arrival, because no one worked harder than he to get all the States to agree to standardization of the gauges. He has not finally abandoned hope that Western Australia and Queensland ""will eventually see the wisdom of the project,- and come into the agreement. He was however, driven by desperation, - when they hedged so long, and finally, but I hope temporarily, withdrew to say, ""Well, let us get the job started. Let us have an agreement .between the Commonwealth and the other three - States "".",65
185,Mr BOWDEN,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Gippsland) [9.30] - I have no desire to detain the House in debating a forlorn hope, because I realise that whatever is said the bill will be passed. I rise, however, because two peculiarities have developed in the debate that are worth recording. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Mountjoy) as a representative of Western Australia, one of the two States that refused to enter the agreement, spoke lengthily on a bill' providing for the standardization of railway gauges in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, which, with the Commonwealth, will incur the whole cost'of the project. The second peculiarity was the rather painful experience of listening to the Minister for Air labour-; ing valiantly, to justify the expenditure of £200,000,000, for a purpose which no longer exists except in the imagination of certain dreamers. I refer to the so-called defence value of the standardization of railway gauges. In my opinion, it has no place in the logic of realism. I am not the least concerned about the Clapp report. That document is the ""how to do"" rather than the "" reason why it should be done "". The "" reason why "" is for the Government to determine. I do not say anything . derogatory of Sir Harold Clapp. I join with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), in paying this tribute to him, that as an organizer and administrator of a railwayssystem, he is one of the best. He wa*> chairman of the Victorian Railways is Commissioners for years, and there is no reason to doubt his ability in that capacity. However, I would not accept a report drawn up even by Sir Harold Clapp as a reason why we should incur this tremendous expenditure at this stage of our national development. If this scheme had been submitted to the Parliament before the outbreak of World War II . and before we had discovered the effects of aerial bombing and the possibilities of atomic bombs, there would have been some merit in it. But what was the experience of Germany, which has a uniform railways system ? The factor which more than any other defeated Germany was British bombing from bases 600 mile* away from the Nazi railway system. That bombing enabled the Russians to advance, because British bombs falling on the uniform railway system prevented the Nazi trains from supplying front-line German troops. The statement that the defence of Australia justifies the standardization of our railway gauges ' is farcical at present.",68
186,Mr HAYLEN,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,Would aerial bombs be ineffective on the railway system of a country which had a variety of gauges?,68
187,Mr BOWDEN,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"The bombing would not be any more effective, as the honourable member must know. The only excuse for the introduction of this bill if to provide a safeguard against unemployment. If the Minister had admitted that. I would defend and support the bill. But his statement that the standardization of gauges is required in the interests of national defence is altogether wrong. We have just emerged from the most devastating war of all time, and there is no prospect of our enemies raising their heads in the next 25, 30, 40 or 50 years.",68
188,Mr FROST,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,Oh !,68
189,Mr BOWDEN,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"The only threat to Australia is that Tasmania may attack the mainland. With the victorious allied armies astride our enemies, there is no possibility of them raising their heads for a long time. Yet the Minister described this project as a defence measure. I .agree that there are advantages in a uniform railway gauge, even for peace-time purposes. But. I shall be surprised if , within the next ten years, a complete aerial transport system with road-feeder services is not operating in Australia. A few days ago, I. read that the United iStates of America has a transport plane which carries 10 tons of produce-as much as a 10-ton railway truck. The produce.is brought to the airport by road transport. aeroplane could do the same work as many railway trucks could do on a journey of 100 miles. Despite the rapid development of air transport, the Government proposes to. expend' £220,000,000 on the standardization of railway gauges. It is futile for the Minister to say that the expenditure contemplated is £70,000,000. That is merely the first instalment, and the total cost will be in the vicinity of £220,000,000. How can the Minister claim that this bill is a measure to standardize railway gauges when Queensland and Western Australia, the two vital States from the standpoint of defence, refuse to he parties to the scheme? What assurance has the honourable gentleman that those States will come into the scheme, even after the railway gauges of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are standardized? I remind the Minister that there is already a uniform, gauge between Melbourne and Adelaide. The amount of £70,000,000. will be expended on the standardization of the gauges of the middle States,-but there is oo guarantee that Queensland and Western Australia will become parties to the scheme' later. Without that guarantee, the contention that defence demands that this project shall be undertaken has no basis. In my opinion, this expenditure, will be wasteful. The money could be more readily and usefully employed on hydro-electric and water conservation schemes and for the encouragement of migrants in order to increase .the population and development of Australia. Those projects will mean more in our national defence than the standardization of railway gauges. In my opinion, the Government and the Minister regard this scheme as a safeguard against an economic depression. If people are thrown out of employment, this scheme will provide work for them. It may be of advantage to have such a project in readiness, but we should be honest and regard it from, that standpoint. As a.defence measure, it is completely useless, and the Minister knows it. In any war in the future, railways will be too slow - The conflict will be over before they can stoke up an engine. If the Government desires to provide a safeguard against unemployment, it can achieve that purpose by One co-operation with the States in the development of hydro-electric power and water conservation schemes for the irrigation of inland districts. The Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) hopes to induce large numbers of migrants to settle in Australia. Unless water conservation and hydro-electric projects are undertaken, the Minister's efforts will be a waste of time. The reconstruction and rehabilitation of Australia require far more useful works than ""the'standardization of railway gauges. During the last 70 or 80 years, our railway systems have done the job, perhaps somewhat ineffectively, and, in my opinion, they will not be used to a greater degree in the future than they have in the past. As I have shown, the taxpayers' money can be spent to considerably better advantage than in the manner that the bill proposes.",68
190,Mr WHITE,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Balaclava) [9.38] - I do' not propose to allow this bill, which provides for the expenditure of £70,000,000 for the standardization of railway gauges in New South Wales. Victoria and. South Australia, to pass without some comment! The money for this project must be obtained from taxation, and the people are already heavily taxed. I shall review the proposals contained in this bill critically, but constructively. One has only to experience the confusion which prevails at times at Albury-the border station. between the two most populous States-to realise that a modified scheme for the standardization of gauges at reasonable cost would be of advantage. However, the time is not opportune, in the last few hours of the session, to commit the country to such a vast expenditure as this bill contemplates. The responsibility should be left to the incoming government. The Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) pointed out that the first railway - constructed in Australia in 1854.. At that Mountjoy). time Great .Britain was engaged in the .'Crimean War. This session began 18th .Tune, the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. That date, in my opinion, has a bearing on the fate of this Governorable ment. After the forthcoming elections, .a different government will be in office.",69

192,Mr WHITE,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"I propose to show that possible the Government should not use its large majority to force this bill through Parliament towards the close of the session. The proposal should be, and will be, properly considered by a more democausing - cratic government in the near future. of .the railway lines which will be dardized is the link between Perntree - Gully and Emerald. I do not know how many honourable members have travelled on that picturesque little scenic railway, which runs along Mount Dandenong, but there has been no public demand for the standardization of that line. The money required for that work could be spent adequate. co greater advantage on more urgent - national works. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) knows of _ che immense possibilities of the Snowy River catchment area. Hydro-electric power could be generated to supply many - of our factories. At present, parts of northern New South Wales are being ravaged by drought. Water conservation Adelaide. - means a great deal to many of our primary producers - Surely water conservation and hydro-electric schemes should have priority in the list of public works! Enthusiastic as the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) may be for his scheme, I am 'convinced that the people - consider that water conservation hydro-electric schemes should be underbegan taken before the standardization of way gauges at a total cost of over in £200.000,000. I am most impressed ""by the number of ex-railwav emhonorable ployees among the honourable members - opposite, including the Prime Ministhe ter (Mr Chifley), the Minister for (Mr Drakeford), the honourable member for Cook (Mr Sheehan), the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard) and the was honourable member for Swan (MT .",70
193,Mr SHEEHAN,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"They have kept this on the country "" on the rails "". -"" Mr WHITE - The aim of those honmembers should be to retain pas' sengers and freight for the railways, instead of losing them to air transport. Those honourable gentlemen are naturally by their earlier employment, in the same way as. I am interested in air transport. In Australia, flying is at all times and one of our urgent needs is improved airports. At present, the .standard of our airports does not the compare with that of other countries. Essendon, the principal airfield of Melbourne, has been closed for over a month, great congestion at Laverton. The One airport of Sydney, Mascot, is inadequate. stanCasualties have occurred and will continue to occur there because the airfield is unsuitable. Money which is expended on the construction of modern airports is a sound investment. Perth, which ie further from the eastern States thanis New Zealand, requires a' better airport. In addition, the east-west railway is inHonorable members who represent Western Australia electorates would not think of returning to Perth .by rail. Tbey travel by air. Indeed all honourable members use the railways infrequently. Enthusiastic as the Minister for . Transport may be for this scheme he uses a ministerial car to travel from Sydney to",70
194,Mr WARD,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,I travel by air.,70
195,Mr WHITE,RAILWA Y STANDARDIZATION,"Recently , the honourable gentleman travelled to Adelaide by car with the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) and has done so before. pet However, I will not rub that in. Why should the country be committed and to this expenditure? The' railways operating in Australia in 1854;railbut stage coa'ches were still running the 'eighties. I do not suppose there are any former stage-coach drivers among gentlemen opposite; otherwise they might tell us that they are keeping country running on stage-coach Air wheels, and they would be arguing for more and better and bigger stage coaches. The Minister and his caucus colleagues are living in the past. They are enthusiastic about the railways'. I am not suggesting that rail transport should be abandoned; but, just a3 the sailing ship was replaced by the steam ship, so rail transport is being replaced by air transport and road transport. Air transport is outstripping rail transport in these days, and it will continue to do so if the aviation companies are properly controlled, and if monopoly is rendered impossible. Continuous improvement would be assured' in air transport if it were not for the creation of excrescences such as the National Airlines Commission. Nationalization is a fetish of this Government, as is shown by the fact that we are being asked to endorse an expenditure of £70,000,000 'on the standardization of railway gauges as a first instalment. Does the Minister for Transport realise that of all the money invested in transport in Australia only 3 per cent, is invested in sea transport, 6 per cent, in tram transport and 25 per cent., in rail transport, and 63 per cent. , in r-.,&d transport? Does the honourable i;eutlernan know that there were more t.iuck-drivers in Australia thau there are isilway employees? In the United States 'jf America airlines have been developed to a high point of efficiency. Their machines and technical equipment are no better than those of Australia, but their airports are infinitely better than ours.. Motor transport also runs right across the continent, from seaboard to seaboard. Vet motor transport on that scale is forbidden in this country. In order to indicate the difficulties that face the people of Australia in regard to road transport, I direct attention to the following extract from the April issue of the Australian Motorist:NA Business people needing to travel interstate are still suffering the gravest inconveniences. The nationalized railway system continues to fail to meet public requirements. It is quite usual for a business man on a visit to another State to be held up for many day's before he can make his return journey. An example of the problem is the experience of one business man from a northern State visiting Victoria. The only way he could get back was ' to travel by rail to a terminus in Eastern Gippslond and hitch-hike where there were no local service cars and obtain transport where hirecars existed. By this means, he gradually worked his way back, because he could no longer remain idle in Melbourne. If there was any one connected with politics who cares for public needs some steps would have been taken to arrange for interstate motorbus services, even for a short period of'three tosix months, or a lesser period, to get stranded people back to their home State. We have some excellent passenger train* in Victoria, but a great deal more should be. done to encourage road transport. Even in this regard, Victoria is in a better position than some of the States, for road trains have been introduced in the districts abutting on Port PhillipBay. Some of the buses operating in that area carry 80 passengers.' Still larger vehicles of trans-continental type are fitted with sleeping-berths, refrigerators and other amenities which may be enjoyed on good railway trains. The point I . am making is that we have noi done what we ought to have done to encourage road transport. We have attempted, to too great a degree, to-concentrate transport on the'railways which are a Government monopoly. I have in mind at the moment an omnibus service' which runs from the suburbs towardsMelbourne, the proprietors of which are not permitted to bring the passengers right into the city. The travellers are clumped at a suburban station and must, complete their journey to the city on overcrowded suburban trains. I cannot understand why the Government should be so insistent on the investment of another £70,000,000 in the railways. The motor industry of Australia has been very heavily taxed during the last six years. The Australian States have collectively received £38,500,000 in motor registration and drivers licence-fees. They have also received £15,300,000 as END. their share of the petrol tax. The total, amount of tax paid by the Australian motorists for the privilege of. driving: their motor vehicles during the last year has been nearly £54,000,000. I appreciate the fact that a proportion of the petrol tax must be expended upon road construction and maintenance, and we havesome excellent roads in this country, but the taxes on motorists are altogether too high. The expenditure which the Government is proposing on the standardization of railway gauges is unjustifiable in my opinion. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, saidFrom a defence angle, railway transport has the advantage of operating entirely on fuels locally produced. He meant coal, but he did not say so. As a matter of fact that particular fuel is becoming more difficult to obtain every day. The position is so serious that the Victorian Railways Commissioners have converted a number of their locomotives to oil fuel. The Minister also saidAny interruption of fuel supplies from overseas would completely cripple other forms of transport.",70
196,Mr ABCHIE CAMEHON,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"Is the Minis-, ter proposing that the rail gauge north of "" the Brisbane line"" shall be standardized? ",72
197,Mr WHITE,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"I do not intend to discuss that subject; but the honourable gentleman's statement in regard to locally produced fuel was ludicrous. The fact that Victorian railway locomotives have had to be converted to oil fuel is known to all of us. Honourable gentlemen know very well, also, that many people have been discouraged from visiting this salubrious capital city, with its wonderful environment, because of its hopelessly inadequate railway service. Ministers use their cars to travel from place to place; honourable gentlemen who repre' sent Sydney constituencies go to and fro by the diesel-driven trains, which do not use locally produced fuel, and Victorian representatives, because they are not willing to sit up all night in trains which do not provide sleeping berths, are glad to fly backwards and forwards by aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force. So much for the Minister's remark that transport can be conducted . on locally produced fuel. We must remember, also, that it takes seventeen and a half hours to travel from Melbourne to Canberra by train, which is longer than some aircraft take to fly from the United Kingdom to America. The trains available for us this side of Albury remind me of Turkish trains. I remember seeing one Turkish railway where the contractor, in order to avoid taking, a. railway track over a mountain, wriggled it across the plain and around the mountain, and so caused heavy extra mileage to - be run on every journey by that route as he laid it on a mileage basis. The Canberra train has something in common, because one comes within 30 miles of Canberra at Yass, yet the capital is not reached until some four hours later. It is high time that more attention was given to the provision of proper motor transport in this country. Overseas visitors to Australia are sharply critical of our archaic transport system. I was looking at some railway locomotives a few days ago on this line, and was surprised to find that they were more than - 50 years old. In view of the great saving of time by the use of air transport it is not surprising that the railways are becoming less and less popular, even when they are available under reasonable conditions, which is certainly not the case at present. In the circumstances that I have outlined, the proposed expenditure of £70,000,000 on the standardization of gauges should he very carefully examined. I realise that there will be a change of Government before this scheme can be put into operation; but honourable memr bers should not"" rush precipitately into a scheme of this kind, merely because the Minister is enthusiastic about it. Steps should be taken to free motor transport from many of the restrictions to which it is being subjected today. Petrol duties and heavy sales tax on spare parts are keeping motor' transport costs up to a high level. The whole situation should be reviewed. We should not continue to spend large sums of money on our outmoded rail transport system. This scheme for the standardization of railway gauges has been hawked round for years, and I am astonished that it should besubmitted to Parliament on the very eve of a general election. We all know that. Sir Harold Clapp, who was Chairman of the Railways Commission in Victoria, is a man with high engineering qualifications. It can be said that he managed the Victorian railways system better than the railway system of any other State was managed. I do not make that statement critically'; it is a factual statement. . Sir Harold has been touring the States lecturing on rail transport. He divided his lecture into two parts: First, he told his audiences what a great statesman the Honourable Edward ""Ward was for having pressed on this scheme for the standardization of railway gauges; and, secondly, he told them what an excellent scheme the Government had evolved. This scheme is, in effect, a gold brick; or perhaps I should say that it is like the curate's egg, good in parts. It cannot be denied that air transport is leaving rail transport behind. Our Lancaster and Halifax aircraft are carrying 10-ton loads; and in America aircraft are being developed to transport loads of 60 tons.",72
198,Mr HAYLEN,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,What about the price difficulty ?,73
199,Mr WHITE,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"No doubt the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) is very ready to assist the Minister for Transport with this scheme,-for probably the Minister has been helpful to him in connection with his travels overseas.. I concede, however, that air transport is more expensive than rail transport. But as our air services improve and our landing grounds and airports are modernized air transport costs will undoubtedly fall.",73
200,Mr HAYLEN,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,Will aircraft ever transport wheat from the farm to the seaboard ?,73
201,Mr WHITE,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"I do not suggest that that is likely to happen. There will still be some useful transport service which the railways can render'; but just as the sailing ships have been superseded by steamships, so the railways will be superseded by air transport. There is room for freight of both types. The point that I stress is that not sufficient consideration has been given to this alternative means of transport. It has been assumed that - because the railways run here and there, prosperity must be increased by their multiplication. That is not the. case. The time factor is important. honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) made the important observation that the railways, being easily accessible to an enemy, could be readily destroyed. That is particularly true of marshalling yards. The principal objects to which bombers directed their attention in Europe, and especially in Germany, were marshalling yards. Who knows what [145 ] form the next war will take? Meteor aircraft, of which there is only one in Australia, can fly from Melbourne to D arwin in. eight hours, and from Mel(bourne to Adelaide in 90 minutes. Does any honourable member consider 'that a future war would be comparable with World War I . or World War II . ? The atomic bomb has completely revolutionized warfare. The bomb of that type dropped on Hiroshima killed 80,000 persons .over a level expanse of 10 square miles. What damage would be done by 100 bombs of that type, dropped by a light aircraft? I am not conjuring up a Jules Verne dream of what is likely to happen 100 years hence but which is possible today. There is talk of transporting troops by rail to Darwin. A light bomber or a fighter aircraft could take off from another continent, fly in the ""stratosphere, reach Australia, hit its target, and practically obliterate a city before defensive preparations could be made. The defence factor stressed a decade ago - by military and political leaders is very much out-dated today. In the last stages of World War II . , did railways save Germany? . They were a handicap. Nor did they help Montgomery and' Eisenhower to move their armies across Europe. They had a continuous stream of motor transport, which passed through French and Dutch territory into western Germany, carrying supplies to their armies. Railways are too static for the transport of armies, except in regard to Some supplies. What I am trying to prove is that there are more modern alternatives. The Government will be, not unprogressive, but actually retrogressive if it persists with this project. I exhort the Minister to consider an amendment or qualification of it. If he travels extensively by alternative transport, he will agree that it has greater prospects of development than have the railways. The Many of the invasion troops taken into Holland and France were carried in gliders towed by aircraft. The transport of squadrons was not undertaken in the United Kingdom by the stupid means that were followed in Australia. Halifaxes, with gliders attached to them, . shuttled - forward and back in a manner that was bewildering to those who thought only in terms of railways or the stage coach. The Government is going too far in attempting to obtain approval of the expenditure of £70,000,000, which wil l be only a fraction of the larger amount of £200,000,000, which eventually will be expended.. When authority is given to' a government to expend money, it feels obliged to go ahead with the expenditure. If to-night authority is given for the expenditure of £70,000,000, after-the next general elections we shall be attacked by the Labour party, the members of which will say, "".Here was a great labour-providing, progressive scheme which these men have jettisoned, thus throwing men into unemployment."" The Government has not the slightest imagination. It could provide considerably more employment in the motor and aircraft industries, in water conservation and irrigation, and in many other ways. It could even reduce taxes, and thu3 make for greater prosperity than will be gained by this railway outlook which I am afraid dominates theminds of so many of its members.",73
202,Mr ABBOTT,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"New England) [10.7]. - I have known Sir Harold Clapp for many years, and join with the Leader of the Opposition . (Mr Menzies) and the .Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) in paying tribute to his great skill and ability as a railway engineer and a planner of railways. The feature of this proposal which strikes me is that his plan for the. standardization of the railway gauges of Australia is to be completely emasculated under the agreement that has been made with three of the - States. The failure of the Queensland Government to become a partner in the proposal will have the result that the'whole of the western .system envisaged in the report of Sir Harold Clapp, running from Bourke through Barringun and the western part of Queensland, and joining a line running across to M t . Isa, thence to Birdum and Darwin j and on the cross of the "" T "" back to Townsville, will be scrapped. One of the great merits which primary producers at least saw in that proposal was that it would be of tremendous assistance to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland in times of drought. Its construction would have enabled cattle to be taken from the western slopes of Queensland, and the Northern Territory, into the fattening country in New South Wales and Victoria, af ter which they could be taken to the great metropolitan markets of Sydney and Melbourne. Sir Harold Clapp has laid particular stress in his report on the evidence given by Mr . Tancred,. of Tancred Brothers, who treat a large number of stock at their Bourke meatwbrks, frequently sending motor lorries with trailers attached 200 miles from the works to collect sheep. Sir Harold said in'his reportI have also had discussions with leading individual pastoralists with interests in central and western Queensland who favour the proposal for the reasons indicated. Mr. 0. E. Tancred, part proprietor of the Bourke meat works, considers that the line, if constructed, would he a commercial proposition. He stated that if the facility were available to move stock by rail from central and western Queensland to New South Wales, he would truck to Bourke approximately 400,000 sheep and 40,000 head of cattle each year from areas north of Cunnamulla. Mr Tancred said that last year he trans ported 150 000 sheep by motor truck from the Ciiiinamulla. area of Queensland to Bourke, New South Wales, and the total road motor mileage run in that year by his fleet of ten live-stock trucks (each carrying 300 sheep) was 185,000 miles. Under the agreement with New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, the railway will come to a dead-end at Barringun, on the. border . of New South Wales and Queensland. It will be utterly useless unless it is continued farther to the north. That is one feature of Sir Harold Clapp's plan which has been emasculated. On to another portion of his scheme has been tacked a completely new proposal which he did not recommend. The Minister for Transport, in his second-reading speech, built up a great case for the standardization of the railway gauges of Australia in the interest of the defence of the Commonwealth. The honourable gentleman said:It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the Minister for the Army, in response to a request for an opinion by Sir Harold Clapp, stated in regard to the proposal to standardize the railway gauges that the defence aspect of this problem is of vital importance, if, indeed, it does not of itself present real justification' for an undertaking of such magnitude in thefield of post-war construction. Railway Standardization .Apparently, Sir Harold Clapp's plans were drawn in the interest of the defence of this country in collaboration with the defence chiefs, yet they did not envisage the proposal embodied in the Schedule, Part III . , clause 10, paragraph e, which readsConversion to standard gauge of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge lines of the Commonwealth Railways from Port Augusta to Alice Springs, the conversion to standard gauge of existing locomotives and rolling stock suitable for conversion . . . "" WTiat Sir Harold Clapp said in regard to that proposal will be found at page 10 of his report. It .is in these terms-:That the conversion to standard gauge (4-ft.' 8i-in.) of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge Central Australia railway (Port Augusta-Alice Springs) and the extension thereof beyond the - existing terminal at Alice Springs be deferred indefinitely. Under the proposal of the Government, that railway is to be built. ' It is to go beyond Alice Springs, because the agreement provides for the construction of a new standard gauge railway from Alice Springs to Birdum, and the construction - of the standard gauge locomotives and rolling stock necessary to operate this line. The line from Birdum to Darwin is to be converted to the standard gauge. But apparently the connecting line from the Queensland system, which was regarded as of supreme importance from the defence point of view, has been abandoned. Therefore, in future, troops being moved from Sydney to Darwin will have to be taken through Melbourne, Adelaide - and the centre of Australia, unless they .are flown there. It is strange that the Minister did not, in his second-reading - speech, mention one word about this vital alteration of Sir Harold Clapp's plans, .and the large additional expense that will be entailed, as well as the curtailment - of the defence requirements of Australia. [ imagine that there must have been very - difficult bargaining even with the three 'States whose representatives-the Minister managed to assemble at the conference, in order to secure approval of this railway from Port Augusta to Alice Springs, ;and the construction of a new line of - standard gauge from Alice Springs to Birdum and thence to the north of Australia- a line that was not reported upon - favourably by Sir Harold Clapp, or, so far as I can learn', by any of the other [8 AUGUST, 1946.] Agreement Bill 1946- 4069 railway authorities in the. C.ommon- wealth. This is a sop to South Australia, in order to g r at if y the Minister's vanity. It is a great pity that these lines were em-' bodied in the scheme when Sir Harold Clapp was so strongly opposed to them, and, according to military .authorities, they have no defence value. I want to make some comments on the cost of .these proposals, though not in terms of finance. As I view the matter, Australia has not sufficient manpower to undertake this enormous conversion of railway gauges and the building of the necessary new stock, without - sacrificing the requirements of the people in a hundred and one other ways that are more vitallyimportant at the present time. The cost of the scheme is estimated to be £70,000,000. On the basis of the basic wage, it would appear that for the next six years there will be from 33,000 to 34,000 men engaged on these-vast projects. But I do not propose to state the matter in that way, because many of the men employed in the scheme in a skilled capacity will - receive higher than the basic wage. At page 83 of his report, Sir Harold Clapp has estimated the additional man-power"" that will be required each year by the railway departments in carrying out proposals "" A "" , "" B "" and "" C "", including the associated works referred to in Part III. Additional to those are the proposed railway from Alice Springs to Birdum and the conversion of the line from Port Augusta to Alice Springs, which Sir Harold Clapp did not envisage. It appears that the times which, it is estimated, will be required to complete the different items are, six and a quarter years for item 2, seven years for item 3, and six and a quarter years for item 4. No estimate is given in respect of the railway through Central Australia. It further appears that at least 10,130 men will be required from the beginning to the completion of the works in the next six years. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) recently cited figures showing that about four weeks ago there were 11,000 persons unemployed in the Commonwealth. Since then,-the number has decreased to 4,000. The Government's house-building programme has completely broken down, owing to the lack of man-power generally and of skilled tradesmen particularly. There is a failure to supply to the primary producers galvanized iron, wire and the farm implements that they need in order, to raise their properties to a high degree of productivity, and generally to place them in order after the neglect of the war years, when maintenance and improvements had to be deferred. There is an enormous shortage of man-power in Australia at the present time, even for the production of the consumer goods that are required by the people. There is a tremendous demand forman-power in the building trades, and in all the ancillary trades which provide the requirements of housebuilders. The position will be accentuated by the demands that will be made on the available man-power resources by the scheme that has been brought forward by the Minister for Transport to-night. Let me enumerate some of the requirements in the way of steel, materials and skilled labour which the plan envisages for Victoria alone. They are as follows :(</-) Construction of 255 locomotives. (6) Construction of 250 cars and vans and 3,770 wagons, &c, 1,304 bogies, 24 car underfrajnes, 42 rail motors, trailers, &c. (c) Coupler conversion of all stock suitable for gauge conversion.' (d) Additional plant and equipment for work-shops generally. (e) New locomotive depot at South Kensington. All this work must necessarily effect bousing. Hundreds of thousands of perscheme sons will not be able to get houses if this vast railway reconstruction scheme proceeded with in the near future. We are faced with the need to provide for hydro-electric development in various parts of the country. Owing to the foreposed sight of the 'Stevens-Bruxner Governdization ment, arrangements have been made for the construction of - five large dams New England. The present Labour Prementioned mier, Mr MCKell, is about to turn the first sod of the Glentown dam on upper Hunter, and the full scheme is explaced pected, when completed, to irrigate 60,000 acres of land. On this land will be grown fodder that can be used to prevent the appalling losses among stock which occur when there are droughts in New South Mr Abbott. Wales and western Queensland. How-, ever, those water schemes cannot be developed if the railway reconstruction scheme makes such a tremendous demand on materials and labour. Another irrigation proposal has been mapped out in the Namoi Valley, and the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) envisages the construction of a hydroelectric scheme on the Clarence' River. This hydro-electric scheme would eventually be linked up with the main coai and power resources of the eastern seaboard, including those at Brisbane and Newcastle, and at Bunnerong in Sydney. We have all heard of the Snowy River scheme, under which it is proposed to divert the Snowy River through a tunnel 15 miles long, into the Murrumbidgee River. I believe that it is necessary to standardize our railway gauges, but the work should not be undertaken at the . cost of depriving the community of houses and consumer goods. We have been told that Australia is short of 250,000 houses. Even before the war, it was necessary to construct 40,000 houses a year to meet requirements, and at the present time, in order to overtake the demand, between 60,000 and 70,000 houses a year should be built. However, it will be impossible to carry out such a housing programme, and to develop water conservation and hydro-electric schemes, if the Governments' proposed railway standardization scheme is proceeded with immediately. I hope that the Minister will assure the House that there is no .prospect that the Avill be undertaken while people are without houses, and while rural areas is lack hydro-electric services.",74
203,Mr ANTHONY,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"Richmond) [10.25]. - The amount of money which it is proto expend on this railway standarscheme varies in the estimate of every speaker from the Government side. in The Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) £50,000,000, hut others have mentioned other amounts. This is one of the the most important works proposals before Parliament for a long time, but I was unable to obtain a copy of the Minister's second-reading speech, although the practice is to make such copies available. Without a copy it is impossible for honourable members to follow, by merely listening to a speech, complicated details and involved groups of figures. Apparently, the proposal is to spend £50,000,000, although the Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) mentioned £70,000,000. The standardization of the gauge of interstate railways has much to recommend it. The proposal has been r-onsidered by. various authorities for many years. Long before the recent war, it was considered essential for the defence of Australia that there should be a standard-gauge railway between Brisbane andPerth, but the war came before anything was done about it. The only real progress towards achieving this end was the construction of a standard-gauge line between Kyogle and South Brisbane. At that time, Mr .S. M . Bruce was Prime Minister, and the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) was his deputy. The existence of this link was of great value during, the war in the movement of troops and supplies. Without it, much greater difficulty would have been experienced in sending our forces into northern areas. However, since the termination of the recent war, there has been a shift of opinion on the subject of defence measures, due largely to the advent of the atomic bomb. Nations do not now think in terms of huge masses of infantry pitted against one another, but rather in terms of small, well-trained and well-equipped mechanical units, technical units, and chemical units which could wreak untold havoc on an enemy before he had time to bring masses of troops into position. Any one who has studied the recommendations of the American general staff to the Committee on Military Affairs must realise that, in a future war, it will he a case of a lightning assault by a power using ""atomic bombs and other devastating weapons which will be able to destroy whole cities overnight. They will destroy the war potential of their enemy in a short space of time, before his infantry, artillery and other arms can be brought into action. We must accordingly re-orient our thinking in respect of defence. I do not believe that any one in Australia, or for that matter, in the world, can predict what new methods of warfare will be adopted in the next decade. In proclaiming to the world that the proposal to standardize our railway gauges is primarily a defence measure, the Minister is giving expression, to outmoded thinking. Our previously .accepted conceptions of defence have been relegated to the limbo Of forgotten things; they are as out-ofdateas is the common rifle as a weapon of offence and defence. Although I praise the Minister's energy and aggressiveness in endeavouring to give.effect to this proposal,. I cannot pay tribute to his farsightedness. A few years ago a proposal such as this might have had very much to commend it. I have no doubt that in his reply the Minister will say that nothing was done about this important matter by earlier governments supported by honourable members on this side of the House. That is a form of argument to which we have long become accustomed, but it gets us nowhere. I have examined the excellent report made on this subject by Sir Harold Clapp; it is so technical, however, that criticism by a layman is impossible. If we are to standardize our railway gauges, I have no doubt that the method by which that object is to be attained will be as easily reached by adopting the recommendations of Sir Harold Clapp as by any other means. . I do not, therefore, intend to criticize that aspect of the proposal. I do, however, criticize the proposal in general as having in some respects been made years too late and in others years too soon. As an effective defence measure it is completely outdated, because the war from which we have just emerged has altered our whole conception of defence. For years we had to fight for our very existence against an implacable enemy. Japan, which had been a constant menace to our safety from the time - when I was a small boy, has now been laid so low that only by a miracle can it become a powerful nation again within the next 50 years. We certainly have nothing to fear from Japan for a considerable period of time. Thus we have breathing space to consider what shall be our future defence. I do not suggest that this country is secure against attack merely because it has emerged successfully from a war. Undoubtedly we shall be challenged again in the future, possibly by some new nation rising in the east, possibly by a resurgent Indonesiaj or by another nation which I shall not name. Accordingly we have to lay the foundations for our future defence carefully, completely and with the full knowledge of developments in modern warfare. I question whether the standardization of our railway gauges, a task that will extend over many years, and will cost more than £200,000,000, can be regarded as an effective defence measure by comparison with others which we might adopt. In order to defend this country adequately we must have an increased population. And we can sustain an increased population only by increasing facilities for its accommodation, enhancing the fertility of our soils, providing irrigation, electricity, and other amenities in country centres.",76
204,Mr SHEEHY,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,And improving our railway systems. The honourable member does not suggest that we should scrap the radlways.,78
205,Mr ANTHONY,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"No . I agree that the improvement of our railways is also very important. In his report, Sir Harold Clapp lays stress not so much on the standardization as on the modernization of our railways, to make them capable of providing speedy transport and effective service. In several places in his report, he mentions that it would be useless for the Government to carry out a standardization policy unless it were accompanied by a very strong modernization policy. The Minister believes that this proposal will be beneficial to the nation, and contribute to its effective defence. I join issue with him on that point. World conceptions of defence measures have changed immeasurably since the first atomic bomb was dropped, on Hiroshima. It is to be noted that the Clapp report was made in March, 1945, five months before the first atomic bomb was released upon the world. The. advent of atomic warfare has brought about a revolution in world thinking on matters relating to defence. I have no doubt that when Sir Harold and his officers, and the military advisers of the Government, reported upon the standardization of railway gauges they had in mind a system of warfare to which .we had up to that time been accustomed. As I have said, the most effective way to defend this country is so toincrease its population as to make possible the raising of adequate forces to defend it. At - present we have a population of 7,000,000 to defend 3,000,000 square miles of territory. Ws are incapable of meeting a serious challenge by a powerful enemy unless we have the full aid and strength of co-operative allies such as the United States of America and Great Britain. The effectiveness of the aid which Great Britain could render us diminished very much as the war progressed. All the wealth which the Mother Country had hoarded during the past two or three centuries was liquidated in the short space of four cr five vears. Accordingly, we must combat any future challenge with our own strong right hand. The Government has a responsibility, therefore, to take such measures as will improve the living standards and amenities of this country and create continuity of productive employment, so that migrants may be attracted to our shores. I agree that the expenditure of £50,000,000 on the standardization of railway gauges will create employment for a large number of people for from eight to fifteen years. But what then? This project will not of itself bring us one new settler, or produce an extra bale of wool or a bushel of wheat. If the same amount of money and man-power, the same quantity of steel, iron, cement and timber, and all the other requisites which will be absorbed in the rebuilding of. our railways, were put into water conservation and irrigation .projects, Australia would be able to sustain an additional 1,000,000 people.",78
206,Mr SHEEHY,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,Wit h obsolete railway systems to cater for their needs.,78
207,Mr ANTHONY,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"I am not suggesting that the railways should not be given the attention they require; I agree thai railway rolling-stock in many States - requires renewal. This vast project will involve the expenditure of colossal sums of money. After the first £50,000,000 has been expended another £50,000,000 will be required, until we ""finally reach the staggering total of £209,000,000 Tor a complete scheme. Experience of government projects of this kind leads us to believe that even that tremendous amount of money will not be sufficient to meet the final cost of the scheme. I object to the Government bringing this measure before us in the dying hours of this Parliament.. Since Tuesday we have been sitting in this chamber from. 10.30 a.m. until well into the following morning. Could we, in that way, secure calm and constructive criticism of any measure calling for the. validation of an act authorizing the expenditure £50,000,000 ? Such pressure is not fair to the Parliament or the taxpayers. The Minister said, in - his second-reading speech, that this is.not an urgent proposal, and that if other matters are more urgent they should receive priority. It must be admitted that the most urgent work in Australia today is the provision of housing for the people. The steel and timber that would be required for the standardization of railway gauges would be sufficient for the construction of many thousands of homes. An urgent matter which is second in order of priority is that of attracting large numbers of people away from the urban areas. When we speak of defence measures, we should have regard to the recent investigation by .the Military Affairs Committee in the United States of America. The report of General Arnold, chief of the United States air force, states that in the next war it - will he imperative for that country to distribute its industries so that they will not be concentrated in areas where they can be destroyed by atomic bombs.",78
208,Mr DRAKEFORD,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,Does the honourable member know that the United States of America is now implementing a policy of expansion and modernization of its railways?,79
209,Mr ANTHONY,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"I have said more than oiice that I favour the modernization of the railway systems of Australia, but that is a totally different matter from the expenditure of £50,000,000 for the standardization of gauges. Sir Harold Clapp pointed out that unless a vast sum of, money were expended in modernizing the railways, standardization of gauges would not be of much value. Therefore, I do not favour the proposal now submitted to the House. It would be too much to.ask the ambitious Minister in charge of the bill to withdraw it. He has been working like a tiger upon it for a considerable time. He has not wheeled Western Australia into line although that State has a Labour government. He has not succeeded in bringing Queensland into the scheme, so the only parties to the agreement are the governments of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. In the latter State, not one mile of railway requires standardization. The money of required for the scheme is to be raised, not from Consolidated Revenue, or by taxation, but from loan money, the .Commonwealth carrying the main part of the burden. Half of the expenditure will be incurred by the Commonwealth and the balance by the States on a per capita basis. I am sorry that a measure showing so little imagination as this bill displays has been introduced at this juncture, in view of changing world conditions.. I sincerely hope that, if a new government conies into office after the 28th September, it will review tbjs proposal. The most urgent requirement is hones for the people, and, next to them in importance, we need irrigation schemes and the provision of electrical power for the people on the land.",79
210,Mr WARD,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"East Sydney-Minister for Transport and Minister for External Territories) [10.50] - in reply-Mem bers of the Opposition are as confused in their attitude to this measure as to every otherbill presented to the House. They differ in their opposition to the proposal. Some of them oppose it entirely, and others only in. part. Some merely raise the objection that the bill has been introduced in the dying days of the Parliament, and that, therefore, they have not - had sufficient time to consider it. It is true that the measure has been introduced in what may be termed the dying days of the Parliament, but certainly not in the dying days of the Government, because the present Ministry will be returned at the-forthcoming general elections to carry out the great programme envisaged by the bill. To show how insincere members of the Opposition are in protesting that they have not had sufficient time or opportunity to consider this proposal, one need only mention the fact that, despite their protests, only six of them sit on the Opposition benches at the present moment, when a great national work is being discussed. A great deal of the delay in introducing the bill was due to the fact that members of the Opposition deliberately attempted to hold'up the business of the country for party political advantage. I hope that this scheme - will he proceeded with at an early date. [Quorum formed.] The Leader of the Opposition' (Mr. Menzies), after speaking of the excellent qualifications of Sir Harold - Clapp as a railway authority, pointed out that two of the States are - excluded from the scheme. I remind him that what the GoA'ernment now proposes is almost identical with the original recommendation, of Sir Harold Clapp for standardizing and modernizing the whole of the railway systems of Australia. The standardization and modernization of the systems of Queensland and Western Australia, with the exception of the line through the western part of Queensland and the standard railway connection between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle, are included in the second phase of the plan, which would have been undertaken after the work in' the three States referred to in the .agreement had been completed. Whilst it is to be regretted that two of the States have not yet entered into the scheme, their non-participation has not, to any great . degree, thrown out of focus what was laid down"" in the original scheme of Sir Harold Clapp. The Government believes that within a measurable time both Queensland and Western Australia will come into the scheme to standardize and modernize their railway systems. As an illustration of the good faith of the Commonwealth Government, which has done everything possible to secure agreement with regard to this great work, it has advanced £S2,000 to carry out the survey of a standard-gauge line from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. Although Western Australia has not seen fit to come into the scheme, that survey is being proceeded with, because eventually the whole of the railway systems must be brought into the general plan. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) contended that it is too late for this project to be undertaken, having regard to what is now considered necessary for adequate defence. Those who have had the benefit of hearing the views of the Opposition regarding this Mr Ward. great national project, must have been so depressed by the opinions advanced that when they get the opportunity on the 28th September, they will vote to return the present Government to power, because they .will recognize the dreadful alternative which is offered to them. The honourable member for Bala' clava (Mr White), the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden), and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) advocated the scrapping of the present railway system. What greater tragedy could befall the country than to have in charge of its affaire honourable members who believe that the railway systems are so out-moded that' they should be scrapped? The honourable member for Balaclava admitted that £320,000,000 has been invested in the State railway systems. He contended that air transport is now.rapidly transplanting rail transport, and that, therefore, the railways should be scrapped. The Government is not opposed to the development of air transport. The measures passed by this Parliament recently .'proved that it regards air transport as a vitally important factor in the economy of the country. The honourable members to whom I have referred would scrap the government railway systems and leave this country saddled with an enormous debt in respect of which a large sum would have to be paid annually in interest. Their action would on the one hand leave the people burdened with a huge debt in respect of railway expenditure, and by the development of air transport by private enterprise would bring about a financial collapse in all States of the Commonwealth. Let us consider whether railways as a means of transportation are out-moded. Nobody can tell - with certainty what will be required in the way of defence measures twenty, 30 or 40 years ahead. Should we stand still and do nothing in the matter of defence? That is the mentality which produced "" the Brisbane line"" strategy, for which members of the Opposition were responsible. The Opposition's policy of ""stand still and do nothing"" is not accepted by the defence authorities here or .in any other country. Let us examine what happened in other countries during the war. In the United States of America, 97 per cent, of all troops, 93 per cent, of all Army equipment, and 90 per cent, of Navy equipment and supplies were transported by rail. The actual figures are astronomical, and include 39,200,000 passenger journeys on special troop trains, and 737,600,000,000 ton miles of defence freight traffic. In Britain, the figures furnished show that in 1944 there were over 32,000 freight trains used exclusively for war purposes, and in addition 160,000 freight trains to meet other requirements. On special occasions, such as D-Day, 17,500 special troop and freight, trains were run. In all, 3,200 steam and diesel locomotives and 50,000 freight cars were landed in Europe. Evidently the defence authorities of those nations do not consider that railways have outlived their usefulness, f t is rather interesting on this point to uote the following report-in the Christian Science Monitor of the 18th December, 1945:Europe remains the world's leading railway continent. Despite a dense network of highways, admirably suited for mo.tor traffic, automobile transportation is likely to be tailed as much as, if not more, than before the' war. . . . Rebuilding of railroads as they existed in 1039 has been made one of the principal budget items of national reconstruction, estimated at more than $15,000,000,000, for all the continental allies, not including. Russia. That shows that those nations, with their vast experience and development of other forms of transport, are not regarding the railways as obsolete and scrapping them. The important thing to keep in mind in considering the great work of standardizing the Australian railways is that during the war no maintenance work of any consequence was carried out and that, whether the lines be standardized or not, the State authorities will be obliged' to spend millions of pounds on re-sleepering and re-railing the tracks, and in the provision of new rolling-stock. So if is only plain common-sense in my opinion to propose that when thatwork is being done we should standardize the gauges and thereby place ourselves in the position of being able to effect greater efficiency as well as great economies by having standard rolling stock. In considering the additional'cost of standardizing the gauges one must 'realise the enormous savings in operating the railway systems that will be effected by elimination of the multiplicity of locomotives, passenger cars, and trucks. The interchangibility of rolling-stock will make the railway systems - more flexible, making for better service and economy. From what some honourable members opposite have said about the cost of the project, any one would imagine that this country was bankrupt and could not afford to proceed with a developmental programme. The honourable member for Richmond, after telling us how things had changed, said that, with the development of the atomic bomb, all ideas about defence should be altered. Then the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr ""White) said that the atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima had devastated 10 square miles, but he failed to say that within 48 hours of the explosion the railways were operating in the devastated areas.",79
211,Mr WHITE,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,What does that prove?,81
212,Mr WARD,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"That the dropping of atomic bombs does not necessarily mean cur- the elimination of rail travel. The experience of Great Britain, which suffered concentrated and continual bombing during the war does not bear out what the honourable member says. This is what I said about that, in my second-reading speechI t should be pointed out in this connection that all transport facilities are similarly subject to ' this danger, but it is interesting to note that the British railways-despit e 13,800 bombing attacks and the destruction or damage of 4S2 locomotives, 13,000 passenger cars, and 10,000 freight wagons-continue d to function throughout the war. There were of course many delays to traffic, but they were mostly of short duration and usually did not extend beyond a few hours.",81
213,Mr WHITE,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,That is true.,81
214,Mr WARD,INTERSTATE TRAVE L STILL AT DEAD,"That proves conclusively that the railways of those countries, despite the persistent* and concentrated bombing, were able to operate very effectively. Some honourable gentlemen opposite seem to be alarmed when mention is made of the cost of this great national work. It is quite true that under the modified proposal, due to the withdrawal of Queensland and Western Australia, the cost of the work will be reduced to about £50,000,000, with the. expenditure of another £20,000,000 by the ' States on associated works. When considering whether the nation can afford the work, I prefer to consider it, not merely in terms of money, but also in terms ""of men and materials. Honourable members opposite continue to argue that work on the conversion of the railway gauges would make it difficult to undertake other urgent national works, but that is not so. Failure to proceed with the work would not mean a saving of all the timber and steel required to carry it out, becausetremendous quantities of materials will have to be used in any case to restore the railways, to a safe condition. Had we been able to proceed with the whole scheme involving the standardization of the gauges in the five mainland States, in the peak year of construction 17,000 men would have been employed directly,' and another 17,000 indirectly in the steelworks, in sleepercutting, and so on, making a total of 34,000 men. When demobilization has been completed, about 750,000 able-bodied people will have been released from the forces and munitions industry. The contention that the subtraction of 34,000 men from that number to carry' out this great national work would tie lin other activities is too ridiculous for words and will not be accepted by the public. If would be of no iue to have a great' modern railways system operating on a standard gauge unless we also provided for greater settlement in the areas to be served. This would necessitate extensive"" development of water conservation and irrigation, action to arrest soil erosion, and accelerated activity in afforestation. We required those great national undertakings when the anti-Labour forces ruled this country, but what did we get? Nothing' Why, during the great depression thousands and thousands of skilled and unskilled men were workless. All that the Government could offer then was a job chipping weeds from the footpaths in suburban areas in return for sustenance. The anti-Labour forces have never shown any realization of Australia's . potentialities, and the people know that it would be a tragic mistake to place them in charge of Australia's affairs again. I regret the failure of Queensland and Western Australia to join with the Commonwealth and the, other mainland States in this agreement. There are in the two States mentioned men whose parochialism is so great thai they cannot see an inch beyond the boundaries of 'their States, but I am hopeful that when discussions are resumed they will adopt an entirely different attitude and co-operate.. Regarding the query as to where we are to' obtain the money for this work, I would remind those who advance this argument that in the closing phases of the war Australia was spending £1,500,000 a day on defence. I remind the House that we could have made it £3,000,000 a day had that been necessary, but there would have been no purpose in doing so. The point is that by the expenditure of £1,500,000 a day we were using all the physical and material resources of this country. Honourable members opposite seem to think that money is the all-important factor in great national projects, but would any one of them argue that the war would have ended at some particular date because we had run out of money ? None of them would have dared .to suggest that we should sue for peace because we had not enough money to continue the fight. Had we had insufficient men to man our defences and had our munitions factories been razed to the ground or.our people become physically exhausted, those factors could have brought about the cessation of the war effort, but not lack of money. My colleagues in the Ministry need no reminding of the many occasions when we had to consider proposals related to the prosecution of the war. Do. the honourable member foT Balaclavaand his colleagues imagine that after receiving a request for Cabinet authority to build a strategic road or lay down an airstrip, the Prime Minister would have pressed a button and called for the bankers to ask them .whether they could provide the money? No! What we asked was whether we had available the men, the materials and the equipment. Money was . a secondary consideration. Money can be made available for national projects in peace as it was made available for national defence in war to the limit fixed by the physical and . material resources of the nation. This Government, which has a new national outlook, is determined that this country shall be developed in order to provide employment and improved living standards for the people. One honourable gentleman opposite said that the sole purpose of this proposal was the creation of an avenue for the employment of men. If we were seeking to find work just for the sake of providing it, we could set men to work digging holes and filling them in again, but that is not our policy. Our policy is, the carrying out of great national works for the development of the country. The fact that those works will provide employment is. not the only consideration. The useful employment provided a welcome concomitant. I direct the attention of members of the Opposition to the provisions of paragraph 15 of the agreement when they say that the standardized railway gauges might interfere with the carrying out of the States' own developmental projects. It provides that the sent of the State authorities must be given before any section of the standardization of the railway gauges can be undertaken, because, when a proposal for the carrying out of any section of the work goes before the council, comprising representatives of the States, it must be unanimously approved before the work can be put in hand. So it is obvious that the States will determine when the work shall be undertaken, the order in which it shall be proceeded with, and what physical and material resources shall be used. Therefore, there is nothing in the contention of honourable members opposite that this project will interfere with State projects. The honourable member for Richmond, in one of his customary speeches filled with inconsistencies, after telling honourable members that the atomic bomb would wipe out everything overnight, said that our great protection would be a greater population. If everything is to be wiped out overnight by an atomic bomb, obviously a greater population will not save the country. Neither will a standard railway gauge. I believe, with the honourable member, that it is imperative that we increase our numbers, but we must not bring people, from overseas to Australia to put them on the dole. We must provide them with work that will make them useful citizens. We can do that only by strengthening the national economy, and one of the pillars of the national economy is efficient transport services. In that connection, much has been said about road and air services. The honourable member for Balaclava referred to an extraneous matter-interferenc e with a bus service that he was interested in in Victoria during the war. The honourable member should have pointed out that the ban on that omnibus service took place during the war years, when there was a shortage of rubber and petrol. It-was in order to conserve those essential commodities that the Government adopted the sensible attitude of using railway services to the maximum, with omnibus services as feeders. The honourable member put' forward the ridiculous proposal that all the transport needs of this country could be met by air transport. That is the logical result of his reasoning con- against modernizing our railways and maintaining them in safe condition, and urging, instead, the expenditure of the money involved upon the development of air transport. l i e said also that this measure had been introduced because on this side of the chamber are several former railwaymen who have a railways complex. I do not say that the honourable member for Balaclava is an.efficient airman ; he may be. I am not expressing an opinion on the subject, but he certainly has an air complex, as the result of being an airman. The Commonwealth Government does not object to the development of road or air transport. It believes that the four methods of transport-sea , road, rail and air-ca n be developed and coordinated,, and thus serve most economically primary producers and others to whom, an efficient transport system is essential. The reaching of agreement between all the interests concerned ""in the railways plan has not been an easy matter. I regret that there was some delay in bringing the agreement before the Parliament, but that was not my fault, or the fault of the Government. Many protracted conferences were held with representatives of the States, at which efforts were made to reach agreement. When agreement was reached with three States, the Commonwealth Government brought - the matter to this Parliament as speedily as possible. That is one reason why some honourable members were not supplied with copies of my second-reading speech; there was not time to have sufficient copies prepared.' The Government believes that this agreement represents a great step forward. The Leader of the Opposition said that it was the greatest national work ever proposed in this country. I am proud to have been associated with the project, and to have helped to put into action what members of the parties now in Opposition have merely talked about for many years, but never intended to implement. The people of Australia will discover in connection with the standardization of railway gauges and also in regard to other matters that the promises made by the Government will be kept. They will learn that this Labour Government can act as well as talk. The honourable member for New England (Mr Abbott) referred to the North-South line. It is true that a Way through the centre' of Australia was not in the original, agreement, or in the report submitted by Sir Harold Clapp, but after hearing the unanimous views of the Government and the Opposition in. the South Australian Parliament, the Commonwealth Government decided that it was under an obligation to proceed with the construction of that line in fulfilment of the terms of an agreement' embodied in an act of this Parliament passed many years ago - Obviously, from his remarks, the honourable member for New England knows very little about the subject. Had he taken the trouble to make inquiries, he would have discovered that, from a defence point of view, the NorthSouth line has a number of advantages. Compared with the line proposed to be constructed through the western part of Queensland, the distance between Perth and Darwin is 1,339 miles shorter by the North-South route; between Adelaide and Darwin, 1,232 miles shorter; and between'Melbourne and Darwin 442 miles shorter. Between Sydney and Darwin the North-South route is 33 miles longer. The North-South line has much to commend it from a defence point of view, and therefollowing fore, the Government decided to include Mr Ward. it in the agreement. The Government does not propose, however, to construct - that railway immediately, because . the order in which the work will be undertaken will be decided by the Standardization Board and the Standardization Council, on which the States have direct representation. I repeat that the Commonwealth Government does not desire to interfere with other national undertakings, but it believes that it iswithin the capacity of the nation to provide manpower, materials, and equipment for the standardization and modernizing of our railways and at the same time to carry out the other' great national works that have been mentioned.

NA BOUNTY BILL 1946. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 18th July (vide page 2745), on motion by Mr. EOKDEThat the hill be now read a second time.",84
216,Mr ADERMANN,RAW COTTON,"Maranoa) [11.24]. - This is a bill to continue a guaranteed payment that has been made for a number of years to the cotton industry. It seeks to amend section 9 of the Raw Cotton Bounty Act 1940-41. Before the war the Tariff Board investigated the cotton industry on five occasions-1922 , 1926, 192S, 1933 and 1938. Another investigation was concluded in October, 1945. There seems to be no justification - for the procrastination on the part of the Government in announcing its decision, the receipt of the latest report. Australia needs more industries, both primary and secondary; it certainly cannot afford to lose any of its existing primary industries. Consequently, there is need to give a sufficient guarantee to the cotton industry to enable* it to survive and expand. Some primary industries are faced with the problem of finding rrvrkets at good prices, because exportprices for primary products are not always satisfactory. That problem does not confront the cotton-growing industry because there is ah unlimited market for cotton in Australia. The manager of the Queensland Cotton Board has said that cotton-growing is the only Australian industry with considerable, potentialities waiting to be developed in. order to meet the requirements of - the Australian people. The Australian textile industry now uses 32,000,000 lb. of raw cotton each year. In addition, there is a local market for 5,000 hales of low grade cotton suitable for the manufacture of bedding, upholstery, padding, wadding, &c. An additional 15,000 bales of raw cotton would produce valuable by-products, namely, 820 tons of edible cotton seed oil, and 3,000 tons of high protein cotton seed meal. If textile factories were. fully manned, and worked two shifts, the local market would be capable of using 60,000,000 lb. of cotton a year. Evidence tendered on behalf of the textile industry before the Tariff Board showed that it is possible to expand the local production of cotton piece-goods to provide 40 per cent. of. this country's requirements. In other words, about 112,500,000 lb. of raw cotton would be needed for that section of ' the textile industry alone. It will be seen, therefore, that the pre-war production of about 5,000,000 lb. of cotton annually represented only a small percentage of Australia's potential needs in this sphere of primary production. The record Australian production of cotton was in 1934-35, when the yield was 8,769,510 lb. Production was fairly well maintained until last year, when there was a great decline. Very little cotton was grown in Australia last year. Por the ten years from 1935 to 1944 the average yield was 10,127 bales of cotton, but in 1945 the production amounted to only 1,305 bales. The reasons for the fluctuations are set out by the Tariff. Board as follows:-(1 ) The method of Government assistance; (2) the net return per lb. of raw cotton and per acre planted; (3) the stage of development of rural industry in cotton-growing districts; (4) climatic fluctuations; (5) competition of other crops; and (6) government encouragement and discouragement. The assistance which is guaranteed under the present act will expire on the 31st December next, and therefore further assistance is necessary to enable the cotton-growing industry to continue and expand. The Government should have announced its decision earlier. I contend that the decision should have been made much earlier, because if the growers are to prepare their land they should haveknown long before this of the Government's proposal. The granting of assistance to the industry is necessary because of the absence of sufficient protection to ensure that those engaged in it shall secure a price equivalent to the Australian standard. Indeed such action is required in most of our industries which are not receiving tariff protection. Consequently the Cotton Board, which is the growers' own marketing board, has sought a guarantee of stability and has asked for a. fixed price of 7d. per lb. over a period of ten years. I emphasize particularly that this action was endorsed by the Queensland Department of Agriculture. In other words, the Growers Marketing Board and the department considered that guaranteed returns should be provided for a period of ten years. In its original application to the Tariff Board, the Cotton Board did not suggest the level at which rates should be fixed, but at a later hearing it amplified the original application so that growers could be guaranteed a price at a stated level by a parity-price system. Whilst the Cotton Board preferred protection hy Customs duties, it did not request a change; it did not desire to upset the conditions in the industry. It is notable also that .secondary industry supported this primary industry's application for assistance, on the understanding that the method of assistance would not hamper the rapidly expanding cotton textile industry of Australia. We would be in agreement on that matter because no primary industry should be supported in a way which would be detrimental to any secondary industry. In the same way, no secondary industry should have any benefits that would detract from the advancement of a primary industry, because both of them are inter-dependent. The assistance . granted before the outbreak of World War II . was based on Liverpool middling spot prices. The Minister stated that those sales have not been held in recent years, and are not likely to take place again under present conditions. Therefore the government of the day accepts the same basis-a . straight out guaranteed price:-as that provided under the act introduced by a previous government. In my opinion, that basis is satisfactory, provided the price is acceptable to the growers and the industry generally. The Minister made, much ado of the fact that the proposed price was considerably in excess of the amount recommended by the Tariff Board, but I point out that that prevailed under previous governments. The Minister's self-bestowed praise will give no eonsolation to the cotton-growers. Let me analyse the position. The Tariff Board's recommendation, made in 1933 and confirmed on subsequent occasions, has never been accepted by the Parliament. This time, the board made the ridiculous recommendation that a guaranteed price of 3^d. per lb. should be paid on the basis of 6d. Liverpool middling spot, for a period of only two years. How can We secure stability on that basis ? When I study the board's recommendation, I am convinced that it has not a full appreciation of the costs and needs of primary industries. Its recommendations more than justify the attitude of the Australian Country party in recommending the establishment of a board to determine the actual marketing costs of primary industries. On the figures submitted by the Tariff Board, the. results per acre received by producers would not encourage anyone to grow cotton. For the period 1936-40, the average production was 97 lb. an acre. During 1941-44 the average was 9S lb. an acre. But, instead of taking the average in its calculation the board statedIf scrub burn were eliminated, then 120 lb. would be the yield.' Air. Adermann. The board considered that the method of development recommended, namely, dry farming, depended upon achieving average yields of 163 lb. an acre. It is all very well, to have that aim-w e agree that farmers should improve their methods in order to get better results-bu t the Tariff Board based its calculations on an asumption that farmers should get a return of 163 lb. an acre under certain conditions, and 120 lb. an acre under other conditions. If the board's objective were achieved, the returns would produce, at H i d . on a yield of 120 lb. an acre, an amount of £5 12s. 6d., and at lO^d. on 163 lb. an acre, a return of £7 2s. 7id. an acre. Those are gross prices and cannot in any circumstances be considered satisfactory. The Tariff Board proceededThe development plan on which the board's recommendations are based demanded con siderable reductions-in production costs so that the net .incomes to farmers from cotton-growing should be materially higher than, before the war. I direct attention to the fact that this notable board suggests 'that - farmers should reduce their costs. Does the board consider that primary producers are serfs? How can growers reduce costs when ' their gross income is £7 2s. 7£d. an acre, and one-half of that amount is absorbed in picking costs under the award? That justifies my earlier contention that the Government should appoint a board, with status,equal to that of the Tariff Board, to determine a proper method of computing the actual costs of primary industries. The Tariff Board's whole theory is utterly stupid. Its attitude, as revealed in its report, shows that it has no appreciation of the value of primary industries to Australia. The board considered that It is, not proved that cotton-growing, in essential to land settlement. And addedFarmers should be convinced to grow cotton. Farmers will require a great deal of convincing when they do not receive any return for their labour. Let us examine the position on the basis of the guaranteed price as submitted by the Minister. I take for the 1941-44 period the average of 98 lb. an acre. . That, yield, at 15d. per lb., gives £6 2s. 6d. an acre. The cost of picking 98 lb. at 4s. 7d., which is the award rate, is £1 18s. 4d. The net return, after deducting picking costs, is £4 4s. 2d. Out of that money the farmer must provide for preparing his land and maintaining his family. ""Now we begin to understand why cotton production is declining. This can be confirmed by figures relating to a period of 24 years. The average yield is 109 lb. On the basis of the guaranteed return of 15d., the gross income is £6 16s. 3d. an acre. The cost of picking is £2 2s. Sd. an acre, leaving a net amount of £4 13s. 7d. I take the average which, it is assumed, should he the result of the use of good farming methods as suggested by the Tariff Board. The assumed average of 163 lb. an acre at 15d. per lb. gives a net yield, after the deduction of picking costs,-of £6 19s. l i d . an acre. Who would attempt to grow raw cotton, maize or peanuts for a net return of £6 19s. l acre, out of which harvesting costs and living expenses must be met?",84
217,Mr ANTHONY,RAW COTTON,"What is the size of a cotton farm? Mr ADERMANTS"" --The area is not - nearly so large as a farm producing wheat or maize. That is another reason why the grower should have a guaranteed price; without it he will not be able to make a livelihood. So much for the Tariff Board's recommendations. It will be difficult to convince primary producers . that they should grow cotton just because the Tariff Board suggested that they should. The Minister praised the Government's proposal because it exceeded the Tariff Board's recommendation. Whilst the price is in excess of the board's recommendation, it is not equal to the amount requested by the growers' representatives on the Cotton Board, namely, 17d. per lb. for raw cotton, or the equivalent of 6d. per lb. for 3eed cotton. The price of 15d. per lb., which the Government proposes is not sufficient to cover the cost of production and ensure to the producer a reasonable livelihood. The price makes no allowance for the increase of costs since 1940, when the act came into operation. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, costs have increased by 25 per cent. What provision has the Government made to meet them? On many occasions, the Government has referred to the decisions of previous Governments for assisting primary industries. Why does not the Government give assistance equal to that given to the industry by previous Governments,' and thus enable production to equal the output in 1940?",87
218,Unknown,RAW COTTON,"Sitting suspended from 1145 p.m. to 12.15 a.m. (Friday). Friday, 9 August, 19J/6.",87
219,Mr ADERMANK,RAW COTTON,"The proposed guaranteed price is less than the price of 17d. per lb. which the growers' representative on' the Cotton Board requested on behalf of the industry. That price is equivalent to 6d. per lb. for seed cotton on the farm. The price of 15d. per lb. i d . an which - the Government proposes to guarantee will not enable growers to recoup costs of production and earn a reasonable livelihood. The price of 15d. per lb. was fixed by a previous government, in 1940 with the object of increasing production. In the meantime costs under all headings have increased. Therefore, a price of 15d. per lb. will not encourage growers to increase production under present, conditions. Obviously, if cotton-growers have better prospects in other industries they will turn their attention to such industries. They, certainly, will not attempt to grow cotton when the guaranteed price is not sufficient to cover increased costs. ' Therefore, the Government's proposal will not encourage the expansion of the industry, and, consequently, will fail to meet employment requirements in rural industries. Cottonf rowing is a seasonal industry, and it ts in with the sugar industry, because cotton-picking is done just prior to the commencement of cane-cutting. Seasonal workers are thus able to go from one industry to the other, with great advantage to both. If the cotton industry is permitted to remain in the doldrums, the effect will be very detrimental to other rural industries al.=o. Another point is that the Australian price of imported raw cotton is somewhat higher than-the price at which the Prices Commissioner has authorized the purchase of the Queensland crop. We must remember also that raw cotton is imported free of duty. Dealing with the overseas price, the Minister stated that with a home price of 15d. per lb. it was not necessary to pay a bounty to the industry. The Government is keeping down the price to lod. per lb. instead of granting the price of 17d. per lb. requested by the industry, and, at the same time, is refusing to subsidize it. If the Government believes in protection, it must be prepared to pay a bounty to the industry, because, as I have already said, raw cotton is imported free of duty. In this instance the Government wants to have free trade,'and, at the same time, avoid payment of bounty to an industry which it professes to encourage. I understand that when the Tariff Board took evidence the Cotton Board stated that the parity price was 18.8d."" per lb.; and from information I have received, the price has since risen. Evidence given to the Tariff Board showed that at that time world parity of lS.Sd. per lb. was worth more than the price then requested by the industry. A price of 18.4d. per lb. c.i.f. spinners' ports, would return to the growers 17d. per lb., whereas the price at that time was lS.Sd. per lb. Thus, the industry is suffering loss, because it is not allowed to reap the benefit of world parity prices. Cotton enters largely into the clothing regimen used in the compilation of the basic wage index. The raising of funds by means of a sales tax upon cotton goods would have far more beneficial effects upon our economy than the payment of a bounty from Consolidated' „ Revenue. This is a matter of financial policy rather than one of assistance to the cotton industry; but in this instance the level of Australian economy is determined by the price the Prices Commissioner has ruled the growers, are to receive. Because growers are' unable to take advantage of world parity, the cotton industry, like other industries which we have discussed recently in this chamber, will have no chance of returning a payable price having regard to the increase of costs during the war cotton growers, unlike wage-earners, in this country, did not receive any war loading; yet no allowance is now being made to enable growers to meet increased Mr Adermann. costs. At the same time, the industry is not to be allowed to benefit from world parity. I reiterate that point. Therefore, it would appear that the industry is to be ground down to a level which experience has shown will offer no encouragement to growers to expand the industry. The outlook of the Tariff Board has not been favourable to the industry. All governments have refused to accept the prices recommended by the board The guaranteed price of 15d. per lb. in 1940 encouraged growers to increase production to a certain degree, but, today, production is declining. Yet, the Government refuses to meet the present position, with the result that growers will not be able to maintain present production let alone increase it. One must conclude, therefore, that the Government is no more concerned about the prosperity of ' the cotton-growing industry than it is about the tobacco-growing industry which has been allowed to decline until today practically no tobacco is grown in this country. The Minister admits that there is only a remote possibility of a considerable decrease of the price of imported cotton during the next three or four years at least, yet even with the prospect * of not having to pay a bounty to the industry the Government is not willing to grant stability to it by means of a longer term than five years, as has been requested by the - Cotton Board, with the endorsement of the Queensland Department of Agriculture. It has to be admitted that the Cotton Board has attacked production in a practical, way, and has co-operated with the State Department of Agriculture. It has made arrangements forirrigation plots, and has improved dry-farming methods, both of which have proved worthwhile in aiding production. How can the growers be expectedto provide additional finance in order to meet the costs of irrigation and dry-farming methods when they are not assured of a commensurate return? The Minister has drawn attention to the effect of the abandonment of the industry, which would mean the closing of ginwhen neries and a cotton seed oil mill, in which £160,575 has been invested. In 1940, the employment in the industry consisted of 2.700 growers. 1,000 field workers, 2.000 pickers and 170 ginnery employees. The failure to increase the guarantee to 17d. per lb., as requested by the Cotton Board, will mean the loss of another industry, because the cotton industry will then be in the same category as the tobacco industry, to which I have previously referred. An increased crop is the only means, apart from the additional production brought about by irrigation and improved methods, of reducing the costs of handling. It is obvious that when production declines, costs must increase. If the Government will guarantee a satis"" factory price, there will he confidence in the industry and the resultant stability will lead to expansion of - production, which in turn will increase the employment-that will be available at a satisfactory wage. A much-desired product will then become available to the home market, which is unlimited in its demands. The textile industry has stated that it could provide up to 40 per cent, of Australia's requirements. greatest production has been 8,000,000 lb. a year - That 40 per cent, would involve a production of 112,000,000 lb., consequently we are far short of the mark. In addition, security of supply would be given to the textile secondary industry. I repeat, that I cannot understand the Government's refusal to increase the price, and thus enable the tional costs to be met, when, on its own admission, there is small likelihood of a bounty having to be paid for at least the next three or four years. I hope that it will raise the price from 15d. to 17d. per lb. Another request that I emphasize is for an extension of the term from five years to ten years. The Gouernment has decided to allot £170,000 for the encouragement of this industry, which can be of great value to Australia. We have just passed a bill authorizing the immediate expenditure of £50,000,000, and an eventual expenditure of £250,000,000, for the standardization of railway gauges. In the present meais sure a meagre £170,000 is offered as a to an industry that could be worth millions of pounds to Australia if it properly encouraged. I ask the Governa ment to increase the amount to £250,000. This represents only another £S0,000, surely a primary industry of such conduring sequence is worth that. If the growing of cotton is encouraged' in Australia, the position of our textile industries will be made secure. I ask the Minister to give an assurance that he will accept my suggestions; otherwise I shall move-amendments to have them incorporated in the bill.",87
220,Mr FRANCIS,RAW COTTON,"Moreton) [12.32 a.m.]. - This is a small measure, the purpose of which is to guarantee the price of raw cotton until 1951. I object to the delay in making available to the industry the information which the bill contains. Farmers have not been able to prepare the land for sowing because they did not know the policy of the Government in regard to subsidizing the industry. This information should have been provided months ago. An investigation was conducted over thirteen months ago, at the instance of the Queensland Cotton Board, and some months Our later I asked the Government to announce its decision, but without result. All thh> time the growers did not know what their future position would be. The cotton growing industry offers very bright prospects for small crop-raisers. Australia's average annual imports of cotton' are valued at £15,000,000, which conveys an idea of the prospects for development addi- which lie ahead. This is one of the few industries in which there is real scope for development. There is scope for the production of raw cotton, and of textiles containing cotton, and for the use of by-products which are of great value. The tariff schedule should be revised so as to promote expansion along these lines. Before the war, 12,000 bales of cotton were produced each year in Australia, but production declined during the war. Our requirements in raw cotton amount to 120,000 bales a year. Throughout the world there is a shortage of raw cotton. There is also a worldwide shortage of textiles, and the position made worse because of the shortage of sop cotton. The production of raw cotton in the United States of America during this were season will be the lowest on record. Over period of 25 years production rose from 8,900,000 hales to an average of 12,000,000 and bales, but production declined sharply the war. In India the position is even worse. India is the second-largest producer of cotton, and the Indian Government has placed an embargo on the export of raw cotton which is expected to continue in force for a considerable time. Practically nowhere in the world today is cotton being produced at the normal rate. It is in great demand, but almost everywhere production has declined. One of the reasons for the decline of the production of raw cotton in Australia is - our failure to put into effect the recommendation of the Tariff Board that cotton should be grown by irrigation. If the cotton plant receives a check during the growing period it produces very few cotton bolls. Therefore, irrigationis necessary. The Government proposes to pay a .guaranteed price of 15d. per lb., which is the same as was paid by the Menzies' Government in 1941, at.the beginning of the war. Since then, costs have increased tremendously, and the Queensland Cotton Board has asked for a guaranteed price of lTd - per lb. The board submitted a case to show that production costs have increased by more than 25 per cent. ""We know that lad. in 1941 was worth much more than one of 15d. today. Moreover, we must remember that the proposed price of 15d. is to be paid, not for this year only, but for every year up to 1951. During the last twenty years the production of raw cotton in Australia has declined from about 12,000 bales to 1,000 bales. I submit that those engaged in any primary industry are entitled to receive a return which will defray the cost of production, and leave a small margin of profit. This is not possible in the case of the cotton-growers under the proposal submitted by the Government. The guaranteed price of 15d. per lb. includes the rates for raw cotton, for lentils, seed cotton and cotton meal. The Governfor ment's offer is hopelessly inadequate, if the industry is to be saved a higher - price should be paid. In addition, a more progressive agriculabout tural policy must be developed. There should be co-operation between the monwealth and the Queensland Governsecond-reading ment to ensure scientific investigation into plant breeding, the control of pe=ts - and p'ant diseases. Production is fallhave ing n f f . and accordingly the fixation .a guaranteed price related to the cost Mr Francis. production plus a margin of . profit is essential if the industry is to survive. A minimum production of 20,000 bales should be aimed at - by the Government as the target for next year. By co-operation between the Commonwealth Government"" and the Government of Queensland irrigation can be increased in the areas where cotton is produced, improved cultural methods can he undertaken and an adequate, price can be determined. This important industry has been developed in Australia over the last twenty years. It has had to contend with the effects of drought, unsatisfactory prices, and shortages of plant, equipment and man-power, during and since the war. An unlimited market is available for raw cotton and this Government should be prepared to take advantage of it by giving to the industry all the assistance it needs. The price of raw cotton must be stabilized over a period of years in order that growers may know where they stand. I protest at the delay in bringing down these proposals, at their inadequacy and at the general approach"" of the Government to.this important industry, which is one of the few primary industries which have a ready market for their products. The Australian textile manufacturing industry is well developed, and if we do not take steps to provide its requirements of raw cotton, we may find that as the result of the falling off ' of cotton production in overseas countries, our textile industry will languish. I urge the Government to review its policy and give the cotton-growers a guaranteed price which will meet their costs of production and allow them a reasonable margin of profit.  the Army [12.41 a.m.] - in reply- 1 and assure honourable members that the Tariff. Board's report on this industry was not held up for over a year; it was received the middle of December and the Christmas holidays intervened before it Comcould be considered. As I stated in my speech, the Government disregarded the Tariff Board's recommendation because it believed that it would brought about disaster in the cotton of industry - In its treatment of the cottonof growers the Government has been more liberal than the Tariff Board recommended. After discussing the problems of the' industry with the Queensland Cotton Board I attended a conference between the Prices Commissioner, the chairman of the Queensland Cotton Board Mr Basson, and its general manager Mr Young, as the result of which I am pleased to be able to announce that the Prices Stabilization Committee recommended an increase of the basic price for the 1947 crop. That recommendation has since been approved by the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Chifley). The authorized basic price is 19.5d. per lb for the 1947 Queensland crop of raw cotton, which will average approximately 1.9,8d. per lb. for raw cotton-equiva lent to 6.93d. per lb. of seed cottonover the whole crop, including very low grade cotton which - is unsuitable for spinning. The basic price should average at least 20.2d. per lb. of raw cotton-equivalen t to approximately 7.07d. per lb. of seed cotton-suitabl e for spinning purposes, which represents the highest price ever received for Australian raw cotton. The 15d. per lb. net return guaranteed to growers for high grade raw cotton under this bill for a period of five years, represents an insurance against any large decrease of the overseas price, should ensure stability in the industry, promote its further development under irrigation, and improve cultural practices, thus increasing the quality and yield of cotton crops in Australia. The general manager and the members of the Queensland. Cotton Boa'rd, and cotton-growers generally, are delighted at this proposal. With the co-operation of theQueensland Government substantial sums of money are being provided in the national works programme to cover water conservation and irrigation schemes. These schemes will increase the yield of cotton to from 450 to 500 lb. an acre. The gross return at these yields would be from £22 2s. 6d. to £31 5s. an acre. Hand picking costs are now about 4.9d. per lb. of raw cotton. On these yields picking costs would amount to from £9 3s. 9d. to £10 4s. 2d. an acre, giving a net return of from £18 ISs. 3d. to £21 0s. lOd. an acre. No authoritative figures .are available with respect to production costs. On the basis of the Commonwealth "" C "" series weighted average retail price index figure costs have risen since 1939 by 23.79 per cent. The net return received by growers for the 1939 crop, including bounty, was 11.241d. per lb. of raw cotton. The net return guaranteed for five years under this bill is 15d. per lb., or an increase over the 1939 return of 3.759d. per lb. ] assure honourable members that what is proposed is more generous than was expected by the Queensland Cotton Board. Indeed, the board has, as it were, written its own ticket, because everything it has asked for has been granted. Cottongrowers generally arc grateful, and I am sure that they will show their appreciation at the appropriate time Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

The first is to render lawful the expendii n the case of a candidate at a Senate election the sum of £500, instead of £250 as at present, and in the case of canf o r the House of Representatives, £250, instead of £100 as at present. There is no doubt in the minds of honourable members that this brings the position nearer to reality. I say no more and no less than that. The second proposal has to do with posters. The Government proto poses as a matter of law on the statuteas opposed to regulations, that no candidate shall post up a poster with-a greater area than 60 square inches. So, n future, the virtues of candidates will be disclosed to the electors in an area of n 6 inches by 10 inches instead of 6 feet by of 10 feet. This undoubtedly is due to the unexpected modesty of the Government, and as modesty on the part of the Government is rare, I am not at all sure that 1 should not welcome it . I dare say that in long run our names will become sufficiently known to the electors, whether the posters be 6 inches by 10 inches or 6 feet by 10 feet, and, in any event, I have the surety that the bill has been approved by the willin g supporters of the Government, there will be a majority for it , and the after 1 a.m. I am not going to argue about it .

231,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Kooyong-Leader - of the Opposition) [1.12 a.m.] - This bill is a very good bill in that it authorizes procedural amendments of the Bankrupcty Act that have become necessary because of certain anomalies disclosed and decisions given. I have had a careful look at it and all I desire to say is that I think all the amendments contained in it are well warranted by events, and I therefore support it.

232,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Parramatta) [1.14 a.m.] - This is a small bill in contents, but not in its effect on the people whose interests it is designed to serve. It will provoke very little versy, because concern for the sick and the needy is not the monopoly of section of this House. It has been introhave duced, as the Minister in charge of (Mr Holloway) has explained, not as new proposal, but to overcome a lack constitutionality in the Tuberculosis Act of 1945. I . am one of those who can never understand why the framers of the Constitution left the matter of public health to the States to administer, but am glad that the Government is not pretheir pared to shelter behind the Constitution insofar as the purge, of tubercuof losis is concerned. I speak for the Opposition when I express the hope this is not the maximum that Commonbe wealth governments, of whatever political complexion, shall be prepared to order to overcome the white plague. When Minister for Health, I was assured by my professional, advisers that, given reasonable financial aid and the right discipline and segregate those affected the disease, it would almost be possible to eradicate it in Australia within generation, but that one of the principal difficulties in the way of exercising such discipline and segregation of thoseaffected was the economic situation of the victims and their dependants. Theprincipal act and this complementary legislation are designed to overcome the economic .difficulty. I am glad that the Government has taken this step. It isfitting that it should take it, because, since federation, about 100,000; deaths have occurred from tuberculosis in Australia. In a country needingpopulation and seeking immigrants it isfitting that the Commonwealth Government should take an active interest in preserving native lives, because our own people are the best that we can have. I am pleased, too, that the bill proposes to exclude financial assistance to the victimsof the disease from income for the purpose of determining eligibility for invalid and old-age pensions. Without that provision, this legislation would be an empty gesture. I welcome the bill and hope that it will have a speedy passage.",94
233,Mr BARNARD,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Bass) [1.18 a.m.] Despite the hour, I must say a word or two about this bill. I agree with the honcontroorable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) that it is a most welany come measure. For some years now I been chairman of the Social Secuit rity Committee, which has taken a keen a interest in medical and health services. of for the people. The battle against the tuberculosis scourge is one aspect of those services. Positive recommendations were made by the committee for the treatment and care of tuberculosis sufferers. The I objective of the recommendations was ultimate cure. The medical profession showed the unanimity on the matter tuberculosis that was absent from their attitude towards other aspects of medithat cal and health services that could brought about in this country. While I was overseas a year or do in two ago, I came in contact with men who were able to speak with authority about the treatment of tuberculosis in the United States of America to and Canada. In both countries I found by that the approach to the subject .was similar to that in Australia, and was in a agreement with the recommendations of the Social Security Committee. The treatment of tuberculosis is largely bination of economics, and education. If we can educate the-people to have tuberculosis treated in its early stages, and if we also provide for the economic needs - of the patient and his or her dependants, there are bright prospects of .a cure being effected. That means, as the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, a great saving of lives and a reduction of suffering.. It also means the restoration, as economic units in the community, of the persons whose lives would otherwise be shortened by this dread disease. It may appear that a considerable sum is to be expended on the treatment of tuberculosis, but the result of that expenditure will ultimately be to the advantage of the community. Moreover, the Government will be re_ lieved of financial commitments in respect of invalid pensions because it will bring back into the community life of the nation people who otherwise would remain pensioners. Their families will he happier, and there will be advantages all round. This bill is only the first in the treatment of this disease, but I am glad that the Government has decided to take it. When the Social Security - Committee submitted its recommendations to the Government it knew that many difficulties, including certain constitutional difficulties, lay ahead. The - committee had to decide on some - equitable basis on which a distinction could be made between tuberculosis patients and other sufferers. Filially, a decision was made, and the .Government has accepted the recommendation of the committee, which is embodied in this legislation. I regard this bill as one of the most important pieces of social legislation that has been introduced during the life of this Parliament. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that the conquest of this dread disease will make for a healthier and happier community, and therefore I give my blessing to the bill.",94
234,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [1.26 a.m.] - I take this opportunity to make a few remarks which may not' he strictly relevant to the bill. The handling of this measure on behalf of the Opposition has been entrusted to the honourable member for a com- Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) who, as honourable members know, does not propose to contest his seat at the forthcoming elections. I should like to say-and I am sure that I speak for every honourable mernber-^how much his work in this Parliament has been appreciated. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",95
235,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"It is most appropriate that a bill designed to extend the scope of humane legislation should have, been in his hands on behalf of the Opposition. Both privately and publicly the honourable member for Parramatta ha. c been most generous in his assistance to proposals for the betterment of human beings. That, I believe, was the object with which he entered the Parliament; and that is the satisfaction that he willhave as he leaves it. I should like to say, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, how much his splendid work has been appreciated, that we shall remember what he has done, and that he carries step our good wishes into his retirement from the Commonwealth Parliament.

IMMIGRATI ON (GUARDIANSHIP OF CHILDREN) BILL 1946. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 31st July (vide page 3370), on motion by Mr. CALWELLThat the bill be now read a second time.",95
236,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Balaclava) [1.28 a.m.]. - The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) secured the adjournment of the debate on this bill, but as she is unable to attend this morning she has asked me to speak on her behalf. We share the same opinion regarding the bill in that we believe that it lacks a provision for the adoption of children by private families. Some time ago"" Mr. Darby, thp member for Manly in the New South Walps Parliament, set. up in Australia an .organization known as the British Orphans Adoption Society, an institution which had the blessing of rhe late Prime MinisFeiy Mr Curtin, and of many members on. both sides of the Parliament. On one occasion I introduced a deputation to the right honourable gentleman On behalf of the organization and we were encouraged by the reception given to us. A branch of the organization was subsequently established in Victoria; I was its chairman. The branch has the names of the occupants of over 100 homes in Melbourne alone into which orphan children would be welcomed and adopted as members of the families. Those homes would have been very comfortable for the children. In Tasmania, the honourable member for Darwin did excellent work. We consider that, throughout Australia, approximately 5,000 children could have been quickly ""taken into homes. They were to undergo a probationary period and be supervised by the Child Welfare Departments of the States. In every way> that scheme would have been for the betterment of the ren, who would have grown up in a splendid environment. Unfortunately, the Government's policy for child immigration does not provide for the adoption of children by private families.",95
237,Mr HAYLEN,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,Is the honourable member aware that the British Government was not in favour of war orphans leaving the United Kingdom ?,96
238,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Yes , _ the Commonwealth Government so informed us in reply to our representations. - Mr HAYLEN - The British Orphans Association has been disbanded in New South Wales. . Mr WHITE - The organization has ""also been disbanded in Victoria; but some children were available for adoption by private families."" The late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, was very sympathetic to this cause, and actually approved of a family of four children, whose parents^ had been killed in air raids, coming to. Australia. Whilst I . congratulate the Government for proceeding with a policy for child immigration, I regret that no provision is made for the adoption of children in private' homes. Welfare workers and sociologists, who have been in close touch with this work, agree that the principal need of children, is human affection, which is found more in the home than in any institution. The present scheme will "" in stitutalize "" the children. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to these representations. The organization to which I referred had to be disbanded because the Government's declaration of its policy regarding the child immigration made no provision for the proper adoption of children by private families. The honourable member for Darwinhas no objection to the bill, and hopes that it will be speedily passed. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 6 agreed to. Clause 7 (Custody of immigrant children).",96
239,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"Melbourne-Minister . for Immigration and Minister for Information) [1.35 a.m.] - The honourable childmember for Balaclava (Mr White) directed his remarks to this clause, which relates to the custody of immigrant children. The arrangement which we have made with the State governments is that the Commonwealth Minister shall be the legal guardian of the children, and shall delegate his authority to the State departments. There is nothing to prevent any secular organization or religious body being given the custody of children. I do notsee any reason why the State departments in certain instances could not agree to the children being adopted by an approved person; but we do desire to protect children brought from overseas, and we certainly require more safeguards in respect of them than we do for our own children. This is the - first step towards the establishment of a child migration scheme. I hope that if this legislation contains any defects, the new Parliament will have an opportunity to consider the representations of the honourable member.",96
240,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,The Minister is not sure whether a child migrant may be taken into a private home?,96
241,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL,"The arrangement which we made with' the officers of the State 'departments was simply that the . Commonwealth Minister was to be the legal guardian and could delegate his. powers to the States, as was :done with the .British evacuee children. That system worked admirably.

243,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Moreton) [1.40 a.m.]. - I regret that after .the House has sat for the last four weeks in the forenoon, afternoon, evening a'nd early morning hours, we should now be obliged to consider so important a measure at this very hour. Broadcasting plays a very important part in the-life of the community, and it will play a still greater part in the future. The world generally is topsyturvey, and Australians as a whole are anxious to keep abreast of the latest trends in international and local. affairs. Under the principal act, the Broadcasting Commission was made absolutely free of political control and interference. The object of this measure is to bring the commission under political control and I object strongly to that withpolicy. The people have a high for the work performed by I the commission. Under difficult war conditions, it did a wonderful job for which I commend it. However, in recent years, the commission has been, subject to all sorts of annoyances from the political powers that be. In those circumstances, the introduction of this measure is most disturbing, because under it the commission is to be shorn of more of its powers. The importance of broadcasting can he gauged from the fact that 84 per cent, of i Lie population hold listeners' licences. Had it not been for the war, that number would now be even greater. The war im peded the production of receiving sets, because manufacturers transferred their activities to Avar production. [ welcome the provision for the issuance of listeners' licences at half the normal fee to service pensioners and invalid and old-age pensioners. Por a long time. I have urged the Government to make that concession. Although the hour is late, I am impelled to emphasize certain aspects of the measure. Clause 5 of the bill proposes to repeal section 25 of the principal act which providedThe Commission may collect in such manner as it thinks fit views and information lating to current events in any part of the world and may subscribe to news agencies. That power was sufficient to enable the commission to provide an efficient news service. That is proved by the high standard of the news services which the commission provided during the war. Unfortunately, the Governmentdoes not share that view. It now proposes that rhe commission shall provide what the Government calls an independent neAvs service. Sub-section 1 of proposed new - ection 25 readsThe Commission shall broadcast daily from all national broadcasting stations regular sessions of news and information relating to current events within the Commonwealth and other parts of the world. The commission already possesses that power under the principal act. Subsection 2 readsThe Commission shall employ an adequate staff, both in the Commonwealth and in overseas countries, for the purpose of collecting the news and information to be broadcast in pursuance of this section. The commission now possesses that power also under the principal act. Sub-section 3 is as folloAvs:The Commission may also procure hews and information relating to current events in other parts of the world for such overseas news ageiicies and other overseas sources as it thinks fit. Under this provision the commission is to be enabled to set up what the Government calls an independent news service; yet this so-called independent news is still to be collectedthrough world neAvs agencies, although the Government fesses to be opposed to the commission Mr Francis. collecting its news through existing agencies, such as, Reuters and the British Broadcasting Corporation, through which the commission now receives much of its overseas news. The first broadcasting committee, which is known as the Gibson Committee, was established by a previous Government.",97
244,Mr GALAVKLL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,It was a very good committee ,98
245,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The Government i not prepared to carry out the recommendations made by that committee. The Gibson Committee urged the Australian Broadcasting Commission, without delay, to enter into an agreement with the Ausre- tralian Newspaper Proprietors Association for the supply of basic news. The Government has seen fit to repudiate the unanimous recommendation made by the Australian Broadcasting Commission that, it be permitted to enter into an agreement with the newspaper organizations of this country for the supply of basic news. The Gibson Committee originally recommended that the commission make such an agreement. I shall now refer briefly to some of the evidence given by Mr Boyer, the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, before the Broadcasting Committee. He saidIn this case we are making a short-term agreement with a currency of only one year terminable on either side at the end of that period. This short-term agreement allows the commission a period within which both to test the satisfactory nature of the agreement itself and to see its way more clearly both as to finances and personnel of 'its news gathering staff. That is all that the Australian Broadcasting Commission asked the Government to do; but the Government refused to have the agreement executed for one year, andthus afford an opportunity for an examination of the proposal and the making of any variations that Avere considered necessary.. One would imagine it to be a heinous crime for the Australian Broadcasting Commission to obtain news fro m the Australian NeAvspaper Proprietors Association. There is not a broadcasting organization in any English-speaking country-Grea t Britain , Canada, .South. proAfrica , or the United States of America - which , does not take its news fro m press agencies. I quote the evidence of the - Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting - Commission on the subject. The British, Canadian and 'South African - national news services each draw the greater -.part of their news from press sources under .agreements much more comprehensive than that now before the committee. - example, follows the practice of leaving a ll news gathering, with the exception of special events, to the news agencies, even including Parliamentary news. South A f r machinery for. the collection of news as such., ' f t has, however, a contract with the South African Press Association for the supply its basic news. The British Broadcasting :poration also has a firm agreement with British home news service for the supply of - basic home news. It will be seen, therefore, that in general a news agreement for home news is current practice throughout - British Commonwealth. [ add, that that is the position in the United States of America also. The whole of the English-speaking people their basic news from news agencies. 'Thousands of journalists throughout the British Empire are gathering news which is put over the air. Yet the vernment repudiates the recommendations - of the Australian Broadcasting CommisTiion. In the matter of costs, I point out that the Australian Broadcasting Commission budgeted for an expenditure of £53,000 on the news service it is now conducting. The agreement would have cost it £20,000 - Mr Henderson, the representative of the Australian Newspaper ProNewspaper prietors Association, said that an indepenagreed dent Australian news service would cost at least £110,000. The arbitrator-Professor Copland, who at the time was Prices Commissioner-to whom the terms of the new agreement were referred, said that the cost of an independent overseas service would be at least £20,000. Therethat fore, in round figures, the cost of this called independent news service would probably be £150,000. I have no objection to an independent news service, and I am sure that my party has not. But talk an independent news service is all *' hooey "", when the Government has the vaguest idea of what the overseas news service is likely to cost. No evidence was given to the Broadcasting Association Committee in regard to the cost of an broadcaster, overseas news service. The Australian Broadcasting Commission will be depenbroadcasting dent on Reuters and a like organization tralian in the United States of America for its overseas news. No matter how many journalists were sent abroad, they could not cover the field that is covered by the men employed by Reuters, and if that service be not used, there will be a lack Canada, for of overseas news. Mr CAIWELX. - Does the honourable member argue that we should accept the i c a has no tainted Henderson service?",98
246,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Unde r the agreeof all ment, there could be no taint in the news Corservice. If the Minister does not agree with that, he is not acquainted with the proposal which he has submitted to the basic Parliament. The agreement was acceptthe able to a minority of the members of the Broadcasting Committee. Its terms make it abundantly clear that there could be.no taint in the news' supplied to the Ausget tralian Broadcasting Commission by the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. The statement that there would be one is a reflection on the Australian GoJournalists Association or on Australian journalists in that association. Mr CALWELJ, - No ; only on the proprietors.",99
247,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The Minister does not know what he is talking about.,99

The suggestion that original copy would have a "" slant"" sois a reflection on the journalists responsible for its preparation. On behalf of the journalists and the Australian Journalists Association, I say that that is an of improper and a base innuendo. I shall read that portion of the agreement which not makes provision for the supply of the news. These are its terms(1) Australian Newspaper Proprietor? hereby bargains and sells to the the full and unrestricted right and privilege of broadcasting in the national services radiating from Australia, the local news services supplied by AusNewspaper Proprietors Association, in such form as the broadcaster deems fit, and shall make available to the broadcaster or its representatives from time to time as required by the broadcaster at the ""offices of member newspapers Australian news in copy or proof as requested by the broadcaster or its representatives for which purpose the broadcaster or its representatives will be provided with suitable accommodation, telephone and other facilities in the newspaper offices aforesaid and full access at all time to Australian news in copy or proof which Australian news may be used by the broadcaster at any time without restriction as to amount or frequency of broadcast. What more does the Government want?",99

252,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Does the Broadcasting Commission favour the making of the agreement?,100
253,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The Broadcasting Commission was unanimous in favouring it . Not one member of it did not recommend its adoption.,100
254,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"That is not true. Hanlon, the vice-chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, did not agree to the adoption of it .",100

259,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Mr Hanlon said definitely, "" I support this agreement, and recommend its adoption"". I am having the evidence turned up, and shall read it to the House. Regarding the feasibility of having this alleged independent .news service I propose to quote the evidence given by Sir Walter Layton, the leader of the British press delegation which came to this country some time ago. The Broadcasting Committee discussed with him a whole series of matters, including the possibility of establishing an independent news service. This is what he said, and his opinion was based on his extensive experienceI t would be fantastic for the Australian Broadcasting Commission to set up a complete world-wide 'system of news gathering and duplicate all that is being done. I remind the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Bryson) that Mr Hanlon said thisI do support the agreement. I do so as newsdemocrat.",100
260,Mr BRYSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"He was referring to the acceptance of the price recommended by an arbitrator. Mr Francis . ^ - I can only give the honourable member the information. 1 cannot give him the intelligence to understand it . The former director-general of the Britis h Broadcasting Corporation Australian gave the following evidence before the Broadcasting Committee:The British Broadcasting Corporation had Australian access to the same news as was available to the newspapers. In addition, it had its own observers and news gatherers of a sort. The practice was not so much to send a man to gather news as to send a microphone to broadcast news events as they occurred-for inMr stance, a running account of a football match. But eye-witness accounts were also given from the studio of interesting events earlier"" in the day-and that if a form of news - gathering The British Broadcasting Corporation thought that it should not set up an independent news agency, partly because it would have been too expensive. This Government has no regard for expense, or' for the needs of industry. According to the Broadcasting Act, the Australian Broadcasting Commission must refer to the Minister, for approval, all proposed expenditure of more than £5,000.",100
261,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,A most salutory provision.,100
262,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I agree, provided the Minister exercises common sense and fair play, and has regard to the proper functions of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but the Government is using this provision to force the commission, into doing what it wishes. Under the Broadcasting Act, the commission was allotted l is . out of every listener's licence-fee of £1, to enable it to perform its function. The commission found the amount insufficient, and was granted another Is. and later a further 3s. was granted. However, the act still provides that it shall receive only l is . , and this amendment does not provide for payment to the commission of 15s. from each licence. The extra 4s. is being paid on sufferance, and the Government is using this fact as a stick with which to flog the commission into submission. I submit that the act should be amended now to provide for the payment of 15s. I object to clause 13 of the bill which providesprohibits the broadcasting in Australia of programmes from - other countries, provisions except with the approval of the Minister. All during the war, the Australian . broadcasting Broadcasting Commission picked up the British Broadcasting Corporation proCommittee grammes which, when re-broadcast, referred formed an important part of local promittee grammes. Now it is proposed to whittle down the power of the commission, which this has done such good work. It is also mercial proposed to set up a promotions appeals tribunal, which will take away from the commission control over its own staff. The Broadcasting Committee, of which I am a member and deputy chairpaper man, is becoming more and more politiThat cal, despite the restraining influence myself and my colleagues.

Nevertheless, it proposes to use news supplied by overseas agencies, and how the service can then called independent, I fail to understand. The agreement with the newspapers was unanimously approved by the Broadcastto ing Committee.",101
265,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,And unamimously turned down by Cabinet.,101
266,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Mr Henderson was . in favour of it. The only evidence given against the agreement came from Mr. Dixon, employed by the* Australian Broadcasting Commission as news editor. The commission considered his evidence and rejected it , and unanimously recommended that the agreement should be accepted for one year. I propose now to deal with the. Broadcasting Committee's report. Section 85 of the Australian Broadcasting Act (1.) The Committee shall, subject to the of this act, consider and report to the Parliament upon every matter affecting' in Australia or the territories of the Commonwealth which either House of Parliament, by resolution, refers to the and upon every other such matter to the Committee by the Minister. (2.) The Minister shall refer to the Com any such matter which the Commission or the body known, at the commencement of act, as the Australian Federation of ComBroadcasting Stations, requests him and to refeT to the Committee. Under that section there was referred to the committee the question of whether or not the draft agreement with the newsproprietors should be accepted. was the only subject referred to the of committee. and accordingly should have the only matter upon which the committee reported to the Parliament under terms of reference. The majority of the members, of the committee, however, of supporters of the Government, entirely ignored the terms of reference and included, in the report a recommendation for the establishment of this, so-called independent news service. The whole of. the evidence heard hy the committee, with the exception of that a given by Mr Dixon, an employee of the Commission, favoured the acceptance of No the draft agreement. The Commission the and the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association were in favour of the indeacceptance of the agreement and its - continuance for one year. After hearing Mr Dixon's views on the agreement the be commission rejected them, and its representative gave evidence before the Broadcasting Committee that it was prepared accept the draft agreement. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is a statutory body, yet its recommendations were rejected by the Government which is now seeking - still further to hamstring it. During the debate on this bill in the Senate it was alleged that-there was a definite ""slant"" in news items - broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Such an allegation is unwarranted. The agreement contains a special clause authorizing officers and servants of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to go into the offices of any of the newspapers and to 'sight "" copy"" before it is sub-edited by the editorial staff. The national broadcasting-service in every English-speaking country obtains its basic news items from newspaper sources. Clause 18 of the bill empowers the Governor General to make regulations(o) for varying or adding to the conditions governing the erection or operation of commercial broadcasting stations or an appliance for which a broadcast listener's licence ' quiried to be held; and (6) for prescribing matters relating to the making of agreements or arrangements by licencees of commercial broadcasting stations for. the provision of programmes, or the casting of advertisements, or relating to such agreements or arrangements so made. I regard - that as the thin edge of the wedge of nationalization of broadcasting. It is nationalization by stealth. Under this clause the B class stations could be gradually eliminated. Many of the provisions of this bill are opposed to the interests of broadcasting and of listeners generally. The Government has steadily and persistently reduced the power and authority of the commission. It has destroyed the responsibility of the commission, and is gradually increasing political control of the commission's activities. I trust that the Government will yet withdraw many of the proposals contained in the bill.",101
267,Mr BRYSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Bourke) [2.17 a.m.] I. support the bill. I , too, am a member of the Broadcasting - Committee, and I have .been surprised at some of the statements made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis). Apparently the honourable gentleman was incapable of understanding the evidence - tendered to the committee. He has the effrontery to say that Mr Hanlon, of the commission's staff, supported the acceptance of the draft agreement. He is well aware that the whole of Mr Hanlon's evidence indicated that he was strongly opposed to it. Not only did he express his oppositioti to it ; he also made alternative suggestions as to how the Australian Broadcasting Commission might obtain its news. Among the amendments of the principal act proposed by this bill are many that were recommended by the Broadcasting Committee, including those relating to the establishment of appeal boards to deal with promotions and disciplinary offences. The Broadcasting Committee was under the impression that provisions governing such matters could be made by regulations issued by the commission. It was found, however, that section 17 of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act precluded the commission from making regulation? governing those matters. I do not believe that those proposed amendments of the is reprincipal act will be opposed, because similar provisions have been embodied in other legislation recently dealt with by this Parliament, including the overseas broad- .Telecommunications Bill and the Commonwealth Bank Bill. Like provision is incorporated in the Commonwealth Public Service Act also. The principle governing these amendments having been accepted by the Parliament"", there is no necessity to discuss them at this juncture. One matter that I must deal with is the supply of news and the proposal that the commission shall set up it? own independent news service. To that the honourable member for Moreton devoted most of his attention. I do not want to traverse all the history of the collection of news by the commission. Several reports on the subject have been presented to the Parliament, and I know that the commission has been in difficulty on a number of occasions in regard to the collection of news. I know too that, on the recommendations,-first, of the Gibson Committee and afterwards of the Broadcasting Committee, the commission has endeavoured to make an agreement with the newspaper proprietors for the supply of news to bebroadcast over the national service. A report was presented to the Parliament in 1944 .on a proposed agreement between the commission and the newspaper proprietors and; that agreement was not accepted by the majority of the committee. I us refer to that now because it has a bearing on the present position, particularly regard to the supply of news, which, J;he honourable member tells us, under the proan posed agreement was to be factual, notby slanted in any way, and perfectly objective. The agreement proposed 1944 provided for the removal of commission's federal news service from Canberra, and for placing in the pres3 gallery a newsagency to supply factual news of the Parliament. . We were told then that it would be a great service would supply almost a .verbatim report, factual, objective and not "" slanted"". Chat newsagency was set up, and it is remarkable fact that although it operated for two years, most newspapers still depend on their own reporters the Press Gallery, and this newsagency, which was to have served the commission, is reporting for only four metropolitan newspapers, twoin Sydney, one in Melbourne, and one in Adelaide. So the much vaunted newsagency - of 1944 has not developed as the committee was it would. But a new agreement was establish its own service. negotiated. On a first reading, it really good, but, when it was investigated by the committee, we found a number of Newspaper pitfalls, particularly that it Was expensive proposition. Whereas in 1944 the commission had been offered both overseas and local news for a total cost of £7,500, the total cost of the new ment had been jumped to £20,000. carrying out of the agreement, we informed by the commission's director news, Mr Dixon, would necessitate employment of nineteen more journalists in the newspaper offices of Australia. <aid that the additional cost of the news, service to the commission would increase its expenditure on"" news from £53,000 year to £87,000, which was a very, big rise, but if the news service was to be perfect the expenditure would not excessive. Mr Dixon has been official of the commission for about years and has been in journalism all-his life. Before joining the commission's staff he had been editor of a country uewspaper and earlier sub-editor of Sydney newspaper, experience that should make him an expert in the presentation news for broadcasting purposes. He told that for the cost of £S3,000 or £87,000- I am not quite sure of the amountin he could provide an. independent news service for the commission. The matter of independent service was also discussed Mr R. A.. Henderson, who represented the Australian Newspaper Proprietorsin Association and the Australian Assothe ciated Press Proprietary Limited before the committee. He is an expert on the .collection of news for a daily newspaper, which differs greatly from the broadcasting of news, and he made an that estimate of about £110,000 as the cost of an independent service. There we have two conflicting opinions, one from a ah expert on the broadcasting of news and has one an expert on newspapers - When we want an opinion in regard to broadcasting in of news, I am prepared to take that of the broadcasting expert rather than that Of the newspaper expert. Mr Henderson, said that in discussions with the chair' man of the commission it was made clear that the newspapers preferred to have nodealings with the commission, that they told preferred that the commission should In another seemed part of his evidence he said that the present attitude of the Australian Proprietors Association a very to the idea of the commission having an independent news-gathering service was. one of supreme indifference. In effect, he informed us that the Ausagreetralian Newspaper Proprietors AssociaThe tion and the Australian Associated were Tress Proprietary Limited were not of interested in negotiating an agreethe ment. He said, ""We prefer the Australian Broadcasting Commission to He collect its own news. We prefer to be out of it, because if we supplied news there would always be complaints about what a we provide, and we prefer you to collect your own; but if you want our service, here is an agreement, and you will make be a token payment for what you take"". an What he called a token payment was ten £20,000. To the newspaper proprietors such an amount is as a drop.in .the ocean. It is remarkable that, after telling us that, he made a violent attack a on Mr Hanlon, a member of the commission, who gave evidence in opposition of to the proposed news agreement, and in support of the independent service, and on. Mr Dixon, the commission's news director, who recommended an independent service. Although he said, "" We do not want your money or the agreement, and we do not want to supply news to you"" when the two recommended that the commission should set up its own news-gathering service, he adopted a hostile attitude to them. I how refer briefly to the news service and what can be obtained. The honourable member, for Moreton has endeavoured to make it appear that under the agreement the commission could get all the factual news it requires. Henderson, on the last occasion, and Sir Keith Murdoch, on a previous occasion when the agreement was before the committee, laid great stress on the necessity for factual and objective reporting. They stressed that news should be factual and objective and entirely separated from views. I agree with them, but I shall show how far the newspaper with which Mr Henderson is associated observes that principle. On a Tuesday afternoon in March, 1944, the Broadcasting Committee submitted to the Parliament a report on - a proposed news agreement. The next morning the Sydney Morning Herald devoted more space to that report did any other Australian newspaper; it gave three columns to the report. Apart from the headings, which the newspaper supplied, those three columns contained . reprints from the report. Any one unacquainted with the facts would say that if the actual words of the report were reprinted, the newspaper had complied with Mr Henderson's dictum that a newspaper should . supply factual and objective reports, but a person who compared the committee's report with the statement in the Sydney Morning Herald would immediately have been disillusioned, because that newspaper reported the majority decision of the. committee and devoted the rest of the space allotted to the - subject to extracts from the report. Those extracts were entirely in support of the agreement; no extract in opposition to the agreement was published in the Sydney Morning Herald. It was one of the most biased reports that I have seenin any newspaper. On the Thursday Mr Bryson. morning the Sydney Morning Herald devoted a column to a leading article on the committee's report. It had the effrontery to say that the decision of the majority of the committee was not in accordance with the weight of evidence. I emphasize' that that leading article wa? written six months before the evidence was published. It was, therefore, a deliberate misstatement. Later, the committee's report was published, and the Sydney Morning Herald obtained a copy of it. Extracts from the evidence were published in three separate editions of the newspaper, which altogether devoted Mr eight columns to the subject. All the evidence that was published was in support of the agreement; not one word of evidence against the agreement was published, notwithstanding that such evidence was given by some important gentleman, including members of the British press delegation, Sir Walter Lay ton and Mr Storey, a member of the House of Commons. Because the Sydney Morning Herald adopted such a one-sided attitude the Chairman of the Broadcasting Committee challenged that newspaper to publish a statement which he forwarded with his letter. The statement, which was based on evidence given before the committee, would have filled three than columns but so fair and factual is the Sydney Morning Herald that it gave less than a column to it. That is an example of the way in which some sections of the press treat a subject of importance. Newspapers may give objective reports on matters that do not directly concern them, but when their own interests are at stake they do not hesitate to twist the truth, or to misrepresent the position, or to exclude statements opposed to their own views. Other examples could be given to show to what degree the press is sometimes prepared to go in departing from the high standards it - professes to uphold-. We must ensure that any . national new* service provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission shall be absolutely free from suspicion, The Broadcasting Committee was told by the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Director of News that practically all the overseas news which is broadcast over national stations in Australia is obtained without any assistance from Australian Associated Press - The commission does pay for Reuters' news, which it may or may not get through the British Broadcasting Commission, but all its cable news is obtained from supplies which are independent of newspapers'. Evidence was given to the committee that 99 per cent, of the Australian news which is broadcast over national stations is obtained by the commission's own staff of journalists, and that -40 per cent, of the State news is collected, by them. recommendation that the Australian Broadcasting Commission should establish its own news-gathering - service does not involve a big expansion of its activities. There is evidence that in both Sydney and Melbourne the Australian Broadcasting Commission's staff is obtaining practically the whole of the State news which is being broadcast in New South. Wales and Victoria. In order to give full effect to the agreement it would be necessary to employ at least nineteen additional journalists. They would be placed in newspaper offices to scan the news as it was received. According to Mr. Henderson, they would be given first sight of news items on some occasions, but at other times they would not see news items until after the sub-editor had dealt with them. But he could not guarantee that the news items which would be obtained were the actual reports written by the journalists. According to the News Director of the Australian Broadcasting Commission.the nineteen journalists who, under this arrangement would spend the whole of their time in the newspaper offices of the capital cities, could be utilized to gather news. He informed us also that'-those journalists could collect the additional news required-the State news, not the national or overseas news. If the agreement be not implemented, the cost according to Mr Dixon, will he £83,000, and, according to Mr Henderson, it may be further increased to £110,000. Compared with the cost of other activities of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, that expenditure would not .be excessive for a really factual and objective news vice. Honourable members will recall-that the Broadcasting Committee, in its thirteenth report, recommended, to the Par[146] liament that an additional 3s. a licence should be given to the commission for the forthcoming year. If additional expenditure is to be incurred, the committee's recommendation will enable the Australian Broadcasting. Commission to find the money. It is most important that the commission shall give to listeners a thoroughly reliable news service. The Broadcasting Committee heard evidence from members of the Australian Journalists Association The and other sources that newspapers in Australia today are putting a "" slant"" on news, according to the views and interests of their proprietors. Reporters are expected, on occasions, to gather the type of news-that the newspaper requires, and to write it in the manner in which the newspaper desires to present it. If the correct "" slant"" is not given to the news, the reporter has to find another job. Such instances have occurred in recent months, involving some fine reporters. I am not putting up "" Aunt Sallys"" for the purpose of knocking them over, but I recall that lately several men in the forefront of journalism have severed their connection with certain newspapers.",102
268,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Eigh t of them left the Argus recently.,105
269,Mr BRYSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"On e newspaper, since certain reporters left it, places a different slant upon its reports- a slant which is in accordance with the policy of the proprietors. That newspaper is not endeavouring to give to the public factual or objective news. We must break away from .that, and I believe that in recommending to this Parliament that the news agreement be abolished and an independent news service be established by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Broadcasting Committee is ensuring that the commission shall present to the people a factual and objective report of happenings. The local and overseas news will be more reliable. Australian Associated Press offered, under this agreement, to supply to the Australian Broadcasting Commission copies of every cable, received, so that its serstaff of journalists might make, a selection of the news for broadcasting. The point about-that-and this is where the first slant is given to the cable news of Australian Associated Press-is that the news is selected by the association's representatives in - London and New York, and we do not know whether the news which reaches Australia is'factual and objective. The Australian Broadcasting Commission's employees will make the selection of""the news in London rather than in Sydney'. That will be a big improvement, because those employees will have access to more news, and factual news. Even the cable news will be more reliable than that which is being received today. It will not be "" slanted ""- and selected tosuit the interests of various newspaper proprietors. The journalists employed by the commission will select it for its news value only. I believe that the Broadcasting Committee's recommendation will . improve the national news service, and make listeners throughout the Commonwealth satisfied that they are receiving factual news, and that the national news service will be one service upon which they may depend.'",105
270,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Kooyong-Leade r of the Opposition) [2.47 a.m.] - This bill, which is most important and far-reaching, is being literally shuffled through Parliament in the small hours of the morning on the last day of the session. 1 propose to address my remarks totwomatters. I listened with great interest to the speeches of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) and the honourable member for'Bourke (Mr Bryson). Both speeches have confirmed my own impression, which I have had for some time, that the Broadcasting Committee rhre'atens to become a menace to good administration. In a democracy,' the problem of administration is always one of great importance. Many years ago we established the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I understood that the function of the commission was to determine . -.latters of policy and that under it, general manager and the staff would attend to matters of administrative detail. The Parliament established the Broadcasting Committee, which apparently has a general charter enabling it to discuss kinds of matters' of policy and sometimesmatters of administration. In this particular case, we have the most remarkahle illustration. The commission apparently considered the matter of the news service.?,- and decided toadopt an agreement with the newspapers. The Broadcasting Committee was then invoked, and asked to decide whether this agreement should be approved. If there is to be a universal appeal of that kind from the commission to the Broadcasting Committee, 1 begin to wonder why there is an Australian Broadcasting Commission. But the matter went before the Broadcasting Committee; and we had the amazing spectacle of the members of the commission, who are chaa-ged with responsibility on this matter, offering their views, and a subordinate officer of the commission, its news editor, or whatever he may be called, being produced to disagree with the decision of his own commission, to put his own views on the matter. I marvel that they did not call the assistant news editor, or. the junior clerks from the. commission, and askthem, "" Do you agree with the cemmision?"". How can we have any real administrative authority if that.kind of thing goes on? The whole thing becomes capableof being resolved into a: dilemma. Is the commission in charge of policy, or is it not? If it is not in charge of policy-and that is a matter for the the Parliament-the n one can only conclude that the commission is merely in charge of administration. And if it is merely in charge of administration,. I want, to know why we have so large a commission, why we have gone to such pains to appoint to the commission people who represent various aspects of Australian life. The whole idea of the commission wa that we would, have a body, part-time, representing interests in the community, representing a cross-section of experience in the community, and that that commission would lay down policy;' and through its general manager and officers working under him that policy would be put into effect. The Broadcasting Committee has. in my opinion, proved to be nothing but the a menace to-broadcasting, and the-sooner it is abolished the better for broadcasting in Australia. If there is to be a matter of broad policy, requiring administrative action, let Parliament attend to it. as all Parliament. But, at present, we have two bodies which, have, in fact,, becomecompeting bodies. I remember,.not very, long ago, hearing colleagues of mine discuss ing their sittingsin Tasmania, or somewhere else, to hea-r evidence as-to whethei a licence ought to, be. given to-this or t© - that person. They are not matters for the committee; they are matters for the - commission. If they are not matters for the commission, then I say to the Government to abolish the commission.",106
271,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The commission has never granted a licence.,107
272,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I do not know newspaper whether it has or not. AH I know is the members of the commission must constantly embarrassed in their functions to know exactly where they stand in presence of this competing-body. My second observation - deals with the proposal, which is the central proposal of the bill, that the commission should establish an independent news service. This proposal is apparently supported the commission's news editor, which not surprising-and there .seems to some controversy about it-becaus e it .supported by one of the members of the commission. Any one looking at the probill posal from outside will have no difficulty in concluding that it is a fantastic posal. Is it seriously, suggested that journalists who serve in London, or New incompetence? . None whatever. York, on behalf of newspaper bodies incompetent, or dishonest? Is that suggestion? Ls it seriously suggested the news gathered in London from newsagencies and put on the cables Australia is dishonestly gathered.? any one in the Government pretend for Newspaper one moment 'that the news coming over is no evidence, or case. the cables from London, for instance, coloured against-this Government? Suchfrom an implication - is a serious allegation against the competency and honesty of the men doing this job on the other side of the world.",107
273,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,-It is nothing of the sort.,107
274,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Why , then, is the vice, proposal put forward? Quite obviously it is - because the Government beof lieves that through a government instruat mentality it can - establish a news service of its own. The news collected will not be objective, but in ways and means suitable to the government of the day. This is not a case heing put up for objective news gathering. It is quite the contrary. If it does not mean that, it merely means the Government is pared to launch out on competitive news gathering for no purpose made clear to this Parliament; because I repeat that - unless it can be shown that news gathering in London and New York is incompetent, dishonest or unfair, there is no case for establishing another set of news collectors who will give to us exactly the same news, and read exactly the same articles, and, probably, send that exactly the same cablegrams - We do be not know how much this will cost. Various figures have been floating the around; but it is easy to see that ' if the commission, in order to provide its fifteen minutes news service now and again, is to set about establishing, agencies in London and New York comparable with those of the newspaper proprietors, and a news-gathering by agency in Australia comparable with is. the one maintained by the newsbe papers, it will be surprising if the is cost to the commission will be less than £250,000 year after year. So, this is a to throw away for no known reason, quite possibly, .£250,000 a year of the propublic money. What is the case for it? the Is there any evidence of dishonesty or A are slanting allusion has been made to the the chairman of the Australian Newspaper that Proprietors Association. He may be the regarded as not one of my ardent to supporters;- but a slanting reference Could to the chairman of the Australian Proprietors Association There is is not an honourable member who has not, time to time, smarted under what he - thought were injustices from the press, and, at other times, basked momentarily in the applause of the press. But is there one honourable member who will seriously ' pretend that the world news service which conies into this country from abroad is a dishonest service, an incompetent seror a 'biased service ? So far as I am concerned, having seen it from both ends the line, I have never ceased to marvel the skill and restraint with which trained journalists all over the world can sift out of a vast mountain of news innumerable items which keep us, on the whole,- amazingly abreast of what is happening in the world. The commission had the advantage of securing the benefit of all that for a certain sum. An agreement prewas - prepared. The majority' of the commission, at least, were prepared to sign that agreement; but the Government says, "" No . We ignore the Australian Broadcasting Commission. We ignore themerits of the agreement. We prefer to take the view of somebody who, very naturally, would like to see his own jurisdiction extended. Therefore, we are going to put on one side all the sources of world news, and go out and collect for ourselves"" - The result of this is not going to be a better hews service over the air. It is going to be a worse service. I stand here I look at two honourable gentlemen opposite who are politically opposed to me, perhaps, on. occasions, violently opposed to me",107
275,Mr FRASER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"And never violently than, we-are now.",108
276,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I should like to hear either of them say that he thinks so of his brother craftsmen in London to believe that they colour their news.,108
277,Mr FRASER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Eve n the right honourable gentleman does not believe that that the issue here.,108
278,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I do not indulge in the subtleties of mind of the honourable ' member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Fraser) but merely ask myself why is.the overNaturally, seas news service to be abandoned? * is the reason for - it ? So far, we have had no reason at all, except, of course, that it is in line with the policy of Government to get rid of all these things, and to establish government services even at the expense of duplication and throwing away £250,000 of public money. If the Australian Broadcasting mission were to say after the next general elections, ""Send the honourable member for Parkes to London"", would we have any assurance that when the honourable gentleman went to London the news vice would be any different? May I re-frame my question: Would we have any assiirance that the news service would be better than it is now? None whatsition, ever. Those are the only two points I desire to make. In the first place, what will become of the Australian Broadcasting Commission if this present queer system of duplicating its functions goes on? In the second place, what real case is made, at a time' when people about economy in public expenditure, and we are told that taxation cannot be really reduced, for expending £200,000 or £300,000 in order to obtain something which, by common consent, could be equally well obtained for a mere fraction of that sum?",108
279,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Parkes) [3.3 a.m.] I have listened with keen interest to the subtle phraseology and clever terminology of the 'Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies). I - suppose that the As flight of the bumble bee over the beautiful landscape'would be comparable . to the oratorical flights. of the right honourable gentleman in relation to thi* bill. He did not come down to earth, as is his usual practice. With great skill, more he made certain points regarding journalists and what they should do in - regard to the overseas news service. This badly is a simple proposition. Why in the as name of goodness, cannot the wireless listeners of Australia have an independent news service? Is there any reason why a - man starting a newspaper tois morrow'should not say, "" I do not want the combine. I want to see whether 1 can get independent news"". .There are sources of news, as there are source* ; of other things that are gathered. a man of enterprise and skill What can get some additional news. Because the Broadcasting Committee, in its wisdom, has recommended that there shall the be an independent news .service, it is ' attacked. As is its duty, it has considered the future of the wireless-listening public. of This controversy has raged for a very long time, and a lot of sinister implicaComtions have grown' up round the matter. If the question were simply whether there was to be a news service from London, I do not believe that that would create any deep problems. But other serfeatures have been injected into the proposition of the news service, and these require some investigation. My reply to the challenge of the Leader of the Oppowho said, ,in effect, "" Do you that suggest that the news coming from overseas is coloured ?"" is that, in the main, because of the pressure of the job and not becaijse of the ethics of the journalists, it is not coloured; but in some instances it is sufficiently coloured to be talk highly dangerous to the' people of Australia, because often 4he ''account-is loaded against the Australian Labour party and the Commonwealth Labour Government.",108
280,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I should like the. honourable gentleman to give an illustration of that. I thought that most of the accounts were in favour of his party!,109
281,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"When the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), now on his way to America, was the first chairman of the United Nations organization, the reporting of his activities was disgraceful. It was coloured and biased, and made me feel ashamed of the journalists responsible for it. Insinuations were made in regard to his competency as a chairman. The accusations were so small as to have been insignificant had they not been disseminated by a news agency serving millions of people and commanding the attention of the world. The cables sent to this country cleverly made it appear that they expressed the views of a Canadian correspondent at the conference of the United Nations. In my experience, I have found both Australian and overseas journalists to have a code of ethics which does not permit them to do such things. Only a small group has those instructions.",109
282,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"That is a very queer code of ethics. Does the honourable gentleman mean that they would not voluntarily invent the story, but would invent it if they were told to do so?",109
283,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I have said that they represent a. very small section. The same features have been associated with the reporting of the statements and actions of the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt). He has been the victim of coloured misreporting.,109
284,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"That is today's funny story. He has been boosted. He is "" the world "".",109
285,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Because this great Australian is making the head-lines overseas members of the Opposition seem to be disturbed. I maintain that he has been grievously misreported. I shall exert a quietening influence on the Opposition by referring to an incident that occurred quite recently-the misreporting of the Gibraltar incident. I am not to be silenced by the Leader of the Opposition asking, "" Will you. say in front of your fellow . pressmen ,;'that. ^ there are any coloured stories from overseas?"" I should say that, there are coloured stories from overseas. These professional ex-servicemen of the old school, who think in terms of the Battle of Omdurman, did not voice any protests when I mentioned in this House that the affray at Gibraltar had been the subject of a had piece of misreporting.",109
286,Mr BOWUEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Where did the honourable member learn that?,109
287,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"What I then said has been justified by a report published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, a newspaper for which I have no great affection, regarding the experiences of a man who went to Gibraltar to investigate the case. I repeat that there was then no attempt on the part of ex-servicemen who are members of the Opposition to come to the defence of the Victory Contingent, because they were thinking of the kind of press they would get at the general elections. To return to the draft agreement: 1 listened with considerable interest to the declaration of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Erancis) that he was speaking for the Australian Journalists Association on some matter relative to the draft news agreement: So far as any knowledge of news or of that agreement is concerned, he is completely at a loss. I would say, in regard to some of his statements, that if , as a journalist, I were asked to write his political epitaph, it would be, "" Here lies the honourable member for Moreton-as usual "". The honourable member made one statement concerning the attitude of M.r. Hanlon to the draft agreement. It is perfectly obvious, from the evidence, that Mr Hanlon, having protested against that agreement as a journalist, decided eventually that he would democratically go with the majority when he had been out-voted. At no time did he withdraw from the position that he was violently opposed to it. In support of the attitude of Mr Hanlon I read the following extracts from an article written by Kim in the Australian Worker of the 9 th May, 1945, a few weeks before he became a member of the commission:The light that is now beingwaged so bitterly by the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association for a monopolyp of the news broadcasting services of this country is just another aspect of the fight that the. chairman and his - fellow conspirators waged, more or less successfully, for the monopoly of the news which is now being published in the newspapers controlled by them in nearly every capital city .in Australia. . . . The plot of the members of the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association to secure a monopoly of Australia's - news broadcasting services is obvious. Having by various and devious means secured control of the overseas :and .most of the interstate news services for publication in their newspapers, they now by hook or 'by crook are desperately anxious to secure control of the air for the same sinister purpose. . . Herein then lies the reason that the newspaper monopolists in Australia-the members of the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association-ar e manoeuvring so cunningly and so brazenly for the monopoly of the air. A man who would write in that fashion just before being appointed to the commission indicated fairly clearly his attitude to the agreement. It seems fair and reasonable that there should be an independent news service. It is the desire of every one who starts a newspaper to get such a service, rather than to use the existing services with all their, disadvantages. At this point, there enters the sinister figure of Mr Henderson, chairman of the Australian 'Newspaper Proprietors Association. First, he did not want to have anything to do with the matter. TTe became derisive of the suggestion, and said that the service would be "" political "". That phrase might be taken from the style-book of theSydney Morning Herald, where the belief is held that any thing which differs from the opinion of the Sydney Mcrnvag Herald must be political. Mr Henderson said that he did not care - whether or not there was an agreement with his organization, and that even if there was it would not mean anything. In the meantime, he had increased the price of the proposed service by 250 per cent.! At one time Mr Cleary, a former chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, was a rabid advocate of an independent news service. Then be suffered a change of heart, probably after he had a talk with representatives of the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. He became a violent opponent of an independent news service"", and was all for getting news in the nice, easy way from the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. His change of heart may not have been .lfr. tfaylen. ' unassocia-ted with the appointment of Mr Dearner as fiditoT of the ABC. Weekly. The Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association was moving in the background. Look how its hand has crept out to .get control of the B-class broadcasting stations. The almost childish innocence of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) is pathetic. After having sat as a member of such an inte'lhgent committee for so long, he emerges with a minority report, which, I believe., must have been written for' him, because its inanities would be - beyond even him. The present allegedly independent broadcast ,news service is of the sausagemachine type. This is what it boils dowD to- "" This is by courtesy of the Sydney Morning Herald"". There is a story about some one who broke his leg, and the leg is always broken in exactly the same way and at exactly the same time. News gathering of that sort destroys all initiative in journalism. Evidence was given before the BToadcasting Committee by Mr. Dixon, news - editor of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, who is an expert in his line. The technique in handling news for broadcasting, is different from that in handling news for publication in a newspaper. News for broadcasting must be compressed within a specified time, yet honourable members opposite say' that it is absurd to go anywhere else for news than to the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. The institution of an independent service was advocated by Mr Dixon, by Mr Hanlon, with 40 years' experience behind him, and finally by the Australian Journalists. Association, which believed that the sausage-machine kind of journalism'was dangerous and harmful to journalists. The Australian Journalists Association is always pleased to see another newspaper begin publication. Under the present .system, .a sensitive journalist starts out with enthusiasm, but be gets into the hands of an unsympathetic management or board of control, where he quickly loses that ""first, fine careles.* rapture"" that makes a good journalist. It is evident that Mr Dixon wanted to handle an independent news service, and he was supported by Mr Hanlon. The proposal was opposed by Mr Boyer, whose principal claim to speak on the subject appears to be that he w.as a grazier. might he qualified on some grounds serve on the commission, but not ground that, he knew anything news-getting. The proposal was opposed by Mr Moses, general manager to. my electors. of the Australian Broadcasting Commisquentiality-, sion, who was a good cricket broadcaster at one time, but of whom nothing has been, heard as a news man since he to speak of the lengthening shadows the lawn at the cricket ground. The other opponent was Mr Dawes, a Labour .man,, who might be described as a sister. ' An independent news service sought by those associated with broadthere casting who knew what they were talking about. There was nothing political in their attitude, but they wanted' to break the newspaper combine,, just as the casting of the proceedings of this Parliaevidence ment have in some measure broken the power of the combine to disseminate liamentary news in a fashion to suit itself. Somebody moved quickly, and induced the honourable member for Moreton to act for him. This is too important a matter test upon the reports of a minority a majority in the Broadcasting Comthe mittee. We are now dealing with the most powerful medium of news disseminathat tion in the world-.radi o broadcasting. Let us examine some of the witnesses gave evidence before the committee. First tJhere was the journalist Dixon the old 'editor Hanlon. who could be easily led into the trap by the suggestion that it would be nice to get a staff ready made and wrapped up in cellophane. No journalist would say that that would be a very interesting job. Then we had the president of the Australian paper Proprietors Association, Mr. Henderson, who cut a very sorry and pathetic figure before the committee. made such amassing statements that when I first read the report I could hardly believe them. He said that the committee was political, that broadcastto ing w.as political, and that the commisAssociation sion itself was political in its news casts. He even referred to the fact that on seven Sundays out of nine, I had broadcasts over-the national station New South Wales-. He characterized those broadcasts as inconsequential and said they .should, not have gone over air. I have very limited facilities for 1 He reachiaig my electors through the newsto papers, because of "" the Haylen case ""oh the which honourable members will perabout haps remember, and naturally I also used the air to. convey messages As for inconseafter a check I found that the matter contained in six of my broad easts , w.as used by the Sydney Mornused ing Herald on the following Monday on - morning. As a matter of' fact, the only item not reprinted' in that journal related to additions to Mr Henderson's luxurious weak residence which were made during the was darkest days of the war and about which ' was some comment in this House. If there was anything political in that, the politicswere certainly not in favour broadof Mr Henderson. Every word of his before the committee was full of spleen and Mas. He lashed this way and parthat; he did not want parliamentarians to examine him because he regarded himself as a little dictator. How dare they bring him before them and question him ? tr> That was his attitude despite the and fact that his activities have caused Fairfaxes to pull the blind down early in the mornings. It is obvious the Fairfaxes are worried about the future of their newspaper and we can who ' assume what they will do before very long. Mr Henderson also made other and serious statements about this agreement. He referred to a conversation which had taken place between himself and our late revered Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, in which Mr Curtin is alleged to have said not in effect, "" Had I given a line to the politicians they would have been boostNewsing themselves over the air."" That statement shocked the committee,, and when it was subsequently published it He was characterized as views, not news. That, of course, was sufficient to condemn it. Air. Henderson led the committee to believe that it did not matter the Australian Newspaper Proprietors what kind of news service' broadthe commission got; he was not concerned about itI f it .did not matter made anything to Mr Henderson, why in - did - he become so mad about it ; why did he lash himself into a veritable fury overit? I . understand that after the he had completed, his evidence he wnote a. series-, of letters to other witnesses who had given evidence before the committee asking why they had attacked him. He has the fuehrer complex and fights the people about him, which makes us think he believed there, was more behind the proposal for an independent news service than he would have us know. It is obvious that he feared an independent news service because something might be brought out into the light of day which he would rather should remain hidden. He would prefer to have over-all coverage of news by one organization in which he would act as a kind of commercial entre; preneur, the very thing that has brought journalism down to the level that it has reached today. City newspapers are "" smarming "" the whole thing over with misrepresentation, and the advance guard is led by the. president of the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association who has condemned the independent news service. Either news is to be reported faithfully or it is to be ""cooked up "" to suit this one or that. In the main, journalists do the job for which they are paid and present the news fairly; there are others, however, who are prepared to do what they are told. The average reporter is sick and tired as is also the public of sausage-machine journals with their comic strips and sexy cartoons. If an independent news service will give a fresher approach to the news whether from overseas or local sources, we shall have achieved a highly desirable objective. The question of price is a matter of pure speculation. It has been said that this service, may cost £200,000. A sensible news editor who had been accustomed to handling news in his own way said that he could supply such a service for £80,000. If an independent news service will bring freshness, warmth and clean reporting into the air and into the 3,000,000 homes throughout Australia in which radio receivers are installed its cost will be fully justified. There are many aspects of the bill that I should like to discuss, but owing to the lateness of the hour, I conclude by saying that the minority report of the Broadcasting Committee is entirelylacking in judgment and knowledge of the subject. Generally, minority reports are courageous; they are brought forward by men who believe that the majority may Mr Saylcn. be brutally wrong. But the minority report of the Broadcasting Committee is the most arrant piece of "" stoogery "" that I have ever read. The evidence shows in parts that the chairman or his deputy cross-examined witnesses in the tersest terms, but it was obvious that such terseness in examination was only in fun. The minority report was written in the twinkling of an eye. and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Erancis) and his colleagues, who signed it, sought to sabotage the independent news service. I exclude the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) who misunderstands rather than seeks to mislead. If we have this independent news service, who cares if it costs £50,000 or £60,000 more thanthe present service, provided the people of Australia get the kind of news they want presented in the way they like it presented!",109
288,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Gippsland) [3.29 a.m.] - I was one of the signatories of the minority report, and I had some share in its compilation. I challenge the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) to compare the minority and majority reports with the evidence sub-, mitted to the committee, and then say whether he can justify some of the statements he has.just made. It was amusing to hear the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Bryson), who is a member of the Broadcasting. Committee, talking of biased press reports. In all my experience, nothing more biased than the majority report of the committee - has ever come to my notice. It completely violates every principle which should be observed in assessing the value of evidence. The one redeeming feature of the majority report is that one of the four members who signed it actually blushed when they had to do so, because they knew they were, violating their own conscience and offering a gratuitous insult to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, whose responsibility it is to advise the committee. The commission was established to take charge of broadcasting, and a manager was appointed. That body has been divested of all power and authority, but it is expected to do its job in the interests .of broadcasting and of the people.' The Broadcasting Committee .has deliberately ignored 95 per cent, of the evidence submitted in favour of the agreement. I do not support the agreement at all. The committee had to consider the agreement which had already been determined between the commission, the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association ' and the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner, covering a trial period of twelve months. The Broadcasting . Committee asked members of the commission to give evidence regarding it, and it also invited the news editor of the commission to express his views. One of the employees, Mr Dixon, is the infallible gentleman about whom we have heard a great deal. The members of the commission gave their evidence in a painstaking way. Neither the chairman nor the manager 1 was adverse to a direct news-gathering service, hut, as they had to ask for more revenue to enable 'the service to be instithe tuted, they were not willing to commit themselves to a known expenditure to £200,000. They asked for tfhich to examine the position. A desperate effort has been made by supporters of the Government to justify the unjustiyears' fiable, hy casting aspersions on persons such as the chairman of the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. BLendersondid not give evidence before the committee as the representative of Sydney Morning Herald, but on behalf of the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. It is not playing cricket to besmirch the characters of witnesses beof the agreement. cause they give evidence fearlessly. I sat hack and enjoyed Mr Henderson's evidence. I like to hear a man speak as fearlessly as he did. Some members of the committee felt uncomfortable in his ness presence. A characteristic pastime of orable members oposite is to besmirch reputations of newspaper proprietors in order to excuse what they cannot justify by reason or logic. What relation had would the speech of the honourable member Parkes to the report of the Broadcasting Committee ? The ramifications of the bill, has been brought down in the dying hours of a dying parliament, are so wide that at least a week should allowed for investigation of the matters under discussion, before we shall be competent to express an opinion on them. The Government is rushing the measure through the House because it is afraid to act decently by postponing consideration of the bill until after the general elections. The reputation of witnesses has been sullied, because they hold opinions contrary to those of the shamefaced majority of the Broadcasting Committee, who are still conscious-stricken over their action. I have great respect for Mr Dixon, whom I regard as a canable officer. The chairman and general manager of the commission, I think, will both agree on that. The committee assessed the value of his evidence before leaving Sydney, and decided that the evidence with regard to news services should be put on one side for a year. Despite what the honourable member for Bourke has said, Mr Hanlon did agree with the rest of the commission. He had a contrary opinion which he expressed to commission, but he said that as the majority had reached an agreement, he up as a democrat would not oppose the a year in opinion of the others.",112
289,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,A journalist of 40 experience would not make a statement of that kind and then repudiate what he had said. The honourable memMr ber has put him in a false light.,113
290,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"He said that he had the expressed a contrary view, but as the majority of the commission was against him he concurred in their decision.",113
291,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,He was not in' favour,113
292,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Mr Dixon's evidence was incomplete. When the committee questioned him, he and every other witadmitted that it was impracticable honfor the commission to establish a worldthe wide news gathering organization, as it was quite beyond its capacity to foot the bill, but he said that the commission also get news from agencies. I for asked him deliberately whether those agency sources would be available, and he replied, "" I do not know "". When he was asked the'cost of providing the service, he which said that he did not know.",113
293,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Would not the Australian Broadcasting Commission have be its London office? Would,not the newstapes running there be available to tap the news which the commission' wanted, and would it not have a chance to change agencies?",113
294,Mr BOWDEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The honourable member may be a journalist, but he is not a member of the Broadcasting Committee. Mr Dixon said that Reuters' newsagency, from which he hoped to get news, would probably not be available to him, but he stated that American agencies were likely to be available. Whether he was right or wrong, a majority of ' the committee gave a verdict in his favour, and completely ignored the whole of the commission's evidence. The people who are to be responsible for carrying out the provision for the establishment of this service were completely ignored by the majority of the committee. That is condoned by the Government in this h ill . How does it expect to hold the commission together? In commissions, as in the Army, when politics interferes with management, chaos results. The provisions relating to the news aTe based on recommendations made by the majority of the committee that were based on the evidence of people who did not know the facts, because the only authentic-evidence about cost came from the very much despised Mr Henderson. Because he controls a leading daily newspaper, he has a knowledge of the eost of gathering news, and he said that it would cost the commission to gather news not so much as it cost a daily newspaper, but that he estimated that the cost would be anything from £100,000 to £110,000 a year. That will be the outlay on a news service of a commission' that hasjust asked us for more money to enable it to meet its commitments. I ' in v it e the honourable member for Parkes to note the irony of the following recommendation of the majority of the members of the Broadcasting Committee, on which clause 5 is basedThe act should be amended, to provide the Commission shall(a) establish its own independent service in respect of Australian news; The humour of that, after everything that the commission had to say in evidence before the committee has been utterly ignored! The recommendation continues(6) procure its overseas news direct, through its staff board, from sufh overseas agencies as the Commission deems Deems fit ! What does it .matter what the commission deems fit when its evidence is ignored ? It disgusts me that the Government shou'ld enforce its will on the Parliament to condone such shabby treatment of one of its instrumentalities - I am sorry to be associated with such a deplorable action. I am one of the minority, but I will back our view before any tribunal as a truer indication of the position than the biased majority repoTt on which the Government excuses bringing down this monstrosity for our consideration in the dying hours of the Parliament. The recommendation proceedsa,s well as from such independent sources a> the Commission deems it desirable to use: We have no objection to that part. 1 come now to clause 18 the piece de resistance. I have asked for an explanation 'of that clause, and two or three have told me that it means something about network control, whereas not one syllable of it refers to that subject. I do not blame the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) for suggesting that it is one of those sneaky little clauses that give the Government control. oveT something that, when the bill is brought down, the public is not aware of. I know of several acts that contain sections thatare undesirable from the point of view of every one except the Government. Clause 1-8 which applies to commercial broadcasting stations, readsSection one hundred and seven of the Principal Act isamended by omitting, all the words after the words "" and in particular"" and inserting in their stead the following paragraphs:""-(a ) for varying or adding to the con- ditions governing the erection OT operation of commercial broadcasting stations or an appliance for which a broadcast listener's licence is required to be held; and Paragraph a is understandable, because that the Parliament already wields powers of that kind. But listen to what follows:(6) for prescribing matters relating to the making of agreements or arrangements by licensees of commercial broadcasting stations for the provision of programmes or the broadcasting of advertisements, or relating to such agreements or arrangements so made."" Not one syllable of that cou'Id be recognized as having any relation to the exfit, planation that I have beengiven as to the meaning of the paragraph. I submitted it to a prominent King's Counsel whosaid, "" It is wide open. A3 far as the law is concerned, they can do anything "". In substance, he said, "" The Government can control every activity of the commercial broadcasting stations"". That. may not be the intention of the proposed new provision, but that is the interpretation placed upon it. The Minister has to explain it. That is all I have to say, except that the bill should not have been brought down in these circumstances. We should at least have time to consider it. I deplore the desperate excuses offered for it by not only .members of the Broadcasting Committee but also other supporters of the Government, who feel guilty about such a bill having been introduced in spite of the advice of members of an instrumentality created by the Commonwealth Parliament.",114
295,Mr FRASER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Eden-Monaro) [3.3S a.m.].:-The case against the establishment of. an independent Australian Broadcasting Commission news service must be weak indeed when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) has to rely on such absurd contentions as he advanced. His main contention was that the establishment of an independent news service could not be justified unless it could first be proved that the journalists employed by the daily newspapers were dishonest in the performance of their duties. The right honourable gentleman is not so inexperienced as to be unaware that there are from time to time such things as newspaper campaigns directed by the proprietors of the newspapers or that from time to time there are editorial directions that prominence be given to certain aspects of the news and that other aspects be played down. He cannot be ignorant that some newspaper proprietors choose to play up statements of one man and play down statements of another. It is, in fact, unnecessary to make any accusation of dishonesty even against the newspaper proprietors to maintain the correctness of the assertion that they do from time to time indulge in campaigns and give instructions that result in playing up and playing down.",115
296,Mr ANTHONY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Would that not apply in any agency?,115
297,Mr FRASER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I will deal with that. It is, in fact, very difficult with every desire to be objective, to be fair and impartial in a news report. Let us, for example, take the debate in which we are now engaged. In whatever newspaper it is re'ported, unless a verbatim account of the proceedings is given, the report will commence somewhat as follows:- "" In the House of Representatives today the Australian Broadcasting Bill was considered "". It will be necessary for the person preparing the report to pick and choose the portions which he considers are' of sufficient news value to be included in the newspaper report, and what shall be left out. It will also he necessary to decide what statements shall be given prominence. An editor who believes (hat the case against the establishment of an independent news service by the Australian Broadcasting Commission is overwhelmingly strong, will almost inevitably regard as most important and worthy of public attention the statements made during the debate against the establishment of such a service. Similarly, the editor of a newspaper who is convinced that it is essential to establish such a service, will give prominence to those arguments which, in his opinion, were the most important because they put the case for the establishment of the service. Again, a newspaper proprietor who is a believer in the theories of Douglas credit will regard statements, speeches and articles espousing that cause as ha ving great news value: Accordingly, by. his direction, those statements will be given most prominence in his newspaper. Another newspaper proprietor who is bitterly opposed to the taxing of land according to its unimproved value will naturally, and not necessarily wrongly, give prominence todenunciations of the principles advocated by Henry George. As I have said, it is most difficult to be impartial in the presentation of news, particularly when thousands of items have to be sifted and summarized, and a selection from them presented in the daily press. But it is particularly difficult for working journalists to be completely objective and impartial, and to follow what in their own minds is the correct course, when they are the paid employees of proprietors who hold entirely different views. The . Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) chose to rest his case on the assertion that either journalists must .be proved to be dishonest or the case for the estabpenditure, lishment of an independent news vice must fall to the ground. The honourable gentleman would be the first person to assert the right of the newswith paper proprietor to hire and "" fire particularly to "" f i r e "" , those journalists on the staff of his newspaper who did fall in with his views as to what was most important aspect or angle of news, Broadcasting Corporation. and did not play it up in accordance editorial directions. The fact that right honourable gentleman so bitterly opposed the establishment of an pendent news, service by the Australian Broadcasting Commission is a good reason'why such a service should tablished. Monopoly control of the of news'to the Australian public is thing. It is a good thing when the has the choice of a number of independent news services. It is all to the advantage of the Australian public that they have an additional news service, indepenthrough dently conducted by men who have no other end to serve than the presentation, fairly and honestly, of the news of the day through the great instrumentality radio. I believe that it would be. thing if further competitive independent organization. news services were established. I should like to see more healthy competition in the presentation of news over the air; I should like to see the "" B c stations given every facility to provide their own independent 'news services competition with the Australian Broadtion casting Commission. We cannot have too many independent news .. services in that rumour. Australia.",115
298,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Balaclava) [3,56 a.m.]. - This bill is too important to be .rushed through in this way. Although is late, I express my disapproval of such action. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) said that an expenditure of probably £250,000 is involved in the I am entitled proposal before us. That expenditure .would be a colossal waste at a time there should be a pruning of government discuss the bill. expenditure. The Government has said that it will reduce taxes, and already has made some reductions.",116
299,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING, - Order 1 The honourable member may - not proceed along those lines.,116
300,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"This is avoidable exand, in any case, a decision sercould wait until after the forthcoming right elections. Should the Government be returned to power, it could then go ahead its proposal; but if not, the incomand ing government could give the matteT further consideration. When I was in not Great Britain some time ago, I listened the careftilly to broadcasts by the British In my with opinion, the programmes from the Austhe tralian Broadcasting Commission compare more than favourably with those from indethe British Broadcasting Corporation. The establishment of the committee which this bill proposes to set up will, as the be esLeader of the Opposition, said, be a supply menace to the stability of the Ausa bad tralian Broadcasting Commission. I public was opposed to the establishment of the Broadcasting Committee. A lot of time of members of the Australian should Broadcasting Commission is wasted . having to attend sittings of the committee - I ' have heard a rumour that, if the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) loses his seat at the forthof coming election, he is likely to be a good appointed general manager . of this",116

310,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The Chair did not protect him.,117
311,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING, - The Chair will not again draw the attention of the honourable member for Balaclava to his conduct. He must discuss the bill.,117
312,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I do not intend to say any more. I can see the way the discussion is tending.,117
313,Mr FADDEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Darling Downs-Leade r of the Australian Country party) [4.0 a.m.] - This is one. of the most extraordinary bills ever introduced during the dying houi's of a Parliament. I listened attentively to the debate in an endeavour to obtain a clarification of the reason for the measure. It is surprising that, at a time when the Government should effect economies, this venture should be undertaken without any apparent regard for the cost. Clause 5 makes it compulsory for the' Australian Broadcasting Commission, regardless of the expense, to set up an Australian and overseas newsgathering organization of its own. From what I have been able to learn, the commission does not desire to do so. The late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, on the occasion of the appointment of the present chairman of' the commission, gave to the nation a guarantee that the commission would be free from political interference in its own proper sphere. Therefore, operating in that sphere many months ago, the' commission entered into draft agreements with the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association and the Australian Associated Press. The agreements were to continue and expand the right that the commission has had for a long period to use news gathered by those two organizations. I understand that the Australian Broadcasting Commission had the right to select the news before it-was sub-edited by the employees of those two organizations. The alternative was for the commission to set up its own news-gathering organizations. The commission rejected as being hopelessly expensive the course which this bill will force it to take. In -' deed, the commission was of the opinion that its interests would best be served by entering into agreements rather than by embarking on theexpensive business of establishing its own news-gathering organizations. The Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) has power to veto expenditures by the commission exceeding £5,000, and that power, together with the Government's majority on the Broadcasting Committee, was used to prevent the execution of those draft agreements. The Government's majority on the Broadcasting Committee was unwise enough to indicate various alleged reasons for its action. Believing' that the' reasons were to be taken seriously, the commission went out of its way to meet them. Further agreements, were drawn up which, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) pointed out, provided a complete safeguard against sub-editorial or editorial slanting of the news on which the commission desired to draw. That is an important aspect of the agreements. The Australian Broadcasting Commission had the right to sub-edit or edit the basic news - at its disposal in order that no slant need be given to the items which it used. But the Postmaster General (Senator Cameron) and the Government's majority on the Broadcasting Committee objected to those agreements. Disregarding the evidence of experts in the field of journalism on the huge costs involved, the Government's majority on the committee recommended the proposal now contained in .the bill. I was impressed by the statement of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Bryson) that the committee should be guided by experts on the cost of the establishment of the independent service rather than by - those with a knowledge of news-:gatherinjg. ! If that be so, why has not the Government been guided by the expert knowledge of the Australian Broadcasting Commission ? What will he the cost of the independent news service? Various estimates have been given during this debate. An amount of £250,000 was mentioned as the sum required to give an efficient service. Honourable members should be given a frank statement of the cost. Then we shall be able to set that cost against the value of the service, because now more than ever before, we are entitled to value for money expended. The people are tired of paying heavy taxes, and substantial relief cannot be given until the Government reduces escapable expenditure. This is not the time to enter into .such a costly and obscure undertaking as that proposed in the bill. Clause 18 causes me concern, because I believe that it is designed to implement in no uncertain way the Government's fundamental policy of the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. This bill is in accordance with the Government's Dolicy to socialize the means of the communication of news. It is disgraceful that this bill, which con-' tains such an important principle and which will entail the expenditure of such large sums, should be presented to the Parliament at this. late stage of the session. I protest emphatically not only against its introduction now, but also against its contents.",117
314,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Deakin) [4.10 a.m.] - Havin g been engaged in the perusal of another measure, I have not had an opportunity to study the bill in detail. However, as a listener, I am interested in this proposal, and I have no doubt the majority of listeners throughout Australia also are interested in it. As an ordinary listener I am anxious to know about anything that happens pertainingto the Au=tralian Broadcasting Commission. The speech mfde by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) struck me as the speech of a suspicious individual. He is a journalist, and, undeniably, during his career bp has lent some colour to news. As he snoke I wondered how one could expect him to give the clear, factual interpretation of news . which people desire. He seemed to have a grudge against Mr Henderson. The Sydney Morning Herald means nothing to me. Probably the majority of my constituents know little about that newspaper. Bui I have travelled around the world, and from my experiences I can say that the Sydney Morning Herald is so much better than the worse, and so little worse than the best, as to make it one of the finest papers in the world. The honourable member for Parkes seems to approach this debate from the point of - view of self interest.",118
315,Mr HAYLEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I rise to order. The honourable member has made an implication which is offensive to me. He is attempting to build up on the libellous allegation made by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) that a certain position is waiting for me should I lose my seat in this House ,118
316,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING, - The honourable member has not raised a point or order.,118
317,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The'honorabl e  declared that the newspapers carry on campaigns. That is so; but an independent Australian Broadcasting Commission news service could do the same. Recently, suspicions have arisen because - it has been alleged that the commission's news has been coloured in favour of the Government. A government news service, like some high public servants, would tend to lean towards the Government in power. But that practice cuts both ways. The allegation made against the commission in this respect may not be correct; but I have seen something of the working of this Parliament, and I believe that the allegation contains a grain of truth.",118
318,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING, - I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the bill.,118
319,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I rise to order. Is not an honourable member entitled to discuss what newspapers may, or may not report, or what news the commission may collect?",118
320,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING, - The honourable member has not raised a point of order.,118
321,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I thought that we were discussing what could take place under a government-controlled news service.,118
322,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING," - The bill is. to amend the Australian Broadcasting Act, and not with the newspapers.",119
323,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It can he inferred from the bill that the commission will..Set up .an independent news service. It has been said that the newspapers play up certain news. I submit that the commission's service also - could play up certain news. I understand - that, under the proposed agreement be-tween the commission and the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association, the commission was to be allowed to place men in newspaper - offices where they would be enabled, to collect factual news. Under that .arrangement, the commission's representatives could place their own interpretation upon the news which would subse-quently be broadcast. I should like the Minister in charge of the bill to say whether that was the proposal made to - the commission by the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. As 'an ordinary listener I do not want to hear - news which is coloured in the interests of any political party. I want to hear - factual news. The newspapers' representatives throughout the worldto-day collect news which at base is factual. I do - not believe, for instance, that the news which Mr M-assey Stanley sends from Japan is coloured to serve the interests of Sir Keith Murdoch. I refuse to believe that were - that .gentleman employed by the commission to send news from Tokyo - he would .send news which was not - basic news. The expenditure involved in this proposal cannot be justified.",119
324,Mr FRASER,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The commission's representatives obtaining news from newspaper - offices would only be able to read proofs.,119
325,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"They would be .given the factual news coming in from all parts of the world, and 'they cou'ld then interpret the news in their own way. I - believe that the offer made by the newspaper proprietors to the commission was that they would supply factual news to - the commission's representatives who were to be placed in certain hewspaner - offices. In effect, the newspapers would say to such officers, "" - If you like to colour that news, you can do so; but we will not colour it "" .",119
326,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,It would' be a case of the commission representatives being given news after the newspapers had coloured it.,119
327,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"That is nonsense. I have no need to worry myself about the press. However, I know some of the leading newspaper men in this country, and I know that they are as genuine and decent as is any honourable member. The next point I wish to make is this: How much of the bill is party political, and how much of it .is based on business principles? Of course, honourable members opposite are pledged to a policy of socialization. They are out to take control of everything. But 'this proposal means that the commission will simply duplicate existing news services throughout the world, and waste public money in doing so. Is .that political philosophy, or good business? If the commission can place its own men in the newspaper offices, and thus obtain factual news and interpret it for themselves, the expenditure of £250,000 on this proposal cannot be justified. The cost may not be so high, but it is significant that the Minister has not given any estimate of ,the cost. The - members of this Parliament can be likened to the directors of the nation, the firm of Australia; and, in this instance, it may be .said that our manager asks .us to do certain things, but does not place before us the cost involved in his proposal - .Such ,a procedure would not be tolerated for a moment by a strong and efficient board of directors. Apparently, that is what is. placed before the House by the Government, with . a complete absence of any business instinct. The Government is asking the people to sign a blank cheque. I , representing 70,000 people, the.great bulk of whom are wireless .listeners, am not prepared to sign a blank cheque. That may be the Government's way of doing .business. It is not mine. If it.be the Government's way, sooner or later it will push this country over .the precipice. It is heading in that direction. The sooner the people realise that .madmen - are at the helm so far as the finances of this country are concerned, the better will it be. Probably, they will then elect a new board of directors to govern this country. If this independent news servicecosts £250,000, that sum must come out of the revenue contributed by listeners. It stands tp reason that i the standard of programmes is to be maintained, the listeners must pay a higher charge. If they do not, the standard must drop, unless the Australian Broadcasting Commission enters the commercial field, and thus becomes other than a .completely independent body, financed by the people and giving to them the class of entertainment it considers will elevate their minds. I have studied the operations of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Corporation. The - Australian system, under which an entirely independent service, run by the people through the agency of a commission, operates side by side with commercial stations', is a good one. I am not inclined to have duplication whioh will depreciate the value of ithe service that listeners have the right to expect from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Apparently, the newspaper proprietors have offered to supply a news service for £20,000 a year. That is not a very big amount, and the difference between it and the £250,000 is considerable. In many respects the newspaper proprietors have acted foolishly. The Sydney journals did so when they declined to make space available free of charge for the printing' of the programmes of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. That service would have a news value. Newspaper proprietors would be foolish were they to demand a high price for their news. I do not say that £20,000 a year is not a fair amount to ask the tralian Broadcasting Commission to pay for the right to select in the newspaper offices the news that it shall broadcast, and to interpret it according to its own ideas. I do not regard myself as competent to determine the amount that should he paid. All that I can. say is that I do not think that those controlling the newspapers would be put to greater expense in the collection of the news supplied to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. On the other hand, it is only right that they should Mr Hutchinson-. make some charge for that news. I do not believe that the broadcasting of news has a detrimental effect on the circulation of newspapers. On the contrary, I believe that most people like to hear the news f broadcast, and then to read it in the press. I do, and I regard myself as typical of the majority. If I hear over the air any news that excites my interest, I like to read the details in a newspaper. Therefore, I believe that the broadcasting of news reacts to the interests of the newspapers. In my view, the step that the Government is now taking savours more of political philosophy than of anything else. It is bad business to spend £250,000 on what can be obtained for about £20j000, especially today, when the people are overtaxed and badly need to have their taxes reduced in order that they may have agreater incentive to increase production.",119
328,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"New England) [4.26 a.m.] - I had not intended to speak on this bill. But I am impelled to discuse some provisions of it that have been freely dealt with, because I believe that important principles are involved. Section 25 of the Australian Broadcasting Act 1942 provides that the Australian Broadcasting Commission may collect, in such manner as it thinks fit, news and information relating to current events in any part of the world,'' and may subscribe to news agencies. That gives freedom to the .commission to collect news, and place it before the people of the Commonwealth in the fairest light. A majority of the members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission have been associated in the past with Labour politics. Therefore, nobody can say that the Labour party in Australia, and the Government, are not Ausadequately represented on the commission, and that it is unlikely that a fair account of their views will not be placed before the people. The commission also has 'the power to set up its own news-gathering service if it so desires, conditional .upon the Postmaster General agreeing to an expenditure exceeding £5,000. Apparently the commission has not at any time requested the Government to amend the act in the way now proposed,, nor has it so far seen fit to set up . its own - news-gathering service and to discard the service it has been using. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) made a long contribution .to the debate.",120
329,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,And a very good one.,121
330,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It was good from his point of view. I always listen to him with keen interest, because I know ""that he holds a high place in journalism of a certain type. He is noted for those delightful feminine romances which are so beloved of adolescents. He is in some respects similar to the person described in the following lines from one of Gilbert and Sullivan's operas:Conceive me if you can ' A matter-of-fact young man, An utter poetical, super aesthetical Out-of-the-way young man. No one could deny, whenl o o k i ng at his broad, handsome forehead, that he q u a fies in some respects for a comparison with Gilbert's aesthetical young man. In his speech, he made it quite clear that he did not favour giving the public a fair cover of the news of the world and of the Commonwealth. What he wanted was to give them a service tainted with the views of the political party to which, he belongs. This is borne out by the fact that, in referring to Mr Dawes, a member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and a former Labour member of the Parliament of South Australia, he described him as a "" weak sister"". This was because he had not fallen for the attempt to foist upon the public a . tainted news service. The honourable member said that the news service provided by the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association was not suitable, and failed to put the Labour point of view before the people as it should be put. Probably the honourable member would like only the Labour point of view to be put before the people. The bill provides that section 25 of the Australian Broadcasting Act shall be repealed and in its place the following new section be inserted :. ""25 -(1. ) The Commission shall broadcast daily from all national broadcasting stations regular sessions of news and information relating to current events within the Commonwealth and in other parts of the world. "" (2.) The Commission shall employ an adequate staff, both in the Commonwealth and in overseas countries, for the purpose of collecting the news and information to be broadcast in 'pursuance of this Bection. ""(3.) The Commission may also procure news and information relating - to current events in other parts of the world from such overseas news agencies and other 'oversea* sources as it thinks fit.''. It is a matter not of whether the newsagency is suitable or hot, but of whether it is favoured by the Minister of the day. Clause 21 of the principal act provides that no expenditure shall be entered into by the Australian Broadcasting Commission of more than £5,000 or for more , than five years without the prior consent of the Minister. Thus, if the commission seeks to take its news service from an agency overseas of which the Minister does not approve and the cost amounts to more than £5,000 the Minister will have the - right to veto its proposal. In effect, the Minisl i - ter will have the right of selection because he will have the right of rejection. He can reject any' news service the colour of which he does not like. He could cut out all news services until only the Tass agency of Bussia was left, if he were a Minister with leanings towards the Communist party.",121
331,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The honourable member would like the people to get their news from a fascist agency.,121
332,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The Minister is an authority on fascism. Never before have we had such a fascist-minded Minister. Honourable members will not quickly forget the time when, without due authority, he seized the newspapers and newspaper offices in Sydney.. The purpose of this bill appears to - be to place in the hands of a fascist-minded Minister power to determine the kind of news - which shall be broadcast to the people. Clause 25 is typical of what was done in all dictator countries in Europe. In the fascist countries of Germany, Italy and Spain the - first act of the fascists when coming into power was to obtain a monopoly of the radio services, which they compelled to broadcast such news as suited the government in power. I am sorry that I have to expose this plot which has been hatched in caucus to destroy the freedom of action of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and to bind it to the Government. Of course the' present bill is only a . beginning. Later, the act will be further amended to provide, for the giving of instructions to the commission that it must broadcast - exactly what the Government dictates.",121
333,Mr BAENABD,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Evidentl y the honourable member believes that the Labour Government will be returned.,122
334,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I do not fear that at all, but I am fearful that the rights of the people of Australia may be interfered with by a government, irrespective of its political' complexion, if the clause is retained. The commission holds the - scales of - justice evenly and ' presents factual news. It should be kept untrammelled and politically unbiased. Ever since this Government took office, it has interfered in the commission's affairs. 5£r. CALWELL - That is not true.",122
335,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It has deliberately tried - to interfere with the commission, - and exercise political influence upon' the - commission's decisions. In this bill, the nigger who has been hiding in the wood pile is revealed. This is the most iniquitous clause that has ever been incorporated in any bill submitted to the Parliament. By a proposal worthy of a Hitler, ;a .Franco or a Stalin, 'this - Government seeks to filch from the people their rights, and from the commission its .authority to ensure that the .people's rights shall be preserved. If the Government - does hot agree to delete the clause, the people will rise up in their wrath against it - on the 28th September and return to - office a new government which will immediately bring down an amending bill to remove the offending section from the act. Mir. CALWELL (Mel'bouirne-^Minister for Immigration and Minister for Informa.tion) [4,43 a.m.] - in reply-Propose new section 25, which the irrational' and erratic .member for New Eng- - Parkhdl-1 land (MT . Abbott) has just quoted, appeals in exactly the same lanSpender),, guage as section 22 of the act of 19351932. Whilst the commission administered that provision in 'the spirit of the legislation, no trouble arose. Difficulties developed onlywhen the commission in began totie itself up with the newspaper interests, whose cause has been so vociconsider ferously championed by honourable mempress bers opposite, from the Leader of the Australia Opposition (Mr Menzies) down to-the press imhecile 'member 'for New England - Honourable members opposite have bitterly opposed two provisions; one is proposed new section 25 which will allow the commission to conduct an independent .news service, and the other is clause 18, which proposes to regulate the activities of the networks which have grown up under the control of broadcasting in this country. Proposed new section-;26 does not take away any powers from the commission; as a matter of fact, it proposes to endow the commission with even greater power and responsibility. The story which we have heard unfolded this morning is not a spontaneous effort on the part of honourable members opposite. They have had their briefs from the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. What has been said here this morning was said, in the Senate only two nights ago. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in - the Senate (SenatoT Leckie) said in respect of clause 5This is the vital clause of the bill and the Opposition proposes to vote against it. Honourable memibers opposite have had plenty-of time to study their briefs. The honourable member for New England never comes into Ah is House without a. brief, amd on this .occasion he has 'been briefed by the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Association. The story of broadcasting in this country is a very simple one-. Those who passed the original Australian Broadcasting Act through this Parliament .belonged to the same political party as do honourable members opposite. Early in the history of broadcasting in this, country, attempts were made to secure monopoly control .over the commer- cial station licences, and the position d becameso desperate that the then Minister for Defence, Mr - no w Sir Archdale , who later lost 'his sea't to the honourable member for Warringah (Mr-. said <on the 3rd December. We have 'growingup 'in tfris country a monopoly of newspapers and broadcasting which,, combination, constitute a danger that this Parliament cannot 'view with equanimity, and. steps should be 'taken to deal with it. Let us what has happened recently. Thehas decided that information cabled to gha'l] come only fWrni one source. The people of this nation get only what the cares to give them. That is' wrong in principle, and is a powerful' argument in favour of such a public utilit y as broadcasting being in the hands of the Government. Those remarks were made by agentleman who has no sympathy with the political philosophy of honourable, members this side of the House, but who at least honest enough to face the danger which confronted this country and to attempt to do something to meet the situation. The. degeneracy of the political party to which he belonged at that time has gone so far that all we have heard in this morning's debate is a series of apologias from people who are but the ""stooges-"" of the very people-whom he condemned. He was then fighting the newspaper interests, who were trying to get control of the broadfor casting stations. The then Leader the Labour party in this House, Mr Curtin, supported his contentions, and the present honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) had to sayI support the case"" submitted'by the Minister  of broadcasting. I was pleased to hear the about broadcasting. Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) ing with the policy and the attitude of the Government on this question:, so far as and T am in* full agreement with the sentiment expressed by the Leader of the Opposition when tary committee onbroadcasting. he said that broadcasting should he under national control, because I contend that broadcasting is on all fours with such public as the post office, the telegraph and the phones, which this Parliament has seen place under the control of the PristmasterGeneral, and I do not know of any authority in the Commonwealth more .competent to with thi« further public utility than master-General. * He argued in favour of the control broadcasting as a public utility in same way as the post office is controlled by a responsible Minister. The degenepress. racy of Liberalism has'gone so far that it is impossible to get a coherent argument from their representatives in this chamber. What the Governtralia, ment has done in this bill is prea cisely what Sir Archdale Parkhill wanted to put into die legislation 193.""). The Gibson Committee, of I was a member, made no recommendathis tion for an alteration of that section the 1932 act, which gave to the commisHonorable sion disc.rotionary power to set up news-collecting agency. The commission at that time made no complaint againsT that provision in the act, because it"" was then in favour of conducting an independent service. The commissionchanged its; mind only when the chairon man became converted' to the idea of was making an agreement with the newspaper companies, and no satisfactory explanation has been given for that change of. opinion. I do not suggest thai: Mr Cleary did not. make anhonest change, but he has not satisfactorily explained it. If j at. thetime when, the Gibson Committee was sitting,, he had indicated that he wanted an agreement in. the terms suggested! to the present committee of which the honourable member Gippsland isa member, T am certain, of that the Gibson Committee would have the late been unanimously against it. 1 The Leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister, set up the Gibson Comr this mittee, and gave it power to compol representatives of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and anybody else it wished""to summon, to. obtain the facts It was the Curtin agreeGovernment which carried out the recomit goes; mendations of the Gibson Committee,, including the setting.up of a parliamenThe Leader of the Opposition supported that, utilities yet he now says that the BroadcastingteleCommittee is interfering with"" the work fit to of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Whether there is, a committee or deal not, nobody can deny the right of the the PostParliament to tell the commission toestablish an independent news-gathering * of service. There is good reason why the the commission's news should not be tainted, but sho^d be free of influence from the The Leader of the Opposition asked, ""Is it suggested that a journalist, would tamper with the news? Would a working journalist in London or Auscolour the news?"" That there is tampering with the news is confirmed by people much more eminent than the in Leader of the Opposition will be, and which more eminent than any spokesman in debate is ever likely to be. I shall of quote an opinion expressed by-the Right Stanley Baldwin, in Hamilton a Fyfe's, Prcxs Parade-Behind the Scenes of the - .Newspaper Backet and the Millionaires' Attempt at Dictatorship. find that Earl Baldwin, as he later came, stated in 1931What are the methods of the press? Their methods are. direct falsehood, misrepresentato tion, half-truths, alteration of the meaning by putting sentences apart from their context, suppression. Earl Baldwin was never a Labour man. He did not represent Labour thought', his experience with the press taught to employ those words. We ""on this have a healthy suspicion that everything he said was right, and that public utilities should not be debauched at the hands of me, the Hendersons and the Murdochs, who, from 1944 onwards, have sought to get arrange control of the Australian Broadcasting Commission's news service so that they could do their work for capitalism, send representatives into Parliament like the honourable member for New (Mr Abbott) and his colleagues on the Opposition side. The point has been raised that the sum of £200,000 is too much for the commission to bear, or for the country to have to pay for an independent, news service. The concession which the Postal Department makes today to the press in various ways amounts to £900,000 a year. If concessional rates were not given, - the Postmaster-General would have £900,000 more in his revenues, and from that sum the amount of £206,000 can be used to maintain a really independent news serviceas independent as Sir Archdale Parkhill, the honourable member for Barker, and all decent Australians want it to be.",122
336,Mr ABBOTT,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Is there not sufficient power now?,124
337,Mr CALWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Unde r the existing section 25, which is to be repealed by the bill, a discretionary power is given to the commission. The clause in this bill, which the House will undoubtedly accept, makes it mandatory on the commission to do what it has had power to do since 1932. Now I come to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) who v has made the extraordinary' statement that from time to time he has pleaded for better treatment of invalid, old-age and service pensioners, . in - respect of broadcasting rights. I have been a memI - ber of this chamber for six years, but I behave never heard him ask a question on that matter, or make a speech concerning it. I can only attribute his claim one of those hallucinations for which speakers' he has long been notorious. . Referring again to the matter of' an independent news service, I quote the following from the evidence given.on the but 10th July, 1941, by Mr W. J. Cleary him before the Broadcasting Committee preside sided over by Senator Gibson enclosing a copy of the schedule, and stating that the commission would confer a tremendous benefit on the public if it were to its own cable service and collect its own news. By doing so, it would place the commission and the Australian people outBide and the grasp of any monopoly. That is the case, and I ask honourable England members to vote on it .

338,Mr RANKIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"the Minister f Army, upon notice I. On how many occasions in the past nine . months did he travel to (o) Rockhamptnn and (6) other centresin his electorate by (i ) service aircraft of any description and (i i ) commercial aircra'ft? 2. What staff accompanied him on each occasion ? 3. What was-the expenditure of Commonwealth money on each occasion? 4. Is it a fact that a Commonwealth motor car was sent from Canberra or Sydney to Rockhampton or anywhere else in the electorate of Capricornia for the use of the Minister? 5. Tf, so, when and what. was the cost involved? .PAIRS. MR . FORDE - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o ws :In reply to the honourable gentleman's questions 1 to 5, see my reply to the. honourable member who asked a similar question on the 19th July, 104C. In amplification of this reply, I , wish to state that I travelled not only to Rockhampton and Bundaberg in my .own electorate, but also on a number of occasions I travelled, to other States, in service transport aircraft similar to the type in which the honourable, gentleman himself frequently travels between Canberra and Melbourne. In addition, I made many trips in commercial aircraft. I made these visits sometimes when Acting Prime Minister and at other times as Acting Minister for Defence and Minister for the Army. In doing so, I availed myself of the quickest means of transport to which I am entitled as PAPERS. a busy Commonwealth Minister; it is my were preintention to do so again, whenever it is necessary for me to travel on public business and a suitable plane is available. Not only did 1 visit the two centres in my electorate where there are suitable aerodromes on which a Douglas aircraft can land, ' but also on a 1 number of other occasions I visited Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane on public business. I flew to Darwin, Morotai, Borneo and New Guinea in a service Liberator to visit troops. On other occasions 1 visited military camps' in various States. As Acting Prime Minister, I visited South Australia and Western Australia, and received many deputations, conferred with military officers on defence and Army matters, granted interviews to a large number of returned soldiers and met thousands of people in a minimum of time. This would have been quite impossible without availing myself of the facilities of air transport. On each trip I took with me sufficient staff to cope with the work. Whatever expenditure was incurred on such trips in the course of my duties as a Commonwealth Minister was amply justified. No ministerial car was taken from the Government Transport Department at' Canberra to Queensland, but on one occasion last year I took to Queensland an .Army car which I am entitled to use as USE OF AIB Minister for the Army. By the use of ' service aircraft I have o r the been able to pay more frequent visits to my electorate and to other centres in distant States while at the same time attending to my ministerial work, Cabinet meetings and the sittings of Parliament. In the old days, by train, it took a week's travelling time alone to visit central Queensland, with resultant waste of valuable time. Without modern travel my electors* woujd not have""anopportunity to see me for months at a time. In availing myself of a service transport, aircraft to make official visits I was following the precedent laid down by Ministers in the Menzies Fadden Government. We all remember, with very great sorrow and regret, th at on oner occasion three Ministers of a Government led by Mr Menzies were travelling in a Hudson transport plane which unfortunately crashed and they lost their lives. They were fully entitled to this means of transport,. and no member on the Labour side of the House uttered one - word of criticism. At this time it will be recalled that there was some public discussion of the dangers attendant on several Ministers of the Government travelling in the. same aircraft. It was. suggested that several Ministers should not be permitted to travel in oue plane. The honourable gentleman evidently considers that Commonwealth Ministers in this flying age should use a "" horse-and-buggy"" means of transport with consequent waste of time,'while he himself, as a private member, has on 'numerous occasions flown in Douglas service transport aircraft from Canberra to Melbourne and back; therefore, his criticism of the rightf ul use by a Commonwealth Minister of a Government-owned aircraft comes with very bad grace, and shows that he is vainly endeavouring to make party political capital out of the rightful use of air transport by a busy Commonwealth Minister. In this age of air travel it is a common occurrence for business executives to fly from one State to another in the course of their work, in order to save time. The present Federal Government is composed of hard-working Ministers who desire to know Australia and its industries and who are determined to travel at regular intervals by the quickest possible means of transport, not only to their own electorates, but also to far-flung States, in order 'to become thoroughly acquainted with the people's problems and the industries of the country.

Hnw were the amounts of £46.581.000 and £42.017.000, being recoverable expenditure incurred during, the year on behalf of other administrations and amounts recovered from those administrations, made up? The answers to the r i g h t honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. (a) Prooeeds from disposals in 1944-45 were £2,600,000 excluding credits to trust accounts. To ascertain the small amount of such credits in 1944-45 would entail a considerable degree of research which is not considered warranted. Proceeds from disposals in 104n-4B were £24.f!S0,000, including credits to truet accounts. The value of disposals effected by the.

Mr CJIIFLEY : - Yes t e r d a y , the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) asked the following questions:Is the ""Prime Minister' aware that a circular has been issued to government departments i (c) Muniwith instructions that the services of retired ' officials .at present employed temporarily shall be dispensed with by the 31st August? Is he also nwnre that, owing to the difficulty accommodating staff in Canberra, a number of experienced retired officials doing valuable work w'ill be discharged without the possibility in - of their replacement by younger men? Is it a fart that the work of some of the de£ partments will' be seriously affected if these instructions are strictly enforced'? If so. will the_Prime Minister take steps to alleviate the position, hy retaining retired officers in positions where ex-servicemen or younger officers cannot be obtained to carry on the work? I am now able to supply the following information:The long standing policy of terminating the services of officers at '05 years of age was departed from tn meet the abnormal condi8;000;000 tions operatins during the war period and normal conditions have not yet been reached, in some departments. Where the continued employment of the ""over-ace officers"" is 6,400;000 swurht,' each case is considered on its merits and extensions aire approved where the .circumstances are considered tn so warrant. In Rome ca«'es in Canberra, extensions have been RTiurcvneH im to the end' of August, givins. 6,200,000 that further time to the departments to arrange necessary relief. It has to be remembered that the employment of an "" over-age officer"", although in perhaps a temporary position,, may prevent younger officers from securing experience and possible higher duty payments. This can affect a number of younger officers in the chain of transfers that can follow from the elevation of an officer in one of the higher grades. The matter is being carefully watched by the Public Service Commissioner.",127
346,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"the Treasurer, Central Office upon notice I. Is it a fact that sales tax is charged on the freight of goods sent by city wholesale mercha-nts to country branches which re-sell the goods by wholesale? 2. If so, is this tantamount to an increase in freight charges? 3. Have city warehouses which rail goods to the country an advantage over wholesalers with country branches, in ' that the fo.rmer do not have to pay sales tax on freight of goods? 4. Is it a fact that this creates an anomaly insofar as country wholesalers are placed at a disadvantage in competing with firms in capital cities, and that their country clients are thereby penalized?* 5. Have many requests been received from country centres - to have the Sales Tax Act amended to remove the tax charged upon the freight of goods? 0. Will he give consideration, to rectifying this anomaly so that wholesalers with country branches will not be at a trading disadvantage compared with other city wholesalers who send identical goods to the same country centres? Mr . CHIFLEY - The answers to honourable member's questions are follows:1. No. When goods are so transferred by city wholesale merchants to country branches, the sales tax is not payable at all. It is true, however, that. tax is payable upon the amount for which taxable goods are finally sold by wholesale. 2. No. 3. 4, 5 and 6.

RATIONING : HOUSEHOLD LINEN.",128
349,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"On the 31st J u l y , the honourable member for M o r e to n (Mr . F r a n c is ) asked a question concerning the r at i o n scale for household l in e n. The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information:. The policy of the Rationing Commission has always been to ease the ration scale whenever supplies actually available or in immediate prospect have improved sufficiently to enable any relief to be granted. The commission is conscious of the fact that the scale for sheets, tablecloths and other items of household linen has been severe for some considerable time, and has been anxious to give some relief in this direction as soon as possible. However, despite efforts to increase the imports of household linen, the supply position is still »ery unsatisfactory. With regard to sheetings and calicoes, a considerable proportion has been imported in the past from India. Present indications are that supplies from this source are unlikely to improve in the near future-=in fact, supplies now coming forward from India are less than in previous years. The only other source ofsupply for sheetings and calicoes is the United Kingdom, and supplies programmed from that source have been severely reduced by the United Kingdom authorities. Other items of household drapery are still in short supply, and the review of the position after the last half yearly census of stocks on 31st January, 1948, revealed that supplies, in general, of all types of household linen which would be available to 31st March, 1947, would be insufficient to meet even the ration demands. , Wit h reference to the honourable member's statement that "" the average housewife has not sufficient coupons with which to purchase these urgently required materials, because of the demands that are made upon the total issue hy her purchases of clothing"", I point out that, even under the present system whereby elothing couponsand ' household drapery coupons are not separate, purchases of household drapery are as high as stocks and anticipated future supplies can stand. However, in individual cases where it has been established that there is real hardship arising from shortage of coupons to purchase essential requirements, assistance has - been given in the past and will continue to be given. The commission will again be reviewing the general clothing and household linen position in September, after the completion of the census of stocks held by traders at 31st July this year, and consideration will then be given to easing the scale if possible, though present indications are that the supplies at present held and the supplies anticipated from overseas in the near future will be insufficient to enable any easing, to be made. CENSORSHIP: STATEMENTS BY MB . ""W. T. HUGHES. Mr FADDEN ashed the Minister for the Army, upon noticeWit h reference to a communication dated the 11th April, 1945, from Mr W. T. Hughes, 'of Brisbane,, to the late Prime Minister, concerning members of the censorship 'staff in Brisbane, and which, matters the Prime Minister has stated were earlier fully investigated by the Department of the Army, will he (a) detail the nature of. the investigations made regarding each allegation made by Mr. Hughes, and (6) indicate in detail what was the appropriate action taken in each case?",128
350,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is af follows:i (a) The allegations made by Mr W. T. Hughes, of Brisbane, were investigated in March, 1944, by the Army Controller of Establishments, who was acting in a civil capacity and had been appointed to the war-time position of Controller of Civil Establishments in the Department of the Army because he had acted in a similar capacity in the 1914-18 war, and prior to the present war had occupied a very responsible post in commercial life. (&) The following information is furnished in regard to the statements made by Mr. Hughes as to the class of employees engaged in the censorship work:Employment of former taxi-cab drivers on the censorship staff - This referred to a person who had ceased employment in August, 1942. Mr Hughes advised the investigator that he had nothing to say against taxi-drivers as a class, but thought that men with better qualifications for censorship' should have .been employed. Employment of barbers on the censorship staff - This - refers to a person who was employed at the time of the investigation as a supervisor. Mr Hughes quoted the Commonwealth electoral roll as his authority for this person's previous employment, because thr occupation stated in the roll was given a i "" hairdresser "". Later this person was selling motor cars, and Mr Hughes alleged that he sold one to Professor Stable "" and was then appointed to the censorship staff and soon became a supervisor"". The investigator reported that both Professor Stable and the person concerned deny the allegation regarding the motor car, and Professor Stable proved that he had bought a different make of car than that which the person was selling. Employment of a cabinet-maker on the censorship staff - The investigator found that the allegations made by Mr Hughes in regard to this person were correct, and, in consequence, he ceased employment on the censorship staffEmployment of a collector of. bad timepayment debts on the censorship staff - The investigator found that the allegations in thif case referred to a person who had ceased employment in May, 1942. Employment of a retired publican and saddler on the censorship staff - Mr Hughes, in conveying information to the investigator, expressed doubt as to. the suitability of this : man for employment on censorship work. The investigator reported, however, that in his view the personwas performing his duty satisfactorily. Employment of driver of a pastrycook's cart on the censorship staff - The investigator reported that the person referred to had ceased employment on the censorship staff in September, 1943'. He. advised, however, that the information available in regard to the person concerned showed evidence of a good school career and contained excellent references. . Employment of insolvent storekeeper and reputed starting-price bookmaker on censorship staff - Mr Hughes advised the investigator - that this employee was an uncertified insolvent, which was denied by the person concerned, who stated that he had made a deed of arrangement with .his creditors following losses resulting from a fire at Somerset Dam. Mr Hughes alleged also that this person was associated with the Reliance Turf Agency, - which allegation was investigated 'by the Commonwealth Investigation Branch in Brisbane, but no' evidence was found of the vxdstence of the agency in Brisbane. The investigator considered that the person concerned was performing his duties competently. Dishonesty of pay officer - This refers to Mr. X. M . Smith, who was a permanent officer of the Commonwealth Public Service employed at the Censor's office. He was dismissed from the service on the 20th A p r i l , 1943, for misappropriation of funds while so employed. A.t the time of his. appointment as a permanent officer on the censorship staff, there was nothing against him, and the embezzlements which led to his conviction and imprisonment took place after his appointment to the Censor's s.taff as a Commonwealth public servant in the normal way, for which the Chief Censor had no responsibility. Employment of an "" international crook "" on the censorship staff - This refers, to a Mr. Raymond, who, however, had ceased employment on the censorship staff in December, 1939. Mr Hughes also referred to a Mr. Coombes, who had ceased employment in March, 1940, and whose ""'troubles police occurred subsequent to his employment in the censorship branch. Mr Hughes made certain allegations against a professional man employed on the censorship staff in relation to his separation from his wife. This hedescribed as not creditable to censorship, but the investigator reported that the matter of this man's divorce should not concern his employment in the Censor's office unless his conduct was such as to bring the Censor's office into disrepute. The person concerned had an appointment on the Brisbane University staff and the investigator reported that Ije wished to resign from the censorship office to return to his position at the university. Investigation of applicants for employment in the Censors' office - The investigator reported that certain of the allegations made by Mr Hughes had been proven, but in the main the allegations had not been supported by direct evidence, and in .certain of the cases vhere the allegations were proven action had already been taken to terminate the appointments of the persons concerned before the allegations had been made by Mr Hushes. The investigator stated that it .was hardly to be expected that, on the outbreak of war, when so many persgns had to be employed in varying capacities in the departmental organizs tion, certain persons would be appointed who would later be found to be unsuitable, either because of incapacity to perform their duties, or because of unsatisfactory records. He indicated that this applied not only to the censorship officers, but to all branches of the deportment, and advised that at the outbreak of the war there was no organized Security Service, so that a full investigation into .the records of applicants for special duty-suc h as censorship and other like staffs-wa s not possible. As the Security Service became stabilized, so investigations became more intensive and as thorough a check as possible was made of applicants for employment, whil* information became available in regard to those already in employment, which, in certain instances, resulted in the termination of their'services.

Will, he makea statement: aer early S3 possible*, on the* whole: problem ?",130
354,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The answers to the honourable* member's questions are' as follows;:1 to 5. The Government hns been concerned (or some considerable time at the difficulty in providing* sheet steel necessary for housing tnd secondary, and primary industries. At the termination of hostilities, considerable maintenance work had accumulated' and since then, because of the housing programmes and the Increased usage in secondary and primary industries, the. demand for - sheet steel has shown a sharp increase. The. chief difficulty In meeting requirements to date has arisen from the difficulty of arranging sufficient labour for the sheet rolling-industry, and the Government's endeavours in this direction are being pressed to the utmost. The position is improving. At the same time inquiries' hare been made overseas, anil the Government has been in constant touch with United Kingdom andUnited States suppliers since 1945. As indicated hy the honourable member, however, prospects - of obtaining supplies from these sources are not good. The steel sheet shortage is world wideand' whilst licences were freely issued* to motor body builders they were unable to arrange through their principals for supplies to be forwarded from America to Australia. For some time the Commonwealth control has been in touch with the sheet producers and as a result additional plant capacity has been created, and will be brought iuto operation early in 194T providing tbojt the necessary mini-power can be made available. This additional plant capacity has been provided despite the fact that asyet the companies have not obtained the manpower to enable them to work the oxisting plant capacity to the full extent. My Government, at the request of the Premiers, is exercising control to enable secondary and primary Industries to continue whilst, at the Bame time, it has endeavoured' to* supply sufficient for housing purposes to prevent aninterruption of t-hnf most important project It will be appreciated from the. above' that action has been taken to increaso plant capacity. Moreover the - Government is taking all possible - iteps to* provide the man-powen necessary, to wonk that plant and it is felt that if , as is expected, the additional man-power becomes available early in 1947, the essential requirements for secondary and primary industries and* bousing will be met providing the usaixo of sheet steel, is strictly controlled to ensure that it is used only for essential purposes. At the same time suggestions are being made that rtotl sheet should be substituted for other materials in many directions as a means of buMding up Australia's secondary industry and the Government, because of these new demands, is now making a 6ur.vey to determine bow far. this hew - usage can be met without interfering with established' essential requirements. The Government will continue to collaborate with the Bhcet rolling companies and is keeping in touch with the overseas markets i i i au endeavour to improve the position.",131
