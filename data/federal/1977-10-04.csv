3,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speakei and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because television and radio (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at all times, and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) against self-regulation by the broadcasting and television industry, (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards. And your petitioners as in duty bound wilt ever pray. by Mr Cadman, Dr Edwards, Mr Hunt, Mr Keating, Mr Sainsbury, Mr Stewart and Mr Wentworth. Petitions received. Tertiary Education Assistance To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citi2. zens (students, parents, teachers) of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision by the Government to withdraw forms of financial assistance to students of Non-state Tertiary Institutions is in total conflict with stated Government education policy. The decision will result in a shonage of places for training secretarial and clerical students and an inordinate demand upon the State Government education system. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that the Federal Government will act immediately to reverse its decision. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Lionel Bowen, Mr Hamer, Mr Martyr and Mr Sullivan. NA Petitions received. Private Nursing Homes: Pensioner Patients To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: PETITIONS That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of Private Nursing Homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down. Many pensioners whose spouse was an inmate of the Private Nursing Homes suffered poverty in an endeavour to sustain their partner while in the nursing home. Only in rare cases was the statutory minimum patient contribution as laid down adhered to. That the telephone was a matter of life and death to many pensioners, but because of the cost of installation of the telephone many are unable to afford the installation. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on and are forced to pay high rents, are in many cases living in extreme poverty. The foregoing facts impel you petitioners to ask the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to1. Make sure that subsidies paid to Private Nursing Homes are such that each pensioner holding a Pensioners Health Benefit Card will pay the Private Nursing Home no more than the statutory minimum patient contribution, which will allow six dollars per week to be retained by the pensioner patient for their personal use. 2. That a pensioner holding a Pensioner Health Benefit Card shall have a telephone installed free of charge, or at a very nominal charge. 3. That those pensioners who have only their pension and very little else to live on, shall receive a subsidy to assist them. The subsidy to be governed by a Means Test.

That there must be a further proliferation of nuclear all weapons as the result of Australia mining uranium. 4. That Australia can and should show to the world that alternative sources of energy such as solar, wind, tide and thermal power are viable propositions.

5,Mr HODGMAN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: That this House censures the honourable member for Oxley for his recent economically subversive public statements which, contrary to the accepted traditions of the Parliament, speculated upon the standing and strength of the Australian dollar upon which the economy of this nation is based, encouraged the likelihood of a major capital outflow from Australia as the direct result of his persistent predictions of an impending devaluation damage Australia's economic and financial credibility in the eyes of the world at a time when the honourable member for Oxley knew or ought to have known that Australia was in the process of negotiating for overseas loans. Suspension of Standing Orders",16
6,Mr SCHOLES,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY," I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Denison proceeding with his motion forthwith. I do this because I believe that, where a censure motion is moved against an honourable member in circumstances where normally it would not be expected that the motion would be debated by the House, it is essential that the House give the honourable member the opportunity to defend himself against that motion. It is possible under the Standing Orders for an honourable member to place any allegation or any type of motion on the Notice Paper and for it to remain there for the full term of a parliament. I believe it is important that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) have the right to defend himself. Therefore I have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders to permit an immediate debate.",16
7,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,The motion will need to be in writing.,16
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,I suggest that the honourable member for Denison would be delighted to proceed forthwith.,16
9,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"If the honourable gendeman asks for leave, I anticipate that leave will be granted. Is the honourable gentleman asking for leave to move the motion?",16
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,We accept that the honourable member for Denison should be allowed to proceed.,16
11,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted to the honourable member for Corio to move that the Standing Orders be suspended.",16
12,Mr SCHOLES,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Denison proceeding with his motion forthwith.,16
13,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,Will the honourable member Notice of Motion for Corio put the motion in writing? MrSCHOLES-Yes. The honourable member for Corio having submitted his motion in writing,16
14,Mr HAYDEN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY, I wish to second the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Mr SPEAKER ,16
15,Mr SINCLAIR,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of procedure. As the Government and Opposition and as a result sought to parties are in agreement that the motion be proceeded with forthwith, perhaps it would be convenient for the honourable member for Denison to seek leave to proceed without the necessary passage of the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders.",16
16,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,I cannot give that direction. The motion has been moved and the honourable member for Oxley is seconding the motion.,16
17,Mr HAYDEN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,I second the motion. I express some surprise that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has preferred to leave the initiative in this matterMotion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That the question be now put.,16
18,Mr HAYDEN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,. . . to a rather uninfluential member of the back bench of the Liberal Party. I have offered to debate,16
19,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,Order! The honourable member for Oxley will resume his seat. The question is that the motion be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Motion of Censure,16
20,Mr HODGMAN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"Mav's Parliamentary Practice provides that if a mouon of censure is moved against a government that government shall call the motion of censure on for immediate debate and will not proceed with any other business before the House. May's Parand, liamentary Practice does not provide for that course of action to be taken in the case of a dollar. motion of censure against one member of the Parliament. I am delighted on this occasion the forms of the House have allowed the sition to call on the censure motion which I move against the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). Nothing is more precious to the Australian economy than the Australian dollar, upon which the strength of our nation's economy is based. believe that the Australian dollar is of such importance that at times members of political parties should draw back in their public ment when they know or ought to know that theboth statements they are about to make could cause serious and, indeed, irreparable damage to the currency of this nation. The honourable member for Oxley is the Opposition's spokesman on political economic management. He has occupied the his position of Treasurer of the Commonwealth Australia. If this were his first offence one might be pardoned for thinking that perhaps he ought not to be the subject of censure, but I remind House and the nation that this is the second time within 12 months that the honourable member has engaged in public statements speculating upon the strength of the Australian dollar. I remind honourable members and the people of Australia that last year in the weeks preceding devaluation the honourable member for Oxley made a number of public speculations about standing of the Australian dollar. He tipped-tomatter use his words-that Blind Freddie and his dog would know that a devaluation was about to occur and during a period of weeks he publicly speculated upon the currency of this country. the event there was a major capital outflow from Australia in the weeks preceding devaluation year. How much of that was the direct responsifew biUty of the honourable member for Oxley, much of it was caused as a direct result pubUc statements is very difficult to prove. The facts remain-as Treasury records would demonI strate-that in the weeks before the honourable member commenced to speculate about the Ausimportantly, traUan dollar the level of capital outflow from Australia was comparatively low. In the weeks 1976 after he commenced to speculate about the level and standing of the Australian dollar, level of capital outflow increased dramatically. increased to such an extent that I believe the honourable member for Oxley could claim the credit-if it is credit-for having been responsible for more moneyflowingout of this country in that period than in any other comparable period to that extent, weakening the effect of the eventual decision to devalue the Australian that Mr CHAPMAN - It is to his discredit. Oppo Mr HODGMAN-Of course, as the honourable member for Kingston says, it is to the discredit of the honourable member for Oxley. I must say that I agree with the honourable member for Kingston that the honourable member for Oxley in 1976 was permitted-in fact, he made a welter of it-to speculate persistently I about the strength of the Australian dollar. What has been the situation during the past comfew weeks? The honourable member for Oxley, within this Parliament and outside this Parliament, has repeatedly speculated pubUcly upon the standing and strength, of the Australian dollar. He must have realised that in making cheap capital out of the Australian dollar, in undoubted desire to secure leadership of the of Australian Labor Party, he has been damaging the very dollar upon which the economy of this country is based. I believe the honourable memthe ber for Oxley should be taught once and for all that patriotism should come before party politics and personal ambition. The honourable member should remember that we are aU Australians, whether we support the Liberal Party of Australia, the Labor Party or the National Country Party. I am a very ordinary member. Indeed the honourable member for Oxley made the comment a moment ago that the Prime Minthe ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had permitted this to be raised by someone he described as an uninfluential member of the back bench. I would be very proud to wear that description because as an ordinary Australian who beUeves In that Australia comes before party politics, I was sickened and disgusted by the statements of the last honourable member for Oxley during the last weeks, in particular last week, in which he how used the Australian dollar for his own cheap, of his personal, political purposes. say that the honourable member did himself a disservice, did his Party a disservice, but, more did this nation a disservice because he made those statements at a time when he well in knew that this Government had publicly stated in the House, through the Prime Minister, that the we would defend the Australian dollar. At the It very time when this Government determined to defend the Australian dollar at all costs the honourable member for Oxley, by pubUc statements, engaged in pubUc comment which I can only describe as being economically subversive. This could not happen in any other Western liamentary democracy. I have been looking through some speeches made in the House of Commons. I have been reading back on speeches made by Sir Winston Churchill at the beginning of this century. It absolutely taboo for politicians in the United Kingdom to speculate publicly about the curthe rency. That is just not done. What sort ation have we reached in this country in 1977 when the Australian dollar is under attack, when there have been capital outflows from this made country, when the honourable member for Oxley knew or ought to have known-to use a legal phrase-that the Government was determined defend the dollar and was engaging in the proto cess of overseas borrowing for the purpose defending the dollar, which is the basis of our economy? I am not an economist, but in simple terms it has been explained to me like this: Every that has flowed out of this country as a result of the rantings and ravings of the honourable memfor Mr ber for Oxley is yet another dollar that this funny. country is going to have to borrow back into the country-to defend our currency you are saying in the and to maintain its true value. In very simple terms, that means that people like myself, and about indeed my children and the children of other the Australians, will have to pay the interest bill on the loans which have been mcreased as a direct result of the irresponsible, subversive and omically sabotaging statements of the honourmember. able member for Oxley. What sort of situation have we reached in this country when in the course of a number of weeks a member of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Austraha will make political capital out of the Australian dollar upon which he knows the economy of this nation is based? Mr Donald Cameron-He is just trying to ajob.",16
21,Mr HODGMAN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"The honourable member Australian for Griffith reminds me that the honourable member for Oxley is not just using this for cal purposes; he is trying to buy a job.

Can the damage done by honourable member for Oxley be repaired? of situWho knows exacdy how much money has flowed out of Australia in the past few weeks as a direct result of his public statements? I have an official request for that information because I should like the people of Australia to see how much money has gone out of this country to since the honourable member for Oxley started predict that there was going to be a devaluaof tion. It must be millions and milUons and millions of dollars. If there is one thing which would make people withdraw money from Australia it is the possibility, indeed the probability, that there is about to be a devaluation. dollar Mr YOUNG - Phi l Lynch left too. HODGMAN-The honourable member Port Adelaide (Mr Young) thinks this is very back-to get poUticalI columnists. see that you have joined the ranks of the We are reading daily what Press. Today you talked aU sorts of things such as brinkmanship, but you never once mentioned in your article in Australian",18
23,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,Order! The honourable econgentleman will not direct his comments to a,18
24,Mr HODGMAN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I inform you, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member for Port Adelaide wrote in the Australian today and did not utter one word of condemnation of the honourable member for Oxley when he knew that the honourable member for Oxley had been playing poUtics with the Australian dollar. I think it is very much to the credit buy of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) that he did not join in the attack on the dollar which was launched by the honourable member for Oxley. politiNo doubt the honourable member for Oxley will say that he did nothing wrong. He will say: 'I quoted from an article which I read in the National Times'. The mere fact that the honourWe able member for Oxley seeks to hide behind an isarticle published in the National Times indicates guilt and indicates that he is prepared to say, because a document emanated from the Reserve Bank which said something about the situation relating to the dollar 'I was entitled to go public on it'. My view is that the matter was summed up very well in a comment made in the Sunday Telegraph of 2 October last. I refer to it briefly but it seems to me to sum up some of the matters to which I have been adverting. It said: Former Labor Treasurer Bill Hayden might one day hope to lead the ALP parliamentary party, but he has a few lessons to learn. Hayden's speculation on the economy-particularl y the forecast of a credit squeeze and higher interest rates-wa s dangerously irresponsible. It was common knowledge when Hayden made his comments that the Federal Government was about to make a multimillion dollar overseas Yet Hayden chose to use the 'leaking' of a Reserve Bank memo on the economy to predict gloom and doom on the economic front. He should have known that such memos are considered low key by the Government's senior financial advisers and that forecasts they contain are subject to detailed investigation and refinement, before being considered accurate. There is speculation that Hayden might topple Gough Whitlam after this week's Caucus meeung, but many in Caucus must be having second thoughts about such a move following the former Treasurer's statements this week. The first thing any political party expects from its leaders is loyalty to one^ own country. I say with respect that the honourable member for Oxley has been disloyal to Australia in what he has done. His statements were economically subversive; they sabotaged the determination of this Government to defend the dollar; they have impaired our economic and financial credibility in the eyes of the world, and they have cast on this generation and future generations a burden to repay the additional loans which are now going to be made necessary because he chose to play politics with this nation's most precious possession in economic terms, namely, the Australian doUar. It was not surprising that the comments of the honourable member for Oxley, coming as they did over a weekend and reported mainly by the electronic media, although some of them appeared in print, brought an immediate and spontaneous condemnation from the Prime Minister and from the Acting Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson). I do not need to restate what they said so effectively last Monday, what they said last Tuesday, what was repeated on Wednesday, and what I hope will be repeated in this country for many years to come, namely, that the Australian dollar is above and beyond party politics and that he who seeks to weaken the Australian dollar, he who seeks to diminish its strength, is guilty of economic treason against this country. As a result of the irresponsible and highly damaging public statements made by the honourable member for Oxley, I believe the situation has now been reached in which we in this country should be looking seriously to a prohibition on extraparliamentary speculation as to the standing and strength of the Australian dollar. I believe in freedom of speech in this country. I believe in the right of the mdividual to stand up and say what he thinks. But surely to heavens, we have reached a pretty poor standard in this country when someone can play party politics and seek to enhance his prospect of leadership of the party by playing politics with the Australian dollar. I say in no uncertain terms that the honourable member for Oxley should be taught borrowing to support the dollar. once and for all that patriotism and loyalty to one's nation comes ahead of, and will always come ahead of, his duty to his party.",18
25,Mr YOUNG,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,Six minutes to go.,19
26,Mr HODGMAN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide wishes to stop me but he will not stop me because I am going to remind him, through you, Mr Speaker, that it was Sir Winston Churchill who laid down the great edict that the first duty of a member of parUament is to the nation. Secondly, it is to his electorate. Thirdly, it is to his Party. He said that occasionally you could change the third and the second but he went on to say that you will never change the first. Heaven forbid that we will Uve in a country in which senior members of the shadow cabinet of the Opposition which seeks to be the alternative Government wiU be permitted to go into the streets, the highways and the byways, not once but twice in the space of 12 months, and run down the Australian dollar. The honourable member for Oxley knew very well that, at this time, Australia was negotiating for an overseas loan in order to ensure that the dollar was defended. What sort of a friend to Australia is it who, when we are seeking to borrow money overseas, runs around this country, knocks our dollar and says that it is growing weak? What sort of a person is it who encourages people who brought money into this country to take money out before a devaluation occurs? What sort of a poUticdan is it, what sort of a patriot is it, who is prepared to say one word and who is prepared to make one pubUc comment which he knows is capable of damaging the Australian dollar? I sought out the honourable member for Oxley and was unable to find him before coming into this chamber today. I gave notice of this motion. I am pleased that it has been called on. I believe it will give this House an opportunity to censure formaUy the honourable member for Oxley for his conduct. It will give this House an opportunity to indicate to the Australian nation that this House is not prepared to tolerate people playing politics with the Australian dollar; that this House and this nation are not prepared to tolerate politicians who make economically subversive statements; that this House and this nation are not prepared to tolerate politicians who are prepared to sabotage Australia when it is saying to the world that it requires a loan to defend its currency. If those things are not worth defending, I and probably many others on both sides of this House would prefer not to be in pohtics at all. If we in this Parliament are not prepared to stand up for Australia, if we are not as Australians prepared to stand up for our currency, if we are not prepared to stand up for Australia's good name, quite frankly we would be better getting out of the system altogether. I say to the honourable member for Oxley in conclusion that whatever motivated you to do what you did last year and again this year, whatever motivated you to cheapen yourself",19
27,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,Order! The honourable gentleman will not direct his remarks to an individual member.,20
28,Mr HODGMAN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"I shall rephrase my remarks. Whatever directed the honourable member for Oxley to play politics with the Australian dollar which in economic terms is our most precious possession, if he has honour and decency within his veins he should pubUcly apologise to the people of Australia for what he has done and give a solemn undertaking never to do it again. Other honourable members are saying that he should resign. I say that he owes the nation an apology. Perhaps he ought to resign. The fact of the matter is that whether he intended it he has done grave and serious damage to the Australian dollar and to our name internationally. He has acted unpatriotically and shown disloyalty to the nation which bred him and which he has sworn to serve in this Parliament. I move: That this House censures the honourable member for Oxley for his recent economically subversive public statements which, contrary to the accepted traditions of the Parliament, speculated upon the standing and strength of the Australian dollar upon which the economy of this nation is based, encouraged the likelihood of a major capital outflow from Australia as the direct tions of an impending devaluation and as a result sought to damage Australia's economic andfinancialcredibility in the eyes of the world at a time when the honourable member for Oxley knew or ought to have known that Australia was in the process of negotiating for overseas loans.",20
29,Dr EDWARDS,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"I second my colleague's motion. I reserve my right to speak. Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. My point of order- I ask you to rule on it-is whether the term 'economically subversive' is unparliamentary to the extent that the word 'subversive' is unparUamentary.",20
30,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,It is not unparUamentary in the terms of a motion. I call the honourable member for Oxley.,20
31,Mr HAYDEN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"It is singularly appropriate that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) should have so much resort to patriotism in his speech. He estabUshed, as we already knew, that patriotism is the last resort of a scoundrel. If the Government is so concerned about the focussing of public attention on public discussion of the Australian exchange rate and the level of Australian reserves I find it rather remarkable that last week, on one day alone, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) should have done more than any other person in this country has done since Federation to focus attention on that issue by attacking me pubUcly three or four times. On each occasion when he launched the attack he underscored one simple fact, which was made clear and irrefutably evident by a published confidential report of the Reserve Bank of Australia. That simple fact-no t my comment, not my observation or analysis, but the considered conclusion of the Reserve Bank of Australia-wa s that the Australian dollar was weak, was enfeebled, and would continue to get weaker, and in the course of this year we would face a $ 1,000m balance of payments deficit. That is the sort of attention, that is the sort of focussing, that the Prime Minister reinforced in the course of last week. I find it remarkable that there should be so much contrived concern about discussion of the exchange rate when, in one week alone, the Prime Minister issued more significant comments than any other person has issued on the state of the exchange rate of this country since Federation. Of course, today the honourable member for Denison further emphasised the exchange rate situation. It is true that substantial borrowings have been made. The Government plays that in a very low profile-and we can well understand why. Already, within a few months of the commenceresult of his persistent predicment of this financial year, our indebtedness for overseas borrowings is or is proposed to be of the order in total of $3,5O0m. I predict now that the level will exceed the $4,000m which created so much concern amongst conservative coalition ranks in late 1975. 'Is there a man amongst us who would say that we should put this country into hock to the tune of $ 1,000m?' The Minister put that proposition in November last year. We are now m hock to the extent of $3,500m and we will be lucky if we are not hock to an extent in excess of $5,000m by the of this financial year. If we in this House are concerned, if members of the Government parties are alarmed that publar, lic discussion of the exchange rate weakens further an enfeebled dollar, then there are the ismarked guilty men-the honourable member for omy picks Denison who raised this matter today and the Prime Minister who has been somewhat pixilated in the almost hysterical comments he Government-the has been making in the course of the past week on that issue. What has happened is obvious. The . honourable member for Denison is in a petty same conspiracy with the Prime Minister. He has given the Prime Minister the coward's escape route for a coward. I have challenged the The Prime Minister publicly",20
32,Mr SPEAKER,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,Order! The honourable He added further on: gendeman will withdraw that phrase.,21
33,Mr HAYDEN,HONOURABLE MEMBER FOR OXLEY,"I withdraw the phrase. I have reason challenged the Prime Minister and I restate that chaUenge, to debate with publicly the issue of economic management. Let the Australian public establish which of us knows what he is talking about and who is an economic Uliterate. Let the Australian pubUc establish which party understands the state the economy, which is more competent to anaweak lyse it and which has proved beyond any doubt by its record its absolute incompetence.

I am too modest to make the obvious obseron exchange vation pubUcly-to express an opinion publicly accomplished on the exchange rate, if my comment of last year with the assistance of Blind Freddie, who damn sight more about the economy than the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) or any member of the Government, was so dangerous to the exchange Prime rate, how much more dangerous, how much more destructive was the comment of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) at a dinner to the in International Trade Division of the Chamber of end Manufactures of New South Wales on 13 September last year? There he speculated aloud publicly on the weaknesses of the Australian dolon our balance of payments defects.

So when you put all these things together I cannot see any whatever for complacency about our balance of paypubUcly twice, ments situation. me BUnd Freddie would give & simple explanation, on economic principles, as to what that means. It means very simply that in September last year, just prior to devaluation, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia believed and said pubUcly that of in his views our balance of payments was in a and deteriorated state, that our reserves were going down. The implication is clear to anydid one who has a fundamental understanding of if economic principles, namely, that the Australian settle dollar was weak and would get weaker. is Only a few weeks ago on 20 September in, I confess, one of the most impressive speeches on apmonetary policy made in this House, the honourof able member for Ryan (Mr Moore), a member of the Brisbane Stock Exchange, said: Australia we have a remarkably high level of interest at the moment. If we compare this with the overseas interest rates, one normaUy would expect that money would come securities in Australia from low interest The bank rate of interest in England is around the 6 per cent mark, the American interest rate structure-the bank rate, the prime rate-is about IV* per cent. Clearly there is a differential in relation to the Australian Government 10 per cent to 10.S per cent-1 0 per cent up the short Why is this money not coming here? It is for the simple reason that Australia does not give adequate forward cover rates. If this were to occur a great deal could be in terms of lowering the short term interest rates and putting a stop to the run on the Australian knew a exchange that we are seeing today. What does that mean in simple layman's terms? It means the Australian dollar was weak and overseas investors had no confidence in it. This was pointed out by a man from the Brisbane Stock Exchange, one of the few people in the economy. Government ranks who know what they are talkThis ing about on the subject of monetary policy. So dollars honourable members will know that there is a long established convention of people in this Parliament speaking on the Australian exchange rate, and they happen to include the current Deputy Prime Minister. Let us look at the situation a bit more realisticlear cally and not resort to the garbage that was ved up by the spurious patriot from Denison. us look at some of the hard facts of life. The people who are concerned about the strength the Australian dollar do not give a damn Lynch). whether the people in this Parliament are silent or loquacious on the issue. They stand to suffer considerable capital losses or, in some circumeconomic stances, gains because of exchange rate ments. It is in their interests to understand what happens to the Australian exchange rate. If we maintained a total conspiracy of silence Parliament, if all forms of the media were stopoverseas. pered and prevented from expressing any comthis ment on the exchange rate, those people would understand what was happening. The only was people who would be deceived by this silence would be the great mass of people outside have neither the interest nor the resources to influence in any way what happens with the traUan exchange rate. Furthermore, let us understand that those should people who can move money in and out of this that I have country are severely regulated by exchange rate tough directnoterms. regulations administered by the Reserve Bank of against a quite unjustified, Australia. So we are talking about a very small from the honourable member group of people in the community who have to seeking to divert attention from be informed otherwise, as a matter of business responsibUity, they can face, through lack of seeking to deflect public awareness fromHe attention, considerable capital losses in a situserious ation of possible devaluation as a result of observing what is happening with the exchange rate. Furthermore, overseas banks have been quoting the Australian dollar atfiveto six points below the official exchange rate for some months now. That is clear evidence, and it received comment by anyone in this country, that people fully understood the weaknesses of government administration. That is what we are talking and about when we talk about the reserves and when we refer to the Australian dollar. We are referring to defects they lack the wit the in the Australian Government's administration of the national economy. That is why overseas investors are not coming here. They have no fidence in the administration of this country they have no confidence, especially, in its country has lost hundreds of millions of from its overseas reserves since early this year. I pointed out in the April-May period that if the Government acted and acted quickly to announce a comprehensive and substantial overseas borrowing program, and if the Government at the same time announced that it was going to revalue its gold holdings, and if it did this with a evidence of determination, then it was my serfirm belief that the Australian dollar could be Let propped up and successfully defended. Instead of that, what have we seen? We have seen bumbof ling and fumbling from the Treasurer (Mr We have seen almost incoherent hysterical abuse from the Prime Minister directed at anyone who cares to criticise the Government's policy and, specifically in the terms of movethis debate, the exchange rate situation. The upshot has been a number of episodic in this movements towards borrowing money from The gold holdings were revalued. All was done in a disparate fashion. There was no continuity. There was no toughness. There no evidence of confidence or conviction on the part of the Government. Accordingly there is who a continuing drain in confidence outside of government, outside of this country. That is why Auspeople have been taking their money out of Australia. If it is said in some hypocritical way that I not be discussing these things, then I say choice but to put them in these I am defending myself manufactured attack for Denison who is the challenge which I have issued to the Prime Minister. the is shortcomings of the Government's econnot omic administration. If members of the Government were concerned about the state of the exchange rate they would have acted much earUer. They would have acted toughly.

Instead they lack confidence in themselves they lack confidence in their ability to adfall in our overseas them an the minister aura national economy. They leave about or atmosphere of uncertainty.

37,Dr EDWARDS,PAIRS," I second my colleague's motion of censure of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) for 29 his irresponsible, not to say, subversive comments directed at undermining the strength of 74 the Australian dollar. A leading article in the 45 Australian recently stated that the honourable member for Oxley, as I must call him in this place. . . seems tofindit hard to learn the difference between valid political statements on the conduct of the Australian economy and the kind of misstated exaggeration which may be common currency in some areas of politicsWe all have to admit to such exaggerationbut which is suicidal when applied to the economic area. It is the difference between fair comment and the scare tactic, and political scare tacticsThe honourable member for Oxley is becoming a past master in indulging in such tacticshave no place in discussion of the national economy . . . His performance today shows that since that leader was written he has learned nothing. He talks of the Australian dollar being weak. It is not. That leading article concluded: Mr Hayden threatens once again to help create the doom he effects to deplore. There is some truth in that statement-thoug h it is difficult to know why someone with the qualifications and experience of the honourable member for Oxley, who is not even the official spokesman for the Opposition on these matters but who is a Blind Bill to accompany his Blind Freddy who has so much to say, should attract this sort of attention. He said that the Australian dollar is weak.",23
38,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,He is weak.,24
39,Dr EDWARDS,PAIRS,"My colleague said that the honourable member is weak. His reading is weak. Whilst I have not access to the leaked document of the Reserve Bank of Australia, I have the version printed in the National Times. Under'Balance of Payments'it states: The trade account is forecast to strengthen during 1977-78I will read that againThe trade account is forecast to strengthen during and give a surplus for the year of the order of $ 1,500m. The statement outlines the anticipated exports and the decline in imports which would account for this strengthening. It refers to increased imbalance on invisible account but then states: Private capital outflow is the area of largest uncertainty the external accounts.",24
40,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,He is hitting at that.,24
41,Dr EDWARDS,PAIRS,"As my colleague says, the honourable member for Oxley is hitting at that. If there is a weakness in the accounts it because of this area of capital inflow. That is the area which the statements of the honourable member for Oxley were affecting.",24
42,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,He is subversive.,24
43,Dr EDWARDS,PAIRS,"They were subversive of the economic strategy of this Government. That why he is making those statements. His purpose is to undermine the economic strategy and the economic policies of this Government. Never mind that that undermines the whole economic position and the whole economic future of overseas. Australia. Anything will do for poltiical advantage. The honourable member for Oxley pursues it as far as he possibly can. It is of interest that in the same issue of the National Times which carried this report concerning the Reserve Bank's forecast of economic  nificant commentator on economic affairs and, incidentally, a one-time speech writer for the honourable member for Oxley-the honourable member for Oxley is not so keen on him nowwrote that if there was any uncertainty about the balance of payments this would require significant borrowings by the Government but stated that 'there was no real reason why this should be so'. He went on to point out that there are movements in the balance of payments at the moment. He wrote: The September quarter is always one of seasonal pressure on the balance of payments, partly on current account as export receipts drop off in their rate of growth, and partly because, after the end of the financial year in June, it is the time when foreign companies repatriate their profits. These are things of which over the years any knowledgeable observer-of course, not Blind Freddy or Blind Bill-woul d be aware and for which he would make allowance. Of all countries in the world Australia's currency and the balance of payments, founded as it is on our strong export position, our traditional exports of wool and wheat and also our massive exports of minerals, iron, coal and future exports of uranium. 1977-78 Based on all these things the strength of our balance of payments and thus of the Australian dolrise in lar is assured. Indeed, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), has a constant theme the so called Gregory thesisthat the growing exports of our minerals are in going to cause all sorts of trouble-that we are going to be embarrassed by our wealth. His worry is that we will have so many exports that we will be embarrassed by them. Mr Bungey-Who says that? would be Dr EDWARDS-The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that. The whole thrust of the circumstances is that the balance of payments and the Australian dollar are strong. This is recognised throughout the world. To counter this sort of current speculation the is Government has given notice of its determination to ensure that the Australian doUar will pursue its strong course and will not be subjected to any devaluation and that the Government will do this by way of significant borrowings from If people overseas really thought that the Australian dollar was weak, would they lend on scale that has been announced to the Australian people and to this Parliament? An amount of $850m will become available within the next few weeks. This is the result of measures which were announced on 25 August by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) and set in train a long while before that. Now we have had the announcement of a further $850m being made available, making a total of $ 1,700m. The honourable member for Oxley, direct with his continuing irresponsibility, said: ' I stand here and make another prediction'. I am not sure of the details but at one stage he suggested that we would be borrowing $4 annual billion. We would do that if it were necessary, but it will not be necessary. The underlying fact. strength of the Australian dollar is apparent to all.",24
44,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,And of the economy.,25
45,Dr EDWARDS,PAIRS,"This appUes also to the econassociated. omy. I shall come to that in a moment. If the honourable member for Oxley tries to scare body by mentioning $4 billion, most likely it will be people on his side of the chamber who will scared. They will have recollections of the $4 billion which was to have been obtained from questionable sources and through sleazy interfor mediaries and by illegal means. I do not know why they were prepared to go to that trouble belend cause at the time the public accounts were ning at a deficit and they were busy printing amount of money of the order of $4 billion in the bowels of Parliament House, as a colleague would say. I think I have said enough to underline the point that the Australian dollar is not weak and that any temporary speculation will by this Government. I repeat that the purpose of the statements made by the honourable member for Oxley is to undermine this Government's economic strategy for a return to economic growth and stability and full employment. We shaU continue to pursue our poUcies to contain inflation and to get interest rates down and this way to stimulate the Australian economy and restore full employment. I stress that progress has been made in these matters. rate of inflation is running at 10 per cent annum or less, compared with 17 per cent per annum and above when we took office. Who caused it? It was caused by the previous reserves Administration and its Labor Treasurers, who included the honourable member for Oxley, the subject of this censure. The rate of inflation is down and is running at the the order of 10 per cent per annum. If any honourable member questions this, let him think back over the past two quarters and the wage cases associated with them. In the March quarter the inflation rate was 2.3 per cent; in the June quarter it was 2.2 per cent. One could add these figures together and multiply by two, or could multiply eitherfigureby four, or make other calculations to get an idea of the annual rate; but a arithmetical calculation by multiplying the will figure for the June quarter by four produces an annual rate of 8.8 per cent. I will not press my case that far but shall simply state that the rate is of the order of 10 per cent and is falling. Let no honourable member dispute that As to production, it is not currently expanding in the way in which we would like, but it is at a significantly higher level than it was under the stewardship of the honourable member for Oxley and the Government with which he was It is running at a rate which is fully 4'/6 per cent higher than it was under the previous any Government. When the honourable member for Oxley was the Treasurer the level of production be had been unchanged for nearly two years. So production has been expanded and, as a result of two years offiscalrestraint,the settings are there a reduction in interest rates. That is not going to happen in one fell swoop, but conditions do themselves to a gradual reduction in interest runrates-and an increase in the ease with which an finance is made available. That has been our task, namely, to restore the settings for a healthy Australian economy. It is not going to be undermined by the operations of the honourable member for Oxley.",25
46,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The honourable be resisted gentleman's time has expired. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (3.25)-After Ustening to the remarks of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) we aU can understand why the Government parties stripped him of his post as Chairman of the Expenditure Committee of this in House. The people who are responsible for the rundown in Australia's overseas reserves are the much members of the Fraser Government-the Prime The Minister himself (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the per Treasurer (Mr Lynch) and the Prime Minister's cronies, particularly the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair). Under this Government Australia's have dropped, the debts have risen and the interest rate has increased. That was going on in October and November last year. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) gave the prescription which would avoid the mischief which this Government was bringing about. was going on again in August and September of this year. Once again the honourable member for Oxley gave the prescription which would cure the mischief. It rankles with the Prime Minister that devaluation of last November was hailed on all sides as a disaster; because that was his decision. Only one man joined him in the decision, and that was the Leader of the House. It was the inflationary thing that the Government could have done. Up till that stage the Prime Minister had said that everything was the fault of the Labor Government. He could never say that the devaluation of last November was the fault the Labor Government; that was his own act. The decision was made by him and an inner devaluation. circle. Our reserves were running down. Our overseas balances were running down. Let me give the figures in relation to our overseas debts. At the end of June 1973, at the time of the first Labor Budget, our overseas debts were $ At the end of June 1975 our overseas debts had dropped to $ 1,182m. At the end of June this our overseas debts had risen to $ 1,871m. Now they are to be almost doubled; they are to go by another $ 1,700m. We will owe $3.5 billion overseas, which is almost three times as much as we owed four years ago. Whose fault is that? It the fault of the Fraser Government. Businessmen in Australia and international financiers know quite well that Australian alition governments, formed of Liberal and National Country Party members, cannot conthat trol the Australian currency, cannot Australian currency. In October last year, when our reserves were running down, the honourable member for Oxley said that the Government should defend the dollar. He said that one means who of defending the dollar was for the Government Leadermember to show its faith in the dollar and to raise a loan bate because overseas. It happens that the same advice was ment or outside given to the Government by the Treasury. That This man who has was revealed, not from the Opposition, not from million misappropriation any individual member of the Opposition; it managescame from a newspaper. Mr Ken Davidson, writing in the Age, revealed that there was a discussion in Cabinet in which the Prime himself raised the possibility of having to devalue; and the devaluation came about. In the last couple of weeks the whole question of the outflow of our dollars and the possibility of devaluation arose again, because other journalists-namely , Anne Summers and Paul Kelly of the National Times- & fortnight ago published a Reserve Bank memorandum. The Opposition misappropriationcannot be blamed for that information coming It out. We cannot be blamed for weakening the dollar, for causing the outflow of dollars from Australia, or for causing the lack of investment from overseas in Australia. The responsibility lies with the Government's record in currency the matters. People at home and overseas still remember that for three days over the Christmas period in 1971 the coahtion Government was distraught on this question of devaluation. Even most when the National Country Party had won that argument, when it had preserved a grossly undervalued dollar, it was not many months afterwards-it was before the 1972 Budget was passed-that the Leader of the National Country of Party (Mr Anthony), who was then as he is now, Deputy Prime Minister, once again was urging It was for that reason that when the Labor Government came into office the country was awash with surplus funds and the dollar was grossly undervalued. People at home and abroad know that coalition governments have been un1,265m. able to defend the Australian dollar. I should say something about the way in which year this debate has been conducted. The notice of motion was given by the honourable member for up Denison (Mr Hodgman). It is the fifth notice of motion which he has given in the history of this Parliament. He is a great limelighter. Much to his is surprise, we moved that the motion come on for debate. Instead of this poison remaining on the Notice Paper, we said that we would take it coimmediately. Then the Government caused the debate to come on; the Leader of the House said it could proceed. Who spoke? The honourdefend the able member for Denison",25
47,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,"He moved it. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Yes, he moved it. But was the second speaker? It was the honourable for Berowra. I realise that the of the House could not speak in the dehe is not able, either in the Parliait, to talk aboutfinancialmatters. owned up to a quarter of a in companies which he",26
48,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,I ask that the honourable gentleMinister man withdraw those remarks.,26
49,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Can I give the facts?,26
50,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,I would be happy if you did. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I will do it on the adjournment. A quarter of a million,26
51,Mr SINCLAIR,PAIRS,False-lik e so many of the things that your say.,27
52,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw the remarks unqualifiedly immediately. Mr E. G. Whitlam- I do; fully, at once. Why is the Prime Minister not speaking on this motion? He is prepared to bucket outside but he will not speak inside the Parliament. He gets hysterical, self-righteous and unctuous outside the Parliament, but he will not defend the dollar outside the Parliament and he will not defend the dollar inside the Parliament. He will not justify this place the things he says about honourable members. There again, we know that he takes advice from the man who presided over the biggest company crash in this country- a man who himself misappropriated $900,000. One can see why the Leader of the House and the Prime Minister will not come into a debate such as this. Admittedly the Leader of the National Country Party and Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer are both out of the country. But the Acting Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) does not come into this debate. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) who also assists the Treasurer does not come into the debate. The fact is that the honourable member for Oxley once again has done a service for this country. A month ago he said that the Government should defend the dollar. He said that three things should be done. The first was that we should put a contemporary value on Australia's gold reserves overseas; and the Government did. It was the correct course. He said that in the cumstances which were then obtaining the Government should raise an overseas loan; and the Government did. It did therightthing then. The honourable member for Oxley also said that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer should at least make a forthright statement to the effect that the Australian Government will defend the Australian dollar. That has not yet been said outside the House. The opportunity is available for the Prime Minister to say it, for the Acting Treasurer to say it and for the Leader of the House to say it. None of them has said it today. What conclusion will be drawn by business people in this country? What conclusion will be drawn by international financiers when they notice that when the matter is brought up by a Government supporter in the House, when the Leader of the House moves that the matter come on for debate, the Prime Minister, the Acting Treasurer, and the Acting Leader of the National Country Party will not rise to defend the dollar. Last week the Treasurer, addressing the Austrahan-American Association in New York, bucketed the Australian people and the Australian Opposition. He downgraded this country. The Treasurer has a gross, crude attitude. He gets it from the Prime Minister. I suppose we can expect the Prime Minister to be hysterical in his vituperation against the honourable member for Oxley when one looks at his conduct as regards the Japanese. He called in the Japanese Ambassador to Kirribilli House. He stood him up and dressed him down. Before he ever saw him he got his Press people to brief the in Press about what he was going to say. Next day the headlines in the newspapers were: 'Prime Minister Blasts Japanese Ambassador'. A couple of days later from Longreach, not very far from where the Leader of the House was censured by cattlemen last week-the y know bull when they see it-the Prime Minister released to the Press a cable he sent to the Prime Minister of Japan before the Prime Minister of Japan could receive it. It was misprinted in the leaked form as well, presumably, as in the form later delivered to the Prime Minister of Japan. How must other countries regard the Government of this country when it raises these matters outside, constantly causing speculation and promoting economic and political uncertainty? What is all this talk about an early election? The speculation is condemned by the Prime Minister who himself promotes it. With one word he could queU all that speculation. What does that do for business confidence in Australia or overseas? The simple fact is that it is the Fraser cir- Government which has been responsible for the decline in business confidence in Australia. It has been responsible for the decUne in overseas confidence in Australia as a proper place to invest or to hold funds. The honourable member for Denison had the gall to suggest that there was some convention in these matters. This came from a member of the party which was responsible for the breaches of convention throughout the latter half of 1975. How unctuous and selfrighteous you can get. The honourable member for Oxley was right last October. He was right in September this year. If his advice had been taken last year we would have owed only half as much. Instead of having to borrow $US2 bilhon we would have had to borrow only $US1 billion. We would have had only half the interest rate bill. We would have saved about $ 1,000m in overseas reserves. All the people are paying in monetary terms. Above all, we are all paying in terms of inflation. The devaluation of last November was the most inflationary action the Government could have taken. It cannot blame the Labor Party for that. It was wholly the fault of the Fraser Government. Inflation got a new burst. The Fraser Government ruled off the book with the devaluation of November last year. The situation since then has been its responsibility and its alone. It is a victim of its own rhetoric. It should have borrowed $1 billion last November but it had already borrowed almost that amount overseas. The Government then sought-her e is the dreaded figure-$ 2 billion overseas in one financial year. In the light of all the things the Government said about overseas loan raising in 1975 it could not face up to it. Yet the week before last the Acting Treasurer came out with the statement that the Government is borrowing $2 billion overseas for temporary purposes. What would the former Attorney-General have said about that? Now the Government has done it. If it had only taken the advice of the honourable member for Oxley 11 months ago there would have been less inflation in Australia. Our overseas debts would have been smaller. There would have been more confidence in Australiaboth by Australians and by people overseas. Sir William MCMahon- I rise to make a personal explanation relating to the revaluations upwards against the British pound in the 1971-72fiscalyear.",27
53,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Does the right honourable gentleman claim to have been misrepresented? Sir William MCMahon-Yes . I had to give that background and you will remember the occasion, Mr Speaker. I think the House will also remember it. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) said that the Liberal Party which involved me gave into pressure by the Country Party on the degree of revaluation. That is totally untrue. I went into the Cabinet determined that the revaluation would be 6.32 per cent. You Mr Speaker, wanted something substantially higher. I stuck to thefigureof 6.32 per cent throughout. The Country Pany wanted no movement at all. I had already taken preliminary action to swear in a new Government if it had been necessary. With regard to the second claim by the Leader of the Opposition that Australia was flooded with money at the end of 1972, any person of common sense who knew and understood the facts relating to the amount of assets held overseas by the Reserve Bank would say today that a government which could achieve that level-yo u were the Treasurer at the time, Mr SPEAKER - kne w what it was doing and was successful. There were few signs in the subsequent three years that the Labor Party ever knew what it was doing. That is the cause of our present problems.",28
54,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,Brin g back Bill! Sir William MCMahon- I say to the fat gentleman opposite that I am 9st 61b. He is 13st 41b and bloated. One can tell to which person ' Big Fat Bill' ought to apply.,28
55,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I do not think the honourable member was saying 'Big Fat Bill'. I think he was saying 'Bring Back Bill'. Sir William MCMahon-Will you extend the courtesy to allow me to say that I should like him to say it again? I am sorry that I misunderstood him. I would like to hear it more clearly.,28
56,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,I have bad news for the right honourable gentleman. I think it was me he meant and not therighthonourable member for Lowe.,28
57,Mr SHORT,PAIRS, I fully support the motion moved today by my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) and so ably seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards). It is certainly a much more relevant and urgent motion than the matter of public importance that was originally proposed by the Opposition. Nowadays urgency debates in this House are not what they used to be.,28
58,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I suspect that the honourable gentleman is speaking to a matter of public importance. The motion before the House is that moved by the honourable member for Denison.,28
59,Mr UREN,PAIRS,I take a point of order. The Leader of the House has already been exposed. We know that the Government will not permit the urgency motion at a later date.,28
60,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is no point of order. The honourable member for Ballaarat may speak to the motion moved by the honourable member for Denison. When I called him he was the only person from the Government benches to rise. That is why I called him to speak to that motion. If he does not wish to do so he should resume his seat.,28
61,Mr SHORT,PAIRS,"I rose to support the motion. In doing so I think that the honourable member for Denison and other speakers from this side of the House have shown today to the House and to listeners of this debate the hypocrisy of what the Labor Party in opposition has been trying to achieve in the two years since it lost the government benches. Over the last two years the Labor Party has thought that it can hoodwink the Australian people and con them against all logical reason into believing that the Fraser Government has not brought back responsible government to this nation after three years of catastrophic mismanagement under Labor. But the Australian people have not been conned. They know, just as the Opposition knows in its own heart, that this Government has got Australia back onto a sound footing and that the economy has already started on an upward path of renewed growth and on a return to prosperity that is essential if the needs and aspirations of all Australians are to be fulfilled. Certainly we still face problems. Certainly the way ahead will not be all plain sailing but there is now light at the end of the tunnel, a light which was virtually wiped out in November 1975 because of the economic holocaust of the Whitlam years, years which produced a four-fold increase m inflation, a three-fold increase in unemployment, a complete halt to economic growth and prosperity for all Australians, and a great fear throughout the land as to just where our nation was heading. It is undeniable that there is still some lack of confidence about the future felt by many Australians, but the fear of the Whitlam years is gone and confidence is returning-and for good reason. Inflation has been reduced by 40 per cent since the Fraser Government took office. Also, the staggering rates of increase in unemployment which occurred under Labor have been cut back dramatically. Interest rates have stabilised and, again through sound economic management, the scene has been set for a downward movement in rates over the course of the year ahead as the level of inflation continues to ease. All these facts-they are facts, despite the wild, unsubstantiated, scaremongering assertions of the Opposition spokesmen-suppor t the view, which is reflected by most forecasters including the Reserve Bank of Australia, that 1978 will see a major improvement in the Australian economy, firmly rooted in the return to underlying economic stability, for which the Fraser Government deserves the highest praise. The Government's impressive economic achievements in less than two short years have already been well outUned by my coUeagues, and I wil not repeat them. I intend to concentrate my remarks today on the attitude that has been adopted in recent times by the Opposition's economic spokesmen. We have not heard much of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford). He has been remarkably quiet. The running seems to have been left to the shadow Minister for Defence who is also the so called spokesman for economic matters, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). It is sad to see the honourable memberforOxley performing, both inside and outside this Parliament, in the way in which he has will over the last year or more. The honourable member for Oxley was regarded by many as being not too bad a Treasurer, although he was Treasurer for only somefivemonths. Of course, that is too short a time in which to judge. But he was thought to be a responsible member of the then Government. In the past year or more the honourable member for Oxley has lost all vestige of responsibility, all vestige of credibility. This is sad to see because apparently the honourable gentleman is the henapparent to the leadership of the ParUamentary Labor Party-eithe r earlier of later. It is about time the Parliamentary Labor Party had a responsible and credible leader. It does not have one in its present leader or in its putative leader, and that is not good for parliamentary democracy. I dismiss the remarks today by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). Even Blind Freddie knows that the honourable gentleman knows nothing about economics or economic management. His term of office as Prime Minister of this country between 1973 and 1975 bears very eloquent testimony to that. He proved it once again today. But the honourable member for Oxley should know better because he was the Treasurer, he has had training in economics and he claims to be an economic spokesman. His statements on the economy in the past year have been pathetic. He has talked nothing but gloom. He has attempted to talk the economy down. He attempted, with some success, in November last year to achieve a movement in the exchange rate which many people judged was not in the best interests of this country. His approach on economic matters has been the height of irresponsibility. He has deliberately fostered speculation against the Australian dollar, and he stands condemned for it. As the Australian newspaper commented in recent days: Mr Bill Hayden seems to find it hard to learn the difference between valid political statements on the conduct of the Australian economy and the kind of misstated exaggeration which may be common currency in other areas of politics, but which is suicidal when applied to the economic area. It is the difference between fair comment and the scare tactic. It continues: Mr Hayden may imagine that he can gain some political advantage from the gloom he expresses, but seems unaware that if he does so it is at the expense of the nation's economic health. In my opinion, Opposition spokesmen on economic matters have a responsibility to speak in a manner which is not deliberately damaging to the Australian economy. Just because honourable members opposite are not in office does not mean that they cannot act in a responsible manner in discussing and working towards a solution to the problems that face this nation. To their dying shame, nothing that honourable members opposite have done m the past 12 months goes anywhere at all towards supporting the view that ought to be held, namely that they have a sensible and responsible wish to see the economy improve. The honourable member for Oxley, the Opposition and the Australian people know that the Australian economy is improving. But the honourable member cannot afford to admit it, apparently. His reasons appear to be purely political. If economic spokesmen who claim to be responsible economic spokesmen cannot divorce politics from responsibUity then they ought not to be economic spokesmen. The honourable member for Oxley knows full well that the Australian dollar is one of the soundest currencies in the world and that the Australian balance of payments is in a very sound position. The Opposition knows perfectly well that we are in Australia in what is traditionally a seasonally weak period from the point of view of balance of payments and that the balance of payments, on normal seasonal grounds, will continue to improve from towards the end of this year. For the Leader of the Opposition to criticise the Government's borrowing program, as he did today, and to attempt to compare it with what his Government attempted to do in 1975 is sheer hypocrisy. He knows as well as does anyone else in this country that the borrowing program that has been arranged by the Government in the last few days was arranged through responsible international financial channels, through international financial houses that have the highest repute in the world, with which we have had a traditional relationship for many years and from which we have been a trusted borrower. Let us contrast that with the situation in 1975 ment when the Government of the day attempted not enormous only to fool and to mislead the Australian people Government as to the nature of the borrowings that were proposed at thattimebut also to obtain those borrowings through financial intermediaries who had no credibility, no responsibility and no ority in international matters. To compare with the situation today is the height of idiocy, I am sure that listeners to this debate realise. have said, the Government is achieving and fact has already achieved a sound base for future economic growth in this country. I have no doubt at all that 1978 will be a year of sustained and sustainable economic growth. The Opposition cannot admit it. The honourable member for Oxley cannot admit it because he knows that he was a member of a government which brought this nation to its knees. He cannot bear to watch the present Government restore the situation. But he will have to watch. Whether an election is held early or whether an election is held late, it will be a long, long time before the present Opposition everleaves the Opposition benches.",28
62,Mr UREN,PAIRS," I oppose the censure motion moved by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman). Instead, I believe that this House should be debating a motion seeking to congratulate the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) for his action to expose the poUcies of this Government not only prior to the November 1976 devaluation but also in respect of the present crisis. I wish to refer to an article which appeared in the London Economist oT 24 September 1977. In the International Business Section, on page 95, the article, headed 'Fraser takes the muddle way', states: Currency speculators are encouraged both by the Fraser government's consistently poor timing on exchange-rate changes and its impressive record for caving in under pressure. This was the view of the London Economist of the Fraser Government's decision to devalue. For six months prior to the decision in November 1976 to devalue, the surplus in the trading account was in excess of $ 1,000m. In the six months following the devaluation of 17V4 per cent by the Fraser Government, our balance on trading account fell to $210m. Prior to devaluation our balance of trade was not falling. At that time our balance of trade had increased by $ 1,000m. At that time the foreign based companies as well as large Australian companies sent enormous amounts of money overseas. The Governflow did not take any action at all to stop that of money. It allowed speculators to make profits from their activities. The knew what was going on. What is the situation now? In the past 18 weeks our international reserves have fallen. At auth30 April, our international reserves stood at that $3,780m. By 21 September, they stood at as $2,468m. Therefore since 30 April our interAs I national reserves fell by more than $ 1,300m. in This amount included a $222m overseas borrowing. So, the fall in our foreign reserves was more than $ 1,500m in a little more than four months. This is the way in which this Government manages the economy. The Government is responsible for the instability that has resulted in enormous amounts of reserves being withdrawn from this country. The nation is aware that foreign and Australian based companies, particularly subsidiaries of transnational companies, have been sending enormous amounts of money from this country. The Government has the power to stop such enormous sums of money leaving the country and could have taken action, thus avoiding the need to borrow large amounts of money. The situation was known on the Sydney and Melbourne money markets. The honourable member for Oxley said that, whether such matters are commented on by newspapers or mentioned in this Parliament, those speculators who are active in making a dollar for themselves are not concerned about the basis of our Australian sovereignty. They are the people who create the problem. They are the people who have been sending out the money. This Government is a government of big ness. It represents the very powerful elements our community. Therefore, it should have taken action to deal with that situation. Since it power in a very dubious way, this Government country. has represented the powerful elite in this country Not only has it transferred wealth from the workers' wage packet to the private sector but also it has cut back on public works and transrency ferred this activity to the private sector. The vate sector is only a very small section of the Austrade traUan community. Of the 200,000 companies Australia, fewer than 400 companies earn more than 50 per cent of all company profits. We know that these large corporations have profited greatly from devaluation of the Australian dollar. The whole strategy of this Government has been to base expansion on the level of foreign capital inflow. The Government seeks foreign capital inflow. It believes that recovery will from a mining export boom. An enormous of amount of foreign capital inflow is required to bring about that mining export boom. The Government adopted that broad strategy. But what has occurred in the mining sector has not resulted from any leadership by this Govern the ment. We have a leader of a kind that this country has never known before. He recognises class system. He has polarised the Australian community to such an extent that foreign invesOxley, tors fear investing in this country. Long gone the days when Australia had a stable governmember ment. This is a government of confrontation. Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) seeks to confront not only the trade union movement but also those sections of the community which dare to criticise him in any way. Even supporters of the Government are well aware why the Prime Minister wants to hold an early election. He knows that economic conditions will be worse this time next year. He knows also that his grasp on the leadership of his Party is shaky. Within the Government ranks and within the circles of Australia's financial institutions, people are saying quite clearly: 'We do not want this man who is a power unto himself; we want a consensus leader. We want a leader of the character of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street, the quiet representative of the Establishment'. Malcolm Fraser will not be the leader of the Liberal Party in the future. We know that the leader will be Tony Street. Liberal Party supporters do not want a leader who will continue a policy of confrontation. That is another reason why an early election is desired by the Government. busiHonourable members opposite must understand in that, while their leader adopts a policy of confrontation, foreign capital will notflowinto this took country and instability will continue in this - Less than a year ago, the Prime Minister faced the problem whether he should put Australia into hock for $ 1,000m or should devalue the curby 17Vi per cent. There was not a balance priof payments problem in respect of the balance of prior to that date. The crisis was in relation into the capital account and not the balance of trade where there was a surplus of over $ 1,000m. also The Prime Minister devalued our currency by Wh per cent. The situation now is that the Prime Minister has not borrowed just $ 1,000m; he has now borrowed some $2,000m. Prior to 1975, certainly a great deal of criticism was directed to proposals to use money from Arab sources. A great deal of the $2,000m that will come into this result country derives from Swiss banks. That money, course, is Arab dollars. So, the old sectarianism attitudes of the past apparently do not matter so much under this Liberal Government. The action by the honourable member for Denison in moving this censure motion against honourable member for Oxley is shallow. We know that the Prime Minister beUeves that the a whole basis of our economic management, particularly that under the honourable member for was sound. This fact causes the Governare ment concern. The credibility of the honourable for Oxley is high. We know that the The credibility of the Prime Minister is extremely low. Recently a national opinion poll was taken and it showed that the credibility of the Prime Minister was extremely low. The poll revealed that 36 per cent of the people were in favour the work he is doing, whilst 59 per cent of Australian people were dissatisfied with him. regard to the honourable member for Oxley the situation was that 66 per cent of the people were in favour of the job he is doing, whilst 12 per were opposed to him. Therefore the credibility the honourable member for Oxley is high within the electorate, much as government supporters may criticise him. The Prime Minister attacked the honourable member for Oxley personally three times in one day. The credibility of Prime Minister is failing wliile that of the honourable member for Oxley is building up. I am not a person who treads any individual down, whether he is the honourable member Oxley or the Prime Minister. I believe end the only way in which we can solve the lems of this nation is by adopting sound policies. expired. The poUcies of the Opposition, are much sounder than those of the Government. gained a good deal of experience of government in the three years we were in office. much about economic management. We will work together as a team. We will look for stability because we believe that the Australian people are asking for it. One thing that this country does not have at present is stability.

74,Mr NEWMAN,PAIRS,"Bass-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development) (4.29)-I move: 69 That the Bill be now read a second time. 25 I have presented this Bill on behalf of the Min44 ister Assisting the Treasurer. This Bill provides for the payment to the States in 1977-78 of the sum of $390m as advances for welfare housing under the provisions of the 1973-74 Housing Agreement. The advances are repayable over 53 years with interest at highly concessional rates. The allocation for thisfinancialyear is $15m more than was made available in 1976-77. The funds will be distributed among the States as follows: $ New South Wales 128,011,000 Victoria 101,759,000 Queensland 39,810,000 South Australia 58,460,000 Robinson, Ian Ruddock, P.M.

C. mined by me after consultation with the Housing Minister of the State concerned. Allocations to the State housing authorities are to assist with the provision of dwellings for rental or sale on a concessional basis to low income families; those advances bear interest at the rate of 4 per cent per Keating, P.J. Klugman, R.E. annum. Allocations to the State Home Builders' Accounts are to provide low interest housing loans to prospective home-owners who meet the eUgibUity criteria of the Housing Agreement; they bear interest at 4A per cent per annum. l Whitlam, Antony Honourable members will recall that this is the Willis, R. final year of operation of thefive-yearHousing Agreement entered into by the Whitlam GovernJames, A. W. Johnson, Les ment in 1973 with each of the States. Over the five year period, 1973-74 to 1977-78, the States will have received concessional interest rate advances totalling $ 1,734m for welfare housing. The early years of the Agreement were marked by rapid acceleration of the amounts made available, followed by a levelUng out in 1975-76 that resulted in some adjustments to the housing programs of some States. This Government's aim, however, continues to be to maintain activity in the welfare housing area on an even keel. We have done this by maintaining as a basis the high level of advances reached in 1975-76 and providing steady increases in 1976-77- $ 10.4m-and again in this year. Information on welfare housing activity in 1976-77 provided by the States indicates that loans made from Home Builders' Account moneys were responsible for completion or purchase of 9,475 homes and, in addition, the State housing authorities commenced 9,420 dwellings and completed 8,530 dwellings in the year. Housing authority work on hand at the beginning of 1976-77 comprised 6,750 dwellings. This had increased to 7,640 dwellings under construction as at 30 June 1977. The funds to be made available to the States under this Bill will ensure continuing steady activity in the public housing sector throughout thisfinancialyear. As to the private housing sector, activity reached a high level in most States in 1976. Private investment in dwellings in Australia as a whole in the December quarter of 1976 was 40 per cent higher in real terms than in mid-1975. Activity was most buoyant in South Australia and Western Australia but subdued in New South Wales. This growth in new dwelUng construction in 1976 was not matched in all States by growth in demand and there was some build-up in stocks of unsold dweUings in the latter part of 1976. Adjustment to those excess stocks and some temporary reduction in housing finance resulted in a fall back in industry first half of 1977. In 1976-77 as a whole, however, private investment in dwellings was 9 per cent greater in real terms than in 1975-76. The Government has been concerned to ensure that the avaUability of finance is not a barrier to steady sustainable growth in home buUding activity. Following a temporary slowdown in lending by savings banks early in 1977, the level of new lending for housing has been increasing again since May. On a seasonally adjusted basis the level of lending for housing by banks and permanent building societies in July was the highest so far in 1977 and is now approaching the high levels prevailing in 1975-76. As the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) announced in his Budget Speech to this House the Government ment. has informed the Reserve Bank of Australia that it wants to see banks and otherfinancialinstituadvances tions encouraged to increase their lending for private home buUding, particularly in those States and areas where the capacity of the building industry is under-utilised. The rundown in the unsold stock of houses together with increased levels of lending is expected to result in moderate growth in house buUding activity during the rest of 1977-78, with activity by the end of the period retunung to the high levels of mid-1976. The present Housing Agreement has achieved a great deal in the provision of good quality rental accommodation and concessional housingfinancefor low to moderate income earners. Nevertheless, the Government is acutely aware that much more could have been done in this area with the funds provided under this Agreement and under successive earlier housing agreements if the substantial subsidies attaching to these funds had been appUed more assiduously to those in need. We are looking to the States, in the negotiations now in train for a new housing agreement to come into operation after June 1978, to agree to institute new practices that would result in the housing subsidies being directed more closely to those in need and in the withdrawal of concessions where the real need for them has passed. We expect to bring forward in due course legislation for a new and improved housing agreement. In the meantime, the Government has agreed with the States to certain amendments to remove some of the restrictive terms of the current Agreement where each State so wished. We shall bring forward legislation to eifect these amendments. The States will be able to apply the advances provided under this Bill and under comparable earlier legislation in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Housing Agreement as amended by the new legislation that I have activity in the mentioned. The Bill authorises the Treasurer to pay to the States in the first six months of 1978-79 the sum of $195m, which is half the allocation for 1977-78, distributed on the same basis as the advances in the current financial year. Moreover, the Bill authorises the Treasurer to determine the terms and conditions applying to the advances made in the period from 1 July 1978. This provision will enable the Treasurer to continue payments to the States for welfare housing after the expiration of the current Agreement on 30 June 1978 until legislation for a new agreement, and an appropriation measure for 1978-79 pursuant to the new agreement, are passed by the ParUaAuthority is also provided to the Treasurer to borrow the moneys necessary for making the to the States under the Bill. The repayable interest bearing advances will, as circumstances dictate, be made either from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund. Provision is made for any payments out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this purpose to be reimbursed in due course from the Loan Fund, when the Treasurer considers this appropriate. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Uren) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Notice of Motion",34
75,The Clerk,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"Notic e has been received from the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) of his intention at the next sitting to present a Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 In Committee Consideration resumed from 20 September. Second Schedule. Proposed expenditure, $14,922,000.",36
76,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"Any time that parliamentarians need to speak about the Parliament there seems to be a degree of hesitancy on their part to raise the matters that are wrong with it. I do not mean so much the things that are wrong with the proceedings in the chamber as the things that are wrong with the building itself. This building is now more than 50 years old. It has weathered well. In the first instance it was not intended to be a building of substance or one which would last into future centuries. It was built as a provisional parliament house. That attitude was adopted by the Parliament of the day. It was rejected and argued against by Walter Burley Griffin who, in 1922, told the Public Works Committee which was investigating the construction of this building that there were sufficient building materials in Canberra for the nucleus of a permanent parliament house to be commenced and that it should be constructed on the hill or the slight rise behind the building that now stands. However, the Parliament of that time had its way. In 1977 and, by any estimate, for the next decade we will be occupying this building that has long since passed its useful function so far as private members are concerned and, I suspect, so far as the Executive is concerned. I know for sure that for the executive of the Opposition there is virtually no accommodation in this building. Quite recently a decision was made by the High Court on the size of electorates. At a referendum in the 1960s the people of Australia voted solidly against the breaking of the nexus between the size of the House of Representatives and the size of the Senate. Unless another referendum is put to the people, it seems that the Parliament is in two binds: Firstly, it can remain the same size, with 124 members of the House of Representatives and 64 senators. On that basis, only one conclusion can be drawn, and that is that the numbers of electors in electorates will get larger. Whilst there are 69,000 electors per electorate throughout Australia now, it is conceivable that if the population were to grow to any vast extent the number of electors per electorate would increase to 100,000 or more. The alternative is that the nexus be broken and that 24 more senators be commissioned. If I interpret you correctly, Mr Deputy Chairman, you rather agree that it would be poltiical suicide for any government to suggest that the number of senators be increased by almost 50 per cent; but that would bring about a commensurate increase in the number of members of the House of Parliament Representatives. Whichever way things go, the accommodation in this place will get progressively worse. If the first proposition, by which members are expected to represent more than 100,000 electors in their electorate, is accepted, it is quite clear that it would be beyond the capacity of one member to serve those people. If it is beyond the capacity of one member with two people working for him in his office in the electorate, it would become obvious even to those who have the most bitter hatred of parliamentarians that there would be a need for assistance in Parliament House in Canberra. If that proposition were accepted, there would be nowhere in this buUding that such people could be accommodated. If the second proposition is accepted and the size of the Senate is increased, with a commensurate increase in the size of the House of Representatives, the same problem would pertain. There would not be sufficient accommodation in this buUding for those who were required, indeed charged, by the people of Australia to be here. That is the position from the point of view of members. Let us go even further than that. Any of us who have been through the section of the buUding occupied by the Press would worry. The whole area is dUapidated. I understand that there have been a couple of false alarms lately at which the fire brigade turned out. When I turned the corner in the car one morning and the fire brigade was here my heart stood still, because I live in tenor of any conflagration starting in this buUding. If it did it would be uncontrollable. The loss of life, with such a large number of people working in this building, I believe would be appalling. This buUding is supposed to be the prestige building of the parliaments of Australia. The whole buUdsurely ing is decrepit. It has been added to. It is out shape. It does not serve the purpose which was first envisaged for it. The very people who write down Parliament the task are the parliamentarians. As you know, Mr Our Deputy Chairman, there is a committee looking that at the proposition of constructing a new and pergetting manent parUament house. I do secret that the committee would be looking at a no project that would cost about $ 10 years. Again I see people going white at the for any great lengthis of thought of going to the electorate and saying to the people: 'This sort of accommodation is required'. But I believe that parliamentarians have, in thefirstinstance, to convince themselves that this is what is warranted and justified and, the second instance, to have the courage to ceed from that point and to sell to the community the proposition that those people whom the comelection munity expects to manage the affairs of this country should be able to do so in accommoHe dation that is of no greater or lesser standard than the accommodation that is used by other people who are engaged in very large dation enterprises. One could enter into a dissertation about the management of the affairs of this country and I believe it would be quite legitimate to do so while we are discussing the estimates relating to members. the Parliament. To elaborate on that point, as we know, the parliamentary structure in this embraces the Executive, which comprises Prime Minister and his Cabinet. We know that expired. these people are directly responsible for putting propositions to this Parliament. I interpolate in recenttimesthey have not put up too many these propositions, but that is their responsibility. There are people who are Government supKeith porters, who sit behind the Executive and suphas port it on these issues. On the other side of the House there is the position, clearly identified by the Leader and the Deputy Leader. It has become the practice over the years for other people to sit with the and the Deputy Leader and they in turn are counter to the Government Executive, they stitute the Opposition executive. Then, of course, there are private members of the Oppositionthe supporters of the Opposition who sit behind the Leader and the Deputy Leader. All sorts of vince facUities are avaUable to the Government Execuwhen tive-if I may use that term to indicate the Prime Minister and his Cabinet-as there should be. make no criticism of that. Surely this whole parUamentary system is based on having a government and an opposition. That being the case, the opposition must have access to facUiof ties if not equal to at least somewhere near the facUities that are avaUable to the Government Executive to enable the Opposition to perform the community expects it to perform. friends in the Press are never loath to state the Opposition is not, to use the vernacular, stuck into the Government as much as it not think it is any facUitiesAand should. lot of these things depend upon the backup that are available. There is doubt that with the volatUity of the Australian 100m spread over electorate nothing going to remain permanent time. At the moment the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is playing some sort of parlour in game. He is enjoying himself. He has the busiproness community upset. Frankly, we are deriving some glee from the fact that he might call an at any time. If that is the case he is going tofindhimself back on the Opposition benches. will not be sitting on the front bench; he will be way up the back. But I point out to the Committee that there is a need to make accommowithin this building more civilised than it is at present, not only for the members of Parliament but also for the members of the Press and the Library, and all the other people who inhabit this buUding. There is a need for consideration to be given to facUities for Opposition executive country Mr DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr GILES) the Order! The honourable member's time has that Mr GRAHAM (North Sydney) (4.48)- I of should like to respond to a number of comments made by the honourable member for Burke (Mr Johnson). Much of the complaint that he registered in the Committee this afternoon is valid. I am well aware of the fact that the accomOp-modation provided for the members of Her Majesty's Opposition is not all that most of us would like to see. Having been in opposition during the Leader years 1972 to 1975 I can confirm what the a honourable gentleman has said. However, at conthat time and in those circumstances when requests were put to the then Prime Ministerpresent Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam)-w e found it was very difficult to conhim that very much should be done. In fact, he was previously the Leader of the Opposition the same circumstance existed. We find I ourselves rather like a dog chasing its taU. I do not want any of these remarks to be interpreted in any way- I am quite sure that my friend the honourable member for Burke would agree with me on this-as a reflection members of the staff, that is, the people in the Depanment of the House of Representatives, the to In Department of the Senate, the Joint House Destaff of the partment, the Library, the Hansard staff and mates other organisations around Parliament The honourable member made an interesting Representatives comment when he refened to the Senate and the tremely grateful when referendum of 1967 in which the present of the Opposition, the honourable member Werriwa, and the then Prime Minister, the late Right Honourable Harold Holt, were approaching the Australian people jointly to have that we nexus broken. At that time,thanks largely to the am distinguished members of the Fourth Estate and ment that we their customary misrepresentation and distorliament. I am have tion, it developed into an argument as to whether dining room and in those there ought to be more or fewer members of Partrolled liament within this country. It was rather unfortunate that this matter not developed properly because one can recall that in the days when Australia had six mUlion seven rnilhon people we had 36 senators. Today, with 14 mUUon people in Australia. I am not sure that there is not some merit in saying that there ought to be 84 senators. This would give a House of Representatives comprising about 168 members. I point out that when there were six mUUon to seven mUlion people in Australia we had a Parliament comprising 74 members. In constantly 1948-49 the Labor Government of the day had, if Irememberconectly, 45 members in this House and the Liberal-Country Party Opposition had 29 members. If one considers the idity of comparison between the population at that time and the population today there is a reasonable argument to be advanced. Of course there are always arguments of a party poltiical nature which interfere with a proper, responsible and rational interpretation of what should be the size of Parliament in relation to population. The other comments by the honourable member for Burke which I wanted to endorse related to the new and permanent Parliament House. a time of economic restriction, as we have present, it is very difficult to imagine that the Government will approach with a great deal of was alacrity these programs, the cost of which would probably run to at least $100m, as my colleague from Burke said earUer. But the fact remains we do need to have a new and permanent ment House. There is no doubt that if we do meet this expenditure in the late 1970s, whereas we would be paying $100m or more now, in 10 tribution yearstimewe will be paying twice that amount. This is the story of the past 40 to 50 years in this country. I have no doubt that that story will not upon the change in the future. the few minutes still avaUable to me I want make one or two comments in favour of the Parliament. In debating these estiHouse. majority of quite I am sure I speak for the very great the members of this House of I say that we are exLeader circumstances which are services for the rendered here in for hope to make one or two comments the not always in best. I relation to some of the figures in these estimates. I note that are graced with the presence of the Speaker. I deUghted to see him in the Committee this afternoon. I want to put in a word for the equipwithin the facUities of the Parthinking in particular of that in the areas that are conby the Joint House Department. I notice, for example, that the appropriation for equipwas ment in 1976-77 was $28,500 and that, with a remarkable capacity, the Joint House Departto ment managed to dispose of $28,499, which left $1 in kitty at the end of the financial year. Howat aU ever, this year the appropriation has been reduced to $ 14,000. After examining some of the usequipment in the dining room- I shall make no more particular reference than this-it is quite apparent to me that some of it needs refurbishing and some of it needs maintenance a Uttle more than it is receiving at the present time. Mr Martin-It is old world.",36
77,Mr GRAHAM,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"I quite understand. I agree valwith my honourable colleague from Banks that much of it is not new. However, I would say that it is still valuable equipment. If the plating on a lot of the jugs and other equipment in the dining room was regularly considered, and if money was provided to maintain that equipment it would last a longtime.I suggest that in this circumstance and at this time it is a matter that might be considered. I turn once again to the facUities section and At refer to some of the critical comments made at earlier by the honourable member for Burke I think it is only fair to point out to him that when I first elected to this place in 1949 the facUities provided to members of Parliament were not as good as they are at the presenttime;they have thatimproved substantially over the years. I pay Parlia-some tribute to the former member for notGrayndler, the Honourable F. M. Daly, because in my judgment he made a very substantial conin many ways in improving the facilities provided for private members of parliament. Majesty's Ministers, because of tnefinancialsupwrong port they receive, do not need the sort of aid required by back benchers. I do not necessarily believe that the former honourable member for Grayndler should be compared with Ministers of the present Government, but I point out that weof attitude. do owe him a great deal. When Ifirstentered the Parliament I well remember that we had only expression one secretary. No office was provided for the honourable member for St George, as I then was.ity I had, I think, the use of half a table in the minis-people terial party room. I do not know that that was tremendous confinement, but there is no doubt that in this day, in this building, members are very substantially better off than they have been in the past, I think that that ought to be recordedcommon side by side with the general criticisms put beforethe the Committee this afternoon by the honourable the member for Burke. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (4.58)-We have just heard two logical contributions in consideration of these estimates. It was a pleasure for me to hear the honourable member the for North Sydney (Mr Graham) say that the complaints made by the honourable member forconsidering Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) were valid. I reciprothe cate by saying that I agree with the contributionsUnion, made by both honourable members. As a mattersociation of fact, it was my intention to mention some of Fellowship. the points referred to by those honourable memI bers. Ifindthat I will have to steer a somewhat different course. However, I still feel that have some duty to discuss some of the functionstioning of the Parliament to be maintained by this apwe propriation and to discuss some of the benefits be derived from the proper functioning of the Parliament. It is appropriate also to discuss benefits to be derived by the country as a whole.come I feel also that we ought to discuss some adjustflag ments that could or should be made in order toate make the Parliament more efficient and to win greater respect and understanding from the citizens generaUy. I am conscious of the official handed to visitors in King's Hall. It speaks aboutany longer the outstanding role that members of this ParUawe ment have to play. It goes on to say that the decisions made by those people will have a far-reaching effect on the Uves of every citizen. then goes on to say that we see at work the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln: 'Governence ment of the people, by the people, for the people'. I am quite sure that most honourable members have those lofty ideals when they comethe to this Parliament. Unfortunately we seem to standing lose our way somewhere along the line. I think Her the damage is done because we project the image. I want to put forward some facts, to make some comparisons, and to use some arguments to justify my belief that this Parliament could be improved. That could be achieved without a great deal of effort but simply by a change It is my beUef that the Parliament should be an of the social structure of the society it represents. Therefore we should act in conformwith the hopes, desires and wishes of the who put us here. Over and above that exapression, of course, members on both sides of the Parliament have a common interest. We have a duty to defend the common interest and to prove that we are wUling and capable of serving that interest which, of course, is to consider requirements of the nation as a whole. Along path towards defining that common interest, I want to give some recognition to the guidance given by the Speaker. I am very pleased to see the him in the chamber this evening. Sometimeago he told us he would make arrangements to have national flag displayed in this Parliament. There is no doubt that the appropriation we are will be used for small things such as erection of theflag,the Inter-Parliamentary the Commonwealth ParUamentary Asand even the ParUamentary Christian shall deal with some of these things. To some people they may appear to be minor matters, but we to me they play an important part in the funcof the Parliament. It seems to me that if are to be an expression of the social structure toof the society we represent we must carry the flag of our electorate in this Parliament. We should the put up the standard and every day when we to the Parliament and we see our national we should remember our duty to our electorand to the flag we carry. I believe that if we uswere all a Uttle more conscious of what the flag represents we would have a better Parliament, a better nation and a brighter future. I do not want to dwell on this for too long. However, I do conbrochure which isgratulate the Speaker and I ask him not to dally can certainly but to have theflagput up, because do with a few moreflagcarriers in this Parliament. It Another matter to which I wish to give some consideration is one which I think is doing violto this Parliament. I speak of the hierarchy syndrome. It seems to me that there are symptoms of that on both sides of the House. I make point that no one increases his dignity by on it. I ask the question: Why is it that some members who come into this Parliament with reasonable to outstanding educational qualifications can wriggle their way on to the further: front bench or into Cabinet and then imagine that they are super-intellectuals? It seems to me fairness, that that sort of thing is causing a good harmony in this House. I cannot understand why any Christian would take that attitude, because those people should know that some knowledge, some wisdom, which is withheld from the learned and the wise, is revealed to little children.",38
78,Mr LES MCMAHON,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,You have a reputation as a saintly man.,40
79,Mr FITZPATRICK,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"I thank the honourable member very much. He said that I am a saint. am only a back bencher of the Christian Fellowtime ship. My honourable friend, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin), and the honouroverseas able member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) who are on the front bench of the fellowship should know that the truth of my words can be found in Matthew 11.25. In any case, I ask the Speaker not to allow those members on the front bench ask three more questions than honourable memUnion going. bers on the back benches. The honourable member for Burke has already mentioned that members of the Press deserve to have some of this appropriation to improve their facilities. I agree with this do not want anyone to think that I believe the Press is always responsible in reporting the hapthat penings of this Parliament. I their methods of gathering news, although they are sometimes of advantage to the Party I Order! represent. However, I think that practices such as leaking information, tipping people off and expired. pimping on one's own Party are to be frowned upon. Mr Speaker would know that rarely does the Press tell the nation about the good work does. It very seldom gives me a mention either. believe that it does some violence to our democthe racy both inside and outside this House. On eral occasions I have spoken about the value some of the country newspapers, Barrier Daily Truth and the Lachtander. I wish to refer to another smaller country newspaper. That is the Recorder which circulates in Ivanhoe and district. Honourable members will underdisappointment stand how truthful this newspaper is when I an article from it. It is headed 'Champion of the Outback' and states: No matter what your pany politics may be, I think you agree that the scrapping of the States biggest seat, held by Mr John FitzPatrick for the ALP since 1969, a great blow for the Far West. Is that not lovely?",40
80,Mr LES MCMAHON,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,It is very good reporting.,40
81,Mr FITZPATRICK,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"Ye s it is. The article states While we hold no party policies one way or the other, in all it must be put on record that Mr FitzPatrick has bit of disbeen the Champion of the Outback. I could read it aU, it is such a lovely story. I wish to touch on the appropriation for the InterParliamentary Union and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I notice that the Senate debates on the Estimates touched on this matter. It seems to me that people outside the Parliament often condemn members of parUament for going on visits overseas. I have been away on three and I have never worked harder in I my life and I have had a spell in hospital each I came back. I think that it is much more beneficial to send a member of this Parliament to spread goodwill and to understand what goes on in the rest of the world than it is to send an army overseas. Unless we are prepared to spend this money we will damage human relations. Every encouragement should be given to to keep the good work of the Inter-Parliamentary I refer also to some of the good work done by the parliamentary committees. I have been on used several committees of this House and I have but I always found some dedicated people who work a lot harder than I am able to do myself. I am sure the Parliament gets a lot of benefit out of the deplore some of committee system.",40
82,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,Mr Jarman)The honourable member's time has,40
83,Mr GILES,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"Firstly, I also draw attention to the fact that Mr Speaker is with us. he May he long continue to resist any interference I or influence from the Executive. He is our man as Speaker of this chamber. He will know that sevhe has the full support of honourable members of from both sides of the chamber if he ever feels in particular the that he needs it. I take up the issue where the honourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick) left off. To my I notice in the community today read an increasing disUlusionment with Parliament and its politicians. This attitude I think is fed by the mass media which reports primarily on diswill putations and confrontations because its job is to Darling, sell newspapers or to increase ratings. I believe will be that the community should know, on the other hand, of the many instances when members and senators work together on specific matters in the total interests of the nation, a matter already referred to by the honourable member for Darimplemented ling. The mutual respect that has developed tween members on both sides of the House has, think, surprised several of them and enhanced the institution of Parliament. Since 1964 when I entered this House there Parliament. has been a substantial growth in bipartisan activity and in the degree of expertise and concentration on certain areas developed by members of the House of Representatives and senators all parties. Inter-party co-operation in committee work has not detracted from the proper role of Her Majesty's Opposition to probe government legislation and statements. However, publicity apparent and sometimes real disagreement on matters of pohcy or practice conceals the comthe mon desire by most, if not all, honourable memRepresentatives, bers to serve the nation and the people who electinstance, them to parliament. To illustrate what I have been saying, when I joined the Parliament 1964 there were six senate committees, five House of Representatives committees and five joint committees, a total of only 16 bipartisan committees. All but two of them dealt with estic matters to do with the Parliament. These committees reqviired a total of 139 members change. drawn from a Parliament of 182 members. Today we have 37 all-party committees requiring 297 members, elected strangely enough from a total of 191 senators and bers. Leaving out Ministers of which there twenty-six at present, on average each member of the House of Representatives and senator serves on more than two such committees. This ensures a considerable cross-fertilisation of party ideas when framing committee reports to ParUacorresponding ment. I took out somefiguresearUer this year for the Government Parties Rural Committee of which I am Chairman. Each committee member had, on average, commitments to over four comimagine mittee tasks. I think honourable members will know that leaving out such people as whips, deputy whips, deputy chairmen of committees, deputy speakers and so on, there is a fair load on the rest of the back bench. I am sure that the Opposition has the same if not a heavier work load to cover a sumiar range with substantially smaller numbers avaUable to do the work. The work load is compounded by an increasgranted. ing number of electors which each senator and member is required to represent. Excluding the special cases of representation in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory the 1948-49number of electors per member than it was before the expansion of both Houses, 1950-51 agreed to by Parliament in 1948 and in the 1949 elections. I shaU repeat be that: The number of electors represented by I members of parUament now is quite a deal greater than it was prior to the last reform mtroduced in relation to representation hi the",40
84,Mr GRAHAM,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,The population has doubled.,41
85,Mr GILES,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"The honourable member for of North Sydney has said that the population has doubled. Of course it is that growth which is responsible for the present situation. A strong case now exists therefore for a larger number of memof bers and senators. Bearing in mind that the Australian people voted at a referendum to maintain nexus between the Senate and the House of an increase of four senators, for phased in over two elections, would increase the number of senators to eighty-four, as in has been mentioned before, and members of the House of Representatives by approximately forty-five. This may seem a large increase but if that were done the number of electors domrepresented by members of parUament would still be greater than was the case after the 1948 That was over one-quarter of a century ago in a much simpler world than confronts the Parliament now. It would probably be more practical, membearing in mind accommodation problems in are Canberra and the considerable changes that a largeredistributionwould entaU, to increase die number of senators by two at each subsequent Senate election whether it be a half-Senate election or a full Senate election. This would mean a increase in the size of the House of Representatives of about 22, buUding up later by 23. So, growth by new seats can be achieved within the nexus that has been set down. I can that some people would react by saying that Parliament costs enough already. It might be worth noting the outlay per head of population per annum on Commonwealth partiamenwork tary government, at constant prices, using 1911-12 as the base year.

89,Mr GILES,JOINT STATUTORY,Thos e charts clearly show the statistics of the increase in bipartisan committees of this Parliament. The people of Australia should not think that we spend all our time here cat-calling at each other and disagreeing on every principle. The charts point out very clearly the huge increase in the number of bipartisan committees of all types on which members meet and through which they find an increasing respect for each other. The statistics lead to the conclusion that almost all members of Parliament spend a great deal of time not only representing their electors in this place but also representing and working very fully in the interests of the nation as a whole.,42
90,Mr MARTIN,JOINT STATUTORY," I agree with many cf the sentiments which have been exE ressed by previous speakers, particularly the onourable member for Darling (Mr FitzPatrick), the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Graham) and the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) who has just resumed his seat. I am a deep lover of the parliamentary system and a firm believer in it, but some of the words which I will speak today feel that Parliament no longer is fulfilUng what should be its real role in the community. There was a time when the moulding of public opinion was carried out within the Parliament, but nowadays it seems to be the fashion for it to be ried out by the media-by radio, television and the Press. IfirmlybeUeve that the Parliament is the place where public opinion should be canvassed, where public opimon should be moulded and where decisions should be made. Unfortunately, decisions are not always made within the Parliament. As I have just stated, cisions are pre-empted and public opinion is moulded by the media to such a degree that the media have developed a talent for creating pubUc opinion. The stage has been reached where members of the Parliament are Uke players on a stage, but unfortunately it is not serious theatre that goes on within the precincts of the chamber. There has been a tendency for the proceedings of the Parliament to become almost vaudevUle or slapstick comedy. If we ourselves do not take steps to improve the standard of parliamentary proceedings the parliamentary system could become a farce. I think that that would be a very dangerous situation. Any real student of history would know just how valuable the parliamentary system is and how hard it was to achieve. We as members of the Parliament should be the last ones ui the world to denigrate the system for which so much blood was shed in days gone by. Unfortunately, we have seen members from both sides of the Parliament wanting to attempt to mould pubUc opinion outside the confines of the Parliament. There is a tendency for them to limeUght, to become television personalities, to accept invitations to appear on programs such as This Day Tonight, Monday Conference or A Current Affair. I will not include the Willesee show because I think that it has become slapstick and vaudevilUan. There is a tendency for members from both sides of the Parliament to want to appear on the AM and PM shows conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, to the exclusion of their activities within this Parliament. I am notfirmlyconvinced of this, but I think that one answer could be to give more consideration to televising the proceedings of the Parliament-no t as a funny show, not as a comedy show and not for the information or the joy of the people who sit up in the gallery, because they are only a very small percentage of the 14 million people who now Uve in Australia. I believe that we would achieve a far better presentation of parliamentary proceedings and a far more serious attitude towards them if they were will be critical. I televised. We saw a veryfineexample of that when the Joint Sitting of the Parliament, which was unique in the history of the Parliament, was televised. When the parliamentary proceedings were being cartelevised there was constant attendance in the chamber, members of Parliament wore their good suits, they were on their best behaviour, no cheek was offered to Mr Speaker and Mr Speaker looked very impressive in the chair as usual. I tliink that if more consideration were given to the televising, not of the whole of the de- proceedings- I do not think that that should be inflicted on any section of the community-bu t of a selected portion of the parliamentary proceedings the role of the Parliament in moulding public opinion would become much greater. I put a case for televising not only the proceedings of the Parliament but also the proceedings of some of the committees of the Parliament. I am certain that the people who sit in the public galleries to watch the proceedings ask themselves: 'What do politicians do? Where are they? Are they in the bar again?' I can assure the members of the public who are present here today that politicians spend very littletimein the bar. Let me cite a statistic that is not widely known: It takes three weeks of the parliamentary session for 18 gallons of beer to be drunk in the parUamentary bar, whereas I would say that at one good party it would take only an hour and a bit to knock over 18 gallons. That gives some indication of how little drinking goes on within the confines of the Parliament. Before I came to this Parliament I heard it said-no t in fun in many cases-that it was the best and highest paid club in Australia. I can assure people that it is not the best club and it is not the highest paid club. I often wonder what it is that drives a person to want to become a member of the Parliament. It is certainly not the money; it is certainly not the working conditions; and it is certainly not the prestige of the job. If any member of the Parliament thinks that he has prestige, he is not going around his electorate. The standing of the member of Parliament in the community has been denigrated-and I say this quite advisedly-by the media which wants to take over the role of the Parliament to become the moulder of public opinion and the decision maker. It has almost succeeded in achieving that objective. It has set out quite deuberately to make the member of Parliament the butt of carI toons and through the Press to pass on the jibes of the populace. Despite what is written I believe that politicians- I do not class them politicians as such; would prefer to call them members of the Parliament-d o an honest and honourable job. Despite the jibes of the community and the toonists and what is written by members of Press who sit up in the Press Gallery looking down on us-and I use the term 'looking down on us' advisedly also- I have never seen in eight or nine years I have spent in this ment a more sincere, dedicated, hard working and capable group of people, and that comment applies to members of both sides of the Parliament. Prior to entering this Parliament I worked 34 years in the Commonwealth Public Service where there are also dedicated, hard working and sincere people. I put the member of ParUanature ment in the same category as those sincere, hard working and capable public servants. Frankly, members of Parliament are public servants. I am here as a representative of 63,000 people. I am here to do my part to assist them. Obviously 63,000 people from my electorstated: ate cannot come up here to govern. Therefore they have sent me and, I might made a wise choice. I am sure the same can be located said of most members of this Parliament.",42

92,Mr LLOYD,JOINT STATUTORY," I also comsimilar. mend the presence in the House of the Speaker, who, as the Presiding Officer, is the senior officer responsible for this part of the Parliament. I the basic question: For what purpose was ParUathe ment House buUt? I also put the subsequent question: In the achievement of that aim or pose, who should have priority in the allocation of the limited space in this buUding? The answer must be that Parliament House is for the govern-he ing of this country by those elected for that pose to represent the people of Australia. believe the present situation reflects that that members and senators should have in this Representatives, buUding. However, the position is better than it are obliged to share was, certainly in respect of the recent past since I impossible for these members have been here. The honourable member for Parliament House at all. I might Angas (Mr GUes) and the honourable member members of Parliament are now aUowed for North Sydney (Mr Graham) referred to an ploy one research assistant each. There are earlier period. I note that the Speaker and the President the Senate are very much aware of the situation. building. understand that certain plans are in hand to alleviate the position further. But I must say that the demands on a member have increased at a disproportionate rate to the improvement in faI cUities. There are many reasons for the increased work load and I shall mention some of them. First, unlike State parUaments where the number carof members is being continually increased to the offset the growing population and demands on those members, it appears impossible to increase the size of the House of Representatives. In fact, the a recent High Court decision has reduced the ParUanumber of members of this House. Secondly, people are not only using their members more than they have in the past but also they are turning more to Federal members for many of their problems or aspects of poUcy areas that in the past were considered to be State matters only. for My third point is that Parliament is passing more legislation and that there are more committees and inquiries of a national and parliamentary requiring the time of members of ParUadedicated, ment and their staff. The Remuneration Tribunal acknowledged this situation in its 1977 determination. In paragraph 31 on page 19 of its review the Tribunal We are satisfied that there is a prima facie case for a back add, they have electoratetoand bencher have one member of staff in Canberra, one in his one additional staff member who may be in either place from time to time. We will look further at this matter when the accommodation constraint at Parliament House is overcome. Canada probably is the most appropriate for this Parliament to consider in terms of accommodation and staff because its system is I was in Canada a couple of years ago and I understand that a member of Parliament in Canada represents about three quarters of the put number of electors that we do. Each member of lower house in Canada has an office of three rooms, if not in Parliament House itself, in a purbuUding quite adjacent to it. The member has a staff of two in his parliamentary office and a staff of one back in his electoral office. In other words, has a staff of three which was the size virtually purrecommended for members of this place by the I do not Remuneration Tribunal. priority Twenty-two members of the House of or about 16 per cent of the total, rooms. As a result it is to have any staff in point out that to em30 research assistants presently employed with of House of Representatives members in this A couple of weeks ago a group of Government back benchers made a tour of Parliament House. I was not a member of this group but I undermatters stand that it found more room could be made would available. There is an unoccupiedflaton the Senthe ate side of the House. Members of the group Therefore were informed that theflatwas used to house a small bomb disposal unit which would, presumSpeaker ably deal with incoming mail. I understand that there arefiverooms in theflat.There is also one vacant Senate office which had been vacated by a research assistant. Members of the group betoday. lieve that they saw only one office used by staff employed in Parliament House that was worse than the offices that many members are required to put up with in this building. It is not absolutely essential to house some sections of support in this building and therefore they should make way for members and senators. Therefore the problem is one of restricted dised space and the priority for allocation of that in the House. space. Eventually the construction of the new and permanent Parliament House will overcome this problem. But stage one is set down for com1975. pletion in 1988- that is 11 years away. I comthe mend and support the Speaker and the President for their determination to have stage one completed on time in 1988 because it is absolcrisis. utely essential that this be done. But what is happen in the meantime-in the 11 years until 1988. I believe that all who work and who are accommodated in this building must accept that a certain minimal standard must be provided all members and senators and that this standard must include a separate room for each member of parliament. It is also important that those rooms be of a size to accommodate adequately the member and one research assistant. We funds should remember that the Remuneration Triis bunal has stated that a case has been proved for up to two people in addition to the member to located in Parliament House. I acknowledge that the facUities of the staff who work here are also inadequate. I am not ing that the facilities are inadequate for members only. But I return to the point of who must have or should have first priority for that space. The answer for the next 11 years appears to be to to this buUding where possible and to re-locate as close to Parliament as possible staff whom it not absolutely essential to house in the buUding. want to emphasise that that re-location must allow the ininimum accommodation for members to be achieved. In conclusion, I commend again the Speaker and the President for their recognition of this problem.",44
93,Mr SCHOLES,JOINT STATUTORY,"This is one of the opportunities we have each year to discuss relating to the Parliament. Although I Uke to talk at length about the estimates of Parliament, time does not permit me to do so. I will say only one thing about the estimates of the Parliament. I am pleased to see the of the House to hear any occasional reference which might relate to his financial administration of the Parliament. I assure him that I do not intend to raise those sorts of matters I make the point that I think continuing consideration should be given to the view that the appropriations for the Parliament should be considered by the Parliament quite separately from the normal appropriations of government. staff The appropriation for the Parliament should stand alone. I say that for a number of reasons. One reason is that Parliament never should be in the position where its operation can be jeoparby the political activities of political parties Perhaps I can refer briefly to the events of One effect of the continuing clash between Houses of Parliament could have been that Parliament would not have had funds with which to operate during a period of national Its funds were dependent, as were those of to the Government of the day, on the annual appropriations. In such a clash I trunk the Government most likely would have refused to put the Parliament 's appropriations forward as a separate opfor eration. The Parliament should not be jeopardised in its operations by any political clashes that may take place. More importandy, the Parliament ought to be answerable for and the presiding officers ought to be responsible for the which are allocated for the Parliament. It not a government exercise. It is a responsibUity of the Parliament as a whole that it fund its operbe ations and that it justifies them. The furphy so often suggested around the place, and I suppose the Treasury would be the worse example, is that funds have to be controlled by a Minister of the sayCrown. I suggest that the person elected to accept responsibUity on behalf of the Parliament - afte r all it is the members of Parliament who carry the brunt of criticism for the expenditure of addfunds or for wasting funds, as the case may beshould have the authority for the expenditure of is those funds and also should present the estimates I for the Parliament and carry them through the Parliament. This process should be part of the standards independence of Parliament. I want to raise one or two matters relating to the administration of the Parliament. In this period I believe that a change in the accommoI dation arrangements is absolutely essential that changed administrative arrangements may be equally essential. It is difficult to propose change. At the moment the two Houses of the Parliament operate in the presence offiveseparadvice ate departments. I think this is impractical do not believe it adds to the efficiency of management of this building. It is my opinion solve that the management of this building should subject to very serious investigation. Possibly joint parliamentary committee could investigate the situation. I believe that the creation of a department of the Parliament, responsible for the functions now carried out by the ParUamentary Library, the Joint House Department and Hansard, having separate heads of those operations into that department, would enable a more ParUamentary efficient management of the buUding structure than is the case at present. The departments rectly responsible for servicing the two chambers would remain-the departments headed by the two Clerks-and would perform the role for sponsibUity which they and their officers are responsible. My proposal would have one other effect which think would be beneficial to Parliament. It would bring the management of the remainder of the buUding, that is apart from the chambers and their immediate precincts, under the joint control of the two presiding officers. Apart from these two chambers, virtually all of the buUding is service facUity for aU of the ment but there is a Une drawn to show that that half is for the Senate and this half is for the House of Representatives. The standard of accommodation within the buUding differs materiaUy when one side is comand pared with the other. The accommodation on one side of the buUding for 127 members of House of Representatives, excluding the MinisSenate try and some other office holders, is sub-standard at best. On the other hand the accommodation for 64 senators is relatively good and takes in a fairly substantial area. It is not true to say that senators occupy half the building because Hansard and the Joint House Department quite occupy accommodation on the Senate side. The accommodation for members of ParUaconferences ment ought to be in accordance with the funcAustralia. tions that they carry out. I think the situation would be better generaUy if a senior administratIn ive officer were responsible for the PubUc Service area of the Parliament and in charge of those functions at present covered by officers of varyin ing rank and standing. Certainly this proposition is arguable and challenges the existing norm believe that it would assist in the management and of this buUding. In a new Parliament House I think it would be essential to place those functions under the control of one PubUc Service officer who would be directly responsible for to the Presiding Officers. If that part of the and I administration would constitute a problem I do the not think it would be beyond the wit of men to it. It is usual for the Presiding Officers to be be of a Ught poltiical complexion and usually they a are able to agree on matters affecting Parliament House where the interests of the two Houses are not directly involved. I want to raise one other matter at this time because I believe it ought to be considered urgently. and I refer to the secretariat of the Interfitted ParUamentary Union and the Commonwealth Association. I raise this matter because I believe that the liaison of visits of parUadimentarians from other countries, especially government sponsored visits from our near neighbours, will involve a far greater area of rein the near future than they do at the present time. In Australia's national interest they I ought to be viewed as involving far greater responsibUity. I think we should be encouraging and even sponsoring visits by parliamentanans from our Pacific neighbours and our near Asian neighbours in order to acquaint them with our system and our problems and to ensure that we a havefirst-handcontact with them. This is in the members of ParUanational interest. I think this purpose would be better served if we had within the Parliament an office of international relations to service the IPU secretariat the CPA secretariat as well as to operate on a much broader basis. This wouldresultin more the uniformity. It would break down the present versus House of Representatives proposition which tended to grow up because of the way in which things are allocated. More importantly, I think there will be a greater spread of responsibUity for the internationalfieldthan is the case at the moment. We have officers who are competent in those areas. Quite obviously they co-operate with one another when major or other such activities are held in I think they ought to be operating out of a single office which has direct responsibUity. addition, there are other parliamentary organisations around the world to which we send delegations or to which we may send delegations the future and they could be easier serviced from a central international bureau. Delegations but now go to the Council of Europe but we tend to tack such delegations on to one of the other deltheir egations. That is an area in which we have a direct interest. I raise that point at this stage because I have just been to Canada where that type of operation is carried out. All the parliamentary organiswishes ations with which Canada is affiliated viced through an international bureau witliin the Parliament. Such an arrangement provides a level of expertise and guarantees the Parliament the best possible service. Where the work load one delegation is light another may have a heavy work load. I recommend this Presiding Officers.",45
94,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,JOINT STATUTORY, made Order! The honourable member's time has session. expired.,47
95,Mr HAMER,JOINT STATUTORY,"Everyone, or of almost everyone, agrees that this Parliament that does not work very effectively but no one does anything about it. It is not a matter of members working hard. The honourable member for Angus (Mr GUes) produced some figures showing how hard members of Parliament have to work. The fact is that we are working very effectively. Some time ago a report on the new parUamentary committee system was brought into this House. It was a detaUed study of the way in which committees might help make this Parliament work more effectively. was a unanimous report but nothing has pened. I am sure we are all aware that there are many matters which are not effectively covered by debate in this House. Too often form of statement followed by flat contradiction and ending in personal abuse. There are many matters which, if they are to be considered tively, must be considered by a committee from both sides of the House sitting around the table discussing matters, examining papers and taking evidence. It is surprising how often a proper and agreed decision will arise out of procedures as that. Why has nothing happened? It is not a matter of money, although I suppose a larger vote would be needed for committees if we wanted make them effective by providing appropriate staff and research assistants. But it is not really matter of money because the amount involved would be trivial in a Budget appropriating than $8,000m for Commonwealth purposes. The fact is that governments do not want this House to be more efficient. Lord Acton once said that power tends to corrupt. I do not know whether he was right but one thing I am sure of is that power tends to make people resist scrutiny of actions. That is an inevitable consequence very for a government of whatever poltiical complexion. Governments do not want the scrutiny of this House when they can avoid it. This matter is so important that I tliink this legislature has to seek ways in which in this area it can impose its on the Executive. It is a matter which this are serHouse has to take seriously. The report on the new parUamentary committee system, which is a radical restructuring of of the present one, was tabled in this House in May 1976. At thattimethe Leader of the House (Mr procedure to the Sinclair) said: . . . I give the House an assurance that there will be an opportunity to debate the statement which has been . . . at a later stage, probably in the Budget The Minister was referring to the Budget session 1976. This is the Budget session of 1977, and debate still has not been held. I ask the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) who is at the table to indicate to the Committee in his winding up remarks when it is planned to hold that very detaUed important debate. I do not want to canvass the conclusions of the not Select Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System although I agree with its conclusions. The point I draw to the attention of this Committee is that we have done nothing about to that report. We have established the Standing It Committee on Expenditure, a committee which hapwas examined by the Select Committee and specifically rejected by it. So we have done nothing to implement the Select Committee's they take the recommendations. This debate is a good example of what is effecwrong with our procedures. We are examining detaUed estimates but I am not planning to speak on them and I do not think any other honourable member has or will speak on them. The point is that this is not the appropriate venue or the apsuch propriate method by which to discuss such things. To discuss the Estimates we need witnesses and documents and to be able to cross examine witnesses. Here honourable members, perhaps helpfully, make speeches on general to topics but they do not examine the Estimates. That role is being performed by the Senate, and a being performed effectively. I do not resent that. I am not in favour of duplication by the two more Houses but I think it is odd that this House should have abdicated so abjectly its responsibility forfinancialmanagement. If we accept, as we appear to have, that this role is being performed by the Senate I have one suggestion to make: Ministers should appear before the Senate Estimates committees to give evidence of hehalf of their departments. At the moment Senate Ministers who in the Senate are responsible five or six departments appear before the Estihave mates committees and are of very little help those committees. There is nothing in the Standface ing Orders to prevent a Minister appearing bebiUty. fore Senate Estimates committees and I urge the Minister for Productivity to suggest to his colleagues that they do so and, incidentally, to set an example, by doing so himself. Like other honourable members. I welcome the presence of Mr Speaker in the chamber for this debate. I take the opportunity, when not rule me out of order, to put a suggestion to him. Questiontimein this House is ineffective. Its ineffectiveness is a great reflection on our real willingness as a legislature to exarnine the Government. The Minister's technique, of there course, is well known. If a Minister does not the look of a question he is asked, he answers different question, and there is nothing much which can be done about it, under our proshould cedures. In the House of Commons the proHouse cedure is different. If a question is asked and is not fully elucidated, and it rarely is, supplemencently, tary questions are allowed until, in the opinion the Speaker, the subject is exhausted. That, course, gives great discretionary power to the Speaker and requires a Speaker who has the fidence of both sides of the House to implementbers, effectively. I believe that our present Speaker that confidence, and he should be allowed to ercise the power given by Standing Order 151 which states in relation to questions without notice: At the discretion of the Speaker supplementary questions may be asked to elucidate an answer. I take this opportunity to suggest indirectly Speaker that he consider discussing with Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) whether he should not exercise that power freely, suitable arrangements being made to control number of questions asked and the method asking them. If that power were used, it do a great deal to improve the quality of question time in this House and the efficient scrutiny by this House of the Executive.",47
96,Mr CREAN,JOINT STATUTORY," I increasing agree with the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Hamer) that questiontimehas become one of the most inefficient instruments of this ment, and that has been so for a considerable number of years. Like the honourable member, I recently heard far better performances in the House of Commons in the sensible use of quesinsertion tion time than I do here. However, there is point on which I will emphatically disagree with for my friend: I do not believe the Senate should any say in thefinancialaffairs of this Parliato ment. This House long ago unfortunately did not up to what should be its supreme responsiIt is in this House, and in this House alone, that Supply can be initiated and it should be in this House, and in this House alone, that it is decided. What happened here on 11 November 1975 was a tremendous reversal of sensible constitutional practice in the 20th century and I will he canyield to no one in my views on that. I too am pleased that Mr Speaker is present for I hope that never again in this Parliament will be a repetition of what took place here the like week before Parliament last rose. One of the a things we are deciding here today is the appropriation for Hansard. I believe that Hansard be a report only of the proceedings of this in this House. For poltiical reasons rehonourable members voted to incorof porate material in Hansard and I am glad that of Mr Speaker took the sensible and practical view that the material could not be incorporated. In conmy view it was a travesty that honourable memparticularly on the Government side, has seriously thought that it should be. We took the exbest part of a day on that decision and I understand that even in the adjournment debate later in the day it was sought to go through the travesty of reading the document into the record when Mr Speaker had earUer decided that it was not suitable for incorporation. If we in this Parto MrUament want to get to the practice of the the American Congress where speeches which are not deUvered at aU are incorporated in Hansard, let us be honest enough to say so. I candidly hope the that we do not do that. I believe that Hansard of should be the record of what happens in the would chamber. I do not know whether anybody ultimately reads the stuff and I tliink that sometimes there is a lot of vanity in relation to what goes into Hansard. I tliink we ought to resist the habit of incorporating into a speech material which is longer than the speech itself. We sensibly put limits on the length of speeches Parliaa long time ago, yet honourable members can make their Hansard contribution twice as long- I am not sure that it is twice as impressive-by the of aU sorts of documents, when many of one them have been included in Hansard previously and most of the information can be found in the government Year Book. I think the low number of members in the chamber at the moment is indicative of the situation. Once Question Time finishes, unless some lively occasion happens to be expected there is a great evacuation of members from the House, the majority of whom often never return that day. One of the reasons for this, of course, committee meetings. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) said that there were members, which I take to be the combined number of members and senators, and that nearly every member has to be on at least a mittee and a half if the committees which been established are to have their membership requirements satisfied. It is far more difficult for ing us on this side of the chamber because the tendto ency is for a committee to consist of 10 peoplethe six from one side and four from the other-o 11 people-si x from one side andfivefrom the other. That certainly puts a greater weight on members in the House of Representatives. I hapat pen to be on three committees-candidly , not cause I want to be, but because my party would not have been able to fill the numbers on one the committees if I had not decided to nominate. At least if I go on a committee I am a conscienposition tious attender. I tliink the Minister for ductivity (Mr Macphee) is aware of that. I often find that I have to make up a quorum for two committees at the one time,and that is not very easy. It is about time those who have the responsilatter bility of looking at the Standing Orders and the hours of sitting realised that we ought to set aside one day or part of a day each week as committee day and not an ordinary House sitting day. At least the committees could meet sensibly. The House of Representatives Standing ComSydney mittee on Expenditure, of which I happen to member, has the right to meet when the House is meeting. But we are no sooner meeting than are disturbed by either quorum bells bells. We on the committee do not have enough sense to give ourselves pairs. Again, that seems to me to be a rather silly way to face up to our responsibilities. Like my friend the honourable member for Isaacs, I believe that Parliament is still the best form of government yet devised for the democratic system. If we are to preserve have to make the institution work better than working. I suppose it works remarkably well in some respects, but it could work a great deal betof ter than it does. In my view it does not require any constitutional changes to make it better; requires changes in the institutional arrangements that currently exist. Proposed expenditure agreed to.

100,Mr BIRNEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"On 22 September last, during comthe Grievance Debate, the honourable member have for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) said: Liberal and Country Party back bench members are actdisgracefully, individually as well as collectively, in order divert attention from the real issues. Last Friday, 16 September, an article appeared in the Sydney Daily Mirror and Adelaide News, written by Trevor Kavanagh, entitled r of 'M.P. Afraid After Row On Latham'. He alleged that the story was a fabrication and was fabricated by myself. He further alleged that no time was I threatened in any way by anybeone in this Parliament. I did not fabricate the story. The scene, or to use the words of the of honourable member for Adelaide, the action and the frenzied gesticulation by members of the Opamid much uproar were witnessed by Promany members on both sides of the House. It was a disgrace and a demeaning of the institution of Parliament. Mr Kavanagh is a Sydney journalist who is respected in journalistic circles and by members of this House as a person of great competence, integrity and accuracy. These attributes have been justifiably earned by at him during the years. He is one journalist who checks his facts before going to print. There was a no exception in this instance. Typically, the honourable member for Adelaide denigrated my wife on the basis that she gets stories put into the Sun. He never bothered to check with be a the Sun because he knew his statements were false. I warn him to desist from personal attacks we on women, especially my wife. He stands conor division demned as a coward. LOAN BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 September, on motion by Mr Lynch: it we That the Bill be now read a second time. it is Mr SCHOLES (Corio) (8.8)-The purpose of this Bill, as set out in the second readmg speech the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), is to provide legislative authority to meet a prospective deficit in it the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this year. This legislation will give the Government the authority to seek funds to meet its deficit at times as it seesfit.Certain matters surrounding the borrowings of the Government and the Australia financing of its deficit, I think, ought to brought to the attention of the House and oughtdrop. to be debated much more fully than will be case with this type of legislation. The general economic management of the Government is, say the least, doubtful and to put it at its worse,have disastrous. During 1975 it was a regular practice of present Ministers to talk down the national economy at every possible opportunity. Now those Ministers in charge of the economy have created a situation of near disaster in the tralian economy, through general mismanagetowards ment and their inability to determine economic priorities and economic policy on the basis of rational discussion and the consideration of advice. The facts are that Australia's economic polieffort cies at the moment are based on a seat of the pants administration. The Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser) makes decisions on the spur the moment and announces them on the spur ofnational the moment. The departments concerned are quite often not even consulted about major econ-stances omic decisions. I am reliably informed that a vatefirmof consultants, which has very close connections with multinationals, has influence on government economic policy than the Commonwealth Treasury at the moment. I make a specific point relating to the Govern-influence ment's loan policies. On two occasions in recentno months the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have made statements relating to future reducThere tions in interest rates on government loans. It coincidental that these statements were timed almost exactly with new Commonwealth loans at the existing rate of interest being advertised. result is that people are given the impression if they want to invest in long term securities should invest in this loan because the next one will be at a lower rate of interest. Therefore will not get the best possible rate. This happenedpolitan on two occasions. There is no evidence at all that interest rates will be reduced. I can suggest only that if a mem-interest ber of a stock exchange made a similar statementcent in respect of an issue that he was making he would certainly be investigated and would most likely be prosecuted, because it is a quite improper practice to seek to influence investmentis in Commonwealth loans by making statements in which so far have proved to be false-statement that interest rates are about to drop. I will high-would light just how serious these statements are by pointing out that a State Government authority suchm Victoria, when advertising its loan, includes verbatim a statement made by the Treasurer of as an incentive for people to invest at be this stage, because interest rates are about to the There is at least substantial evidence that interest rates are not about to drop. The stateto ments of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer been misleading. It may be that my statement is not correct, but there certainly has been no action on this matter. I consider it is an improper practice for a national Treasurer or a Prime Minister to be making statements which Auswill influence people's investment policy a particular loan unless such Ministers are prepared to give absolute guarantees that they will carry out those statements. It is not the first occasion on which that type of statement has been made by persons in the Government in an to influence a decision relating to the economy. We all remember that a similar statement (Mr relating to tax concessions was made by the of Prime Minister immediately preceding the wage case in March. Six weeks later he was telling this House that under no circumwould the Government consider tax conpri-cessions as a trade-off for the unions withdrawing their claim for a wage rise based on indexaa greater tion. That is one of the facts. There has developed a practice by the Government of making statements, designed to tribunals and individuals, which have relationship at all to the facts and which, if made outside this Parliament, would be criminal. is no question that if one tried to sell deis bentures in a company, told people that this was the last opportunity they had of getting 10.5 per cent on a gilt-edged basis, and told them with the The sort of authority that the Treasurer has, with no thatintention of carrying out that statement, one theywould be putting out a false prospectus. That is exactly what the Treasurer and the Prime Ministheyter have been doing. The Melbourne and MetroBoard of Works in its loan raising advertising is using the Treasurer's words as part of its advertising campaign in order to fill its loan at an rate which is one quarter or one half per higher than the Commonwealth bond rate. Mr Haslem-Who is doing that?",49
101,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The Victorian Government using the Treasurer's words about a reduction interest rates. I suggest that you look at the smatter. If it were done by a private individual it be looked on as being a false prospectus. Mr Haslem-The Government is not doing it.,50
102,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member was not in the House when I made my original remarks. The facts are that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister made statements to this effect almost immediately before opening a Commonwealth loan. They stated that there would be future reductions in interest rates for Commonwealth loans but not for this loan, the implication being: Get in now if you want the high rate of interest. Certainly it was an incentive for people to buy into that particular loan. At this stage I suggest that the statements have no real consequence as far as any particular reduction is concerned. If made by a private firm they would be criminal. Mr Haslem-We have to wait and see, do we not?",51
103,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"I do not think that we have to. The Government has made great play of the size and structure of its deficit and of the that it is going to be of a certain size. I think ought to be pointed out to this House that there are wide discrepancies between the Govern the ment's accounting methods now and the acdoes counting methods used previously in arriving at the amount of the deficit and also that a substanpose tial proportion of the reduction in government expenditure shown in the Budget has been achieved by transferring expenditure to other areas. For instance, in die past two years over $200m of government expenditure has been little transferred from the Budget Papers to the Ausmachinery-type tralian Telecommunications Commission in the form of separate borrowings. The borrowings port the Bill. have taken place but the Government has not shown them in its Budget Papers. It has claimed that there has been a reduction in government expenditure when there has not. It is only ing of the books or a change in bookkeeping entries. The Opposition is not opposing this loan besome cause obviously it is necessary to finance deficit. But I suggest that it might be appropriate for the Treasurer, when he is available, to make a full statement on the economy which this House can debate at length. It is abouttimewe had something other than ad hoc remarks from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or other MinisBUI ters about the actual state of the economy and what the anticipations are. It is important relevant that a major economic debate should take place in this Parliament and that it should take place on the basis of a government presented statement. This Government seems a little shy to present such a statement. Mr Newman-That is what the Budget is.",51
104,Mr SCHOLES,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,That was presented two months ago. Even you altered that.,51
105,Mr BOURCHIER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The Loan Bill 1977, which is before the House tonight, is a usual Bill- I think that is the best way to describe it. It is a Bill of a type which has been introduced by governments for many many years. It does not, as the former Speaker, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) claimed, represent an ad hoc process. The comments being made by the Pnme Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and others in regard to interest rates have nothing whatsoever to do with this Bill. The Prime Minister quite correctly has forecast that the proper economic measures taken by this Government will eventually lead to a downturn in interest rates. This has nothing to do with this Bill or the fact that a loan is being put fordo ward in which the public can invest. fact The Government is drawing on this loan to enit able it to borrow for defence purposes. As I have mentioned, other governments have done this in past. But, by the same token, this measure not authorise any additional defence expenditure. There has been legislation for this purin the legislative programs of successive governments. Honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Corio, know quite well that their Government undertook exactly the same procedures. There is very to say about this Bill except to say that it is a Bill. It has to go through the Parliament. It will go through. I merely nse to sup",51
106,Mr CREAN,PERSONAL EXPLANATION," I take the rather interesting point made by my friend a cookthe Government Whip, the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), that the Loan Bill 1977 is a machinery-type Bill which ought to go through the Parliament. If I may say so with historical significance, that is not the view the which was taken some two or three years ago when a simUar Bill came before the House. I draw attention to the tide of the Bill, namely, 'A Bill for an Act to authorize the bonowing and expending of moneys for defence purposes . One of the reasons why the wording in the title of the is so carefully chosen is that bonowings for defence purposes can be made outside the mechand anisms of the Loan Council. I have heard quite a lot in recenttimesabout attempts to evade the Loan Council. With some respect, this has been a matter of some historical significance. I am pleased to see the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth), in the House; I was surprised that he was not here earlier. Candidly, I do not agree with some points about the difference between loan and capital expenditure which were raised by the honourable member for Mackellar. But the only reason why this particular measure comes before us is that it does allow us to allocate part of ever funds might be determined in the course 12 months and to say that these funds are for fence purposes and they do not of the allocation by the Loan Council. There has been a lot of iteration about what temporary and what is permanent, but as far as loans for defence purposes are concerned, these funds do not form part of the allocation by the Loan Council. This was the case in measures of this kind for at least the 15 years before a Government came into office at the end of 1972 or the beginning of 1973. At that time, when particular measure came before the House, instead of it being regarded as a mechanical measure it became the vehicle of obstruction, initially in this House in a craven sort of way cause at least the then Opposition members of this House knew that they could not pursue the battle very far. But they chose to say: 'Oh well, view of the time-table we will fight the issue somewhere else'. They fought it in the other place. I was the Treasurer at the time. There was a buy demand to supply answers to certain highly irrelby any other evant questions. The matter was pursued with a argument rather great deal of vigour. I think one of the principal exponents of the objections was the lady who is now the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle). It is intriguing, to say the least, to find that the matter is now regarded as merely mecha anical. I never thought it was anything else, just as I regard the total presentation of the Budgetall. after all, this is only part of the total presentation of the Budget-to be mechanical. If one looks at thefiguresprovided in Stateing ment No. 1 headed 'Summary of the 1977-78 year Budget' attached to the Budget Speech, one sees that estimated for 1977-78 are outlays of those $26,656,000,000 and receipts of and $24,439,000,000-a deficit internally of interest $2,217,000,000. Then one sees the rather vague ing item 'Overseas Deficit'. With all respect to my annual former experts in the Treasury, I think some of them agreed with me that there was some difference in evaluating what is called an 'Overfuge. seas Deficit' when the balance of payments situchamber, ation is different from one year to another. Nevertheless, the statement refers to a domestic deficit of $ 1,347m. But this Budget, does plain any more than any other Budget explains, how that domestic deficit is to be encompassed. suggest that there is some mystery about the overseas deficit. One of the ways in which it is to be encompassed, of course, is that there shall be public loans-borrowing s from what is called the non-banking sector, as I understand the terminwhatology. Candidly, when a Budget is brought down of nobody has any conception about what that subdescription is going to be or from what source it is have to form part going to come. Since we are having a learned discussion on is this point, I am pleased to see in the chamber my friend, I hope, of long standing because we have both been in the Parliament for a long time. I disagree with him on one point: I think there is a lot of difference between public accounting and priLabor vate accounting. I can understand a man who wants to buy a domestic motor car having the this choice of whether to buy a humble Holden or a grandiose Mercedes, but he would be foolish if, having bought his motor car, he did not set aside something year by year to buy the next one when behe felt he wanted to do so. If he is affluent enough he does not have to bother. But the community as a whole does things year by year. For in example, if a person is buying 100 motor cars every year over a period of years, it seems to me that the interesting thing is the way in which he ensures he has enough money year by year to the additional capital stock he requires. Whether it be done by depreciation, reserves or means seems to me to be a technical than anything else. If I may say so, it is in that regard that I differ from the opinion expressed by my friend who says that if certain things are put in what he calls capital account as distinct from an annual income account, a deficit will not be created at That is very consoling, unless one looks at aggregate performances. Surely that is what a government has to do. If a government is buildschools year by year, if it is building hospitals by year, if it is building all sorts of other capital undertakings year by year and if all of transactions are entered into an account some kind of amortisation, some kind of rate, is worked out, that may be interestfrom an accounting point of view, but I do not think that is the reality of capital as against consumption in a community. What we have here is only part of this subterIn fact, with all respect to the experts in the I hope it is not subterfuge. It certainly becomes subterfuge if an effort is not made to explain it honestly. If I may say so with all respect, not exthere was a dishonest attempt when I was Treasurer to use this particular event-the annual I provision-for that purpose. I can remember a former friend of mine, Mr Howson, who is no longer in the House, bringing in this sort quietly one day. I suppose that was as far back 1965 or thereabouts. I must say that I offered objection to it. I accepted it as being merely technical part of the Budget exercise. But when the Labor Government came into office, it was different story. I must say that I listened with some interest today to Government supporters trying to pour scorn upon those people who endeavoured to make capital out of the Government's difficulty with the exchange rate. Any government at time in the future will have difficulty in determining what its exchange rate ought to be. I think it posite would be acknowledged by the honourable Budget at member whose history goes back a long time-it spend $800m-i tThedebate. goes back like mine does, to the Depression when, I think we had less knowledge about realities of economic circumstances than we do now-that in the final analysis the setting of exchange rate is an arbitrary decision rather a precise mathematical one. I think it is nate that we play hazard about what the exchange rate might be, because I believe that the number of people who can take advantage of changes in the exchange rate is very small when seen in the total context of an economy. But they in contrast to the rest of us can gain significant. The Government should not play pure today in relation to what is happening in 1977 compared with what it did in 1973, 1974 and 1975. In the latter year it did what to my mind was the graveyard of democracy in that a place other than this gained ascendency in regard to where the financial decisions of his nation are made, and the Government betrayed any respect that it may now claim for trying to defend things in terms of decent constitutional usage. At no time was that better displayed than on the trivial occasions in 1974 and 1975, and even maybe in 1973. In many ways we got away with it in 1973 because I think there was at least acknowledgment in 1973 that because the Government had just been elected it was entitled to be extended the normal decencies and to be allowed to use the proper procedures. I would ask honourable members opposite, and particularly those Government members who were then in Opposition, to look at the kinds of trumped up questions that were asked of us, particularly in 1974 when what I rightly described as this mechanical issue- I agree with my friend on this point-cam e before us. Government supporters saw that point and the honourable gentleman in particular saw it. I suppose that he is responsible to ensure that under this legislation the sum of $1,100m is the of Bill precisely measured maximum amount. But I as hope he knows enough to realise that even if the no $ 1,100m is exceeded in one way, it will be boona doggled or accounted for in a different way. a I believe that in an economy such as the Australian economy, which is running at an aggregate of $80,000m per annum-that is what the gross domestic product will be; it is pretty close to it now-nobod y can say with precision that it is better to have a deficit of $2.2 billion without allowing for the overseas account and $ 1,300m any on domestic account. Can anybody on the opside of the House argue against that proposition the moment? I said this during the Government is prepared to may have to spend more than days that because it may not have estimated the the aggregates correctly-o n the unemployment benefit. If I may put it crudely, in reality, somean thing like 90 per cent of government outlays than comes from taxation. The payment of the unemunfortuployment benefit means that those who are working subsidise those who are not working. Can anybody argue that it would not be better, instead of paying people two-thirds of a wage for doing nothing, to pay them a full wage for doing what something? I am pleased that the honourable is member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) acknowledges that. Whilst I am not an active front bencher, I hope that I am an intelligent back bencher in the Labor Party. Ifindit rather intriguing at the moment to read a number of articles in overseas journals which refer to countries trying to pursue an incomes policy. An incomes policy is some attempt to keep a relationship between wages paid and available resources and the disposition between consumption and investment. I am sorry that I had to speak rather suddenly tonight. I did not expect this debate to come on so quickly. A Swedish economist has said that it is absurd in the Swedish situation- I submit that it is as absurd in the Australian situation-to tliink that variations in currency are any answer to the problems the country faces. I trunk it is about time that was acknowledged in this country. I also read recently a review by an economist of the National Westminister Bank. If I was speaking tomorrow I would have the reference with me. He said that looking at the British experience there is no warrant for suggesting that either excessive wage demands or labour militancy is responsible for the economic situation which the United Kingdom faces. I suggest that there are salutary lessons to be learnt. The only favourable comment made by honourable members opposite on my performance as Treasurer is that at some time. I said that an increase in one man's wages may be to the detriment of another man's employment. I think there is an element of truth in that, but 1 do not believe that that simple syllogism contains the whole truth. I have tried to suggest that this Budget offers no solution to the basic problems of the Australian economy. I believe that that is true. After all, the Bill we are debating tonight is part of this Budget. If the problems can be simplified- I am not too sure that they can be-as being only inflation and unemployment perhaps the Budget can offer some solution. I do not believe that there are simple solutions to those twin problems. Inflation is endemic in modern affluent societies. I hope that unemployment will not become traditional in them. But it will be traditional and increasingly significant if we do not recognise that changes are taking place. I am afraid that nobody in the Press Gallery takes any notice of a speech unless the Press has had at leastfivehours notice of it and it is made by somebody called a shadow Minister or something equally insubstantial. Otherwise the Press does not report it. I do not believe that the unemployment in Australia at the moment is due to the substitution of capital for labour. That is the history of capital development. Surely the social problem is what to do with the people who have been made redundant by the machines which are taking their place? Surely everyone of us here knows that we would be a pretty primitive community if we relied on man power instead of horse power? Has not that been the history of economic development in the Western world? My reading of history indicates that there was an agricultural revolution before there was an industrial revolution and that there were differences in the industrial revolution as between one country and another. The industrial revolution occurred early in England and later in Germany, and it occurred in a different way in France. One of the horrible, odd realities of the end of World War II was that those countries whose economies had been destroyed by the war because they were not allowed to spend their affluence on armaments were able to re-equip themselves with new industrial machinery. This is the kind of lesson everybody has to learn. The honourable member for Mackellar is like me: He is a grandfather now, so he is also a father. Anybody who is a father of young children ought to be concerned about the employment opportunities in the years ahead. They will not occur in factories as they did before. I looked at somefiguresthe other day. I am sorry again that I cannot be precise, but I did not expect to speak at this time of the night. At the moment significantly fewer people in Australia are employed in the textile and footwear industries, but those people are producing just as much as was produced when the numbers were greater. One only has to look at the aggregate of manufacturing employment in Australia today. I have referred to the Jackson report two or three times previously. If I interpret it properly it says that if Australian manufacturing industry is to hold the relative proportion of employment it now has and if it is to expand it will not do so internally; it will have to do it externally. I again ask honourable members on the other side of the House to nominate the areas where they can see potential expansion for exports of Australian manufactured products. I cannot. I am prepared to acknowledge my ignorance, but the Government side is supposed to have the wisdom. Given that it will be difficult and that the solution will be long term, where is the Government going to employ people? It was prepared to lay the blame for unemployment at our door when thefiguresgot high enough. It did not worry about unemployment when thefigureswere increasing. When they got high enough it said that they were due to the terrible three years of Labor Government in Australia. That is nonsense. The Australian economy is not the worse in the world. If one looks honestly atfiguresone will see that in recent times the period when it was at its best was in 1973-74. I say again with some modesty that after thefirstLabor Budget in 1973 the number of houses completed in Australia was the highest ever and the total amount of employment in Australia was the highest ever. One cannot take no great credit for that. In a country such as Australia, where the population is still increasing, there ought to be more jobs one year than in the previous year and more houses ought to be constructed one year than in the previous year. Perhaps there will be ebbs andflowsaccording to birth rates, but at least the Australian economy is not the worse in the world. But if anybody is responsible for painting it as being the worse in the word it is honourable members opposite who wanted three years to repair the economy but who would not allow us 18 months to do our task. I repeat that there is not much that we began to do that has been reversed. There is a lot of what we began to do that has been slowed down, and the people of Australia are beginning to miss it. Honourable members opposite had the years from 1949 to 1972, undeterred by numbers in either House, but they had no vision. They had no imagination. If I may say so, they had even slightly more talent then than I think they have now. But they are the people who are supposed to be facing up to these sorts of things. When Labor came out with this sort of legislation that called a technical measure honourable members opposite did their best. They could not win here but they had a contrivance of numbers somewhere else. I repeat what I said in an earUer speech today that, in my view, this House negates its responsibUity. After aU, governments in Australia are won by the party that happens to have the most numbers in this House. We have negated our proper responsibUity. When Labor came into office the upstairs place was used to deny what the people of Australia suggested the new government should do. I alwaysfindthat it is from the other side of the House that the cries come about communism or dangerous forms of government. I believe that communism will come in Australia only when proper domocratic forces are denied the abUity to do what the people of the country want them to do. Surely that is what the situation was. Let me come back to the title of this Bill is a Bill 'to authorise the borrowing and expendwere ing of money for defence purposes'. It is only subterfuge that such moneys expended that way do not have to go through the Loan Council. What a song honourable members opposite made about certain things that did leave not even ultimately come before the Loan Coungranted. cU and what might have happened if they had done so? I think that honourable members opposite have to scratch deeper. They have to look more closely and examine more thoroughly what are the realities of Australia in 1977. In my view, the major problems that afflict the Australian economy in 1977-the y were incipient in 1971 when honourable members opposite were in Net office, they were more evident when we came expenditure into office in 1973, and surely if they were unapparent to the obfuscated in 1971 they ought to be to States evident even to the most naive in 1977-ar e that to Other Sectors changes are taking place in every economy that Transfer still calls itself western capitalist. They are changes in the structure and they are changes that will not be resolved by us unless we get past authorities-for capital purposes meagre poltiical bickering.",51
107,Mr WENTWORTH,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"There are some things on which I would Sources: agree with the honourable member for Melpage bourne Ports (Mr Crean) and some on which I 'Payments would disagree. I hope that I will make that clear as I proceed. The Bill in front of us is the borrowing for defence purposes. As such it not amenable to the Loan Council and stands outside the Loan Council framework. Nominally at any rate this borrowing will be part of the moneys necessary to cover the $2.2 bilUon 'deficit' which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is brought forward in his Budget. Whether there will be any reversal of that in the future, we do not know. Nominally this is what it is for. Even apart from any defence component there are capital works and capital advances to the States included in the Treasurer'sfigureof $2.2 bUlion which he caUs the deficit and which I think is more properly referred to as the pubUc sector borrowing requirement These capital works will be of the order of $3.5 bUlion to $4 bUlion. In other words, if one goes to normal accounting one sees that the Budget shows a surplus of about $2 bUlion which is wholly directed towards financing some part of the capital works-the rest of the capital works are to befinancedby borrowing, of which this Bill before us for $1.1 billion might well form a part. As I have said, I am not clear as to the detaUs of the capital works included in the present whichBudget. Last year the capital works included set by the Treasurer at $3,869m. He was a good enough to give me a breakdown of that figure for last year and I seek leave to have it network of the included in Hansard.",55

I have no doubt that in due course they will be provided and we will be able to see the Treasurer's ownfigurefor capital works in this Budget corresponding to the $3,869m for last year's Budget. This capital component, by the way, includes all the State capital works. People perhaps do not realise that when we put into our Budget afigureof $2.2 billion-we call it 'deficit' but it is more precisely 'public sector borrowing requirement '-it includes the capital works of the various State governments which for some obscure reason now appear as part of the Commonwealth deficit. It is mad, it is ludicrous, it is insane, but that is how thefiguresare done. I take the point made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that public accounting is different from private accounting. That is true, but if one is thinking of any normal type of public accounting one must look, as he said, at the overallfiguresand at the economy as a whole. What has happened is this: In the Australian economy people make individually the decision to save and to put aside some part of their current income. This is a decision which they make personally, and the aggregate of those savings is taken away from their current consumption. That means that their current consumption falls and we have to find a way of using those savings in capital works whether they be private or government, because if we do not we will have unemployment. In point of fact there is unemployment in the Western world and in Australia today because of this excess of unused savings. Our Australian unemployment is simply the smell of unused savings going rancid. That is all it is. Any government which looked at the overall economy would find a reason and a compelling necessity to borrow on the local market because this is the way of absorbing the private savings which are at the present moment unused, going into the banking system, being mucked about by the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank and generally being taken out of circulation. These rancid unused savings are in point of fact the cause of the unemployment which we see today. I am looking at the economy as a whole and looking at the overall picture as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports told us we should do. I am afraid-and I say this with all respectthat my friend from Melbourne Ports was brainwashed too much by the Treasury officials when he was Treasurer. I think our present Treasurer is suffering in the same way. What I say against our present Budget. I would say against the kind of Labor concept which the honourable member who has just spoken- a former Labor Treasurer-brough t forward. Although he trunks he is looking at the situation as a whole, in point of fact he is not doing so. Apparently he does not realise that, if we used these savings more effectively, we would not have unemployment because unemployment is simply the aggregate of excess personal savings. This is a very simple proposition, but it is true. Of course, there is the double effect. What one withdraws from consumption not only reduces the actual consumption of the day but also reduces the propensity to invest because investment is made for consumption. This gearing is quite important in the whole of the economic process. So I say that we have to look at this matter as a whole. It is quite right for the Government to borrow these excess savings because this is how to get the economy going again. It is no use just taking the savings by way of taxation. If we take them in this way all we do is cut down the aggregate of demand because what people pay out in tax they do not spend themselves on some item of consumption. Their saving is made from the residue after the tax has been paid. These are very, very simple propositions but I regard them as essential propositions because they are the ones on which the whole economy of the Western world is foundering. The Treasurer is quite right when he says: ' I am only doing what overseasfinancierstell me should be done'. But overseasfinanciersthemselves have not done it to the same extent that our Treasurer has done it here. Overseasfinanciersare now having second thoughts and they are talking about reflation in Europe and America. They now see that the measures they have been taking, the measures which they have wished on our unhappy Treasurer-ou r unhappy and uncomprehending Treasurer without an understanding of what it is all about who has applied them much morefiercelythan they have been applied in Europe-ar e wrong. They are reversing them in the hope of checking the stagnation which is present in the economy of the whole of the Western world in the same way as it is blighting our economy. So I regard this as a matter of major consequence. It is not, of course, that what is done in Australia will change the history of the world. Of course this will not be the case. We are a little people and our influence is minor. But at least here in our small way let us abjure the economic sins of the financiers overseas. While the Treasurer is quite right when he says that taking the advice of overseas bankers he is wrong in taking that advice. I cannot say too strongly that this is a major matter. Unless we do what I suggest, we will turnment the Western world and Australia as part of it the abyss of socialism and communism. This is why the free enterprise system is not being lowed to work. I believe it is essential that should allow the free enterprise system to work,and end this stagnation and get things going again. pedient. Let me return to the Bill in front of us and speak about the money that is to be borrowed. We do not think the Bill states whether the money to be borrowed locally or overseas. But this money may well form part of the loans which Government is now saying it will raise overseas. address my mind for a moment to the question overseas loans. A country has a balance annually of what is known as its current account. That balance volves crediting the exports and debiting imports, crediting overseas earnings and ing overseas payments. There are two comover ponents-the visibles and the invisibles. them together and they are the country's current account for the year. For the year ended 1976-77 we had a negative balance on current account. We went into the redemploy by $1.9 billion. If we look at thefiguresto see will how they are shaping up wefindthat this year wedrastic are to go into the red for $3.5 billion or more bUlion from unless something is done. Thefiguresare quite the inexorable when one looks at their trend because we must remember that our overseas debit on went current account last year was piled up under quickly circumstances where there was stagnation in can cut the Australia and consumption and investment low. Any recovery here will mean a bigger seas deficit unless something is done. We have to remember that company profits, including the profits of overseas compames, are increasing. They are not Australian profits belong to someone else. We also have to remember that when the Government borrows $2,000m extra or $3,000m extra it will be up another couple of hundred rnillion dollars in interest. All of these factors have to be taken account. I would say, looking ahead, that something has to be done. We can poultice the situation means of foreign investment. But foreign investbourne ment has to be paid for in the end. balance-abou t half our deficit on invisibles; something like a $1.5 billion deficit on invisibles-is due to profits which have to be paidtohe is tofirmswhich have come over and invested in Australia. They have been earriing profits in Australia. If we encourage more foreign investment, we have to pay more. So private investis not the answer to this. PubUc investment, intothat is borrowing $2,000m overseas, is a temporary means of staunching the outflow. Probably it alis a better means than encouraging too much we private investment but it stUl has to be paid for one can think of it only as a temporary exNow, there are two alternatives in front of us. I can improve the balance of visible trade by isincreasing exports or decreasing imports. the How are we to increase our exports in the near I future? We have no uranium avaUable, unhapofpUy. There is not much market for extra coal, iron ore, copper ortin.There is not much additional market for wool.

Added to the $1.9 bUUon that down the drain last year, say $3.4 or $3.5 bUlion for 1977-78. Unless something is done downward trend will steepen. So we were exports a little. and imports perhaps we can increase over-differential tax on foreign we Perhaps can think of a private investment in Australia. That would be a very drastic tiling but it is possible. It certainly is conceivable. But something has to be done. We cannot allow this but drift to disaster to continue.

Over the short term probably it is the right tiling to do but over the long term it is not good enough. Let us face up to reality. I accept absolutely the point made byby my friend the honourable member for MelPorts that we should look at the AusOur negativetraUan economy as a whole.",55

120,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"This debate encompasses a debate on two Bills, namely, the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill and the Excise Tanff Amendment Bill. MCMahon, Les This legislation arises from changes announced in the Budget to the rates of levy applicable under the Coal Export Duty Act and a change in Stewart, F.E. Uren,T. the rate of excise duty on coal which was collected for application to the coal mining industry Willis, R. long service leave fund. The purpose of the CusYoung, M.J. toms Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill is to reduce the rates of duty on coking coal from James, A. W. Johnson, Les $4.50 to $3.50 a tonne on coal subject to the higher rate and from $1.50 to $1 a tonne on coal subject to the lower rate. This legislation is contingent upon an amendment made by the Government at the time of the last Budget to Wallis, LO. Garrick, H.S. phase out the coal export duty levy over three years. The Opposition opposes the legislation. It does so on the same basis as it did last year, namely, because the Government has not announced its intention to introduce a tax measure as a substitute for the present coal export duty levy. During the debate on this subject last year I took great to explain the attitude of the Opposition to the coal industry and to amplify in detail the Opview of the state of the industry. I also I made it clear that the Opposition was of the view that the present coal export duty levy was indiscriminate in its application. I stated then: Whilst the present levy was indiscriminate and unfair in operating across the board on all coal company profits, the industry is healthy enough to sustain a selective tax to increase the return to the Australian people. Second Reading Most observers will be aware of the good fortune of the coal industry over the lastfiveyears. Prices haverisenspectacularly in real terms and some .companies have reaped the whirlwind from efficient, large scale production. It is the view of the Opposiuon that because companies have of been given a national asset to mine and export, with the fact that some have managed to is do it profitably, many companies can afford to the return to the Australian people some of the debenefits which commodity price movements have given them. The Government on the other takes the view that the companies most successful in this industry should be relieved of any additional tax burden. It is true that some of the marginal producers found the impost of the coal export duty difficult to manage, but some were able to tolerate it with absolute ease and still chalk up massive growth in their profitability. The Utah companies in Queensland between them paid over half the total collections under the duty and were able to increase their profits even with the impost of the duty. I refer to the company's last annual report which points out that in 1975 the company's gross profit was $ 100.9m when the coal export duty levy payable that year was only $ 10.8m. In 1976, despite an increase in the coal export duty from $ 10.8m to $75.9m, the company was still able to increase its gross profit from $100.9m to $136.9m. This was a 35.6 per cent increase in its gross profit, although it had paid out an extra $65m in duty in that year. There are other examples, although they are not as spectacular. How the Government can justify the phasing out of this duty on a company like Utah and not replace it with some secondary profits tax mechanism is absolutely beyond explanation. It seems that naked partisanship can be the only explanation. The Government has had a year since the presentation of the last amending legislation to devise and implement a secondary tax mechanism. If it had done so the Opposition would not be opposing this legislation. Not only has the Government not yet introduced a secondary taxing structure applicable to the coal industry but also it has made it clear that it is not even contemplating one. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) have made it clear in recent times that any secondary profits related tax which may be introduced by the present Government will be applicable only to petroleum and uranium, completely exempting the coal industry. The coal export duty levy may have been a clumsy mechanism but it did give an increment to the national wealth from the mining of Australia's valuable coal reserves. I have given notice that a future Labor Government will certainly seek to apply a secondary profits related tax mechanism to the extractive industries. The tax would be carefully designed in consultation with industry so that the objectives of such a tax would be met without some of the distortionary effects which can arise from taxes which are ill designed and hastily imposed. However, some sections of the coal industry can afford to pay more than just company tax alone and, in my view, they should be obliged to pay more. No sensible person believes in penalising companies to the point where development is stymied or where exploration is discouraged. But there is a sensible medium in all things. Imprudent talk by industry leaders about confiscation policies do little to establish a sensible point of agreement between government and industry in relation to the nature and incidence of any new secondary tax. PubUc opinion will eventually force this Government to abandon its overly protective attitude towards the coking coal industry. It is to be hoped that some of the more responsible elements in the Government will see the need for a proper sharing of the tax burden amongst those institutions in Australia that can afford to make a greater contribution to the nation's wealth, so we get away from the situation which we witnessed in recent years in which the growth in tax income came only from the pay-as-you-earn category of individuals. The Opposition supports the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1977, it supports the increase in the rate of excise duty on coal from 4.3c to 10c per tonne, and it supports the removal of the present duty of 1.2c per litre on condensate.",59
121,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) is an enthusiast with respect to mining, and he is respected for being an enthusiast. I have always thought that he has tried to be fair insofar as his party would allow him to be fair. He has had to carry some lead weights in the saddle. The lead weights are put there as a result of his party's policy and as a result of some of the conference decisions of his party. I want to deal with those matters because I was fascinated that he should mention at great length that his opposition to this matter rested only on the proposition that there was a faUure to announce a compensating, secondary or super profits or resources tax on companies which will benefit by the aboUtion of the export coal levy. The Opposition, putting itself in the position of saying that it will not oppose this proposition if the Government would do something about taxes in otherfields,fails completely to remember its policy on taxation and those upon whom it levied the tax rate. Let it never be forgotten that the principal source of revenue from taxation when the Opposition was in Government-the honourable member for Blaxland was not responsible for this-wa s the taxation upon the ordinary person who had only the price of his own labour to sell. That was Labor's policy. It is not sufficient to come into this House, to cry and to say: 'If we were in government we would change. We would keep our tax policies low, but we would hit somehow or other those coal exporters who are able to mine and export coal and earn export income for this country'. Not for one moment does the Opposition retreat from levy upon the coal industry. Basically it does retreat from that position. In a practical manner and in a theoretical manner, that was a gross a very grave error. The Opposition forgets that those commodiindustry. ties upon which it imposed the tax are commodisaid ties which are subject to very large cyclical ments in price because they are subject to world after market prices. It was all right to propose a levy upon coal when it was at the top of the boom, when the price hadrisenfor a number of years, but when a tax is kept on that commodity and when one realises that the price of coal today, compared with its price a couple of years ago, 15 per cent or 20 per cent below that price in real terms, what does one do about the tax which was imposed- a commodity tax, an export levy tax? Does one put it on and put it off from year to year? The idea of a commodity tax does not motor work. Apply it to coal-the down-swings in price are as great as the up-swings in price. Do it copper-the oscillations in price are easily great and as severe. Do it with sugar. Honouremployed able members know what happens with sugar. industries Do it with the other products which are produced from commodities such as coal. I refer to steel. They are all subject to wide cyclical movements in price. In practice and in theory, the idea of a comwhich modity tax on these items does not work, has the never worked and is not in Australia's best interests. I am astounded that this proposition remains in a country which is short, and increasingly short, of export income. The debate earlier today concerned the negative balance current account and the negative balance on the balance of payments. As soon as one talks about either of those matters one is talking about the capacity of a country to export. If one imposes tax on those commodities which are responsible for getting one's exports, one of any economic or social rationality whatsoever. I am disappointed that the Opposition conhas, tinues to adopt the policies that it has adopted. That is wrong. I instance what happened when this coal levy was first put on. It is not sufficient say that it was merely intended to shoot at the Utah organisation. A lot of bystanders were of caught in the grapeshot as well. In 1974-75, year in which this new tax was put on, 12 of the great coal exporters in this country had returns on historical cost levels of below 15 per cent. They had no indexation; no bringing up to present value of their capital equipment. Yet they were to have this extra levy imposed upon them. That is against common sense and econthe idea of a tax omic rationality. not I believe- I am disturbed about this-that I see once again the great influence of the policies of and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this respect. He feels that we can hit the mining He has said this ad infinitum. He has that we can hit the mining industry repeamove-tedly and it does not matter. He has said that all it is not a great employer of labour; it is a very capital intensive industry; therefore it can be susceptible. People who make that kind of statement forget or do not understand that the exports of the mining industry enable wages to be paid to workers and profits to be paid to those is who have invested capital in Australia's great protected industries. In other words, it is a transfer from the export industries that enables wages to be paid, in excess of the value added as a result of production, to workers at the Adelaide vehicle plant of Chrysler Australia Ltd. It is the export income earned from coal which enwith ables wages to be paid, in excess of the value as added as a result of production, to those in Australia's great textile and apparel in Victoria. That is part of the necessary interconnection of Australian industry. So, to pick out, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has sought to do repeatedly, and as has been followed by his party, an industry is capital intensive and which does not in first line of work have a large labour force, is to do irreparable harm not only to the people in that industry and to the people who have invested in it but to people in other parts of Australia whose returns depend upon exports on earned far away from them. That applies particularly in States such as Queensland and Western Australia, parts of New South Wales and so on. It is a serious misunderstanding in which the a Opposition indulges, and it is not to Australia's benefit that the misunderstanding should be perisflyingin the face sisted with. This country in future will have, and today if it is to achieve the economic prosperity which it has had, a limited ability to take in its own washing. It will not be gained from the rate to of growth of its domestic market. It will not be able to generate a great rate of growth in terms the production of its own industry or of the dethe mands from its own industry. It simply means that in the long run the great generative industries in Australia will be the export industries. It is the transfer from those export industries which enables the massed work force in many of the large cities of Australia to be supported, and necessarily so. It is the lack of understanding that proposition which ought to concern person in this House. In this kind of circumstance the Labor Party reminds me of a suicide Australia squad-it picks a target, faces inwards and troys itself. It also destroys the Australian force and its prospects. I had hoped that it not indulge in this kind of ludicrous economic Company. rubbish and nonsense. These matters have to mentioned. Two further matters in respect of the coal industry are important. One of them is the curto rent seamen's strike in relation to exports Utah from north Queensland. Certain features that strike ought to be comprehended and underapplied stood. One of the interesting features of the strike is that the rule that is being relied upon is as the 40:40:20 rule, which is a recommendation of the International Labour Office which was never adopted except by some landbound African States. The rule is that 40 per country's exports and 40 per cent of its imports should be transported in ships manned by seamen of that particular country. This applies both the exporting and the importing country. Twenty per cent of those exports can go relahis tively free. The Seamen's Union, as a general background to its negotiations is relying upon that principle. The second principle upon which it is relying tariffs to generate the strike and the stances for which it is responsible is that the and to thetomatter Spanish seamen on those ships are paid sufficiently. It just happens that the union is foolish and will not serveThe forgets to apply those principles in respect example, Russian ships which transport goods to certain circumstances and that country only and from Australia. Russian ships have increased their transportation from Australia from about 10 per cent to 20 per cent. The wages of their seamen are far below respect what is being paid to Spanish seamen. But what Those is a crime with respect to Spanish seamen is ignored with respect to Russian seamen, some whom are paid a Uttle over $80 a month.",60
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Order! to be I am having a hard job lining up what the to honourable member says, although it is most interesting, with the customs and excise tariff BUls. I wonder whether he would like to tie in remarks with the subject matter of this debate.",62
123,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"I should be deUghted portion to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker. As you will see in moment, what I am saying is most relevant. We are talking about the export coal levy which, course, applies to those companies which are it is exporting coal from Australia. One of the comof panies that has been in the target line has been every the Utah Development Company, which has been trying desperately to export coal from in order to earn export income. As you deswould realise, Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourwork able member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) menwould tioned at some length the Utah Development be There has been a continuing inabUity to export coal from north Queensland because of a seamen's strike which has been applied with respect coal exports. That strike has relied upon two by principles-the 40:40:20 principle, which has of been misappUed, and a principle that has been in respect of Spanish seamen. What I was pointing out was that if the coal exports are known to have any validity and any meaning whatsoever the industrial relations which are the necessary lubricant for those exports to be consummated have to be part of the consideration. I cent of a mention those matters in passing.",62
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Order! to They might need lubricating, but the Chair does not. I suggest that the honourable member tie in remarks more exactly to the BUls, which are not trade BUls but customs and tariffs Bills.",62
125,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"I find it very difficult, Mr Deputy Speaker, to see how customs and Bills can relate to anything other than trade. Nevertheless, as you request, I shall return tragic set of circumprecisely the Bill which is before the House of the coal industry and the not being economics of that industry. nature of this tax Australia well. When of, for it is said that the tax would be opposed in should of goods to and impose tax, the instead a super-profits tax or a secondary Opposition needs to define its position in of each of those taxes. What does it mean by a super-profits tax or by a secondary tax? terms have never been defined. of Unless in the matter of taxation there are precise definitions people are afraid of whatever whim comes before them. Is the super-profits tax levied in place of the coal export levy? Is it be determined on the rate of return on capital development, or is it to be determined instead merely on the rate of total profits? That would be his the difference between Utah and the Broken HiU Pty Co. Ltd. Is it a tax to be incurred as a proof the profits on turnover of a company, aor is it a tax to be imposed when a $2 company happens to earn a $10,000 profit in a year? That of has never been made clear. Unless there is some precision in terms of taxation, people do not know where they are going and as great a miscommodity take will be made as was made when this tax first imposed several years ago. Prices fluctuatewith and those determinants according to which proimpose fitability is applied in a company also fluctuate. I take your advice with respect to the Bill beingredients fore the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, apply the few minutes left to me precisely coal industry. One of the companies which is in the process of developing a mine in Australia is the BHP company. It will be developing a mine at Gregory, the coal from which, if my understanding of the quality of the product there is correct, will be subject to the coal export levy at the highest rate. When the BHP company develops that mine in Queensland I am conevery cerned that it is developed operation but as a separate profit centre. When difficulties in getting one lives in some of the outlying areas of the country one oftenfindsa branch office mentality balance. applied to that area. I hope that BHP in developing the Gregory mine will have regard to employment that exists in Queensland in respect of engineers and will employ the maximum number of consulting, civil and other engineers from that State to work out what is to be done the rnine and the works. I hope that BHP will the employ as its negotiators for coal exports people centred in that State and not merely people national centred in Sydney or Melbourne where its princivolume pal operations lie. I hope also that its exports be negotiated from that State. In other words, hope that there will be maximum domestic ripple economic effects in that State from those operthe ations within that State.",62
126,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,You left out the freight rates in that State.,63
127,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"No doubt it will be tions subject to appropriate freight rates in that State and the company is aware of that now, whatever those rates are. It might be represents a secondary resources tax, and a effective one too. It is a matter of working out whether this should be a branch office operation or whether it should be set up as a separate profit all centre. I am sure that BHP has these things in ing major mind.

As you are about to request, Mr Deputy Speaker, I bring myself back to the Bills. The Bills are designed to reduce a tax which was ish and wrong. It was misconceived in time and in terms of its effects. The veryfluctuationsof products mitigate and argue against was this kind of tax.

It has been foolish with respect to coal. With respect to sugar, it would have been just one step short of insanity. I suggest that this House should support, as it will, the assertion that taxes of that kind offend against decent principle of taxation and certainly not as a branch office countrynot should be applied to an export industry in a which is having continuing and great adequate exports to bring its current account into correct focus and correct the un Mr JACOBI (Hawker) (9.50)-I rise to oppose the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill 1977 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1977. I say to the honourable at member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) that one of most pressing issues that face this country at a national level is the crucial need to evaluate the control, the rate of exploitation and the of export of perhaps the two most imporwill tant hydrocarbons-coa l and natural gas. I think I the exploitation of both coal and natural gas, in particular, on the North West Shelf ought to be subject of an inquiry by a joint parliamentary committee. We ought to act upon that now. I suppose that 10 years ago it would have been possible to discuss the coal industry-that is what we are doing tonight-in isolation from other secof the mining industry. Today that is no longer possible because the coal industry is an integral part of the energy picture; it cannot be said that that divorced from it. very I have said previously that for a number of years prior to the estabUshment of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1973 energy companies had been diversifyinterests. One must examine this probthe reasons for it and the consequences in order to understand the present situation to the Australian coal industry and the export levy. We imposed the levy at the rate of $6 a tonne; in last year's Budget it was cut to $4.50 a tonne; this year it is reduced to $3.50 a tonne; and the Government is committed foolto abolishing it in next year's Budget. The Government says that the levy is misconceived. I ask the honourable member for LUley: What are the real facts behind this issue? I think we realise that the greatest advantage to be gained by companies, as I have said before, is to become monopolistic as far as the supply of raw so. materials is concerned. The control of raw materials bars new entry into the industry and allows monopolistic profits to be obtained. It economic sense, I suggest, that those companies must gain control over all energy sources if in fact they are to retain their monopolistic position. I thought that was rather self-evident. Mr Kevin Cairns-Monopolisti c in an export required industry?",63
128,Mr JACOBI,PAIRS,"Yes , because that is crucial, and that is what the ball game is all about. The necessity for the large oil corporations quickly to gain control of other energy sources was hastened by three major events. I suggest that the honourable member for Lilley cogitate on this. Firstly, oil company profits began to cline in the 1960s, partly due to increased petition. What was the competition at that stage? It consisted of independent companies. Secin ondly, the growth of environmental problems in the United States, Japan and Western Europe challenged the supremacy of oil so that oil was not in fact going to be the foremost source of encoal ergy. Trdrdly, there was the problem in North Africa and the Middle East, which one could refer to as nationalism. Fourthly, and most importantly, I think, was the awareness that oil supplies would fall behind demand in the last quarter of the century. That only hastened the large companies to move into alternative I suggest to the honourable member and I suggest to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) who is at the table that pened Australia's massive coal reserves are the present target for the large corporations. We have quantities watched that for the lastfiveyears. The Minister at the table is perhaps more aware of that than anybody else is, since he is a former New South Wales Minister for Mines. What amazes me in relation to this measure is that the large reputathat ble corporations throughout the world foresaw this problem five, six or ten years ago. They realised that coal would become the important energy source in the world energy predicated their policies on that basis. We failed to do so. In the last week the results of a number of studies on the world energy outlook have been published. What do those studies forecast in regard to the demand for fossil fuels? They clearly indicate that the demand for coal is expected to increase quickly after the middle 1980s. I suggest to the honourable member for oil Lilley that the people who made that forecast have done their homework; he has failed to do A good example of that sort of forecasting is to be found in the report of the World Energy Conference which was released only a week ago. is That could be coupled with the Cavendish Laboratory report. What do wefind?We find that coal will be required in industry both for direct use and for making synthetic fuels, which is what I have said on many occasions. Also it will be electricity to balance the nuclear component in generation. Those reports estimate that world coal demand in the year 2020 will be four to six times its present level. Does that indicate that there will be a decrease in coal prices? Do honourable members opposite believe that? In that situation, the move into coal by the large energy corporations is perfectly obvious. I have said before- I will repeat it-that there is a dedeliberate strategy towards monopolistic control comand that such control provides a number of benefits. We sought to structure that in advance 1974. The first benefit is that these corporations can make profits by driving up prices. As the price of other energy sources rose they would be able to maximise their profits. Secondly, as is a likely source of oil or gas in the future, it would give the companies marketing flexibility. I would have thought that that was obvious. That is one of the reasons for the large corporations making Australian coal their target at the present time. Thirdly, it would tend to guarantee the stability of the companies as far as coal and sources. uranium were concerned. If the honourable member is not aware of it, let me point out that what obviously has hapis that both in the United States and in this country there has been a cornering of the large of non-oil reserves. As I said before, we will be forced to follow these moves that have been made in the United States unless steps are taken immediately to prevent this country from losing control of its energy resources. I suggest such American words as 'divestiture' and 'anti-trust', which I can claim some credit for using in this House, will soon become household words in this country unless action is taken picture. They immediately. I suggest that the case against foreign monopolisation of Australia's coal industry is more than just nationalistic sentiment, ln the case of export prices of Australian coal, foreign ownership has tended to undermine the traditional bargaining tactics of the New South Wales coal companies which have usually co-operated in negotiating the best possible price. If any man in this chamber knows what that means it is the MinisWe ter at the table. At least when we were in govern-As ment we did what we could to rationalise the bargairiing position of Australian coal companies in their dealings with Japan. Even the huge repatriation of funds could be small comallowed pared with future pay-outs after the removal the coal levy. The honourable member for Lilley overlooked that point very conveniently. The case of the Utah company Ulustrates the hazards to Australia of foreign ownership of key energy resources. Why did not the honourable member teU the House that when Utah was first estabgrowing Ushed in this country there had to be a hue cry in Queensland before one cent of Australian equity was obtained in that company? If that pubUc outcry in Queensland had not occurred, there would not have been one cent of Australian equity in that company. In 1976 Utah sent back to the United States $90m; in the previous year it sent back $63m. This year it will be returning well over $ 100m General Electric. Utah hopes to export, as I understand the situation, twenty million tonnes of coal when Norwich Park comes on stream. The saving of the $6 a tonne coal levy will then be worth a massive $126m a year to Utah. Thatreserves, is what this means. Is the Government seriously suggesting that we have no right to devise mechanism by which the people get a fair return on their national asset? I have too much respect for the honourable member for LUley to say he does not consider that we should do somerequirements, thing about that. The rate and size of the transfer of funds Utah shareholders has increased since General Electric took over the assets of the company. The national latestfigurewhich is the result Utah Mining Company suggests that Utah is paying out 90 per cent of its net profits in dends which have jumped by 2,000 per cent interests since 1972. That company is already per cent on money invested. It is sitting on enough coal to more than maintain its coal export levels for 100 years. That is the minimum period. In spite of its huge profits, Utah's basic phUosophy is to undercut competition in coal sales. For example, its latest contracts with Japanese steel nulls set a price of between $47.20 and sUghtly less than $49.00 a tonne for differentthe types of coal. Two New South Wales South Coast producers, Bellambi and Kembla Coal and Coke, have recently negotiated prices of a tonne for sUghtly inferior coal. It is not surprisfore ing that local companies resent Utah's approach which amounts to contempt for Australia's side interests. There is no doubt about that. It is true. ought to reaUse that fact and acknowledge it. long as the monopoly and control in this country escalate it will exacerbate the situation. The situation has further deteriorated since foreign ownership bids by Esso and Shell were to proceed. I repeat that only three local of coal export ventures will not have significant levels of overseas ownership if the Conzinc RioTinto of Australia bid is also aUowed to proceed. I repeat what I said in the House previously. The Japanese steel mUls, Australia s largest customers, have also voiced their concern at the foreign ownership of Australian coal and reserves. They know what will happen if it reaches the same proportion as it has in the United States and Canada. At least those countries have some foresight. We have very Uttle. There are considerable disadvantages in Australia allowing its coal reserves to be dominated by foreign interests. This situation is being actively encouraged by this Government's to pohcy, including its reduction of the coal levy. I have stated before and I forcefully repeat that the present Australian Government and particularly the Queensland Government have faUed to recognise the real worth of our coal especially from the viewpoint of large corporations. Unless the Australian Government a quickly comes to the realisation that our coal reserves are among the world's significant energy sources and unless it prepares a national that policy for Australia's domestic energy the wealth of our natural resources will be of litde consequence to this country's to needs both at a national and international level. We will have written off our options. If the Government faUs to regulate the use of of this levy on the least this and minerals energy in the national interest-at is what it is doing with this levy-mul divitinational corporations will use them in the of their world wide, vertical and horimaking 36 zontal conglomerate structures. Already in Canada and in the United States foreign investment in oU and gas has reached 90 per cent. Let us have a look at the level of foreign ownership. Twenty of the biggest oU companies control 94 per cent of the United States oU the reserves. Eighteen of the largest oU companies produce 60 per cent of the natural gas. Sixteen of 18 companies own oU shale reserves. Eleven companies own huge coal reserves. Sixteen have bought into uranium. I have repeatedly asked $52 the Government and the people to recognise beit is too late-regrettabl y I think it is-that while wefiddleto try to balance the petty cash of the national balance sheet, and at least this is one constructive attempt to do that, large energy conglomerates have deciphered the combination to the national bank vault; that our rich national resources. That combination consists of a number of complex sequences which involve the rate of exploration, the level ploitation, the degree of ownership and control and the volume of exports. Mr Kevin Cairns-As well as diversifying the markets.",64
129,Mr JACOBI,PAIRS,"On that combination rests in small measure this country's continued economic standard and the continuity of people's wealth and their standards of living. Whatever may said by the honourable member for Lilley, country's future progress will be determined how it evaluates and exploits its resources. is no question in my mind of what the election 1975 was about. The machinations over the last 18 months have only confirmed that. What has far enough. happened and what has continued to escalate over the last 6 months have put it beyond any doubt at all. This Government's policy, this action and this commitment to eliminate a levy which is one mechanism by which people can at least capitalise on the exploitation of what is, fact, their asset can only escalate and strengthen the already high degree of foreign monopoly over this most important national and natural resource. If honourable members want confirmation of that they should look at the penetration by panies such as Shell, Esso and British Petroleum. An odd statement was made in the House the other day by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) welcoming foreign governments which formulate subsidiaries to come in and take up mining leases in this country. He applauds that but then condemns any government in this country, national or State, which seeks to do exactly the same thing. Ifindthat odd, to say least. I warn the Government now that it should take action urgently on two crucial issues-th level of control of coal reserves and the control exploitation of natural gas deposits. These issues ought to be the subject of a joint parliamentary committee of inquiry. They ought to be acted sought. upon now. I oppose the measure.",66
130,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS," I rise to support the Bills. In this cognate debate I the start. intend to devote most ofmy attention to toms Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill. During the course of this debate certain speakers have indicated the extent of the levy, why it was introduced, its importance and what it was intended to do. I enter into the argument by ing a little of the history not only of the levy also of the more recent coal developments in the is central Queensland area in the Bowen Basin. A new technique has been developed, quite different from what has happened in the past. It of exdoes not involve underground mining. It involves the stripping and the open mining of the coal reserve. Let us go back just two years to when the introduction of the levy was effected in 1975 Budget by the then Treasurer, Mr Hayden. It is interesting to note that at the same no time the Medibank scheme was introduced as probably one of the great socialistic platforms of that Government. There is no doubt in my mind be that the levy was intended partly to offset the this projected cost of the Medibank scheme. Of on course we know that the escalation of the cost of There that scheme would have put us into hock for in many years.. The present Government has altered the system but probably has not taken it The fact is that those measures were introduced at the sametimeand, irrespective of what is now claimed about controls of reserves and of the resource itself, I believe that this was a platform of the former socialist Government and in that the commodity tax, or as I call it, a resources tax on the coal was just meant to offset it. We have heard tonight that ten years ago was the time to act. If we go back ten years we can practically see the commencement of the coal development in the central Queensland area. For over 30 comyears those reserves have been known to exist. They have been used only once on a very limited scale. There was no Australian capital, no Australian company or no Australian individual interested in outlaying the risk capital to establish the nature and extent of the reserves. It was only the multinational company, Utah Development Co., at which much criticism has been levelled, that was prepared to come in. It the was said that, after a hue and cry, Australian equity was allowed. Again there was no Ause tralian equity available when the exploration of was commenced. It was only at the development stage when reserves were proven and the markets were known that Australian capital could be Mr MCVeigh-The unions want a cut out of it now. They did not have enough guts to get in at the Cus Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE- I am not talking so much about the unions, although there is a problem in that area now. The fact is that the basic Australian investor was not prepared to take the risk at that time.The central Queensland coal givfields have been known to exist. The new mining but technique which is being used is greatly sought after not only throughout Australia but also throughout the world - today. If we look at Queensland's participation in this project we see that the State has control over the reserves. It has let out those reserves only a bit at a time in comparison to the total extent of them. At all times the State has had control. There was a hue and cry about rail freights but do we hear about that now? The rail freights on some of the later negotiations are as much as $4 to $5 per tonne. The royalties have increased. Yet we are told that it is Utah that is taking the money out of the place. Let us look at that statement and let us talk in terms of profit. In the latest report of the company, for 1976, we see that the profit is $l37m. Certainly that is the profit in which there will be a 20 per cent participation by Australians once Norwich Park comes on stream. It is interesting to note the difference between the 1975 and 1976 reports. The sales increased by $185m but the profit increased by only $36m. If we look at the schedules in the report we find that despite a profit of $137m, $258m was left in Australia through direct income taxes, levies, freight and royalties. So who says that Australians are not participating? Mr Carige-Plus all the salaries that have agement while been paid.",66
131,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,PAIRS,"That is not including the salaries and wages of the men on the field and the taxes that they have paid. In an area probably ran half a dozen head of cattle before, we have assets that comprise two townships with populations of over 7,000, port facilities that could be used in the event of any other expansion in trade, and the rail connections to the hintercoal. land of very productive country. The former honourable member for Dawson indicated that terms that area, which is now tapped by this railway, has perhaps as great a potential for agriculture any of the plains in America. That is the result what Utah has done. Utah has opened up the country. If it had been left to Australian pation that coal would still be buried under the soil and the country would be carrying one head of cattle to 100 acres. That is what Utah has done, yet we do not hear this from the took Opposiuon. Honourable members opposite have also Party neglected to say that, once the levy has been removed progressively, the Australian particichance pation will still be to the extent of 46 per cent the tax that will be levied on it. So at least it a complete loss to revenue if we are to recover per cent of it. I do not believe that this is opoly control of our resources, although I agree with the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) that we should be very concerned about future energy supplies within this country and how we fit into the slot of world participation in energy conservation. I agree with that. We have talked of large monopolies or large companies. The type of mining that is done within Queensland at the moment cannot be done by small companies. It is only the vastness of the operation that provides a profitable return. If we think in terms of a profit of $ 137m for the capital investment of thosefields,I believe that Norwich Park is coming on stream only to keep faith with the Queensland Government and the Australian Government. Taking into account the infrastructure and the rail and port facilities, one would doubt at present operating costs and writing off the asset over the period of the lease whether it would return any profit at all to Utah. So Utah is participating in more ways than one. It is showing faith for the future. But let us forget about Utah for the moment. Let us look at the chance of any fresh developments of those mines by companies large or small. The margin of $6 per tonne levy was in many cases the difference per tonne between an operating profit and a loss. There was no encourthat levy existed. There was no intention to remove it. There was no faith and no initiative by any other company to take it up. Now I believe that there are other reserves there that that will be taken up predominantly by Australian capital. The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, CSR Ltd and a lot of other companies are interested. I hope that, whatever arrangements they make for equity holding, they can go ahead and mine this We are not talking in terms of reserves of very short lived quantities. We are talking in of reserves that have not yet been fully established. We are talking in terms of a comas modity that is badly needed overseas and that of certainly helps in our export arrangements. For instance, $56lm was generated just through particiUtah last year from these coal reserves. Of course, we get back to the fact that Utah has proven a success in spite of the initialriskit with the Labor Government that wanted to have some part of the action. I think it is fair to cite an attitude that prevailed within the Labor at that time. It has been suggested that a socialist is an unsuccessful person whose last is to get a share of what somebody else of has. If ever there was a grasp by the socialist is not Government it was to get the money from the 46 levy and to generate those additional funds for a monwhat was said to be for Australians but which was only to implement the Medibank scheme. A former speaker made a comment about the estimated issues in the 1975 election. I believe that the was partly responsible for the result of that tion. If it could be applied to coal it could plied to any other industry that had a success record on the export market, even if only for time or for a windfall profit. We saw the export levy imposed on beef at a time of great prostralian perity but it was not taken off by the Government when that prosperity declined. The fear was that the levy could have applied to wheat and sugar. We have already seen the proI fitability of coal per tonne decrease and there was no suggestion that the commodity tax, or call it the resources tax, would have reduced. A previous speaker has also referred to the union problem. Certainly there are problems with the Seamen's Union of Australia. I do not think that I can add anything more to what said before. In respect of the total argument, who is to determine what is a fair equity as far as tralian participation is concerned? What is fair Australians as far as the tax, the return and the development are concerned? Who is going to do it? I believe that only the multinational comis panies like Utah and certainly some of the big Australian companies will do it. But they will do it only with the incentive of the removal of tax. I certainly support the Bill.",67
132,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,"The levy honourable member for Dawson (Mr centres alone. Braithwaite) said that a socialist was someone who wants a share of what someone else has. seems to me that another way of putting this proposition is to say that a socialist is someone who wants a share for the people from the Professor exploitation of the people's resources. This is argument that the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) sensibly put forward this evening. In my view he put a very reasoned rational case. He pointed out that, in this view, the Labor Government in its enthusiasm for the objective that I have stated imposed a tax which might have been indiscriminate to some degree in that it disregarded profitability and fell even handedness over the entire coal mining industry. He put the proposition that the Governday. ment should try to redress this situation and should impose a tax or levy which has more rationale behind it. The fact of the matter is that when this was introducted by the Labor Government it was designed to yield something Uke $U2m. Last year, even though the Government reduced the actual amount of levy, the yield was I think approxiamtely $121m. Even this year the yield is about $90m, despite the fact levy that it is the Government's declared intention to elecreduce the duty from $4.50 a tonne to $3 a tonne be apfor high quaUty coking coal and from $1.50 a tonne to $ 1 a tonne for other coking coal. If this a levy had been going full blast it could have yielded some $200m for the coffers of the AusGovernment for purposes associated with Labor the needs of the Australian community. I think it is fair to speculate about the purposes to which such an amount of money could be put. refer to the $90m that will be derived this year or the $200m which could have been derived if as I the levy had not been reduced. Let me tell been honourable members opposite, as one who comes from a coal mining area and as one who represents half of the great city of Wollongong, that that city Uke the city of Newcastle is wreaking with deprivation in respect of aU public serwas vices. The raUway systems are antiquated. The services associated with the coal industry itself Aus-need massive upgrading. There is need in Newto casde and Wollongong for improved coal loading facilities. There is a need for better roads to carry the coal trucks to transport the coal. There a need to electrify the South Coast raUway system. There is a need to get the coal trucks off the roads. There is a need to upgrade miners' superthis annuation. One could spend a long time enunciating the purposes to which the proceeds of this could be put in respect of the coal producing The fact of the matter is, of course, that there Itare many other needs to which the proceeds could be put. Let me mention, for example, the objective of converting coal to oU. I know that Wen of the University of West Virginia the stated in the Monash seminar recently that coal could probably to converted for $25 to $35 a barrel. I know that is expensive. It is something and Uke three times the current Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries price. But there is no doubt that there is a need for some sort of start to be made in this regard. At the same seminar a senior projects officer of Shell suggested with that a conversion plant costing $4,000m could produce between 50,000 and 100,000 barrels a There are many people who say that this fossU resource, Umited as it is in deposit form, should not be burnt since it has so many other meritorious properties. levy In the shontimeavailable to me in this debate, I wish to make some mention of Utah and other companies which are overseas controlled and which are moving into this great bonanza area. We have talked about a tax on uranium. One wonders why the Government does not have the same kind of enthusiasm for a tax on coal. The honourable member for Dawson, the previous speaker in this debate, referred extensively to Utah. This company is only 10 per cent Australian owned. It is certainly the largest coal producer in Australia. It employs only about 2,700 people. This is not a large number when one looks at Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, for example, which employs something like 60,000 people. Its profit has increased 2,000 per cent since 1972. Last year its net profit was no less than $137m and of that amount $91m was repatriated to the United States of America. Members of the National Country Party seem to be proud that these rip-offs are being allowed to occur , in Australia. This reduction of $1.50 a tonne in the coal levy in the 1976 Budget means an additional $25m which is to be repatriated overseas and the further reduction plus the increase in production this year means that next year's profits will reach $ 180m. I have been speaking cursorily about the Utah situation. But one can run through the whole scene and see the extent to which overseas oil companies especially are moving into the coal industry in Australia. The Shell company has been involved on a very large scale indeed with 37 per cent of Austen and Butta Pty Ltd plus unsecured loans up to $20m. Shell has 16.6 per cent in Theiss Industries. Also it has 49 per in a joint venture with Theiss in Drayton Deposit, New South Wales. It has a 22 per cent holding in Theiss-Peabody-Mitsui which owns the Moura and Nebo deposits. The Wakworth Miriing Pty Ltd operates parts of the Singleton lease. We find that this company is made up of the Costain organisation from Great Britain which holds 30 per cent ownership, the H. G. Sleigh company which owns 45 per cent, and the Mitsubishi Development combine which owns 15 per cent. Honourable members opposite will be gratified to hear that Australia through the T and G Insurance Company appears to have a 10 per cent equity in Wakworth Miriing. The philosophy of the National Country Party seems to be one of crumbs from the rich man's table- a ruthless rotten sell-out. Members of the National Country Party are acquiescing in this mealy-mouthed proposal which will deny the Australian people $200m in earnings. One can go to any dubious part of the world-to the Middle East or to Asia-and one will not find people selling their country out as cheaply and as recklessly as members of the National Country Party and of the Liberal Party and prepared to do in respect of our great coal deposits. Australia has massive reserves of coal. Let me mention, if I may, one area of very great potential so far as coal exploitation is concerned. My colleague, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), would be able to give further startlingfiguresin this regard if he was given the opportunity to speak tonight on this Bill. I will mention something of the potential of the Singleton coal deposits. It is to this effect: The Hunter Valley deposits containDebate interrupted. NA",68

Mr Macphee- I require that the question be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. CUSTOMS TARIFF (COAL EXPORT DUTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed.",69
134,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT," I was saying that there has been a survey of the cent Singleton coal deposits. The preliminary estimate of in situ reserves is that there are 45,000 million tonnes of coal of which 15,000 million tonnes has a cover of less than 200 metres and therefore has the potential of being mined by open cut methods, as the honourable member for Hunter points out. These deposits contain one of the largest and most accessible and concentrated resources in Australia. The resources are remarkable, even by world standards. By comparison, the Newcastle coal deposits can boast six or eight major seams that can be worked concurrently in any one area. The Hunter Valley deposits contain as many as 36 major seams in a given vertical succession capable of one open pit operation. A single 12-mile lease in the upper Hunter Valley exceeds, in money-in-ground terms, the whole of the famous Rhodesian copper belt. It is equivalent to more than ten times the value of the Bougainville copper mine. It represents ten times the revenue from the Alligator Rivers province if all the seams are worked and sold. It is worth about one-third of the value of all the oil remaining in Saudi Arabia. In energy equivalent terms the upper Hunter Valley resource alone is ten times as large as all known resources of oil and gas, both on-shore and off-shore. Mr MACKenzie-That is in the electorate of Paterson, is it not?",69
135,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Well, it is I am pointing out, particularly to members of the National Country Party, that Australia happens to be in a very privileged and advantageous situMinister. ation. It is generously endowed with these great resources. It is important that this Government, and indeed any government of the future, look these resources objectively with a view to ensuring that the maximum possible benefit is derived from them for the people of Australia. If we at world resources we see that coal represents 150 years of energy consumption at the current world level. Australia's coal reserves will last years at the present rate of consumption. It was put by the honourable member for Blaxland when discussing this legislation that it is designed to deprive the Australian taxpayers Speakerof something like $90m. That is the sum which would have been received in revenue this year except for the passage of this legislation. I put it to honourable members on the that this legislation is a development which can only be regarded as undesirable.

NA Alleged Misappropriation of Company Funds-Petro l Price Equalisation Motion (by Mr Macphee) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Mr E. G. Whitlam (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition) (10.45)-This afternoon the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) asked me to withdraw some remarks I made about him. I then asked: 'Can I give the facts?' He said: ' I would be happy if you did.' I said: ' I will do it on the adjournment.' The facts come from the financial accounts of two companies, the first being Allan Walsh (Hornsby) Pty Ltd. The accounts are signed firstly by Ian Sinclair, as director, and one other making a certificate under section 162 subsection 10 of the Companies Act of New South Wales and also by Ian Sinclair as Martin, V.J. the principal accounting officer giving a certificate under secuon 162 subsection 12 of the Uren,T. Whitlam, Antony same Act. The second certificate states that subject to the notes attached to the financial accounts they are to the best of his knowledge and belief accurate. I quote in particular note No. 5 which, under the heading 'Losses by misappropriation', states: Following an examination of the company's records for Fry, K. L. the year ended 30 June 1972 it has been ascertained that certain payments made during the year were paid without the knowledge or approval of the directors either directly or indirectly to orforthe benefit of a person employed by the company. The aggregated amount of these payments for the year ended 30 June 1972 was $39,708.25. The financial accounts, similarly signed by Ian Sinclair, for the year ended 30 June 1973 have the same note No. 5 headed 'Losses by misappropriation', and the last sentence of that note is: The aggregated amount of these payments for the year Third Reading ended 30 June 1973 was $60,502.92. The financial accounts for the year ended 30 June 1974 also have the same note No. 5 under the heading 'Losses by misappropriation', the aggregated amount for that year being $27,402.82. Thefinancialaccounts for the year ended 30 June 1975 have the same note No. 5 1977 under the heading 'Losses by misappropriation' and the aggregated amount for that year was $47,876.20. Thefinancialaccounts for the year ended 30 June 1976 have a note No. 4 with the heading 'Losses by misappropriation' and for Third Reading that year the aggregated amount was $18,285.41. Secondly, I quote from thefinancialaccounts of Allan Walsh Pty Ltd. There too there are two certificates by Ian Sinclair as sole director and as principal accounting officer and attached to those accounts is also a note No. 5 under the heading 'Losses by misappropriation' in the same terms except that the aggregated amount for the year ended 30 June 1973 was $35,015.73. Thefinancialaccounts for the same company for the year ended 30 June 1974 have a note No. 5 headed 'Losses by misappropriation' giving the amount of $18,959.10. Thefinancialaccounts of the same company for the year ended 30 June 1975 also have a note No. 5 under the heading 'Losses by misappropriation' giving an amount of $17,281.28 for that year. Sir, it is for those reasons, for those amounts which I have given, that I stated that the Leader of the House had been responsible for companies which had total misappropriations of a quarter of a million dollars.",70

152,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,"The Leader of the Oppoexplained sition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) is obviously in a very grievous plight. He is concerned about his integrity and about the leadership of his Party. am quite sure that it could be only in those cumstances and on that premise that he has resorted to publishing tonight accounts which have already been lodged with the Corporate Affairs Commission in New South Although the company is a proprietary company; although the matter is entirely personal; although the circumstances are such that the term 'misappropriation' has already been explained in public, it is also of interest that night the Leader of the Opposition very carefully avoided the words he used his morning. that I was an officer of a company which had misappropriated amounts to a certain This morning he alleged that I, in some way, had been responsible. I assure him and members of the House that I am not responsible. In no way have I been involved as he impugned this member morning. As it happens, my father was a chartered accountant who was, at a time, an auditor of companies. The accounts did fall I have pubUcly, in front of television, the situation to the Australian people whose credibility I prefer to that of the Leader of Opposition. I have explained that as the accounts were out of date there were, therefore, some amounts which could not initially be identified. have said in pubUc that those accounts have been identified in that way. I add that this affair clusively the business of the shareholders companies, not of the Leader of the Opposition, not of the people of Australia. It is a proprietary company. There are three famUies involved. The honourable gentleman seeks to impugn against me and, as a result, against the Government, an integrity which is of the order of his own. Fortunately the manner and behaviour of a people on this side of the House does not stoop that low. In fact, the circumstances of this company are such that each member of the company has discussed the whole of the circumstances. It because we felt it was desirable that the accounts be identified in this way-ther e are a number of elements which were uncertain-that the accounts were lodged exactly in that form. I believe that this attack by a man who holds himself as an alternative Prime Minister is about as low as any individual can hope to go m the House. I am quite prepared to accept responfor those statements which I signed. As, one for thetimebeing, I am executor of my father's estate. I have little alternative but to exercise the responsibility that that places on me. As I have to the other shareholders, I am quite prepared to accept the responsibUity within that own famUy group and I will exercise that responsiI bUity. It is not sometliing of which I am m any cirway ashamed. I only hope that the honourable gentleman, were he to find himself in simUar circumstances; would be prepared to stand up in the same way. I rather doubt that he would be Wales. man enough to do so. Mr Katter- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of clarification. I seek your guidance. Was the honourable member for Oxley in order in toembarrassing a senior Hansard official by going over and whispering something to him a little He said earUer in the evening?",72

155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)the Order! The honourable member for Oxley will out of date, and resume his seat. explained Mr THOMSON (Leichhardt) (10.55)-In the last few weeks two very important policy the statements have been made in this House. The first one, which was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 7 September, said that I rural industries should be compensated for the cost of high protection afforded to manufacturis exing industry. The second one, which was made of the by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) on 22 September, said that people in remote and isolated areas have particular problems which are different from those of people in other parts of the continent and that in order to ensure that there is no critical disadvantage in this situation the Government is examining those government imposts which prejudice people in isolated areas to see whether they can be adjusted to bring those people into more relative equality with the position of people in urban Australia. The recent rise in fuel prices, with which I in full agreement, has placed the people in quarter isolated areas in a very difficult position. I quote some prices. Last week the price of super grade petrol was 19c a litre. price in Sydney was 14.5c a litre. The price of petrol in Burketown, which is in my electorate, was 29c a litre-twice the price of the discounted petrol in Sydney. This discount petrol is paid by the sweat of people in isolated areas. In my electorate there is no alternative means of transport other than that which uses petrol diesel fuel. We do not have railways, except for the very few miles of railway line in the southa eastern corner. The roads are bad. Everytriing must go in an out by vehicle. Fuel price rises mean that all prices rise in the whole area. ing the wet season much of the area is cut off five months. One can imagine the cost of stockingdeficit up on all commodities for that period. In 1965 a petroleum products subsidy scheme was introduced. It was abolished by the Labor Government in August 1974 in one of the many that actions that it took to disadvantage people in rural areas. Mr Mc Veigh-By whom was it abolished? Mr THOMSONThe Labor Government, equalisation scheme. whose members were responsible for the disgraceful affair that occurred just before to speak. We said when we came into power there should be justice for all. It is not justice all that people in Sydney should be able to petrol for 14.5c a litre and should have to pay 29c a litre for it. I believe that something should be done about that. I recommend that the petroleum products subsidy scheme, which is still on the statute book, be used. I believe that we should raise a small tax on petrol and distillate to help to pay for the price differential. I am informed that a tax of half a am cent a litre would raise $100m a year. A tax of a of a cent a litre would raise $50m a year. shall This amount could be used to reduce the price differential in the isolated inland areas of The lowest discount Australia. The previous scheme did not completely equalise petrol prices. Prices varied from befor tween 3.3c and 5c a gallon in those days. I believe that nowhere in Australia should the price of petrol and distillate be more than lc a litre or above the city prices. This would cost about $50m a year, which would be covered by a tax of quarter of a cent a litre. There is no public transport in my electorate, except for a very short length of railway track, but it is interesting to Durnote that buses and trams in the cities of for Australia are covered by the taxpayers for a each year of $90m. The deficits of the railways of Australia are $500m a year. I make a plea for understanding and justice for rural Australians. I tliink it is essential that those areas which have no alternative transport be helped so they do not coUapse under fuel price rises. If we are to pay more than Up service to decentraUsation we must do sometliing about this matter. I appeal to all the city members of parUament, whose electorates have so much when the people in my electorate have so Uttle, to support a fuel I began Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)thatOrder!

House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Aborigines: International Labour Organisation Statistics Convention No. 65-Pena l Sanctions (Indigenous) Workers, 1939 Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for ployment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 24 May 1977: (1) Do any State or Territory laws and practices touching Aborigines not yet comply with the requirements of International Labour Organisation Convention No. 65-Pena l Sanctions (Indigenous Workers), 1939. (2) If so, which laws and practices, in which States and/or 1974-75 Territories, do not yet comply. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) My Department instituted, in April review of ILO Convention No. 65-Pena l Sanctions (Indigenous Workers), 1939, in accordance with Commonwealth/State arrangements for the periodic examination of compliance with by Australia. I am advised that the review revealed the existence of a number of provisions in Federal and State legislation which were inconsistent with the Convention. These were as follows: NA Australian Capital Territory Apprenticeship Ordinance 1936-1968. Masters' and Servants' Act 1902, as amended. (NSW legislation). Northern Territory Apprentices'Ordinance 1948-1957. New South Wales Masters' and Servants' Act 1902, as amended. Apprentices'Act 1969, as amended. Queensland Apprenticeship Act 1964-73. Trading Bank Loans Mr Bradfield asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 June 1977: Will he provide the lending statistics of major trading banks in Australia in respect of (a) total 'personal loans', (b) total newly approved overdrafts below $100,000, (c) total increase in approved overdrafts from below $100,000 to in excess of $100,000, (d) total new overdraft approvals over $100,000, (e) total reductions in overdraft limits below $100,000, (f) total reductions in overdrafts from above $100,000 to below $100,000 and (g) total reductions in overdrafts below $100,000 for each of the years 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA upon notice were circulated: are not available to enable precise answers to all the questions asked by the honourable member to be provided. However, the available information is set out below. All figures relate to the seven major trading banks. (Question No. 874) (a) Total 'personal loans'.

(2) Have there been any instances where funds provided to the Queensland Government under section 96 of the constitution have not been spent by that Government and have had to be refunded to the Commonwealth Government; if so, will he supply details of the projects affected and the amounts involved. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Total grants to the Queensland Government provided from the Commonwealth budget since 1972 have been as follows: 1972-73-$460.2m. 1973-74-$581.8m. 1974-75-$856.7m. 1975-76-51,132.6m. 1976-77-$ 1,288.7m. 1977-78-$ 1,451.9m (estimate). For funher details of funds (including loans as well as grants) provided by the Commonwealth to the Queensland Government I refer the honourable member to the Budget document 'Payments to or for the States and ment Authorities', or its equivalent, 1972-73 to 1977-78. Summaries are provided in tables and 133 in the 1976-77 and 1977-78 editions of the docu2275) ment, respectively. (2) In answering this part tinguish between general purpose payments and specific purpose payments. General purpose payments to the States (for example, the States' income tax-snaring entitlements) are the States as they seefit.The question of any repayments to the Commonwealth because of short-falls in State spending therefore does not arise in the case of such payments. In the case of specific purpose payments, payments to the States are administered in such a way that they be neither significantly in advance nor significantly in pate arrears of the State expenditures to which they relate. foreshadow Repayments by the States to the Commonwealth are not, take in the light therefore, a common occurrence. Payments and expenditures are monitored closely as they occur and any overpayments which may be made are recovered as they are identified, payments in later periods. No special tabulation is maintained in the central accounting records of the Department of Finance of amounts paid to States and not spent by them, or of therecoveryaction undertaken. It is standard that the net amounts paid to each State are verified by Auditors-General as having been spent by the States for purposes laid down, and in the manner specified in the terms and conditions attached to the Government payment. As details of overpayments and recoveries are not recorded separately, extensive extraction of data documents held by departments responsible for each particular project or program would be required to provide the information sought by the honourable member. This work would be expected to show that there have instances of over-payments to Queenlsand and that those that have occurred have generally been small and promptly corrected. In these circumstances I have not asked officers undertake the considerable work that would be required to rovide a more detailed response to the honourable memthat er's quesuon on all programs of assistance to Queensland; suggest that if he has particular programs in mind he proach the responsible Minister for relevant information. Electoral Division of Petrie: Commonwealth Mr Hodges asked the Treasurer, upon notice, examinationreferredto on 16 August 1977: (1) What Federal Government funds have been spent in the electoral division of Petrie in each year since 1972. (2) On what projects were these funds spent. Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The accounting records of Commonwealth departments are not designed to record or apportion expenditure in terms of amounts spent within individual electorates. Accordingly Iregretthat it is not possible to provide the details sought inrespectof the electoral division of Petrie. Health Insurance Organisations: Election of Directors (Question No. 1102) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, Local Governupon notice, on 16 August 1977: for each of the years 136 (1) Did he assure me on 20 May 1976 (Hansard, page that he would consider introducing legislation to ensure to contributors of health insurance funds a democraticrightto elect managing boards. of the question it is useful to dis(2) If so, when will he (a) announce his decision and (b) introduce legislation to give effect to his assurance.",72

Agricultural Tractors Bounty Book Bounty Other Bounty Payments Export Incentive Grants and Payroll Tax Rebates . . Export Development Grants Structural Adj ustment Assistance General Administration Total Total Manufacturing Industries Agricultural and Pastoral IndustriesSpecific IndustriesWool IndustryWool Marketing Assistance Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Commonwealth assists industry through a variety of measures, including direct financial assistance, tax(Question No. 1248) ation concessions, guaranteed home price arrangements, financial guarantees and the customs tanff. Direct industry assistance takes the form of bounties and subsidies, reconstruction and adjustment schemes, contributions to research and promotion programs, price support and other payments to or for the benefit of industry. It includes also some outlays by Government departments and instrumentalities (e.g. Depanment of Overseas Trade, Depanment of Industry and Commerce and Department of Primary Industry) which provide many services either free of charge or for charges which do not recover fully the costs incurred. The detailed table below shows net outlays on direct assistance from the Budget to manufacturing industry and agricultural and pastoral industries (i.e. after deducting amounts collected by way of industry levies and charges and repayments of loans). The table does not include direct assistance, such as export and trade promotion, which is not specific to either manufacturing industry or agricultural and pastoral industries. It will be noted that the annual totals for agricultural and pastoral industries are strongly influenced by the amounts of net advances or repayments in respect of Assistance wool marketing assistance; the significance of this factor can be seen from the following summary: (Question No. 1254) Direct Assistance to Agricultural and Pastoral Industries Wool marketing Other assistance assistance Total of direct financial assist$m $m $m 1974-75 . . 289.0 158.1 447.1 1975-76 . . 31.0Cr 194.8 163.8 1976-77 . . 145.0Cr 191.0 46.0 1977-78 (est.) 100.0Cr 227.8 127.8 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Actual Actual Actual Estimate $m $m $m $m 31.2 43.0 29.0 12.7 17.9 19.3 15.4 14.0 4.4 3.6 4.9 5.0 1.7 1.6 2.4 2.5 5.9 6.7 8.0 7.0 3.9 1.4 0.3 1.1 93.2 62.8 1.0 1.5 17.1 24.1 30.0 5.3 1.1 0.6 0.1 1.3 2.3 1.3 0.6 3.0 10.4 6.8 6.6 167.8 169.5 93.8 81.1 1.4Cr 1.3Cr 1.5Cr 0.4Cr 166.4 168.2 92.3 80.7 324.2 49.0 61.7 59.5 Total Wool Marketing Assistance Research Promotion and Other Expenditures Wheat IndustryTotal Dairy IndustryPrice Support for Dairy Products Research, Promotion and Other Expenditures Total Fruit IndustryFruitgrowing Industry Reconstruction Research, Promotion and other Expenditures Total Poultry IndustryTotal Cattle, Sheep and Pig Meat IndustryEradication of Cattle Diseases and Compensation Research Promotion and Other Expenditures Total Total Specific Agricultural and Pastoral Industries Expenditures not allocated to toral IndustriesAdvance to Commonwealth Development Bank for Rural Rural Reconstruction/Adjustment 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 Actual Actual Actual Estimate $m $m $m $m 35.2Cr 43.5Ct 61.7Ci 59.5Ci 36.5Cr 145.0Cr 100.0Cr 289.0 31.0Cr 145.0Cr 100.0Cr . . . 44.6 45.0 58.0 62.3 29.4Cr 28.3Cr 33.0Cr 35.9Cr 304.2 14.3Cr 120.0Cr 73.6Cr 41.1 37.6 2.2 2.4 3.9 1.6 40.2Cr 1.7Cr 61.7Cr 31.6Cr 38.0Cr 0.7 16.7Cr 7.6 8.9 18.7 6.3 1.4 50.0 9.0 1.3 6.5 . . . . 3.1 2.7 3.5 4.2 2.2Cr 2.6Cr 4.8Cr 55.4Cr 18.8 20.0 5.1 6.6 5.4 3.9 4.5 5.2 0.7 0.1 2.5 1.1 0.4 1.2 1.3 1.2 1.7 1.5 1.9 . . . . 1.8Cr 1.3Cr 1.5Cr 3.1Cr 5.8 7.1 6.3 5.4 13.2 11.9 12.0 11.2 13.0Cr 11.5Cr 11.6Cr 10.9Cr 0.2 0.4 0.4 0.3 . . 7.4 9.3 6.7 11.2 17.9 20.6 25.4 28.0 11.3 3.5 . . . . 7.9 9.7 9.5 11.0 22.7Cr 27.1Cr 8.6Cr 9.9Cr 10.5 23.8 36.4 40.3 2.3 2.6 2.4 2.9 3.8Cr 4.2Cr 4.2Cr 4.7Cr 299.9 36.2 90.2Cr 15.2Cr specific Agricultural and Pas20.0 8.0 28.8 30.0 29.5 51.5 43.5 33.2 53.9 52.0 3.2 3.7 4.5 5.0 Agricultural Extension and Research Territories-Agricultura l Services and Projects Less Recoveries and Repayments Total Irrigation and other Pastoral Water ProjectsIrrigation Projects Investigations and other Pastoral Water Projects Flood Mitigation Less Repayments Total Land Development ProjectsSoil Conservation War Service Land Settlement Other Less Repayments Total General Administrative and Other Expenditure Less Recoveries Total Agricultural and Pastoral Industries . . . .

(2) What has been the rate of growth of the work force employed in those industries since 1968. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There were 39 Australian Standard Industry Classification groups in the manufacturing sector receiving protection in 1974-75. The 11 groups in the quartile of highest nominal rates are as follows: 219 Total beverages and malt 221 Tobacco products 241 Total knitting mills 242 Total clothing 243 Total footwear 272 Total other chemical and related products 311 Total fabricated structural metal products 312 Total sheet metal products 313 Total other fabricated metal products 321 Total motor vehicles and parts 322 Total other transport equipment.

(2) Who is its Field Staff Head. (3) How many agents has the Bureau permanently engaged in (a) Australia and (b) overseas. (4) What has been the cost to revenue of sums paid out to agents in the years 1974-75 to 1976-77 for information relating to the suppression of the illicit drug trade or possession of effective rates are as illegal drugs. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It has not been the practice to publicly disclose the actual number or details of persons employed in the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. The Bureau has staff stationed in each of the capital cities of Australia whose task is to co-ordinate investigations into the import, expon and trafficking in illegally imported drugs. It can and does draw upon other large numbers of investigative and law enforcement staff employed elsewhere in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs at such places as airports, wharves, etc., to assist in investigations. The regional forces are under the control of a Northern Regional Commander, responsible for the overall coordination of operations in New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory and a Southern Regional Commander, responsible for co-ordinating Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. One narcotics liaison officer is stationed overseas and it is shortly proposed to station another officer overseas. In addition staff in other overseas posts manned by the Department assist in gathering drug intelligence for use by the Narcotics Bureau. In common with other law enforcement agencies monies are paid by the Narcotics Bureau for information relating to the suppression of the illegal the practice to provide details of these payments. Apartheid in South Africa Mr Garrick asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 25 August 1977: (1) While speaking at the Commonwealth Conference on 9 June 1977 in London, did he denounce the treatment of black people in Southern Africa as an offence to human decency and a scourge to the dignity of man. (2) Did he also say that what happens in Africa affects all.
