1,Mr HUNT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Leader of the House, I move: (1) that this House establish a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation, to inquire and report on the following matters: (a) best practice approaches to regional development, considering Australian and international examples, that support: (i) growing and sustaining the rural and regional population base; (ii) the benefits of economic growth and opportunity being shared right across Australia; (iii) developing the capabilities of regional Australians; (iv) growing and diversifying of the regional economic and employment base; (v) an improved quality of life for regional Australians; (vi) vibrant, more cohesive and engaged regional communities; (vii) leveraging long-term private investment; and (viii) a place-based approach that considers local circumstances, competitive advantages and involves collective governance; (b) decentralisation of Commonwealth entities or functions, as a mechanism to increase growth and prosperity in regional areas, considering Australian and international examples, including: (i) examining the potential for decentralisation to improve governance and service delivery for all Australians, considering the administrative arrangements required for good government; (ii) identifying the characteristics of entities that would be suited to decentralisation without impacting on the ability to perform their functions; (iii) identifying the characteristics of locations suitable to support decentralised entities or functions, including consideration of infrastructure and communication connectivity requirements; (iv) considering different models of decentralisation, including: - relocation of all or part of a Commonwealth entity to a regional area; - decentralisation of specific positions, with individual employees telecommuting, considering any limitations to this in current Australian Public Service employment conditions and rules; - co-location of decentralised Commonwealth entities or employees in existing regionally based Commonwealth or State Government offices; and (v) examining the family, social and community impacts of decentralising; (c) actions of the Commonwealth that would encourage greater corporate decentralisation and what can be learned from corporate decentralisation approaches, including: (i) considering the role of the private sector in sustainably driving employment and growth opportunities in regional areas in both existing and new industries;  (ii) comparing the access to early stage equity and or debt finance of metropolitan and regional businesses for both start up and established businesses; (iii) examining access to capital for regional business, including agribusiness, manufacturing and technology; (iv) considering the adequacy of regional businesses access to early stage accelerators and incubators, including access to business mentors, business networks and capital (debt or equity); (v) considering the adequacy to support the private sector to attract and retain skilled labour to regional areas; and (vi) examining the extent to which employment and growth can be supported by growing existing and new industries in regional areas, leveraging strong transport and communications connectivity; and (d) any related matters; (2) the committee consist of 10 members, six members to be nominated by the Government Whip or Whips, three members to be nominated by the Opposition Whip or Whips and one non-aligned Member; (3) every nomination of a member of the committee be notified in writing to the Speaker of the House of Representatives;

2,Ms MCGOWAN,COMMITTEES," I would like to add my comments to the minister's and welcome the government's motion here and acknowledge the work of the Prime Minister, the member for Mayo, the Leader of the House and many members of parliament we have worked with on this particular motion over a period of time. I would particularly like to acknowledge the people of Indi, who have asked that this motion be brought to the House. Also, I would like to thank my staff, particularly the work of Jeremy Mickle, for the huge amount of work they have done. I think this is going to be a visionary committee. I know that the intent is to look at regional development, the future of Australia and the role of decentralisation to assist and support in doing that. There are so many innovative and creative things happening in rural and regional Australia. There are so many wonderful people doing amazing things, so many communities, projects and issues that can really value add to how the government wants the country to be. We can build connections. Before I address the details of this particular motion, I would like to share with you, Mr Speaker, a couple of moments of history if I could. In the 1990s, as president of Australian Women in Agriculture I was approached by John Anderson, then Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party, to chair the Regional Women's Advisory Council. This was a national representative council reporting directly to the Deputy Prime Minister on issues of important to Australia. As chair of that committee, we did an enormous amount of work of joining up government and talking to the government about how their issues impacted on the lives of people in rural and regional Australia. Our first report was called The success factors. It talked about the success of economic growth and development in rural and regional Australia. It underpinned the next part of the work that I and many of my colleagues did for the next 15 years and directly resulted in me standing to become a member of parliament. There was so much wisdom in The success factors about how government and communities can work together. I am looking forward to bringing some of that knowledge back to this committee. Before I was involved in Women in Agriculture, in my earlier life I was working for the Victorian Department of Agriculture. The Premier of Victoria at that time was John Cain. John Cain established a committee called the Rural Affairs Committee of cabinet. He brought together some of the key portfolios that impacted on rural and regional Australia. I had the fortune to be a staff member who worked to that committee of cabinet, and I could see the impact joined-up government had. I could see the impact of partnerships between communities and government. I could see the respectful relationships developed when rural communities better understood how government worked. I could see the capacity-building  that happened right across rural Victoria as cabinet ministers came out, met with communities and better understood the problem, and then we worked together to actually be solutions focused. It was a most amazing career for a young country woman from a farm to get a really good experience of how government works in partnership with communities. And the results were amazing. Right across Victoria, communities came together, people put their hands up to become part of government. They joined committees. The capacitybuilding happened as people understood that they had authority, they had personal power and government was a partner. And in supporting this particular motion I am hoping we can do the same thing. I am hoping we can bring government together. I am hoping we can work with the opposition, and it is so good to have you here today. I know there are issues about the actual format of the committee, but I am looking forward to working with the government, with the opposition and with my crossbench colleagues, to ask, 'What's our vision for rural and regional Australia?'-how we can actually work together and with government as a partner to do the detailed planning that needs to happen for us to be the shining light that I believe we can be for this wonderful country. Before I talk about some of the key aspects of the committee, I really want to acknowledge the work everybody has put in place to get here today, and particularly for me as an Independent to be standing here to put my hand up to be on the committee-and I certainly hope to-and to work with all my rural colleagues. I know we have the connections, we have the links, and we want to do this. I will note just a couple of things about the committee that I think are going to make a really big difference. It is going to look at best-practice approaches to regional development, considering Australia and international examples, and many of us have great knowledge of how things work in other countries. We are going to look at decentralisation of Commonwealth entities and functions as a mechanism to increase growth and prosperity in regional areas-again, considering Australian and international examples. Really importantly for me, with my background in business, we are going to look at the actions of the Commonwealth that would encourage greater corporate decentralisation and what can be learned from corporate decentralisation approaches-how we can bring business with us. I will give you one example of this. In my local community of Bright last week I met a woman who has a consultancy company working for Google, out of Bright. She does it all by telecommunications. One of my volunteers this week works for the Victorian Department of Agriculture. He is part of the department's HR team and works from Rutherglen. We have so many examples of this joined-up, clever decentralisation approach that we could bring to parliament and work to. In closing, I say, the time is now. The right people are here. The parliament is together in its will. And I say to all my colleagues throughout rural and regional Australia, come and join us; this is going to be the most exciting thing we do for the next eight months.",19
3,Mr JOYCE,COMMITTEES,"New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:38): I thank the honourable member for her contribution. I think this is going to be very good. It works on the back of the inquiry we have had in the Senate, which was also premised on decentralisation and premised on what we can do for regional areas. In the Nationals we are very much focused on making sure that we continue with a process of decentralisation, and people would note the work we are doing with RIRDC, going to Wagga; with GRDC, going to Toowoomba, to Dubbo and to Northam in Western Australia; with  APVMA, going to Armidale; and with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, with the decentralisation to Wodonga, to Adelaide and to Toowoomba. The centre of our party's purpose is the development of regional Australia, and we are very proud of the work we are doing there-even recently, the announcement of the Regional Investment Corporation in Orange, which will be capitalised to $4 billion. With all this, the more that we can get other people to put their shoulder to our wheel in driving this agenda the better, because we know that there is always a tendency that it oscillates-at other times people go back to centralisation. There is never an inquiry about how they close down post offices or close down services and move them out of regional areas and back into major cities. There has to be a concerted push, when the opportunity arises, to decentralise back out to regional areas. I would never be so bold as to say that this is something peculiar to the National Party. Without a shadow of a doubt the Labor Party themselves have been instrumental in decentralisation. The Albury-Wodonga push by Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was a clear example of that. We have also had the Department of Minerals and Energy that went to Maitland. We have had the Labor Party moving other departments into the Northern Rivers of New South Wales. All of these I agree with. All of these I think make abundant sense. It makes sense for a section of the minerals department in New South Wales to be in Maitland, because that is where the coal mines are. That is where it should be. This is something where, if we as a government and in a bipartisan way can drive an agenda of decentralisation then we make our nation a stronger place, because the essence of our nation only exists in a form of decentralisation in its primary aspects of closer settlement. The idea of a penal colony at Sydney was a policy of a government-not a policy of our government; a policy of an English government-but that is precisely how the closer settlement of Australia came about. The only reason where we are right now-Canberra-is here is the policy of government. There was no natural inclination for the creation of our nation's capital on the banks of the Molonglo River, but what an incredible jewel it is for our nation now. In fact, it was part of the process that the nation's capital had to be more than 100 miles from Sydney or Melbourne. It was one of the reasons why we are where we are at this moment. Now, with around 380,000 people living in Canberra, I think less than 40 per cent of its GDP is to do with the public service. It is growing under its own speed now, and that is a great outcome. We support this inquiry. This inquiry adds to the work that has been done by the Labor Party and works on the whole premise of the National Party, which is a party for Regional Australia. It works off the back of the Senate inquiry. I want to commend the work that has been done by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Senator Fiona Nash. She has done a power of work in this space. Also, Senator Bridge MCKenzie has been working so hard in this space. We are only too happy to support people across the parliamentary spectrum who share in this goal of decentralisation. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) (09:42): I want to start by congratulating the member for Indi, who has put a power of work into this. I read an earlier motion that she had prepared and I know she had been in discussion with the government and others on an earlier motion which had envisaged a joint select committee to inquire into decentralisation and regional development. Labor would have supported such an approach. We think the power of having  both houses of parliament and the independence that is brought by a joint select committee would have brought a valuable contribution to the subject matter which is going to be covered by this committee. As the Deputy Prime Minister has just said, Labor has a long and proud history in the area of decentralisation. It is well known that the Whitlam government established the Growth Centres (Financial Assistance) Bill 1973and the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill 1973 as a means of driving through this place a decentralisation agenda. It was not a process that stopped with the Whitlam government. I know, for example, that any of the members who are representing electorates that have an Australian tax office in their electorate have it as a result of a deliberate initiative of a Labor government to ensure that we decentralised the work that was being performed by such a large department of the government. Some people have often quipped that this is something that is going to give Labor a natural advantage in some of these regional areas; it is a view that, if you are decentralising public servants out of Canberra, they will move to areas and change the political spectrum. I always remind people who make that observation that actually the member for Farrer used to work in the Australian Taxation Office-I believe she used to be a union delegate in the tax office-and was one of the beneficiaries of a Labor government's commitment to decentralisation. We believe that there is a right and a wrong way to go about this. We think you need a methodical, systematic approach to decentralisation. I see the member for Hunter is here in the chamber with me today. He and I will have an active role in watching and participating in the work of this committee. I know that the member for Hunter has had some critical things to say about the move of the APVMA from Canberra to New England. We see this as an example of the wrong way to go about things: an ad hoc approach, very, very costly and a great disruption to the normal operations of that agency, without any cost-benefit analysis of the long-term benefits of that move. This cannot be interpreted as a hostility from Labor to the proposition of decentralisation. It is something that we have had a long-term commitment to, dating back to well earlier than the 1970s, to the Chifley and Curtin governments, and even earlier than that. Labor have had a strong commitment to decentralisation. It has to go further than just looking at the activities of government, which is why I appreciate the work that the member for Indi has put into the drafting of the terms of reference for this committee, because they go to those important areas of regional economic development and the role of the private sector as well. The objective of the decentralisation is to create jobs and economic opportunity in regional areas. That is what it is all about. Therefore, we argue that it does not make sense to be moving agencies or parts of agencies from capital cities into regional centres if, at the very same time, you are cutting jobs from other Commonwealth agencies that already exist in those regional areas. Sadly, that has been the case. We note that within the existing budget there are a further 1,200 jobs slated to be cut from the Department of Human Services-one of the most decentralised agencies in the Commonwealth. These are issues that need to be looked at and will be looked at. We will be looking at them very carefully in our participation in this new select committee. Once again, we want to congratulate all members of parliament who have had a role in bringing this motion to the parliament today, and we will be active and positive contributors to the work and the considerations of this committee. Question agreed to.  NA Imported Food Control Amendment Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Joyce. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
4,Mr JOYCE,BILLS,"New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:48): I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Australia has a world-class food safety management system. Our exported food is highly sought after internationally due to our world-class food safety reputation. This benefits our farmers, our economy, and our nation as a leading exporter of high quality safe food. It is essential that we ensure food being brought into Australia is safe. As globalisation changes how food is traded around the world, we need to strengthen our laws to meet the changing landscape. Australia imports food for a variety of reasons. In 2015-16, we imported $16 billion worth of food. In the same period, Australia exported $40 billion worth of food. Some food is imported into Australia as ingredients to be used in manufacturing of food, some of which is consumed in Australia and some is exported, contributing to our prosperity. For both our economic prosperity through exports, and for the safety of Australians, ensuring all food brought into Australia is safe is a must. The hepatitis A outbreak in 2015 linked to imported frozen berries highlighted the limitations in our imported food safety management system in identifying and responding to new food safety risks and ensuring importers are accountable for importing safe food across their supply chain. This bill will address these limitations to modernise the system ensuring we continue to have a robust world-class food safety management system. Food safety management systems are based on science. Some food risks you cannot see. We know for some food, such as raw milk cheese, scientific testing alone of the final product does not guarantee the food is safe to eat. As our farmers know, ensuring every step of the production process, from the grass the cow eats, to the water the cow drinks, to the cleanliness of the dairy, the conditions the cheese is made in, to finally the way the cheese is packaged and transported are all critical. To address these concerns for food where at-border testing alone is insufficient to assure safety, this bill will introduce a requirement that for certain ready to eat or minimally processed foods, importers will need an internationally recognised food safety management certificate that assures the food's production has been managed safely. One or two times a year there are circumstances where we strongly suspect a problem with an imported food but the scientists are still working out what tests will best show if the problem exists in that particular batch. This was the case with the frozen berries, and we were able to work with the importer to voluntarily hold the food. However, this is reliant on the importer being cooperative. This bill addresses that weakness by introducing new capacity to hold food at the border until the scientific testing approach is being finalised or the extent of  the problem is understood. This capacity will only be utilised for a short period until the scientific testing approach is finalised, then we will use the existing provisions. Under the current system, if we have some information about an emerging risk but the scientific evidence is incomplete, the system is unable to increase the surveillance of that food. This bill introduces the ability to increase the level of surveillance to monitor the risk for a limited period and gather scientific evidence to conduct a reassessment of that food. This will enable us to better respond to emerging risks proactively before a food safety incident occurs. Australia is a big exporter of food. Our agricultural exports contributed $38.3 billion to the Australian economy in 2015-16. This government has worked tirelessly to develop new markets for our exports. As part of this work we have identified foreign countries who have food safety management systems that are equivalent to our own. Where there are equivalent food safety management systems between Australia and another country, this bill introduces the capacity to recognise the systems and to reduce intervention at the border. This will benefit both countries, enabling the easier flow of trade between Australia and that country. We are serious about ensuring Australia continues to have a world-class food safety management system. Part of ensuring this is having the necessary tools in place for when somebody tries to break the rules. This bill brings the enforcement tools available to the department up to modern standards and introduces new penalties to make sure when somebody breaks the law they are dealt with appropriately. That's why we are introducing a full range of penalties, ranging from strict liability offences to up to 10 years in gaol and fines greater than $100,000. The Australian government only has regulatory responsibility for food as it comes over our border. We need to make sure the expectation we have on Australian businesses is the same as expectations on importers. Australian food businesses have excellent systems in place to be able to trace food, which is essential if a recall is required. To make sure importers are able to do the same, this bill introduces requirements for importers to be able to quickly identify who they bought food from and who they sold it to in Australia. This will strengthen our ability to respond to a food incident. The food safety management system in Australia is a cooperative system where the states, territories, local governments and Australian government have shared responsibilities. To enable information to be used easily within Australia for food regulation, we have improved our information-sharing abilities with the states and territories. The states, territories and local governments play an essential part in Australia's domestic food safety management system, and the Australian government will be able to share information to support jurisdictions to effectively perform their role in food safety management. Another limitation with current imported food safety management practices is how foods can be specified. Despite the knowledge in 2015 that only berries from a specific location were of concern in relation to that incident, all frozen berries were required to be tested under current legislation. This bill introduces the flexibility to specify food in a detailed way. For example, we will be able to narrow holding orders to specific foods from specific locations or even specific factories. This will reduce the burden on importers at the border as we will be able to target the specific food causing concern, and not all food of that type.  The changing global marketplace of food supply presents new challenges for managing the risks associated with imported food. As the world's population grows, ensuring a safe food supply is critical. This bill introduces the ability of Australia to share information with our international trading partners about any food safety issues identified in food arriving at Australia's border. This will enable a safer food supply chain worldwide. Australia enjoys a world-class food safety management system. Through these changes we will strengthen our system, enabling Australians to continue to enjoy a wide range of food from around the world. Our food manufacturers will be able to continue to produce highquality and safe food, which is highly sought after internationally. This benefits our farmers, our economy, and our nation as a leading exporter of high-quality safe food. A strong food safety management system at the border is essential for our nation.

5,Mr MORRISON,STATEMENTS," On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I am glad you took the sage advice as a Carlton Blues supporter to transfer your Blues allegiance to the New South Wales Blues last night. It was a great win for the Blues, and congratulations to Laurie Daley and Boyd Cordner. It was a tremendous win. Congratulations, particularly, to Andrew Fifita on a tremendous game. I just hashtagged-just saying-that, of the 28 to 4 win, 16 points were scored by Sharks players. So we are all very happy in the shire in New South Wales today. Well done to all of those players last night. It was a tremendous spectacle, enjoyed by all New South Wales members here, I am sure.",25

NA Medicare Guarantee Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum to this bill, and to the Medicare Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017, presented by Mr Morrison. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
8,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Turnbull government is guaranteeing Medicare so that all Australians can be assured Medicare is not only here to stay, but will be strengthened into the future. Australians place great faith in our world-class health system. In 2015-16, 89.3 per cent of the population accessed a Medicare service, using over 384 million Medicare services. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is a key component of Australia's health system that has provided affordable access to necessary and life-saving medicines for  Australians for almost 70 years. Around 208 million services-91.7 per cent of which were concessional-were provided under the PBS in 2015-16. The Turnbull government is building on our world-class system by strengthening Medicare, with the strong leadership of the Minister for Health and Sport, who is at the table with us today. In this year's budget, the government will provide $1 billion to reintroduce indexation for certain items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The government is investing record funding for our public hospitals and will deliver an additional $2.8 billion in the 2017-18 budget. The government has also committed to an additional $1.2 billion to list new and amended, cost-effective medicines on the PBS, as announced in this year's budget. This adds to more than 1,400 new or amended listings on the PBS since 2013, compared to just 330 in Labor's last three years in office. Labor rationed the PBS. They did not list life-saving drugs, when they could have and should have. We have and are. The MBS and PBS combined will account for almost 45 per cent of Commonwealth health expenditure in 2017-18. The Turnbull government is guaranteeing Medicare. According to those opposite, the Labor Party, the government was apparently meant to have sold Medicare by now. With this bill the government is guaranteeing the MBS and PBS so that all Australians can continue to access timely and affordable health care and medicines into the future-proving the deceit that was put to the Australian people by the Labor Party at the last election. The Turnbull government is guaranteeing Medicare. By law, we will establish a Medicare Guarantee Fund to back up this guarantee, to pay for all expenses on the MBS and PBS from 1 July of this year. The fund will secure the long-term future for the Medicare Benefit Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The fund will consist of the Medicare Guarantee Fund (Treasury) Special Account and the Medicare Guarantee Fund (Health) Special Account. Proceeds from the Medicare levy, less the portion set aside for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, will be paid into the fund to meet MBS and PBS costs. Because the Medicare levy does not, and has not ever, covered the full costs of providing health care in Australia, an additional contribution from income tax revenue will be paid into the funds to meet MBS and PBS costs. The money will be placed in the fund every year-transparently, assuredly and responsibly. In 2017-18 an estimated $33.8 billion will be credited to the fund. The Medicare levy will contribute about $12.1 billion. The remainder, an estimated $21.7 billion, will be drawn from personal income tax receipts, equivalent to around 10 per cent of all personal income tax. The funds credited from the Medicare levy will be equivalent to three-quarters of the revenue raised by the Medicare levy for the next two years. This will shift to become threefifths of the revenue raised by the Medicare levy from 2019-20 when the Medicare levy will need to be increased to cover the full costs of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and fill the $55.7 billion funding gap left by the Labor Party for the NDIS.  The amounts credited to the Medicare Guarantee Fund will be held in the fund for the sole purpose of meeting the cost of essential health care provided under the MBS and PBS, thereby guaranteeing those important services, those essential services, that Australians rely on and the Turnbull government is guaranteeing.. They will provide transparency about the costs of Medicare and the PBS and a clear guarantee on how we pay for them. The fund demonstrates the government's commitment to Medicare by ring-fencing revenue for the sole purpose of MBS and PBS spending. Ring-fencing the revenue in the Medicare Guarantee Fund will increase the public visibility of the costs of these important services, the quantum of revenue generated by the Medicare levy and the additional revenue necessary to meet these costs, which is drawn from the personal income tax base. The fund does not change the demand-driven nature of MBS and PBS funding. To make sure that there is always sufficient credit in the fund to meet MBS and PBS costs, the credit to the fund will be adjusted at every budget update. This will ensure that it is in line with forecast future growth in MBS and PBS expenditure over the forward estimates. In the event that the fund has insufficient contributions to meet MBS and PBS expenses in any year, a special appropriation will meet those expenses. This ensures that Medicare Benefit Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme funding is always guaranteed under a Turnbull government. Full details of the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Medicare Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Morrison. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",25
9,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Medicare Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017 makes amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953 to reflect the proposed operation of the Medicare Guarantee Bill 2017, which secures the ongoing funding of the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The MBS and PBS are currently paid under the Health Insurance Act 1973 and National Health Act 1953 respectively. These acts meet payment obligations under those schemes by appropriating from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Medicare Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017 makes a number of consequential amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 and National Health Act 1953 to replace the current special appropriations under those acts with the Medicare Guarantee Fund.  These changes will increase transparency around the cost of running the MBS and PBS and will guarantee the government's commitment to fund the affordable health care all Australians rely on. Full details of the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Treasury Laws Amendment (GST Integrity) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCCormack. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",27
10,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today, I introduce a bill to amend the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 ('GST law') to give effect to changes that were announced by the Hon. Kelly O'Dwyer MP, Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, on 31 March 2017. The bill provides that entities buying gold, silver and platinum that have been supplied as a taxable supply for GST purposes will be required to apply a reverse charge. This means they will remit the GST to the ATO instead of the seller remitting the goods and services tax. In addition the bill clarifies that precious metals are not second-hand goods. These changes will negate two types of avoidance activity by entities exploiting the different tax treatment applying to 'precious metals' and 'scrap metals'. Precious metals are gold, silver, platinum and other prescribed metals meeting particular investment form and fineness requirements. Generally, a supply of precious metals is not taxable, whereas a supply of scrap metals will be a taxable supply under the GST rules. However, precious metals can be altered to turn them into scrap metals, for example by removing logos or brand markings, or chopping the metal so that it is no longer in investment form. The first type of avoidance activity involves entities altering precious metals to turn them into scrap metals. On sale of the scrap metal, GST would be charged. However, the seller would go missing without having remitted the GST to the ATO, and the purchaser would still claim an input tax credit on their purchase. To address the 'missing trader' scheme, the bill applies a reverse charge to supplies involving these metals, which ensures the purchaser becomes responsible for remitting the GST to the ATO. This removes the opportunity for the seller to keep the GST and go 'missing'. The second type of avoidance activity involves entities altering precious metals to turn them into scrap metals, so they are treated as second-hand goods. The GST law allows entities to claim input tax credits for second-hand goods bought from the public, in line with the policy rationale that GST is embedded in the price when dealers purchase these goods.  However, scrap metals, broken jewellery and other items that are bought and later sold to refiners for their valuable metal content are very unlikely to have any GST embedded in the price. Allowing an input tax credit in such situations is not consistent with the policy underpinning the second-hand goods rules. The bill clarifies the law to ensure it operates as intended and this avoidance, and at times fraudulent, activity is stopped. The bill will have effect from 1 April 2017, as announced. To make sure this activity does not simply shift from gold to other metals, the amendments also apply to goods containing silver, platinum or other metals that may be prescribed. The government is committed to protecting the integrity of the tax system. By making these changes to the GST treatment of precious metals, the government is securing necessary funds for states and territories that provide crucial services such as hospitals and schools that Australians rely on.

Treasury Laws Amendment (2017 Enterprise Incentives No. 2) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCCormack. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",28
11,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 to improve Australia's corporate insolvency system. Firstly, it will create a 'safe harbour' for honest and diligent company directors from personal liability for insolvent trading if they are pursuing a restructure outside formal insolvency. Secondly, 'ipso facto' clauses, which may allow the termination or variation of contracts based on a company's financial position or the commencement of certain insolvency proceedings, will become unenforceable during and after certain formal insolvency procedures. Our current insolvent trading laws put too much focus on stigmatising and penalising failure. As part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, these reforms aim to promote entrepreneurship and innovation to drive business growth, local jobs and global success. The threat of Australia's insolvent trading laws, combined with uncertainty over the precise moment a company becomes insolvent have long been criticised as driving directors to seek voluntary administration even in circumstances where the company may be viable in the longer term. Concerns over inadvertent breaches of insolvent trading laws are frequently cited  as a reason that early stage-angel-investors and professional directors are reluctant to become involved in a start-up. Broadly, the safe harbour and ipso facto measures encourage Australians to take a risk, leave behind the fear of failure and be more innovative and ambitious. More often than not, entrepreneurs will fail several times before they experience success and will generally learn valuable lessons during the process. Helping these entrepreneurs to succeed requires a cultural shift. The amendments in part 1 of this bill create a safe harbour for company directors from personal liability for insolvent trading if the company is undertaking a restructure outside formal insolvency. This will drive cultural change among company directors by encouraging them to keep control of their company, engage early with possible insolvency and take reasonable risks to facilitate the company's recovery instead of simply placing the company prematurely into voluntary administration or liquidation. An 'ipso facto' clause is a provision that allows one party to terminate or modify the operation of a contract upon the occurrence of some specific event, regardless of otherwise continued performance of the counterparty. The operation of these clauses can reduce the scope for a successful restructure or prevent the sale of the business as a going concern. The amendments in part 2 of this bill will make certain contractual rights unenforceable while a company is restructuring under certain formal insolvency processes. This reform is aimed at enabling businesses to continue to trade in order to recover from an insolvency event instead of these clauses preventing their successful rehabilitation. Together, these amendments will reduce instances of a company proceeding to a formal insolvency process prematurely. Where companies do enter into particular formal insolvency procedures, they will have a better chance of being turned around or of preserving value for creditors and shareholders This in turn will promote the preservation of enterprise value for companies, their employees and creditors, reduce the stigma of failure associated with insolvency and encourage a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation.

Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco Duty Harmonisation) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill-by leave-and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr MCCormack. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",29
12,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will increase the excise imposed on roll-your-own tobacco to align it with the excise rate applied to cigarettes.  The bill will phase-in the rate adjustment over four years to match the timing of existing excise increases. The first adjustment to the roll-your-own tobacco excise rate will occur on 1 September 2017. The rate adjustment will correct a disparity in the treatment of cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco. This disparity exists because there are two excise rates that apply to tobacco, a stick rate which is applied to manufactured cigarettes with 0.8 grams or less of tobacco per cigarette and a per kilogram rate which is applied to all other tobacco products, including rollyour-own tobacco and most cigars. The stick rate simplifies the taxation of cigarettes and reduces compliance costs. Consequently, cigarettes have excise imposed at the same rate regardless of their tobacco content, as though they contain 0.8 grams in tobacco. However, the average cigarette contains less than 0.8 grams of tobacco, which means the government imposes excise on the average cigarette at a higher rate than roll-your-own tobacco. To correct this disparity, this bill will adjust the per kilogram tobacco excise rate to reflect the new assumption that the average cigarette contains 0.7 grams of tobacco. This adjustment, to be made over four years, will make sure the government taxes tobacco more equally, regardless of its form. A cognate bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco Duty Harmonisation) Bill 2017, will increase the excise equivalent customs duty on roll-your-own tobacco.

Bill read a first time. Second Reading",31
14,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am delighted to introduce the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017, which is the most important of six bills in a package of legislation to reform the system of industrial chemicals regulation and establish a new scheme for Australia, known as the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme (or AICIS). These reforms also deliver on the coalition's commitment to reduce red tape and improve the safety risk framework for industrial chemicals in Australia. Industrial chemicals play an essential role in everyday life-they are in paints and petrol, and are used in the production of a wide range of consumer goods and products such as cosmetics, dyes, cleaners and plastics. They are also an integral part of Australian industry and are extensively used in mining, manufacturing, and the building and construction industry. But they can also present risks to human health, worker safety and the environment that require management through fit-for-purpose regulation. The details for the regulations will be set out under the bills, and contain the technical and operational details to ensure the new scheme remains responsive to scientific development and changes in industry. This regulation will be subject to further public consultation. Industrial chemicals also form part of a multi-billion dollar international market, with Australian imports and exports of industrial chemicals combined exceeding approximately $62 billion in 2015-16. It is important that Australian regulation aligns, as far as possible, with that of our trading partners, and that it is flexible enough to accommodate changes as they occur internationally and as the science develops. The bill that I am introducing today introduces a new scheme designed to make regulatory effort more proportionate to risk and to promote safer innovation by encouraging the introduction of lower risk chemicals. The changes will continue to maintain Australia's high standards for protecting the Australian community (both workers and the general public) and the environment from any harmful effects of industrial chemicals. The regulation of industrial chemicals at the Commonwealth level has existed since 1989 under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989. However with the passage of time, through successive governments, it has been recognised that reform was required to streamline what has become a very complicated regulatory scheme. The bill will establish the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme, which will replace the current National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme. Under the new scheme, the executive director, who will be an independent statutory officeholder appointed by the Governor General, will have a range of important functions in relation to the introduction of industrial chemicals in Australia. The term 'introduction' refers  to importation or manufacture. The executive director's functions will include the assessment and publication of information about certain industrial chemicals introductions. AICIS publications will then be used by other bodies, including Australian government and state and territory-based regulators, to aid in the protection of human health, worker safety and the environment. Poisons scheduling, occupational health and safety and environmental protection regulation, performed under state and territory law and coordinated nationally, will be informed by AICIS publications. The package also delivers on an important coalition government election commitment and an issue that is important to many Australians-banning cosmetic testing on animals. The government has received strong public support to introduce a ban on cosmetic testing on animals. The ban provided for in this bill will bring Australia into line with the EU and other countries introducing a ban on cosmetic testing on animals, prospectively following the commencement of the legislation on 1 July 2018. Indeed, the new scheme in Australia is moving away from the use of animal test data for other purposes, so that animal test data, like in the EU, would be used as a last resort where science has not yet developed valid alternatives that can assure continued protections for human health, worker safety and the environment. This ban will apply on the use of animal testing for more than 99 per cent of the cosmetics ingredients introduced into Australia. The remaining less than one per cent are circumstances where these chemicals are also used in other industries and this information is critical to ensure the protection of consumers, the public and workers, and the environment. The coalition believes that the legislation will establish Australia as a world leader in this space. The coalition government first announced the industrial chemical reforms as part of the 2015-16 budget and since September 2015 there has been extensive consultation with stakeholders to develop the implementation detail for the reforms. We have undertaken four rounds of public consultation, released four consultation papers, held eight public workshops-with over 350 stakeholders in attendance-reviewed 148 written submissions, and sought advice from international regulators. Our consultation will not stop here, though, and an important process of consultation will continue with stakeholders to inform the development of delegated legislation. This will be critical to implementing the new scheme. I think it is fair to say that our stakeholders do not all share the same views about the level of regulation that should be applied to industrial chemicals-with some favouring a more restrictive approach and others favouring a more deregulatory approach. But, after carefully considering the views of all, I believe that the bill before us strikes a very effective balance. The bill achieves this balance in five main ways. First, by removing unnecessary regulatory burden and improving IT systems, the costs to industry will be reduced by around $23 million annually. We have found more efficient ways to achieve similar outcomes without in any way jeopardising health and environmental protections. Second, introduction of a more risk-based approach to regulation encourages innovation and ensures that lower-risk chemicals are not subject to unnecessary restrictions. By enabling industry to self-assess lower-risk chemicals, this reduces the number of chemicals assessed by  the regulator by more than 70 per cent-thereby reducing costs to industry, and also enabling the regulator to focus its efforts on higher-risk chemicals. Third, the bill better aligns industrial chemicals regulation with that of Australia's trading partners. The government has worked closely with regulators in the US and Canada to ensure that wherever possible, definitions are aligned, key concepts are consistent, and most importantly that low-cost, streamlined regulatory pathways will be available for chemicals that have already been assessed by comparable international regulators. This supports the Australian industry to become more competitive internationally. Fourth, a national inventory of industrial chemicals will be enhanced. Chemicals will be added to the inventory following assessment by AICIS under the new scheme and will be linked to the assessment statement, providing important information about the steps required to safely use these higher-risk chemicals. Critically, this will improve transparency of the scheme and chemicals on the market by publishing information that is more meaningful for industry and the public, including particularly important risk and safety information about the chemicals that have been assessed. Finally, the bill includes new powers for the regulator to ensure the protection of consumers, workers and the environment. The regulator will be able to refuse the import or manufacture of industrial chemicals where the risks cannot be adequately managed (either by the regulator, or by other Australian risk managers such as environmental authorities). The regulator will also have strengthened enforcement powers in the event of non-compliance. An important benefit of realigning regulatory effort towards chemicals with a higher risk profile is that the costs to businesses using lower-risk chemicals will be reduced. The faster regulatory pathway to introduction of lower-risk chemicals provides an incentive to introduce safer new chemicals, including replacing more hazardous existing chemicals. A greater focus on post-market assessment and monitoring will assist in maintaining the protection of health and safety of consumers, workers and the environment. As mentioned earlier, in an area of science that is very dynamic and involves a high level of technical detail, it is critical that the regulatory system can adapt quickly in line with industry innovation, scientific advances and discoveries about the hazards of chemicals. For this reason, much of the detail about the types of chemicals subject to different levels of regulation will be set out in delegated legislation and guidance material. The Department of Health has already undertaken a great deal of consultation on the detail to be included in the delegated legislation, and a fifth consultation paper seeks the further input of stakeholders. I encourage all stakeholders to contribute to this consultation process. This bill delivers on the coalition government's promise to build a strong new economy by incentivising innovation, supporting Australian exporters and protecting human health and our environment. This bill also ensures that the regulatory system provides an effective platform for the coming decades-one that is efficient, risk based and proportionate; that encourages innovation and that ensures ongoing protections for consumers, workers and the environment.

Bill read a first time. Second Reading",32
15,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am pleased to introduce one of the supporting bills-the Industrial Chemicals (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2017-to the government's package of legislation to reform the industrial chemicals regulation in Australia. The bill is a companion bill to the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017. It will facilitate the transition for industry and others currently operating under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 to the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017. This bill will repeal the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 and the three industrial chemicals charges acts at a time when the new arrangements come into effect on 1 July 2018. In addition, it will make consequential amendments to a range of other Commonwealth legislation to replace references to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 with 'Industrial Chemicals Act 2017'. Most importantly, this bill will provide for the smooth transition of industrial chemicals from the old legislation to the new regulatory framework, to be known as the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme (AICIS). It will do this by ensuring that the risks associated with the introduction of an industrial chemical that are managed under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 will continue to be managed following its repeal, and providing certainty to people currently introducing industrial chemicals. The bill provides a seamless transition to the new arrangements for those authorisations or processes that are already in place by recognising existing approvals under the old legislation and deeming others to be applications under the most appropriate category in the new arrangements. For example, if an assessment certificate or permit on which a person is introducing a chemical was made under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, it will be considered to be made under the Industrial Chemicals Act 2017 and the controls on its introduction will continue to be applied. Importantly, a chemical that was previously on the inventory will be considered to be on the inventory under the new arrangements, providing for its continued introduction. In some key areas, such as the introduction of chemicals that are of low volume or low concentration, the transition will take place over a 12-month period so businesses have more time to align with the new requirements for introduction. This bill will also provide for the transitioning, over a period of time, of confidential business information under the old framework to the new arrangement. Decisions to limit  access to some confidential information under the old legislation will be taken to have been decisions under the Industrial Chemicals Act 2017. As these decisions are due for reconsideration, businesses will be encouraged to move to the more contemporary mechanisms. Finally the bill also provides a degree of flexibility to make adjustments to the new arrangements or prescribe other matters of a transitional nature in the rules. Debate adjourned.

16,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am pleased to introduce the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Amendment Bill 2017 as part of a package of six bills that reform the regulation of industrial chemicals in Australia. The Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, or the ICNA Act, establishes a national system of notification and assessment of industrial chemicals and for registration of certain persons manufacturing or importing chemicals into Australia. The bill that I am introducing makes important changes to the ICNA Act to enable early commencement of certain aspects of the coalition government's broader reforms to industrial chemicals regulation that would otherwise commence from 1 July 2018. The amendments to the ICNA Act in this bill include:  making changes to the definition of certain low-risk industrial chemicals (new synthetic polymers) to more closely align with international approaches to regulation;  making changes to the notification requirements for introducers of certain new chemicals, such that polymers of low concern would be exempt from notification;  removing the requirement for introducers to provide annual reports to NICNAS for permits and self-assessed assessment certificates; and  removing the requirement for certain annual reporting requirements for introducers of certain industrial chemicals in a registration year. Collectively, these changes reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens and provide a faster regulatory pathway for introduction to the Australian market for lower-risk chemicals whilst ensuring that we do not compromise the high standards for health and safety and protecting our environment. These early reforms also set the stage for the wider package of reforms that will take effect from 1 July 2018, and are reflected in the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017 and the related supporting bills.  This bill I introduce today contributes to the coalition government's commitment, to ensuring that the regulatory system provides an effective platform for the coming decadesone that is efficient, risk-based, proportionate, encourages innovation and ensures ongoing protections for Australian consumers, workers and the environment.

17,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I am pleased to introduce one of the supporting bills-the Industrial Chemicals Charges (General) Bill 2017-to the government's package of legislation to reform industrial chemicals regulation in Australia. The new scheme will be known as the Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Scheme (AICIS). The Industrial Chemicals Charges (General) Bill 2017 is one of three charges bills being introduced as part of the government's package of legislation; and will replace the current Industrial Chemicals (Registration Charge-General) Act 1997. The other two bills are the Industrial Chemicals Charges (Excise) Bill 2017 and the Industrial Chemicals Charges (Customs) Bill 2017. This bill will facilitate a cost recovered scheme, by introducing a charge on a registered person each year they wish to introduce a chemical in accordance with the Industrial Chemicals Bill 2017. The legislation requires that the Minister for Health be satisfied that the amount charged will not be more than the likely costs of AICIS regulatory activities. This will provide introducers of chemicals with confidence that the government will not over-recover the costs of managing these regulatory activities. The bill does not itself set the amount of the charges. The charges and who is liable and exempt from paying the charges will be set in the regulations. Specifying such matters in regulations, as opposed to the act itself, provides the department with sufficient flexibility to ensure that these matters are appropriate in all circumstances. The Department of Health will be consulting extensively on the mechanism for calculating this charge to ensure cost recovery arrangements for activities provided in relation to registering chemicals are appropriately supported. I encourage all stakeholders to respond to this consultation process. Debate adjourned.

The key provisions of the bill mirror those in the Industrial Chemicals Charges (General) Bill 2017 and have the same operative function and effect.

Education Legislation Amendment (Provider Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mrs Andrews. Bill read a first time. Second Reading Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson-Assistant Minister for Vocational Education and Skills) (10:47): I move:  That this bill be now read a second time. The Education Legislation Amendment (Provider Integrity and Other Measures) Bill 2017 gives effect to greater student protection measures and strengthens the arrangements for governing quality in the higher education and international education sectors. This bill is a further plank in the Turnbull government's ongoing efforts to protect students and taxpayers from the unscrupulous behaviour that we have seen in the vocational education and training (VET) sector and prevent unethical providers from emerging in the higher education and international education markets. Australia's international education sector is one of the strongest in the world. The quality and integrity of Australia's education providers has seen education become our single largest service export industry, worth $21.8 billion in 2016. The Turnbull government is committed to building on Australia's success as a world leader in international education and is delivering on Australia's first ever National Strategy for International Education 2025. The quality of our education services, and the quality assurance systems we operate, are critical in maintaining Australia's reputation internationally. The government's higher education reform bill, introduced to parliament on 11 May 2017, will put the higher education sector on a more sustainable funding base into the future, and make the sector more transparent and responsive to student choice and market needs. Our universities and non-university higher education providers will continue to flourish, to innovate, and to produce graduates equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to help Australia's businesses and economy grow and prosper. However, we also have the unfortunate example of some unscrupulous providers in the VET sector to show what can happen if effective regulation and monitoring are not in place. In the VET sector, unscrupulous providers were able to exploit students and the taxpayer for their own gain due to a funding system set up with minimal regulatory oversight. VET FEE-HELP suffered serious design flaws that allowed unscrupulous providers and brokers to take advantage of vulnerable students, rip off taxpayers, and tarnish the reputation of Australia's high-quality training providers and the VET sector. Many students in the higher education sector are not currently afforded the same protection from exploitation by providers, and higher education providers seeking to enter the sector are not subject to the same scrutiny as those in the VET sector. There is also opportunity in the international education sector to build on Australia's rigorous quality controls by delivering greater scrutiny of providers seeking registration to deliver education to international students. The Turnbull government has decided to act now and apply similar measures in the higher and international education sectors to those recently enacted for VET to identify, monitor and prevent the sorts of unscrupulous behaviours by some VET FEE-HELP providers from tarnishing the reputation of Australia's international education and higher education sectors. And of course, for the majority of providers who operate with integrity and in the best interest of their students, these measures will require little change. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (the ESOS Act) to strengthen regulation and ensure our international education sector cannot become vulnerable to the actions of unscrupulous providers seeking to exploit students.  This bill enables the minister to make a legislative instrument setting out any additional matters for regulators to consider when assessing whether a provider is fit and proper to be registered to educate international students. This will allow the minister to adjust fit and proper requirements as needed, in response to emerging issues in the sector. This provision will ensure the ESOS regulators are aware of the history of providers or individuals who have had action taken against them due to their unscrupulous behaviour, and who are now seeking registration in the international education sector. For providers who are already registered, new provisions in the bill expand existing requirements that they notify the regulator of significant changes to their management or business practices. Providers must also notify the regulator where they become aware key personnel have any serious recent past convictions, or have had regulatory action taken against their previous approval to deliver government programs. These provisions ensure individuals previously involved in dubious business practices will not go undetected if they move into influential positions within international education. To expand the ability of the government to respond to emerging trends which indicate a potential risk to the integrity of the international education sector, this bill includes provisions that enhance the information sharing abilities of government agencies. An enhanced ability to share information among enforcement agencies is a sensible, pragmatic action which will enable the government to monitor providers more effectively and proactively address identified concerns. The measures in the bill also benefit prospective students by enabling information about the actions of education agents to be released to providers and the wider community. Providers are already bound by a requirement not to use education agents who are dishonest or lack integrity in attracting prospective students to Australia. This bill builds on that requirement by enabling the government to share information with providers about their agent's recruitment outcomes. An additional measure in the bill allows this information to be published more broadly. This will highlight the good work of the vast majority of agents, while providing greater transparency of the small number of agents who may not be providing good advice to students, resulting in poor outcomes for international students. There are also minor administrative amendments to the ESOS Act to ensure providers have a 30-day time-frame to make late payments, in line with current government money collection practices. This ensures the time frame for payment is appropriate, and that providers will not be automatically suspended due to non-payment. Schedule 2 of the bill amends the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011 (the TEQSA Act) to support the efficient operation of its regulatory regime. The measures included in this bill are similar to those legislated in the VET sector last year. The bill clarifies financial viability requirements and stipulates the extent of coverage of TEQSA's regulatory powers.  This bill introduces greater protection of Australian qualifications-requiring vocational education and training courses that lead to the awarding of diplomas, advanced diplomas, graduate diplomas and graduate certificates to be accredited under the TEQSA Act or under vocational education laws. There are also measures to enhance TEQSA's existing compliance capabilities, allowing TEQSA to implement more robust student protection mechanisms and more stringent application and reporting requirements on providers. These include expanding the fit and proper person test for providers seeking accreditation, and expanding the scope of information TEQSA may consider when deciding whether or not to accredit a provider. Additionally, TEQSA will require providers over a certain size to provide general purpose financial statements. To support this measure, the definition of a qualified auditor in the TEQSA Act has been amended. The measures in this schedule also allow TEQSA to delegate its functions or powers to the chief executive officer. The measures in schedule 3 amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to enhance the existing regulatory framework and mirror the sweeping changes made in the VET sector. These reforms will only apply to bodies approved as higher education providers under section 16-25 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, that is, non-university higher education providers. For practical purposes, this excludes universities operating in Australia. This reflects the fact that these measures are directed at reducing the risks to students and taxpayers associated with providers seeking to transition operations and/or students to the higher education sector following our reforms to VET student loan arrangements. Separate arrangements under the government's higher education reform package will drive improved quality, transparency and accountability for universities. The Department of Education and Training will continue to monitor applications, approvals and the amount and number of student loans accessed among all providers registered to offer FEE-HELP, and advise the government if there is a need to extend the measures in this bill. By ensuring consistent standards apply to non-university higher education providers and private VET providers, we are preventing a transition to the higher education sector of the intolerable behaviour of a few unscrupulous providers we witnessed in the VET sector. This bill allows the minister to exempt bodies established by a government, be it the federal government, or a state or territory government, from the body corporate requirements. This is a minor amendment to correct a current anomaly, and will for example, allow organisations such as the Australian Federal Police and Bureau of Meteorology to deliver courses in their areas of expertise and offer FEE-HELP to remove the upfront tuition fees barrier subject to the necessary approvals. This bill also introduces more rigorous tests for all providers applying to access FEEHELP, similar to what was put in place last year in the new VET Student Loans program. Under these measures, the minister can consider whether the provider has a proven history of successfully teaching the courses offered.  We are enhancing the fit and proper person test that providers are assessed against. Providers that fail to gain approval are excluded from reapplying for a six-month period. For existing providers, those who currently access FEE-HELP, additional financial viability and transparency requirements are also included in this bill. These arrangements are broadly consistent with requirements for VET Student Loans providers, legislated last year. This bill provides scope for additional requirements around financial statements and providers' revenue sources to be included in the Higher Education Provider Guidelines as conditions a provider must meet to maintain their approval. This schedule also applies student protection mechanisms currently available in the VET sector to students enrolled at non-university higher education providers. The bill will prevent providers from creating barriers to withdrawal such as withdrawal fees. If a student requests to be unenrolled, the provider must cancel their enrolment without requesting a punitive fee or binding the student in red tape until after the census date. Additionally, cold-calling, the use of third-party contact lists and other unscrupulous marketing practices will be banned, as they are under VET Student Loans. This bill will prevent the use of deceitful marketing, and apply penalties to those who fail to abide by these standards, consistent with the VET Student Loans arrangements passed by parliament last year. Similar to requirements in place for VET Student Loans, we will ensure that FEE-HELP loans are only going to students who have requested them, and who are active and engaged in their course of study, and to those who are academically suited for the course in which they are enrolled. Requiring providers to assess a student as academically suitable and limiting eligibility for FEE-HELP loans to those students who are genuinely studying will prevent vulnerable people from being signed up for courses they are not capable of completing and incurring debts they may not be in a position to repay. In order to maintain eligibility for FEE-HELP at these higher education providers, students must also achieve and maintain a reasonable level of completion of units undertaken. The onus should be on both the provider and the student to achieve this-the provider to have high quality teaching and student support in place and the student to engage with the course requirements. An important aspect of these changes is that they ensure non-genuine students, or those who were not eligible to incur the debt for academic reasons, are able to have their debts remitted. The bill also triggers powers under the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014. This allows the department to monitor and investigate, and to apply enforcement provisions such as civil penalties, again mirroring arrangements for VET Student Loans. This schedule also introduces measures to allow the Commonwealth to cap the amount of FEE-HELP assistance a provider is able to offer or restrict student numbers or courses for which they are able to offer FEE-HELP.  These measures will prevent artificial growth due to non-genuine student enrolments and allow the Commonwealth to act quickly if there is evidence that a provider is dishonestly trying to take advantage of the system. Conclusion Together, these vital measures represent an important insurance-and quality assurancepolicy for our higher education and international education sectors, and are consistent with changes recently enacted in the VET sector. The bill ensures that as we increase learning opportunities for overseas students and market opportunities for dedicated education providers, we also shut down opportunities for unscrupulous providers to harm the reputation of our education services. By enhancing the protections in place for students, and strengthening the monitoring framework for international education providers and non-university higher education providers, we are avoiding another disaster like the failed VET FEE-HELP scheme. We will ensure that both the higher education and international education sectors maintain the highest standards of quality and integrity, for which we are internationally renowned. I commend the bill. Debate adjourned. Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Fee Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Sukkar. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",38
20,Mr SUKKAR,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Act 2015 to implement a streamlined and simplified foreign investment fee framework. This is part of the coalition government's actions to ensure we have a foreign investment regime that meets community expectations, appropriately scrutinises applications but also balances these needs with supporting foreign investment that is ultimately good for Australian jobs and investment. This bill gives effect in part to regulatory reforms that the government is undertaking to ensure Australia's foreign investment framework is robust and operates efficiently. Fees were introduced as part of the 2015 reform package to ensure that Australian taxpayers are not funding the cost of administering this system. Since that time, the government has sought ongoing feedback on how the reforms are working in practice. In response to stakeholder feedback, the government is simplifying the fee framework. The amended fee framework will reduce complexity, achieve more equitable fee outcomes and minimise the regulatory burden on stakeholders, importantly without compromising the integrity of the review system. These changes are broadly revenue neutral, ensuring that foreign investors continue to meet the costs of funding this system.  The fee framework will reduce the number of fee tiers for some categories and implement a standard fee for low, medium and high value acquisitions. The new fee structure will also legislate some existing discretionary fee waiver arrangements to provide a more transparent and consistent approach. The changes to the framework are not intended to encourage or discourage any specific investment category, but instead aim to ensure fees payable for different investment categories are applied on a more consistent basis for similar transactions. The bill will also introduce a 10 per cent fee increase for residential property applications to fund the establishment of the Critical Infrastructure Centre. Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Treasury Laws Amendment (Foreign Resident Capital Gains Withholding Payments) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Sukkar. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",43
21,Mr SUKKAR,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill continues the government's agenda to crack down on tax avoidance. The bill reforms the foreign resident capital gains tax withholding regime from 1 July 2017. By clamping down on tax avoidance by foreign investors in real estate, the government is ensuring home ownership is more achievable for ordinary Australians, and that they have access to secure and affordable housing. The existing foreign resident capital gains tax withholding regime, which the current government legislated and came into effect on 1 July last year, was designed to assist with the collection of capital gains tax liabilities owed by foreign residents, and address the low levels of compliance by foreign residents with those necessary Australian tax obligations. This bill will give effect to changes to the existing regime for foreign residents who sell Australian property, as announced as part of the 2017-18 budget. These changes involve increasing the withholding rate from 10 per cent to 12½ per cent; as well as increasing the number of foreign residents caught by the regime, by reducing the threshold from property with a market value of $2 million, as it currently stands, to property with a market value of $750,000 or more. This will mean that from 1 July 2017, a purchaser of certain Australian property that has a market value of $750,000 (reduced from $2 million, as I said, currently) or more must withhold 12½ per cent (increased from 10 per cent) of the purchase price and pay it to the tax commissioner if they purchase the asset from a foreign resident.  These changes will improve the integrity of the existing regime by capturing more property transactions and encouraging greater compliance with Australia's tax rules Combined with other changes announced in the 2017-18 budget, which will ensure only Australian tax residents can access the main residence capital gains tax exemption, and will improve the integrity of the capital gains tax rules for foreign residents, the estimated gain to revenue over the forward estimates period is $570 million. This reflects the revenue gain expected, following a small change to one of these associated changes as a result of initial targeted consultations. These other capital gains tax changes will be introduced later as part of a separate bill, to enable consultation to occur. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) will be provided with an additional $19 million to assist with administering the regime. The ATO is undertaking an education campaign to help raise awareness of the changes, including presentations in major Australian cities, an online webinar and collaboration with stakeholders that assisted to raise awareness when the regime was first introduced, including the Real Estate Institute of Australia, the Australian Institute of Conveyancers, law societies, and various state and territory regulators. This bill represents an important step for Australia in improving housing affordability and strengthening the integrity of Australia's tax system. Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. NA Publications Committee Report",44
22,Mr CHRISTENSEN,COMMITTEES, I present the report of the Publications Committee. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-agreed to. NA Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,45
23,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS," Today I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017 and state from the outset that Labor will be supporting these measures. This bill contains three schedules which seek to undertake the legislative reform which underpins three elements of the 2017-18 Department of Veterans' Affairs budget. The first and probably most significant schedule amends the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006 to provide Australian participants in British Nuclear Tests (BNT), British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), pastoralists, civilians and Indigenous people with full health coverage for all conditions. This is a significant move. Currently, the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006 only provides Australian BNT participants with testing and treatment for malignant cancers.  Under these changes a broader class of civilians and BCOF veterans will be eligible to receive treatment for all conditions. This coverage will enable these individuals to access DVA funding for all clinically necessary healthcare needs and all health conditions. These changes are the result of a long and hard-fought campaign over many decades for recognition of the BNT and BCOF participants. As many members here may be aware, from October 1952 until October 1957, 12 British atomic weapons tests were conducted at Montebello Islands, off the west coast of Western Australia, and at Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia. There were also 600 minor trials, including the testing of bomb components between 1953 and 1963 at Emu Field and Maralinga. Both military and civilian personnel participated in the tests, with a nominal roll established listing a total of 16,716 persons, comprising of 8,126 service personnel and 8,590 civilians. These 16,716 people performed a range of tasks on and around the site with military personnel undertaking a number of duties including decontamination teams and atomic-cloud sampling and tracking operations. Civilians, who were employed by the Commonwealth or by contractors, provided construction, maintenance and support services relating to the conduct of these tests. In addition there was also a number of Commonwealth police officers and members of the Australian Federal Police on site. Of course it was not just those posted to the site or employed by the Commonwealth who were impacted by these tests. The impact of the detonations spread far and wide, affecting pastoralists, civilians and the Indigenous population. Over the years, many surveys and reports have been undertaken investigating the long-term impact of the British nuclear tests on participants and other civilians who were in the vicinity of the tests. BNT participants recall being required to line up with their backs to the detonation with their hands over their eyes for the first minute or so and then told to turn around and witness the mushroom cloud of the blast. One witness, who provided a statement to the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia undertaken in 1985, recalled: The flash was so strong that we could see the bones in our hands and the outline of the huts in the background even through closed eyes. We could see the shock wave moving towards us as it came over the scrub and when it hit us, it knocked us off our feet. In addition, it is claimed that few wore anything more than shorts or service uniforms to witness the blasts. In a statement to the royal commission, a leading air craftsman within the RAAF recalled using a Geiger counter, which measures ionizing radiation, and stated: … every man showed some degree of radio-activity. I cannot remember the level of the readings but there were some that went off the scale, indicating that they had had the highest possible dose which could be registered. Of course, we are now all too aware of the dangers of radiation and the risks these participants and civilians were in as a result of this exposure. We know that radiation with sufficient energy can cause chemical changes in cells and cause cancer, and acknowledge how dangerous these conditions were and the ongoing impact that this has had on participants lives and on the lives of pastoralists and Indigenous people living in the area. The impact of these tests on the traditional owners of the land is particularly complex. Prior to the tests, the government attempted to move Indigenous people away from the sites with little regard for their connection to their land. This had the dual impact of fragmenting families and, anecdotally, was not always successful. A patrol officer was given the task of  finding and warning all Indigenous people in an 80,000 square kilometre area, and it has been suggested that groups would move out of the area and then return once that patrol had moved on. At the 1953 test in Emu Field, Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in the area described an extraordinary black mist which stuck on vegetation and household items. An Indigenous man who was walking on the edge of the test site stated: We thought it was the spirit of our gods rising up to speak with us. Then we saw the spirit had made all the kangaroos fall down on the ground as a gift to us of easy hunting so we took those kangaroos and we ate them and people were sick and then the spirit left. The ongoing impacts of these tests are significant, and it is appropriate that full healthcare cover be provided to Indigenous people in addition to the BNT participants and pastoralists. These amendments will ensure that any pastoralists and Indigenous persons in the vicinity of the nuclear test areas as well as any other civilians who were present in the areas during the relevant period will be covered. In addition to BNT participants and civilians, BCOF veterans will also be able to access full health coverage. The BCOF comprised elements drawn from the armed forces of Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and India. It was the first time Australians were involved in a military occupation of a sovereign nation that Australia has defeated in war. BCOF's primary objective was to enforce the terms of the unconditional surrender that ended the war in September 1945. BCOF was required to maintain military control and supervise the demilitarisation of Japan and the dismantling of its war infrastructure. The impact for those who served as part of the BCOF was significant, with some having been allocated to the severely devastated prefecture of Hiroshima. The BCOF had to work through considerable stocks of war material, including chemical agents and ordnance, to render them safe or to destroy them, exposing them to radioactive material. As we know, this would have had a considerable long-lasting effect. The ongoing impact of these tests has been subject to a number of studies, including the 2006 mortality and cancer incidence study of the BNT participants. This report found that the death rate from cancer was 17 per cent higher in this group than in the general population and the incidence of cancer was 23 per cent higher than expected. Regardless of the result, the findings of the study did not implicate radiation exposure in the higher than expected mortality and morbidity finding. But veterans and others challenged the finding as those who passed away before 1982 were not included in this study. Without including these people the study did not provide the full picture of the impact of radiation on these participants. Following the release of this report the government finally acknowledged that these participants had a clearly defined healthcare need and established the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006. The 2006 bill provided eligible persons with access to free cancer treatment and ongoing tests. However, it did not provide redress to participants as the service was rendered during peacetime; and, as such, they were covered by military and workers' compensation arrangements. In 2010 the then Labor government sought to provide additional assistance to BNT participants who were also members of the Australian Defence Force by reclassifying their service as non-warlike or hazardous peacekeeping service; and, as such, they were able to access some assistance under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, including access to the disability  pension. The amendments in schedule 1 build on these changes. Labor welcomes the expansion of full health cover to BNT participants, BCOF veterans and civilians, which will enable them to receive the treatment that they need and acknowledges the ongoing impact this exposure had on the individuals who were present on the test sites. This recognition is the result of a long campaign by BNT and BCOF participants. These individuals, nearly all of whom are over 80 years of age, have spent their lives fighting for recognition of the risks they endured and the need for increased support-people like Avon Hudson, from South Australia, who has been working and agitating for change for decades. I understand that approximately 2,900 BNT and BCOF participants will benefit from these changes. As previously mentioned, the expansion will also include the pastoralists and Indigenous people who were present in the test area during the prescribed time frame. I take this opportunity in a bipartisan way to encourage those eligible for this full health coverage to register with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I understand also that the department and the government will look at many avenues to ensure that those who do not understand that they are eligible for this treatment will be contacted. A number of communication methods will be used to ensure as many people as possible actually get access to what they are entitled to. I strongly support that and I encourage the government to make all efforts in this area. These amendments recognise it is appropriate to provide treatment for all conditions for BNT participants, BCOF veterans and civilians who were present during the British nuclear tests during the relevant period, and this is the right thing to do. The second schedule in this bill seeks to amend the current outdated work history restrictions for the special and intermediate rates of disability pension provided in the VEA to better reflect modern working arrangements. Particularly, this will affect claimants over 65 years of age, who must satisfy the above criteria that they have been working with the same employer for 10 years or, in the case of the self-employed, they have to have worked in the same profession, trade, vocation or calling. This criteria is somewhat outdated. Under schedule 2, these changes will ensure that the work history will only require 10 years of continuous work in any field or vocation. This amendment acknowledges that the nature of work has changed. Over the course of a lifetime, an individual may have a number of different careers with a variety of employers. It is now far less common for a person to remain employed by a single employer for 10 years or remain in the same vocation or field in the case of the self-employed. Labor is supportive of this change which reflects the reality of modern-day work. The third schedule in this bill seeks to insert instrument making powers into the Safety, Rehabilitation Compensation Act 1988 and the Military, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, enabling the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to determine a class of persons eligible to participate in an early access to the rehabilitation pilot program. Under the current arrangements, those clients who are under what are currently known as the SRCA and MRCA are required to wait until their claim has been finalised before they are able to access rehabilitation services. This can take around four months to be completed and if the cases are complex, it can take even longer.  Early intervention in relation to rehabilitation obviously has proven benefits, and Labor is supportive of this measure that would look at enabling veterans to access rehabilitation earlier. The importance of this was highlighted in the 2011 MRCA review, which recognises the need for early intervention and noted that access to rehabilitation as soon as a claim is lodged is desirable. Early access to rehabilitation facilitates participation in economic activities and ensures that there are better benefits for well-being. In addition to early intervention in rehabilitation, through-care is equally important. This is an issue that has been raised with me by a number of veterans, most recently at Raymond Terrace in NSW with the member for Paterson. Veterans have highlighted issues where they have begun rehabilitation while still in Defence, which then has stopped while liability was being determined by DVA. Not only does this gap delay improvement but it can also result in a veteran's progress and recovery going backwards. I trust this is an area that could be considered as part of the trial in the pilot program. Under these amendments, a six-month pilot program will be established by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, involving 100 people whose claims are viewed as likely to be approved. The program will be entirely voluntary with the option of opting out. We have been assured that if the claim for liability is later rejected, the department will transition to individual to a community-based rehabilitation provider to continue their treatment if they wish. Importantly, the MRCC will not seek to recover the costs of the rehabilitation services provided through the trial. These are important assurances that have been provided to Labor. While the trial is initially limited to 100 veterans, I am hopeful that this is just the start and that it will identify good results so that this trial will be able to be extended to more veterans. Labor is always supportive of processes which are designed to improve outcomes for our ex-serving defence personnel. We certainly think these measures are needed and good. That is why Labor will support these measures. I commend the bill to the House. Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan-Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services) (11:29): As a government and as a country, we must do everything in our power to support Australia's service men and women, veterans and veterans' families. The coalition's fair and equitable 2017 budget supports Australia's veteran community. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017, a bill welcomed by the veteran community, will implement three of the government's 2017 budget announcements for their community. Specifically, this bill will provide medical treatment for all conditions to Australian participants of the British nuclear tests and Australian veterans of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. This is a welcome measure, as the long standing provisions within the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 had no scope for the participants to be granted treatment for all conditions based on the nature of this service alone. This amendment, however, will provide full treatment for all conditions to those who participated in the British nuclear testing program in Australia at Maralinga. It also seeks to include those veterans who served as part of the BCOF who took part in the occupation of Japan immediately after the Second World War. In recognition of these veterans' possible exposure to ionising radiation, the government will provide a gold card to veterans which will enable them to access medical treatment for all conditions.  A local constituent, a retired serviceman in his late 80s telephoned my office just after the 2017 budget announcement and was incredibly grateful that he was finally getting access to a DVA gold card. For him this not only provides certainty for his health care but also forms a significant recognition of the invisible danger to which he and many of his fellow colleagues were exposed. I must also note that this measure includes a number of civilians who were in the same vicinity as these tests. This includes pastoralists and members of the Indigenous community. The second measure of this bill amends the current outdated work history restrictions for the special and intermediate rates of disability pension to better reflect working norms. The special rate of pension was designed for severely disabled veterans of a relatively young age who could never go back to work and could never hope to support themselves or their families or put away money for their retirement. On the other hand, the intermediate rate of pension was designed for veterans who can only work on a part-time basis due to a servicerelated disability. The changes proposed in this measure remove the current requirement for claimants 65 years or older to have worked for 10 years in the same profession. This further beneficial measure for veterans will now mean that they would require a period of 10 continuous years of work in any field or vocation prior to an application for the special or intermediate rates of disability pension. The last schedule of this bill will enable early access to rehabilitation through a pilot program by inserting instrument-making powers into the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. This would enable the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to determine a class of persons eligible to participate in an early access to rehabilitation pilot program. Presently, rehabilitation can only be provided once liability has been determined, a matter which can take months to resolve. A six-month pilot program providing early access to rehabilitation to 100 participants will be undertaken in the 2017-18 financial year. Just like the coalition's determination to ensure our Defence personnel seek early intervention for mental health conditions for positive outcomes, so too are we determined to ensure early access to rehabilitation. Early access will facilitate the individuals partaking in economic activities with all of the ensuing benefits of work and recovery. This participation in economic activity will also assist in minimising the ongoing effects of injury and illness and promote recovery and well-being. Currently, veterans and ADF members with eligibility under SRCA or MRCA have to wait until their initial liability claim is accepted before they can access rehabilitation services. Assessing a claim typically takes around four months, and for complex cases it can take even longer. As those of us from Defence families know, the war does not stop on the battlefield. In most instances-cases may vary by individual-Defence personnel exhibit some form of post-deployment challenge, such as a change in sleep patterns or reclusion. In more serious cases we see violence and substance and alcohol abuse. The families of deployed servicemen and servicewomen bear the brunt of military life, so it is fitting that there are organisations in Australia that seek to help those who fall on hard times. I segue now to an organisation of which I am patron and in which I take a great deal of interest and support: Wounded Heroes. Wounded Heroes is a national community  organisation established in 2008 to provide first response support services for deployed personnel, the wounded and their families. As an emergency crisis support provider, Wounded Heroes provides short-term emergency relief payments to individuals and their families. This can mean paying to put the electricity back on or filling the fridge with food if the family is going through a challenging time. Through my contact with the CEO of Wounded Heroes, Mr Martin Shaw, and their president, Jim Shapcott, I have been told that a lot of emergency response support goes to sufferers of PTSD. PTSD does not rest solely with the wounded hero. It also affects smaller heroes-the children, who, as I mentioned, so often bear the brunt of postdeployment issues. I mention Exercise Stone Pillow to demonstrate the dedication of Army Corporal Elena Rowland, who established the cause in 2013 when she recognised a need for a better understanding of the issue of homelessness within the Australian veteran community. This exercise also raises vital funds for organisations which provide housing and support to homeless veterans and their families. I commend Wounded Heroes for their continued campaign to care for Australian defence personnel and their families. To ensure that the benefits of this bill are reaped by the veterans community, the timely passage of this bill is critical. These beneficial measures should be supported by all in this House. I am proud to be part of this coalition government, which has invested an additional $350 million in the 2017 budget to support veterans. I place on record my appreciation and praise for the efforts of our defence force and indeed former, current and future personnel for their service. I commend this bill to the House.",45
24,Ms SWANSON,BILLS," I rise to speak in support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017, and I would first like to acknowledge Mr Dean Da Costa, who is with us in the gallery today. Thank you, Mr Da Costa, for being with us. I know that you will benefit from this bill, as you served at Maralinga, and I thank you so much for your service to your country. I would also like to speak more about the third schedule in this bill, which relates to the establishment of a pilot program by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to provide rehabilitation services to veterans while their claims are being processed. It is this aspect of the bill that I want to focus on. It is very good news for veterans. Currently they have to wait for their liability claim to be accepted before they can access rehabilitation, and precious time is lost. Early access to rehabilitation is so vital. The sooner we get the rehab started, the better it is. It helps the veteran return to work, where possible, with all the benefit that work brings to recovery and well-being. And we all know that being productive and having a purpose is important. Improving outcomes for our ex-service men and women ought to be a priority for all of us. We ask a great deal of our defence forces. Yet sometimes when they return home we do not look after them as well as we could. The Williamtown RAAF Base is in my electorate, and the Singleton Army Base is nearby. Serving personnel and veterans are a part of our communities and our families. They are our sons and daughters, our mothers and fathers, our friends and loved ones. Recently I was pleased to host Labor's shadow minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel, the member for Kingston, in Paterson. I invited her because of the issues raised with me by serving personnel, veterans and their loved ones. We gathered  together in groups of personnel and veterans. Some had written to me asking for help. Others heard about the visit through their networks and wanted to have their say-and good on them. Their issues all boiled down to the same theme. When personnel leave Defence, the base gate shuts behind them and stays shut, never to be opened again. They feel a sense of isolation and abandonment that they no longer have a purposeful job, that they are no longer part of that tight-knit Defence family. And even if they are lucky enough to have escaped physical or mental injury, they are scarred by a transition to civilian life that is neither seamless nor well supported in many cases. I would like to read an email I received from one veteran: Meryl, I just watched a story about the epidemic of veteran suicides on SBS. I was horrified. It informed me that a man I used to work with took his own life. He was one of the most positive and well-respected people I have ever had the honour of working with. Defence has failed him, and it has failed countless other victims. The Veterans Affairs Minister was given the chance to contribute to the discussion. He twice mentioned that there are budget allocations for veterans' assistance and that he was ""listening"". Well, here is a tip for him. Instead of listening, start doing. The longer you make people wait for help, the less likely they will ask for it. I have been trying to lodge a claim now for at least 10 years. Most of that time has been spent psyching myself up to attempt to deal with the insane amount of red tape. I suffered in service of my country. All of us who have served our country deserve more than what we are currently stuck with. I am sick of being told I don't matter. Veterans were raising not just problems with us but solutions, as well. They hold regular coffee mornings, bush retreats, physical challenges and interventions when drugs take their toll. Look around the world and see what other countries are doing, they suggested to us. Give veterans access to base amenities – so that they can use gyms and computers. This happens in other parts of the world. Involve them in base activities. Make them feel welcome. Give them a chance to work - with the right training for the right jobs. Recognise their skills and their qualities. Prioritise them as employees. Work with their families. This is such a critical part of it. Resource their advocates. Do not kick them out of Defence Housing on the day they are discharged. Talk about the drug problems. Talk about post-traumatic stress disorder. Talk about suicide. Make it easier to make claims, and easier to transition to civilian life. That is one of the most critical messages that they give. These people are the personality types who want to be in service. They want to serve their country. They step forward to serve their country. They want to have purposeful lives. Then, when that is cut off, it is not just that they have not got a job to go to. It is part of the very core of who they are-having that purpose to be in service to others. That is also cut off in many cases. That is really part of the scars that you cannot often see. We need a cultural shift in the way that we think about our ex-serving personnel. We need to be not just listening but doing. One veteran told me:  I have seen many broken people after service. Everyone has bad days, but if our medically-discharged personnel cannot get a foot in the door of a workplace because of a mental health issue, then what does that say? Give vets a chance to belong again - do not write them off. And from another: As Defence personnel, we are top of the pops. And then we are worthless. It's us and them, and we are no longer them. It was an emotional day that we spent with veterans in my electorate. The messages were very important. In an uncertain world, Australia is being asked to commit more troops to faraway conflicts. Our young people step forward to serve their country. Our more experienced personnel choose to go back. We need to make sure that when they come home we step forward to look after them. This bill goes a small way towards recognising that we need to make it easier for veterans, but we do have a long way to go.",51
25,Ms MARINO,BILLS," Australia has led the world in taking care of its veterans. The Returned and Services League was formed in 1916 to continue the camaraderie, concern and mateship shown amongst Australian diggers. It focused on the welfare of returned servicemen from the First World War. From a population of fewer than five million, 416,809 men enlisted-of whom more than 60,000 were killed and 156,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner. It is worth noting that more than a quarter of those who landed at Gallipoli on 25 April were Western Australians. In fact 32,231 men volunteered in WA. This was 10 per cent of our population at the time. It was the highest proportion of any state. The RSL was born from that conflict and it has looked after Australia's veterans from all subsequent conflicts, including our current veterans returning from more recent operations. The 2017 budget represents some very significant changes in how we look after and respect our veterans, and our current serving members. The Turnbull government is investing an additional $350 million to support our veterans. A major focus of that is on mental health. The rate of suicide especially amongst recent veterans is far too high, and the government is committed to turning those numbers around. We are building on the measure announced last year that gave free and immediate treatment for those suffering from depression, anxiety, PTSD and alcohol and substance abuse. Under this increase in spending, the government is committing to providing treatment for all mental health conditions. From now on, active personnel and veterans will receive free and immediate treatment without the burden of proof that prolongs the process and can actually worsen the health outcomes. It will make an immediate change in how veterans receive health care and relieve them of the anxiety-and it is anxiety-of going through a sometimes torturous process with the Department of Veterans' Affairs to simply prove their condition. There will be additional funding to streamline the DVA processes. I know all of this will be welcomed by the nine RSLs and the veterans they support in my electorate. I now want to acknowledge, and thank them for, the huge amount of work done by my local RSLs' welfare officers and advocates, who assist our veterans-wonderful volunteers like Ken Parish of the Bunbury RSL, Bev Streeter, Rob Lennox and Graeme Caddy of the Busselton RSL and Les Liddington of the Harvey RSL, to mention just a few. I also want to thank the office bearers and members of all RSLs in my electorate of Forrest,  who are so genuinely committed to the physical and mental health and well-being of their members. There are several other important measures, one of which has relevance to my home state. The government will provide health care for Australian participants of the British nuclear tests and Australian veterans of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. This is very important, because in Western Australia three tests were conducted by the British government on the Montebello Islands off the coast of WA. This measure is significant, and I thank and acknowledge the minister and the Turnbull government for this initiative. The extension of a gold card to access medical treatment will also be granted to veterans of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. All of these measures are of practical value to our veterans. They show the government's ongoing support for and commitment to veterans for the service they have provided to this country. I would say it extends to the families by default. I think I would be one of the few people in this House who is the daughter of a war widow, and I know what my older sisters and mother went through as part of that. So I commend this bill to the House and thank the government for taking these initiatives to show respect and support for our veterans and those ahead who will access these services.",53
26,Mr ZAPPIA,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017. In doing so, I support the comments of the member for Kingston who spoke earlier today and reflected Labor's position on this legislation-legislation which we will support. This legislation is long overdue. It recognises the injustice that many Australians have lived with for decades-an injustice that I have spoken about in this place on other occasions. I refer to the injustice that arose out of the British atomic testing program carried out between 1952 and 1963 at the Montebello Islands off the coast of Western Australia and at Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia. The contamination and health effects from those tests still affect some Australians today. When I spoke about this matter in 2014, I quoted the words of Reuben Lette, who summarised the injustice so well in a letter that he had sent to me and, I expect, to other members of parliament. At the time, Reuben Lette believed that there were fewer than 700 veterans still living who had been affected by the testing. Today, I pay tribute to Ben Lette and all of those people who, over the decades, have never given up the fight for justice, not just for themselves as servicemen but also for the civilians whose lives were placed at risk because of the testing. To use their language: 'We were used as human guinea pigs.' The even greater shame is that governments in Australia and Britain continued to deny the realities of what happened and continued to deny the compensation and medical support that victims were entitled to. Service records disappeared, and a culture of deny and frustrate prevailed throughout government departments that had responsibility. Just as disgraceful, personnel who were in any way associated with the tests were obliged to sign a secrecy statement at the time preventing them from speaking about their experience and knowledge of testing in the subsequent years. Because the Edinburgh RAAF base and the co-located weapons research establishment were linked to Maralinga, several people I came to know from Adelaide's northern suburbs  had personal knowledge of the tests. One of those persons is Brian, otherwise known as Mick, Lennon. Mick was employed at the time by the Department of Supply at the weapons research establishment and was later sent to Maralinga as a fire safety officer. He was there from 1955 to I believe the end of 1956. He was there when, he believed, eight of the tests were carried out at Maralinga and Emu Field. I believe there were two at Emu Field and six at Maralinga. He also went through the so-called safety measures, which included having an antiradiation injection before the test occurred. The procedure itself confirmed that the serious risks were known and anticipated. I have also seen documents from a person who was based at Maralinga at the time, which confirmed to me that the serious risks that were associated with the tests were known to authorities at the time as well. Mick was one of the fortunate ones who survived, but he saw several of his colleagues die within months or within a few years of the testing. He recounts to me how one of his colleagues in the days after the testing literally glowed in the dark. He saw first hand the horrific health effects that they died from. One of the pilots who flew the plane which dropped one of the bombs was also a Salisbury resident and also known to me. I will not name him because he has since passed away. After dropping the bomb that he was instructed to drop, he turned to return to base at Woomera using the flight path that he expected would enable him to avoid the huge dust cloud from the explosion. Unfortunately for him, the wind unexpectedly changed direction, causing his plane to fly straight through the plume of dust and smoke. Years later he too became very unwell, and he eventually died of cancer. Throughout those years, he attempted to be granted the gold card for his service, but his applications continued to fall on deaf ears. He was never given the gold card. His medical records went missing, with some claiming that they had been sent back to the UK. Indeed, many of these service personnel who were there at the time were UK service personnel. Interestingly, a lot of them, after the tests, were immediately sent back to the UK because they had also been in the front line of the risk. There were also Canadians there at the time. If a private company had denied their responsibility, as the Australian and British governments have, there would be community outrage and very likely government intervention. Yet, regrettably, a different set of rules has applied for governments. Six decades later, the recognition that has been denied for too long has finally been acknowledged. Whilst we support this legislation, as will, I am sure, those who are still surviving and will be entitled to the gold card and other benefits that arise from it, regrettably, for too many it is too late.",54
27,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017. I am proud to be part of a government which supports our veteran Australians. The government has invested an additional $350 million in this year's budget to support our veterans. More than 300,000 Australians rely on the government through support from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. These veterans, their families, dependents, widows and children, are a community that is growing younger, which sounds a little counterintuitive. As our World War II vets and even our Korean war vets pass away, the new point of focus is increasingly on those who have served in the Middle East. Our service men and women put their lives on the line for the nation in the defence of our values. They have served their country with the belief that democracy and freedom are ideals  to be upheld around the world. The sacrifices made by veterans and their willingness to fight in defence of our nation merit our deep respect and praise, and they deserve the very best Australia can offer in benefits and medical care. Often veterans return from service with wounds that are not obvious-wounds that we cannot see. Young men and women who are damaged by their experiences need support. Our older veterans struggling with psychological issues as a result of war experiences also need support, as do their families. The coalition is committed to providing veterans with the mental health care services they deserve and need, and the coalition will continue to support the mental health of our veterans. Our deepest gratitude and unparalleled respect must go to the men and women who keep us safe. Sometimes, unfortunately in the past, we have failed at repaying them in the ways they need when they most need it. It is the commitment of the coalition government that we ensure that we have a better understanding of the difficult mental and physical health issues that veterans face each day and help these men and women and their families face the battles they fight when they get home. Too often those emotional scars of service and resultant mental health issues can contribute to veteran homelessness or place veterans at the risk of homelessness. We have committed to mental health services for veterans to help them get back on their feet by making treatment for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and drug and alcohol misuse free for everyone who has served a day in the full-time Australian Defence Force. The coalition are committed to ensuring that current and future veterans and their families have the support they need, and we have a strong record in supporting veterans by ensuring more financial support and services to individuals than ever before. This bill will help this happen, but it is just part of a raft measures that we have provided to veterans over the last 12 months. The government has already created a significant legacy of achievements, including veteran mental healthcare treatment on a non-liability basis, gold cards for the British nuclear test veterans and the British Commonwealth Occupational Force veterans and, most importantly, delivering fair indexation for military superannuation. These measures focus on both the physical and the mental health of the veteran community and their future. We have assisted thousands as they have dealt with these difficulties. The government is providing more than $11 billion a year to support veterans, including through healthcare, income support pensions and allowances, by providing: $9.8 million to pilot new approaches to suicide prevention and improve care support available to veterans; $2.7 million to get veterans into the workforce through the Veterans' Employment Program, launched in November last year; $166 million to be provided in this year's budget to implement and modernise the Department of Veterans' Affairs antiquated ICT systems to provide easier access through DVA services; $18 million as part of the government's energy for the future package so that more than 235,000 DVA clients will receive one-off payments for energy bills; $9.1 million for accelerated access to rehabilitation services, incapacity payments and improved access to totally and permanently incapacitated disability pension for veterans working past the age of 65; $1.2 million to continue the income support bonus for DVA clients receiving an education allowance under either the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training  Scheme; and $5 million for the Australian War Memorial to examine ways to provide additional exhibition space. In my electorate of Grey, we have a veteran community that strongly supports veterans. It is, I think, very poignant that in these bills we are recognising those who served in those British atomic tests, whether they be military or not. They were, of course, largely conducted in my electorate at Maralinga and Emu Field and other places. These tests have long been a mark of perhaps misdemeanours-things that we did not understand at the time-and it is right that we should move to help those who were most affected. We are blessed to have strong, outstanding members of the veterans community in my electorate, like Vietnam vet Haydn Madigan of Port Pirie, who has supported and helped his fellow veterans for decades. He served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969. He has been local pension and welfare officer since 2005 and he is a TIP trained to level 4. Haydn spent nine years as president of the Port Pirie RSL sub-branch and three years on the SA state board. He knows his veteran community. He recently told me just how much his community has benefitted from the coalition's veterans policy. He congratulated the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Dan Tehan, for improving the accessibility of mental health support to all veterans. He said: This has previously been a traumatic process for the Veterans to go through and not all veterans have been able to access it at all. It finally recognises that veterans can be affected by their service. Haydn said the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service has been of great benefit to veterans and their families and that its continued government support will benefit veterans and their families. He said: Veterans find it difficult to seek employment outside the Services. The proposed 'Employment Programme' will greatly help their prospects of finding employment. And he has welcomed the adjustment to schedule 2, which removes one of the major tension points in veterans applying for intermediate and special pensions. Haydn said once you are part of DVA they are terrific, but the process of being accessed is a terrible painful process and it stops a lot of veterans applying for a disability pension. In his words, 'This was an archaic requirement and caused many veterans great hardships when applying for a pension.' So, in conclusion, I support this bill. I am confident that the combined efforts of our veteran support networks and the coalition government will ensure the best outcomes for those who have given selflessly to the service of their nation. I end this contribution by quoting John F Kennedy: As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them. Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) (12:02): I welcome this bill, the Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017, whose chief purpose is to provide better health care for those affected by the British nuclear tests, and I give credit to the government for including this measure in the budget. Considering those tests occurred 75 years ago, the measures are long overdue, and the people who will benefit from them are a very small proportion now of those who were affected, because many of those affected have died, often from being exposed to atomic  radiation. A study in 1999 for the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association found that 30 per cent of those involved in the tests died of cancer, most in their fifties. The experience of Australian veterans and affected civilians has been the same: high rates of cancer, bowel disease, hip and spine deformities, and crippling depression. That is why it is important to reflect on the long and painful road that has brought us to this point. And I thank other members for making contributions, including the member for Makin, who I listened to earlier. Not many Australians would appreciate that we consented to having 10 atomic bombs exploded in Australia, a number of which were more powerful than the weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Three were detonated in the Montebello Islands off the coast of Western Australia. Seven more were detonated in South Australia. On 27 September 1956, a 15-kiloton atomic bomb of the type called Red Beard was detonated from a tower at Maralinga. The mushroom cloud rose to a height of 11,400 metres, and radioactivity was detected in South Australia, the Northern Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland. These facts are not well known because the tests were conducted without proper scrutiny, and their impact was covered-up. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the people who worked hard and against a great deal of obstruction for many years to bring this part of our history to light-people like South Australian whistleblower Avon Hudson and journalists like Brian Toohey and Mark Colvin. And I encourage members to consider reading the fantastic recent book by Elizabeth Tynan called Atomic Thunder, about this dark episode in our history. It is available in the Parliamentary Library. I have it out currently, but will return it very soon. I am grateful to have the opportunity in this week to reflect on the British nuclear tests. That is partly because it is Reconciliation Week. Among the several and severe shortcomings in the decision-making process that led to the British nuclear tests was the unthinking and careless dispossession and displacement of Aboriginal people. It also happens this week that when I am back in Fremantle I am scheduled to meet with two Western Australian members of the Australian ex-Services Atomic Survivors Association- Mr Ray Whitby and Mr Rex Kaye. Ray Whitby was present at the Montebello tests, aboard HMAS Fremantle. He was 18 years old. He has suffered ill-health ever since, and he and his wife experienced five miscarriages. Those have been prevalent in the families of fellow sailors. Rex Kaye was in the Air Force and based at Woomera in the 1960s. On three separate occasions he was given the job of cleaning down a Vickers Valiant bomber that had flown through the mushroom clouds to collect samples. In 2000 he was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. The decision to detonate and blow-up atomic weapons was made without reference to the Pitjantjatjara or Anangu people. Whole communities were forcibly relocated to Yalata and Oak Valley, and traditional lands were poisoned forever. The area that South Australian Len Beadell surveyed as a test location was initially called X300. It was then named Maralinga for the purpose of the tests. It is not a local name; it is from a language group in the Northern Territory and it was chosen because it means thunder. The worse contamination at Maralinga was not caused by the detonation of the atomic bombs but by the hundreds of explosions in the Vixen test series, which involved blowing up plutonium to see what would happen if a nuclear bomb should ever be in a plane crash or subject to an artillery strike. This involved 22 kilograms of plutonium, and it left thousands of  fragments of plutonium all over the land's surface. Maralinga is now one of the most contaminated places on the planet. Several clean-ups occurred over the decades from the 1950s to the present-the 2000s. The early ones were poorly planned and ineffective. The most recent clean-up occurred as one of the processes that followed the MCClelland royal commission, which the Labor government initiated in the 1980s. That clean-up actually took place between 1996 and 2000. It cost $108 million and I understand it took some considerable effort to get the United Kingdom to agree to pay for half. Three-hundred and fifty thousand cubic metres of soil and debris from within a two-kilometre area at Maralinga was removed and buried in trenches. I will finish by again welcoming this important, if long-delayed, further instalment in responding to the profound damage inflicted on our people and our country by the British nuclear tests, which we agreed to. We would do well to reflect on the cultural and structural decision-making framework that existed in Australia at the time, because it allowed harm to occur-enormous harm-and allowed that harm to be covered up and to go unaddressed for a long time. It is still unhealed. The Australian government of the time was utterly careless in its consideration of Aboriginal people. It perpetrated a 1950s form of terra nullius in the dispossession and displacement of Pitjantjatjara and Anangu people. And the Australian governments at the time and since have not shown sufficient care for Australian service people, many of whom had their lives severely blighted and shortened by exposure to atomic radiation. As Rex Kaye has said, 'I spent years trying to be recognised as an atomic veteran, and I don't trust the government anymore.' Finally, I think it is crucial that we reflect on the fact that nuclear power and nuclear weapons continue to pose an extraordinary threat to human life and to the health of our planet. We should not regard that as someone else's problem. More Australians should know that their government is currently boycotting the United Nations process to advance a draft treaty banning nuclear weapons. One-hundred and thirty countries signed up last week; we continue to obstruct that process. More Australians should know that earlier this year we entered into a new agreement to supply uranium to the Ukraine for its civilian nuclear program. As we adopt an important but long-belated and imperfect measure to deal with the atomic radiation we inflicted on ourselves 75 years ago, let's be careful that we are not sleepwalking along the path to the next nuclear disaster.",55
28,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," It is a great honour to be here today speaking in favour of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017 and the recognition it provides for our veterans-people who have fought so hard for our country, who have fought to preserve our nation's security and our democracy. I thank these men and women for their service to Australia and I also thank current serving Australian Defence Force members for their service to our nation, their continuous protection of our nation. This bill has been amended to address many facets of veterans' affairs and post-service life that until now have been overlooked, including allowing interim incapacity payments at 100 per cent of the normal earnings to be paid until superannuation entitlements and a final incapacity rate are determined. It extends access to non-liability mental health treatment to all past and current serving men and women irrespective of the length or type of service. It aligns  the end date of veterans' incapacity payments with the incremental increase in the age pension age and it acknowledges the experiences of the veterans involved in British nuclear testing here in Australia. Labor welcomes this expansion. It means these veterans can now get the treatment they deserve. Also, it acknowledges the long-lasting consequences of the nuclear tests. In addition to providing full health coverage to British Commonwealth Occupation Force veterans, the bill will also cover pastoralists and Indigenous people who lived or worked in the vicinity of the testing sites. Including Indigenous people in health coverage for the British nuclear testing in Australia is a landmark decision. In the 1950s and the 1960s, when this testing was underway, Indigenous people, as we have found out in this chamber over the last two weeks, were the invisible people. In 1956 a test site and airstrip, known as Section 400, was built at Maralinga in South Australia, the home of the Anangu people. It served to achieve Britain's nuclear power status during the Cold War. Nuclear testing at the site greatly affected the Anangu people. Many were forcibly removed from the area and others refused to leave. Around 12,00 Anangu people were exposed to radiation at the time, suffering not just from radiological damage but psychological, social and cultural damage. The Anangu people lost their ability to deeply connect with their land, with their country, which was a huge blow to their spirituality, their sense of self, their identity, their being, their culture. And they lost their health. The radioactive fallout had serious effects such as sore eyes, rashes, vomiting, fever and early death. We have all seen the consequences of this radioactive fallout and how shattering it is physically and how appalling it is physically. In 1985 the royal commission into British nuclear testing in Australia showed little concern about the safety of the Indigenous people living off the land around these testing sites. Fortunately, in many ways, the issues have been addressed in terms of Indigenous justice since settlement. We still have a long way to go in terms of closing the gap; and this bill in some way helps to close the gap on this appalling issue, this tragic issue, which in many ways is a blight on Australia's history in terms of the treatment of the Indigenous community in this area. I cannot think of a better time than Reconciliation Week for this bill to be debated. Last week, we had the anniversaries of the Mabo decision and the 1967 referendum. The issue at stake here is reconciliation and an acknowledgement that the Anangu people suffered. In a small way, this bill acknowledges the anguish that the Anangu people faced when they were forced to live with the health consequences of the British nuclear testing in Australia. The bill addresses coverage for those people, who at that time were written out of history, were invisible in history, and whose health needs and needs in general were ignored for so long. The treatments available will include treatment for all conditions, not just malignant neoplasia, and its expansion has been welcomed by the veterans of the British nuclear testing and British Commonwealth Occupation Force. I am sure it will be welcomed by the Anangu people and Indigenous communities right around Australia who suffered during the testing. We need to ensure this kind of history never, ever repeats itself. As we have heard from my colleague beforehand, the land at Maralinga is still contaminated, despite the government's best efforts to cleanse it, clean it and rehabilitated it. That has happened three times-not once, not twice, but three times. That was in 1967, 2000 and 2009. The contamination of land  is debilitating for all the people who live around the area: for the farmers, it affects their ability to make money and to feed their families; for the families, it creates uncertainty about whether kids are safe playing in the backyard; and for the Indigenous communities, the Anangu people who live in that area, it decimates their whole culture and their connection to land-that ability to connect land with their culture and to connect with their country. Before a close, I just want to acknowledge the service, hard work, tenacity and tireless efforts of the National Boer War Memorial Association. Yesterday, after decades of fundraising, the National Boer War Memorial was finally dedicated. It was a wonderful ceremony. I attended it with the shadow assistant minister for veterans affairs. I just want to, for the record, say the names of who contributed so much after so long. This has been a tireless effort and a great exercise in tenacity. It is a great showcase of tenacity. I acknowledge Colonel John Haynes, Lieutenant Colonel Ron MCElwaine, Lieutenant Colonel Tony Larnach-Jones, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Guild, Major General Iain Spence, Bill Woolmore, Lieutenant Colonel David Deasey, Donna Hampton, Colonel Bob Guest, Chris Dawson, Lani Davis, George Bazochka, Major John Neenan, Lieutenant Colonel John Howells, Peter Wilmot, Monty Smith, David Thomas, Nigel Webster and all of the fantastic Boer War Memorial Association people here in the ACT who I have become very close to over the course of the last few years. I acknowledge Paul Hanlon, Reg Watson, the fund committee that was involved in this and everyone who is involved in making this National Boer War Memorial a reality after so much time and after so many decades. Thank you, congratulations. It is a major contribution to the memorialisation of those who served and died in the Boer War. It is a beautiful addition to ANZAC Parade. It was an honour to be there at the dedication with my colleague, the shadow minister for veterans affairs, yesterday and it has been absolute showcase of tireless dedication and tenacity. Congratulations to all involved.",59
29,Mr HART,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017 that is currently before the House. I have listened with great interest to the very insightful contributions that have been offered to the House by the members for Fremantle and Canberra. In particular, regarding the decisions that were made many, many years ago. I do trust the decisions that we take these days in this place have a greater sense of the impacts that we have on others and, in particular, on our Indigenous peoples. The first schedule of this bill amends the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006. It legislates for treatment for all conditions with respect to participants in the British nuclear tests, the BNT program in Australia; the British Commonwealth Occupied Force, the BCOF program; and civilians who were present at a nuclear test area during what is referred to as a relevant period. As I said earlier, these are obligations created in a bygone age at the commencement of what we now know to be the Cold War, when our understanding of what was appropriate with respect to nuclear materials handling was in its infancy. The BNT program saw the United Kingdom conduct 12 major nuclear weapons tests in Australia during the 1950s on the Montebello Islands off Western Australia and at Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia. As we heard in the address of the member for Freemantle, it seems that the obligations that we took upon ourselves at this time were to comply with the  wishes of others overseas-particularly from the United Kingdom-without regard to the effect upon our people, our citizens and, in particular, our servicemen and women and Indigenous landowners. It seems from the present day looking back that there was no regard, or insufficient regard, for the rights of the Indigenous occupants or traditional owners of those lands. Again I thank the member for Freemantle for his insight into the practical effects and the loss of connection with country. We are still dealing with the consequences now, 75 years later. In this bill before us the definition of 'nuclear test participant' is deliberately broad and it includes a person present in a test area and individuals involved in the transport, recovery, maintenance or cleaning of a vessel, a vehicle, aircraft or equipment that was contaminated as a result of its use in the nuclear test area. The definition also includes those BCOF veterans sent to Japan in 1946 to oversee the removal of the country's war-making capacity and maintain military control. As the legislation currently stands, there are no provisions for BNT participants and BCOF veterans to be granted treatment for all conditions under the Veterans Entitlement Act based on their nature of service. In 2010, the then Labor government provided additional assistance to BNT veterans who were also members of the ADF by reclassifying their service as non-warlike or hazardous peacekeeping service. This classification provided some nuclear test participants with access to some assistance under the Veterans Entitlements Act. This included access to the disability pension and the war widows pension. The bill that we have before us now extends that treatment to BCOF veterans and civilians, as well as providing full health coverage for all conditions. This is a good measure. I do note that the expanded coverage does not extend to the wives and widows of the veterans or to their children. Nevertheless, a widow may be entitled if that person can satisfy the usual requirements for a war widow's pension. This is a concern to me personally, given reports that the children and grandchildren of participants in the BNT program suffered from increased rates of a range of medical problems such as cancer, birth defects and heart disease, and increased rates of miscarriage and stillbirth. In fact, during the address from the member for Freemantle we heard the personal experience of one veteran in that respect. However, unfortunately that is not a matter for veterans entitlements legislation but another far more complex conversation about our obligations with respect to past wrongs. I acknowledge that the expansion as it stands has been welcomed by BNT and BCOF veterans, many of whom have experienced significant health complications. Veterans should be able to not only receive the treatment they deserve but also have their experiences, and the long lasting consequences of those experiences, acknowledged. Schedule 2 of this legislation seeks to amend the current outdated work history restrictions for the special and intermediate rates of disability pension provided to the VEA to better reflect modern working arrangements. These changes will remove the current requirement for claimants over 65 to have worked for 10 years with the same employer and for self-employed clients to have worked a minimum of ten years in the same profession, trade vocation or calling. Rather, the work history will only require a period of 10 continuous years of work in any field or vocation prior to applying for the special or intermediate rates of disability pension. This is an inherently sensible reform, given the reality of the modern work environment, where people have the potential to have many careers over their lifetime.  The final schedule of this legislation inserts instrument-making powers into the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, and the Military, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, enabling the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to determine a class of persons eligible to participate in an early access to rehabilitation programs. This is a most desirable outcome, given that early access to rehabilitation facilitates participation in economic activity, with all the ensuring benefits of work, recovery and well-being. The benefits of an early intervention such as provided for here are well recognised, and Labor is supportive of a process which is designed to improve outcomes for our ex-service Defence personnel. Indeed, Labor is supportive of all three measures in this bill. However, I would echo the sentiments of the member for Kingston, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs. It is imperative that our veterans are able to get assistance when they need it. I meet regularly with veterans and representatives of service organisations who consistently indicate to me that the complicated and adversarial DVA claim process and the prolonged waiting times diminish their feelings of value and, in some cases, leave them questioning why they served at all. We must recognise and value the experience and sacrifice of current and former service personnel in serving their country both at home and abroad. They deserve specialised, tailored assistance. Further investment in frontline services and towards structural improvements within the Department of Veterans' Affairs must be a priority moving forward to best honour and support the veteran community. Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (12:26): I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017. In honour of our veterans, citizens and first nations people involved with the British nuclear tests in South Australia and Western Australia, I pay homage and respect to the battle these people have had to fight to get to this point today. I have the utmost respect for all veterans for the selfless service they have given to this country to ensure that we live in the democracy we experience today. I welcome this bill. Between 1952 and 1963, the British government, with the agreement and support of the Australian government, carried out nuclear tests at three sites in Australia: Montebello Islands off the Western Australian coast, and at Emu Field and Maralinga in South Australia. Britain wanted attainment of nuclear power, and Australia was to be the dumping ground for Britain to get there. More than six decades later, the decisions of the then-Menzies government still cast a horrible shadow over our nation. These decisions were made by a government with a political agenda for national security and tapped into the Cold War fearmongering. Menzies's decisions forever changed the lives of thousands of people, and they serve as a timely reminder in this place that political agenda must never be placed above the lives of Australian people. What was referred to by the Anangu people as the puyu, meaning black mist, was a deadly cloud-as deadly as Hiroshima and Nagasaki. UK servicemen, Australian soldiers and civilians including our first nations people were exposed to radiation. Illnesses reported include cancer, blood diseases, eye problems, skin rashes, blindness and vomiting, which are all symptoms of radioactive poisoning. The decision by both the British and Australian governments to forcibly remove the Anangu people in Maralinga from their traditional lands in the lead-up to the testing was disgraceful. The forced relocations destroyed the traditional lifestyle of the Aboriginal families. The damage was radiological, psychosocial and cultural.  We can give compensation, but nothing will replace the land and the cultural connections, and no amount of compensation will make up for the loss of life that has occurred. Service men and women, citizens and our first nations communities not only had to fight deadly illnesses for their lives, but over the years have been forced to fight for recognition of what had been done to them and to continually fight for compensation. In 1984 a royal commission was established to inquire into these tests, and although the royal commission was welcomed it was still a long battle for those affected to reach this point today. In 2010 the then-Labor government provided additional assistance to British nuclear test veterans who were also members of the ADF by reclassifying their service as non-warlike or hazardous peacemaking service. This classification provided some nuclear test participants with access to some assistance under the VEA. But more needed to be done, and this brings us to the bill here today. Approximately 1,800 British nuclear test participants and 1,100 British Commonwealth Occupation Force participants will benefit from these changes, which are intended to begin on 1 July 2017. Labor is supportive of all three measures in this bill which seek to deliver on legislative reform. The first item this bill seeks to address is to legislate treatment for all conditions to participants in the British nuclear test program in Australia, the British Commonwealth Occupation Force and civilians who were present at a nuclear test area during a relevant period. It was not only those servicing who were affected; it was also the people cleaning equipment, vehicles and aircrafts who came into contact with nuclear waste and later suffered major health issues. The amendments in this bill build on those changes by the Labor government in 2010, extending treatment to veterans and civilians as well as providing full health coverage for all conditions. Schedule 1's amendments recognise that it is appropriate to provide treatment for all conditions for BNT veterans and BCOF veterans and civilians who were present at a British nuclear test area during a relevant period due to their possible exposure to ionising radiation. Changes have been included to contain a broader class of civilians to receive treatment, including our first nation people and other citizens in the vicinity of the nuclear tests. The amendments go a step further, by providing treatment for all conditions, not just malignant neoplasia. Furthermore, this bill rectifies the current outdated work history restrictions for the special and intermediate rates of disability pension provided in the VEA to better reflect modern working arrangements. The final schedule inserts instrument-making powers to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, enabling the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to determine a class of persons eligible to participate in early access to the rehabilitation pilot program. As it stands SRCA and MRCA claimants have to wait until their initial liability claim is accepted before they can access rehabilitation services. This process can take around four months to be completed, and for complex cases even longer. By contrast, those covered by the VEA are able to access assistance under the Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme without submitting a claim, as long as they meet service eligibility requirements. Today's bill represents many years of campaigning for these veteran citizens and our first nation people. As the member for Herbert, whose electorate is home to the largest garrison city in Australia, with a large veteran population, I welcome these necessary changes. Any  bill, amendment or necessary change which seeks to make life better for our veterans, I will always strongly support. This bill not only enables all people who were affected by the Black Mist to receive treatment they deserve but also acknowledges their experiences and the longlasting consequences they have endured as a result of these tests. Nothing will bring back lives, but this bill seeks to rectify those wrongs made more than six decades ago and to pay homage to the lives of those citizens. May governments never act on political agendas to the detriment of our Australian people but rather act in the best interests of the people they are elected to represent.",61
30,Mr GOSLING,BILLS," The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017 contains three schedules, and I particularly wish to focus on schedule 1. It legislates treatment for all conditions for participants in the British Nuclear Testing Program in Australia and the British Commonwealth Occupation Force and civilians who were present at a nuclear test area during a relevant period. This last category includes the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara peoples of Central Australia. They have fought for many years for recognition of the impact of the British Nuclear Testing Program on their country and people. In 2010 the then Labor government provided additional assistance to the British nuclear test veterans who were also members of the ADF. This gave some of them access to some assistance, and the current amendments build on these changes. They extend treatment to occupational forces, veterans and civilians as well as full health coverage for all conditions. Under these changes a broader class of civilians and Australian veterans will be eligible for treatment-pastoralists, other civilians and Indigenous Australians, like the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara peoples who were in the vicinity of the nuclear test areas-and they will be covered. The changes have been welcomed by veterans, many of whom had experienced significant health complications. They are a result of many years of campaigning and as a result of campaigning by Aboriginal organisations and individuals such as Yami Lester, who as a 10-year-old lost his sight after British nuclear testing at Emu Field. Labor welcomes these amendments. Not only do they enable veterans and civilians to receive the treatment they deserve; they also provide acknowledgement of their experiences and the long-lasting consequences they have endured. Sadly, many of those impacted have long passed. They were unable to access support and services. They have gone, but before they could know the dignity of acceptance of their experiences. These amendments provide an opportunity for us to reflect on all the men and women, Defence personnel and civilians, who have been impacted by war during peacetime. I would like to particularly acknowledge a long-forgotten part of our military history, the occupation forces. Members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force who were based in Japan from 1945 to 1952 included Australian troops who arrived there in February 1946. For two-thirds of the period of occupation the Commonwealth was represented solely by Australians. Throughout its existence the force was always commanded by an Australian officer and, although small when compared with the US occupation force, the Australians made a strong contribution proportionally to our population-as always has been the case. Australia has always fought above its weight. From 1946 to 1952 Australian forces were responsible for the military occupation of Hiroshima Prefecture. About 16,000 Australians served there in the force. At the peak of its  involvement the Australian force was responsible for over 20 million Japanese citizens and 57,000 square kilometres of country. It is worth reflecting on the role that those 16,000 Australians played for our country after the war. Their role was to disarm and demilitarise the former enemy and rebuild its basic infrastructure, including democracy after the long period that Japan was under imperial rule. I wish to acknowledge all Australians-as I said, around 16,000 of them-who served in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. These amendments are for them. I acknowledge also those impacted by British nuclear testing at sites like Emu Field and Maralinga. These amendments are for those people, too-people like Yami Lester. They act as a reminder of our history and the often shameful way we have treated veterans and those impacted by activities involving exposure to hazardous materials and chemical agents. I remember as a young boy Dad's equipment from the Vietnam War being in Pop's back shed. I remember wanting to play with it when I was a boy-even then I think I wanted to join the Army, as Dad had and as Pop had-but I remember Dad saying, 'No, don't play with that stuff yet because we need to give it a good wash-there was this stuff called agent orange.' It took some time for the harmful effects of that chemical to be known, and it behoves us to do our bit to make sure that our veterans, who may have been exposed to any form of hazardous materials or drugs, are looked after. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro) (12:37): It is a pleasure and a privilege to speak in support of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill and the measures it contains. Obviously the issue of the nuclear test veterans has been a long standing one and it is good that in recent years we have been coming to grips with some of these issues, including taking measures to fix the situation of our former prisoners of war of the Japanese as well. Obviously the member for Solomon and I had similar circumstances in our growing up, completely surrounded by the stories of veterans and our family's veterans' history. Every generation of my own family has served in the Army. I remember very vividly growing up with stories from both of my grandfathers, my uncles and my father, and then as a young man going to university I used to do a night shift cleaning toilets in a rehabilitation ward in a veterans hospital. I watched veterans suffering from the effects of their wars, and then when they passed away during the night I would have to clean them up and take them down to the morgue. I would see comrades watching their friends being taken away like that. The stories, their circumstances and what they were enduring were seared on my memory. Then, of course, I served with some wonderful people over the course of a couple of decades in many situations and saw the circumstances of our modern veterans. My father also worked on the nuclear test sites as a young man, and I remember him giving me a book about the nuclear tests, which I read as a young kid in the late sixties-I am giving away my age! Sadly, he passed away about 17 years ago so he will not see the benefit of this, but it is good that those veterans and civilians with us who were involved will be able to fall back on this legislation. The other provisions are also welcome. I would like to compliment the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Tehan. I really do feel that he is a man who has these issues close to his heart. I have always had a lot of time and respect for him, going back to when he was chair of the intelligence and security committee. He always had the nation's security interests at heart. I am a bit concerned about the workload that he has, though. There are not enough members assigned to the portfolio. This is the  lowest number of people involved in the Defence portfolio that we have seen, and I know that the Australian Defence Association has called for that to be addressed. The minister certainly needs some help, as he has quite a load of work, to free him up to concentrate even more on these issues. I spoke yesterday about the impact on veterans of the approach to pensions that we saw in earlier budgets through this time of the coalition government. Thankfully those matters have been largely resolved. But I have been concerned about the impact of the removal of the energy supplement on our veterans, war widows, war orphans and their families. I have been inundated with emails about the effect of the removal of that supplement, and I really do call on the government to have another think about it, because it is going to cause a lot of grief out there in the community. But I also welcome the minister's focusing on mental health issues. This has been a really serious concern for the whole community, looking at these terrible suicide rates that we have seen amongst veterans. For many years this was not being tackled properly, and I was pleased to see, when we came into government, that we came to grips to it in appointing Professor David Dunt to conduct a review of mental health services and support in the ADF. The review was a catalyst for more than $92 million to be invested and committed across DVA and Defence to improve mental health services for serving personnel and veterans. And we increased funding for the applied suicide and intervention skills training program to assist in that as well. We did the independent study into suicide in the ex-service community and the review of mental health care in the ADF and transition through discharge and introduced key initiatives such as case coordinators in DVA, who are now in place, and supporting clients who have complex needs. There were many aspects to tackling this, and I note that we worked on a project developed with the Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health to improve the training and competency of secondary mental health workers, which started in 2009. That was in addition to the $145 million that we spent altogether on veterans' mental health annually. A comprehensive Australian Defence Force mental health life cycle package was also produced in association with the ACPMH. That progressed the first three initiatives of the life cycle package, including the longitudinal study of psychological resilience, resilience-building programs, and models for the annual mental health screen. These were all really important initiatives, and they needed to be built on. One problem in this space, of course, is that there is never enough that you can do. You never get to the full answer to these problems. But that does not relieve us of the responsibility of continuing to work towards finding those solutions. And I think we need to really look at creative solutions and better stress management regimes for serving personnel as well as making sure that we are tracking these situations when people separate from the service and that there is a better fusion of data between serving personnel and DVA. One thing I am pleased about is now working with the member for Berowra in the Parliamentary Friendship Group on the prevention of suicide. This is one area that we will be focusing on, trying to provide a collecting point for great ideas and solutions to help resolve that issue as well. Suicide among veterans is a serious, serious problem at the moment, and it needs a fullcourt press. The old saying says that it takes a village to raise a child. Well, it also takes a village to support and sustain veterans. All of us in the community can play a role in that, and  I commend some of the organisations that have sprung up, who I was pleased to help, like Soldier On and Mates4Mates. I encourage the community and all those providers to reach out to those organisations and help support veterans in dealing with their transition from those situations into civilian life.",65
31,Mr SNOWDON,BILLS," I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017. I know that my colleagues, both on this side of the House and on the other side of House, have addressed most of the issues that we would want to address in terms of the needs of these victims of the nuclear test decisions, taken by a government so long ago, but for which they are wearing the consequences. It is absolutely true that we need to make sure that their interests are properly looked after and protected, and, most importantly, that they get the support they most properly need. I note that the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006 currently provides Australian nuclear participants with testing and treatment for malignant cancers. Under these changes, of course, as we have been told, a broader range and class of civilians and Australian veterans would be eligible to receive treatment. In addition to those veterans, pastoralists and Aboriginal people in the vicinity of the nuclear test areas, other civilians who were present in those areas during the relevant period will be covered. I want to spend a few moments to talk about the Yankunytjatjara people who were the subject of being removed from their country, as they were in those days. There was no real recognition of Aboriginal interests or Aboriginal rights, and, sadly for us, that meant that many of these people in the area of Maralinga and the Emu Junction area became victims of these tests. I want to refer to one man, who is a very good friend of mine and someone I have known since the late 1970s, Yami Lester. Yami is a Yankunytjatjara man who was born, I think, a little before me, although probably not too much before me. In the 1950s he was blinded by a black mist from the south. After this mist passed, and he was a young Aboriginal man living with his family, his family experienced sudden deaths, outbreaks of skin rashes, vomiting, diarrhoea and temporary and permanent blindness. Yami, sadly, suffered the consequences of this and became blind. Yami tells us that some of the people were so weak they could not go down to the nearby waterhole and skim the black scum off the water which came from the black cloud, and actually died of thirst. It is generally accepted that this mist came as a result of the nuclear tests-the Emu Junction tests and the Maralinga tests-which were taking place at the time. I have known Yami because he is an advocate and a leader for the Yankunytjatjara and Pitjantjatjara communities of the southern part of the Northern Territory and the northern part of South Australia. He has been active, and it was, almost certainly, his activity that led to the recognition of the impact of these atomic bomb tests, particularly at Maralinga, and to an acknowledgement that Aboriginal people had been adversely affected. Remember, these people had been shoved off their land. Their land was stolen from them for the purposes of a foreign nation, in partnership with us, holding controlled nuclear tests on the land. Is it any wonder that they were concerned about the impact? His actions most certainly helped lead to the MCClelland royal commission in 1985, which found significant radiation hazards still existed at the Maralinga test sites. Recommendations  included group compensation for the Maralinga and Tjarutja people and an extensive long term clean-up operation to restore the land. Minister Tehan, who is at the table-and I thank him for being here-on ABC radio, on Q&A, said in relation to this legislation we are talking about this morning: 'The measure will provide gold cards to Indigenous people present at or near Maralinga, Emu Field or the Montebello Islands at the time of the British nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s.' Minister, I thank you for that. But sadly, I am standing here as a former minister and as a member of governments who over the period really failed to recognise, apart from in the Maralinga royal commission, the personal impact that this has had on individuals and families. For that I am sorry. As Yami has said, blinded by the atomic test himself, his family and extended family suffering immeasurably as a result of these bomb tests: 'This support comes 60 years too late … Most of our people have passed away. They were young ones then. Now they are older ones, a few of them still living today' So the benefit will be limited to the extent of the numbers of Aboriginal people it will impact upon, and that is a worry. It is significant that Yami said: 'Our people were sick, very sick. They were on the lands, they needed help. They're doing it too late. They didn't do compensation before, early. They didn't do it.' Yami's daughter, Karina, whom I know very well, and who is active in fighting against the possibility of nuclear waste dumps in South Australia, has said: 'Why now? This was recommended by the royal commission into the British nuclear tests in the 1980s. It is too late for those who have passed, but I am pleased to those who are still alive.' It is very difficult, for me particularly, because I have lived and worked in the Pitjantjatjara lands with the Yankunytjatjara Pitjantjatjara people, and I know families who are directly affected by these bomb tests, including Yami and his family. They are right. This is 60 years too late. I apologise, because as a member of this parliament I should have been advocating a lot more strongly than I have done for their cause. I pay tribute to the minister for at last cooperating in recognition of their suffering. Whilst we are talking about the veterans-and I pay my great respect to those veterans who are impacted by these bomb tests-I cannot let pass the opportunity to try and get people to understand the absolutely horrific impacts these bomb tests had on the Aboriginal people of South Australia. I suspect there may be a few people who will be properly recognised in terms of treatments as a result of this legislation, but absolutely nothing we can do here will ever alleviate the pain and suffering of those who have passed, and their families who have felt that in an ongoing way. Minister, I am thankful for the legislation. I am so sad that it has taken 60 years for us to at last recognise the health impact this has had on the Yankunytjatjara Pitjantjatjara people of South Australia. To understand this and to know that country as I do is to understand that it is about not only the physical health but the mental well-being and the social and emotional well-being of a group of people whose rights and interests were totally ignored by the governments of the day. Whilst they have been recognised subsequently-thankfully-it is a lesson to us about why it is important to listen to the voices of Aboriginal people when it comes to understanding the history of this country.",68
32,Mr DICK,BILLS," I rise to join colleagues to speak in support of this bill, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017. In following on from the member for Lingiari, the father of this House, I want to acknowledge that it is 30 years since the member for Lingiari was elected on 11 July 1987. In listening to his contribution  today, I note the sorrow and pain that he demonstrated on behalf of those impacted by decisions of the past. But I also acknowledge that this is a positive day. It is a positive day for both sides of the House to join, recognise and acknowledge pain and suffering that has happened, but, also, it is a way forward for other serving veterans. I want to acknowledge the minister today. When we make decisions in this House, such as we are doing today, it may not be on the front page of the news tomorrow and it might not lead the news tonight. But I think in the last 12 months since I have been elected, today is one of those important days in our Commonwealth where both sides of the politics-and I think all 150 members-acknowledge what has happened in the past, but also pave a way for the future. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, as the son of a World War II veteran, I am particularly moved by the stories, the suffering and the pain of those who have served our nation, but also empowered by what this Commonwealth and parliament can do to honour those sacrifices. I want to speak briefly today to show my support for these changes for this bill that the government is putting forward. In doing so, I acknowledge the good work of Minister Tehan and the shadow minister, the member for Kingston, in making sure that the mistakes of the past are not made in the future, as well. The three important measures will provide better and more appropriate support for our veterans. As we have heard from speaker after speaker, we acknowledge that the bill legislates treatment for all conditions to participants in the British nuclear test program in Australia. I have listened to the debate in my office today. I have heard and witnessed first hand the testimony from people involved-the thousands of Australians. Although we are only dealing with a small number, it is an important number for the civilians and ADF members that were part of that program, particularly those civilians. We heard from the Indigenous members of the community who were present at a nuclear test site during that relevant period. It may have been 60 years ago but it is still important to place on record that period in Australia. Currently, there is no scope for British nuclear test participants and the British Commonwealth Occupation Force veterans to be granted treatment for all the conditions under the VE act based on the nature of their service. This changes that. This ensures that there will be the treatment given. Although we are dealing with the three sites and we have heard that former governments have made the decisions, it is up to us now to make sure that we are honouring that service. Schedule 2 seeks to amend the current outdated work history restrictions, especially in intermediate rates of disability pension provided in the VE act, to better reflect modern working arrangements. That is an important initiative that Labor will be supporting today, alongside the government. We understand that it reflects the reality of a modern work environment where people have the potential to have many careers over their lifetime. Schedule 3, the final schedule, inserts instrument-making powers into the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, enabling the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to determine a class of person eligible to participate in an early access to rehab pilot program. This is something that I am really supportive of. Having read the amendments, I know that if they are confirmed, as I am sure they will be, a six-month pilot program will be undertaken for a group of 100 participants over the next 12 months.  Members on both sides of the House know the recognised benefits of early intervention, and we are supportive of a process which is designed to improve outcomes for our ex-serving defence personnel. Representing many ADF families in the electorate of Oxley, many who have served overseas and have served in difficult situations, I know the importance of these pilot programs. On top of that, as a supporter of veterans groups, particularly in the south-west of Brisbane, I know the great work that they do, particularly in supporting younger veterans and ensuring that they have pathways to employment and pathways to success. So we support these recommendations before us today. I thank the minister for his work, and I acknowledge the good work of many members of this parliament. And I look forward to supporting future legislation to honour the work of our veterans and to support them in everything that they do.",69
33,Mr TEHAN,BILLS," I thank all members for their contribution to the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget Measures) Bill 2017. The bill gives effect to three of the veterans' affairs 2017 budget measures, all of which will benefit the defence and ex-service community. The first measure would provide improved health care for Australian participants of the British nuclear tests and civilians present at a nuclear test area during a relevant period and Australian veterans of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. In recognition of the possible exposure to ionizing radiation experienced by both Australian veterans of BCOF and the BNT veterans, the government has decided to provide a gold card to these veterans, which will enable them to access medical treatment for all conditions. This program will also provide healthcare coverage for pastoralists, Indigenous people and other civilians determined to be within the same vicinity as the participants of the British nuclear tests. From 1 July 2017, it is expected that 2,800 people will be able to access these expanded services. The government has committed $133.1 million over the forward estimates to this measure. The second measure would amend the current outdated work history restrictions for the special and intermediate rates of disability pension provided in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to better reflect modern working arrangements. The changes would remove the current requirement for claimants over 65 to have worked for 10 years with the same employer, and for self-employed clients to have worked for 10 years in the same profession, trade, vocation or calling. In the modern workforce, these expectations are unrealistic, and the government recognises this. Instead, the work history requirement for special and intermediate rates of disability pension would just require a period of 10 continuous years of work in any field or vocation, with potentially multiple employers, prior to applying for the special or intermediate rates of disability pension. The third measure would facilitate early access to a rehabilitation pilot program for certain veterans and Australian Defence Force members. Early access to rehabilitation facilitates participation in economic activities, with all of the ensuing benefits of work and recovery, assists in minimising the ongoing effects of injury and illness and promotes recovery and well-being. A six-month pilot program providing early access to rehabilitation assessment to a group of 100 participants will be undertaken in the 2017-18 financial year.  I would like to acknowledge the contribution to the debate of this bill made by the member for Grey, who noted that over 300,000 Australians rely on support from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. He knows that the government's extra investment of $350 million will mean to them. As he put it, this money, particularly in mental health support, will help veterans fight the battles they face when they return home from service. For his electorate, this budget has particular significance; it is where some of the British nuclear tests took place. As he said, we are correcting some things we did in the past that we did not understand by doing something today that we know is right. I thank the member for Grey for his support in making this possible. I would also like to thank the member for Solomon, who noted the significance of this budget and the measures for the BNT veterans and civilians. He knows what it means in particular for the Indigenous people who were impacted by these tests. I thank the member for Forrest, who has a long history of involvement with veterans and knows what some of the changes in this budget will mean for her community. As she mentioned, streamlining the DVA processes will be welcomed by all veterans in her electorate because it will mean wait and claims times will come down. I would also like to mention the contribution of the member for Lingiari, who spoke of his personal dealings with families who have been impacted by the British nuclear tests and apologised on behalf of previous governments who have not acted in this area. I commend the member for Lingiari for his heartfelt contribution to this debate. Finally, I would like to thank the shadow minister for her support and contribution and for helping ensure that we get this bill through in time so we can provide the support come 1 July. Thank you, shadow minister, for your help and cooperation in ensuring that we can get the help to the veterans as soon as possible. The shadow minister knows that this budget will deliver a revolution in how we provide mental health support to veterans. We will now commence the job of making sure all veterans who need help know they can get it. I will finish by asking all members of the House to reach out to veterans and ensure that the word is publicised that there is help and support for all mental health conditions now. We want to make sure they get help as early as possible because we all know that is the best way to make sure you can recover. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",71
34,Mr TEHAN,BILLS," by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time.  Comcare and Seacare Legislation Amendment (Pension Age and Catastrophic Injury) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) (13:08): I rise to speak on the Comcare and Seacare Legislation Amendment (Pension Age and Catastrophic Injury) Bill 2017. Labor will support this bill. This bill amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Seafarers Act to ensure that injured employees in receipt of weekly compensation payments for incapacity can continue to receive those payments until they reach pension age as defined in the Social Security Act 1991. The qualifying age for the age pension under the Social Security Act 1991 will begin to increase on 1 July this year. By linking compensation for incapacity with the pension age rather than age 65, these amendments will result in no gap between the cessation of compensation for incapacity and eligibility for receipt of the age pension. This bill also amends the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the seafarers act to align these acts with minimum benchmarks for catastrophic workplace injuries in the National Injury Insurance Scheme. The bill removes the cap on weekly compensation payable for household services and attendant care services for employees with catastrophic injury. An employee with a catastrophic injury will also be eligible to receive compensation for household services from the day of the injury, without the current 28-day waiting period. While we support the bill and the measures it takes to align the payments to the pension age, it is worth noting the Turnbull government's agenda to increase the pension age to 70. This signature unfair policy from the horror 2014 budget is still there. The policy to have the pension age increased to the age of 70 is still an objective of the Turnbull government. In effect, the Prime Minister of this country and of this government wants to give Australia the oldest pension age in the developed world. The Prime Minister wants to make construction workers, nurses, tradies, farmers, seafarers and other workers work until they are 70 before they are eligible for the age pension. It is something that underlines how out of touch this Prime Minister and this government are when it comes to the difficulties that confront workers in workplaces over this period. The idea put forward, without any planning whatsoever, that people who have much of their work being of a physical nature could actually work until 70 says how little the government understands workplaces. We are not suggesting that people should not be able to voluntarily work beyond the age that is currently set down for the pension, but we know that there are many people who just cannot work up until that age. It is quite extraordinary that this country will be in a position to have the highest pension age of the developed world as a result of the objectives of the government. I applaud the bill to fix up the current arrangements and increase the age so that there is no longer a gap insofar as insurance and compensation are concerned and their intersection with the pension age, but I think this bill is a reminder that we have a government which is in pursuit of lifting the pension age to 70 years of age. There are people now in their 40s and 50s who will have to work until they are 70. If people understood the nature of the work of  construction workers or nurses or people who work in aged care, the difficulties they confront, the injuries that arise and the wear and tear on their body, then the idea that they would have to work until 70 would just not be tenable. What it would need, if we were to ever consider it at all, would be much greater involvement in the way in which people would undertake work in the period up until their retirement age. I do not think there has been sufficient work undertaken. But I do know this, though: before I was in this place, I represented working people and I saw too many unable to continue to undertake work because of injuries-hernias, carpal tunnel syndrome, back injuries or whatever it was-and the stress placed on their body. People think it is a problem that afflicts male occupations, but, as I have said and as everyone knows who has any understanding of these issues, this applies to nurses as much as it does to construction workers. It is extraordinary that the government has not contemplated this problem. We do support this bill, because we are removing the gap that exists currently. We do accept that there are people who want to work beyond the current pension age-there is no problem with that-but we do not accept the idea that you cannot get a pension until you reach age 70. The pension age keeps increasing and people have to keep watching it move away from them when they have worked so many years of their life, particularly if they have been vulnerable physically in their workplace and are feeling the wear and tear of work over many, many decades. We feel that little consideration has been given to this initiative. Indeed, it is extraordinary too that much of the 2014 budget has been revoked, rejected and repudiated by the current Prime Minister and the government, but not this policy and not the policy to lift the pension age to the highest level of any comparable country. I think the government has to rethink its position. The Prime Minister likes to say he believes in fairness, but he actually is trying to force millions of Australians to work until they are 70 before they can access the age pension. We will support this bill, but we will not support Malcolm Turnbull's cruel attempts to increase the pension age. While I am on my feet, I would also like to say that it is worth reminding the parliament, and through it hard working Australians, that the Turnbull government is still pursuing two other bills to amend the Comcare scheme. These are related; these are incidental to the bill before us. The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Improving the Comcare Scheme) Bill 2015, with its Orwellian title, will exclude workers from the Comcare scheme and significantly reduce the compensation available for those who remain eligible. This bill attempts to reduce the liabilities of the Comcare scheme at the expense of people injured at work. There is also the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 which, if enacted, will directly and indirectly risk the workplace health and safety of Australian workers. It will also remove the rights of Australian workers to fair and reasonable cover when they suffer the misfortune of a work-related injury or illness. This government will stop at nothing to attack workers. It is only because of the staunch opposition of the Labor Party that these bills have been stalled and have been prevented from being enacted, and we will hold that position because of the unfairness intrinsic in those two other bills. To sum up, we do support this bill. This is fixing something that needs to be fixed, and for that reason we will support it. But we will never support the coalition's agenda to create coward workforces that are easy to hire, easy to fire and more open or more vulnerable to  injury, where if you are injured they deprive you of the things you need to return to work or have a decent life in the event you cannot return to work. This bill, for the reasons I have outlined, is something we can support; but we are concerned that the government still has not given up on pursuing those other areas to change compensation and Comcare arrangements in this country. We would ask the government to rethink its position on that and we would ask the government to rethink its position on the harsh policy to increase the pension age to 70 that it announced in 2014, which I believe has been ill thought out. It shows a callous disregard for workers and it shows no understanding of workplaces and the difficulties that workers confront, whether they be construction workers or nurses, in dealing with the wear and tear on their bodies and the difficulties each and every day when they do such magnificent work in this country.",72
35,Ms CHESTERS,BILLS," As the previous speaker has said, Labor will be supporting this bill. The Comcare and Seacare Legislation Amendment (Pension Age and Catastrophic Injury) Bill 2017 does correct an anomaly that has been created because we have lifted the pension age, yet there is the flow-on effect to other areas of legislation, like safety rehabilitation and compensation for seafarers. This bill corrects that. It ensures that people who suffer a catastrophic injury at work, who are being covered by compensation, will continue to be covered. It will not finish at 65 and then force them into the unfortunate situation of being on Newstart for two years. It means they will continue on the current schemes until they reach the pension age of 67. I rise to say a few things about injured workers and about how it is the responsibility of all of us in this place to ensure that we have best practice laws and to ensure that in a time when workers are in need our help, when they have suffered a catastrophic injury at work, we are doing all we can to support their recovery. But if they not able to recover to return to work, we will support them in their life and until they reach the pension age. One of the other good things about this particular bill is that it ensures that household services will continue without the current 28-day waiting period. An employee with a catastrophic injury will also be eligible to receive compensation for the household services from the day of the injury without incurring the current 28-day period. This is good news for families where this occurs. Let's just think about these families for a moment. Someone gets up and goes to work as everybody does, and a catastrophic injury occurs. The first thing that happens is that person goes to hospital. All of a sudden, what is happening at home? If they have children, who is picking up the children? If they have to modify the home, who is there to do that? If they need a nurse at home, who is there to help with that? When you have a catastrophic injury you need help from day 1. The 28-day waiting period is something that does not fit with what has actually occurred, so it is a good development that people will now receive household services from the day of their injury. Where do these injuries occur? We have a lot of dangerous industries in this country, such as manufacturing. I recall in my time at United Voice when I was there as an organiser that some of the most heart breaking phone calls I would receive were from delegates to say there has been a serious incident at work and asking us to come down and meet with the members and talk to the staff about what has happened. In manufacturing food and beverages there was a particularly bad incident at CUB where somebody was quite severely injured. They have not  and will not return to work. In that particular case, unfortunately, the company did not follow the direction of WorkSafe or the PIN notices that proceeded. Almost 12 months later, another catastrophic incident occurred and an individual-a worker-lost their life. At the time, the fine handed down against the company at the county court was the largest in Australian history for negligence in a workplace causing death of an employee. Unfortunately, since then there have been other fines issued for employers who have knowingly not followed safety instruction from the authorities and bigger fines have been issued. It is a problem for us in this country in industries where there is dangerous work going on. Incidences are increasing, not decreasing. I would like to talk about another industry where we have injuries and incidences on the increase, and that is the construction industry. We know through media reports, investigations and public findings that in workplaces that are not unionised, where there is not a good safety committee in place, where there are employers that are not acting in the best interests of their workforce and where they are rushing to get things completed we have seen an increase in the numbers of deaths or serious injuries. In Perth, two backpackers were killed because they had lunch in the wrong spot and a big concrete sheet fell on these individuals. There was the very public case of a backpacker who took off her safety harness and fell down a shaft. Another, working for the same company, was killed at work when she had been working on the site for less than six months. All of these cases are going through their process of inquiry. What is frustrating is that they could have been avoided if the company had been proactive, had engaged the union-the CFMEU-had engaged their workforce and had proper safety arrangements and training requirements in place. The injuries within construction are rising. It is no coincidence that it is at the same time the ABCC has been reintroduced. It appears that, just as in the past, the moment that the government introduces a draconian regime like the ABCC, the focus is all on the union officials and not on the employers. We see a body that chases people about right of entry notices rather than one that chases employers who have not ensured that they have a safe workplace. I will give one example from before it was the ABCC, when it was Fair Work Building and Construction. It was in my own area, the Bendigo electorate. This was during the process of building the Ulumbarra Theatre. There was a significant contribution from the federal government and state and local governments to build the Ulumbarra Theatre. There was a serious workplace incident: a worker fell into the orchestra pit. The safety equipment that had been in place, the barriers that had been up, had been removed, and he fell in, and almost literally lost his head-there was some quite serious damage to the back of his neck and to his head. He was then in hospital for quite some period of time. He, to this day, has not returned to work and may never return to work. At the time, it made the news. Union officials were on site. Workers were on site. They got him the best quality care that they could. This is also a site where we had a number of contractors. They were not paid on time by the builder. They went to the wall. They lost everything. Their workers lost everything. They were able to get some stuff back through GEERS. So this was a project that was riddled with problems. Yet what happened six months later was not that the company was fined for this worker almost literally losing his head and suffering a catastrophic workplace injury; it was not that the companies that had gone broke  received compensation because the builder had not paid them on time-no. The organiser for the CFMEU was pulled up before Fair Work Building and Construction, which said: 'You didn't produce your worker's permit when asked.' I am really concerned that the government is putting workplace health and safety at the very end of its list, as their dogged pursuit and their ideological hatred of unions become the first priority of this government-not ensuring best practice when it comes to workplace health and safety; not ensuring that workers are paid on time; not ensuring that we are cracking down on phoenixing so that employees are paid by their employer and do not have to go through the FEG program to receive their basic entitlements. There are so many areas in our workplaces that this government needs to improve on, yet their only focus has been on bullying and on pushing forward on draconian rules and laws like the ABCC that target unions and target workers who are only trying to ensure that all of their workmates, at the end of the day, go home safe. As a previous speaker also said, there is a real problem with this government trying to push the pension age from 67 up to 70. It is something that was in this government's first budget in 2014, in their 2015 budget, in their 2016 budget and now is in their 2017 budget. This government is still not listening. They are still not listening to people who work in trades-in trades where you need to use your physical body. These people are not like politicians, who get to sit on the nice green benches; these are people who, day in day out, are on their feet and whose bodies, for many of them, will not last until they are 70. I am talking about tradies, nurses, farmers, seafarers, and cleaners-like our own Parliament House cleaners, who have still not received a pay rise since this government scrapped the Clean Start guidelines; they are still on the same money. I note that, whilst we, the politicians in this place, have received a pay rise and whilst our staff have now received a pay rise, the cleaners here in Parliament House have not. They work really hard. Cleaning is a job that is tough on the body. They have not received a pay rise yet. I would like to take this opportunity to call on the government to think about their cleaners and reward them with a fair and decent pay rise. They have not had one, and it is not right. Cleaning is a job which people struggle to do until they are 70. Whilst some are still cleaning until they are 70, when you chat to a cleaner who is 70 they say it is because they still need to keep working. They still need to keep paying the bills, they still have a mortgage or their husband or wife is not working. But they should not have to be made to clean",75
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member for Bendigo will have an opportunity that time to continue her remarks. NA Sri Lanka: Floods,77
37,Mr HILL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to record my distress and that of thousands of my constituents regarding the devastating mudslides and floods that are presently affecting large swathes of Sri Lanka. The worse affected is the Ratnapura district, east of Colombo. I was sad to learn this morning that the death toll has now passed 200, with 202 confirmed dead and  more feared. There are 600,000 people displaced, and these are the worse floods in 14 years to affect Sri Lanka. The good news is that the water is receding slowly. However, the United Nations has warned that with increasing numbers of displaced people in temporary shelters, the risk of disease-particularly waterborne disease-continues to rise in the coming days and weeks. There are hundreds of thousands of people still with no access to water or electricity and they are fully reliant on voluntary services. I was pleased that over 24 countries so far have pledged support. Australia, along with Japan and Pakistan, has made an initial commitment of $500,000 for supplies, water purification tablets and so on. Sri Lanka is very important to me; it is place I have visited. It is a country I love and I have people I consider as family there, as well as Sri Lankan people in my electorate and in my office. In this, the 70th year of diplomatic relations between Australia and Sri Lanka, I urge and encourage the Australian government to monitor the situation and to continue to be generous in our response in the coming weeks. Canning Electorate: Infrastructure",77
38,Mr HASTIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This government is committed to infrastructure projects that will unlock growth in regional and rural Australia. The community of Austin Lakes in my electorate of Canning is a prime example of a regional area constrained by lack of infrastructure. Since it opened, Austin Lakes has grown to include Austin Cove Baptist College, the only K to 12 school in the Shire of Murray; a shopping centre, the first to be established in South Yunderup, comprised of an IGA, owned by Karen James; a cafe; a liquor store; a pharmacy and a medical centre; and a $6 million family recreation park. Despite being situated alongside the Forrest Highway, the main arterial road between Perth CBD and the south-west, residents in Austin Lakes have no immediate freeway access. The nearest freeway interchange is at Pinjarra Road, a seven-minute drive north. For residents wanting to head south it is quicker to take this journey than to drive 15 minutes past Pinjarra to Greenlands Road. A freeway interchange at Beacham Road would reduce travel time drastically. For Waroona students attending Austin Cove, it would shave 30 minutes of their morning journey. A freeway access road into Austin Lakes has the potential to generate $1.8 billion in private investment over the next 20 years, providing a boost to the local construction industry. This proposal is supported by the school community, the residents, the developers and the shire. I will be calling on the government for its support. Western Australia Day Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) (13:33): This coming Monday is Western Australia Day. WA Day is celebrated across my great state with a WA Day Festival. There are events on all around the astounding vastness of this state over the coming long weekend and I urge all Western Australians to get involved and to enjoy the weekend. Of course, I thank all those West Aussies who will be working across the weekend and on the public holiday. Rest assured, Labor will do all we can to protect your penalty rates. If you are around our beautiful capital city of Perth you might want to get along to the State Of The Art Music Festival. Those in my electorate of Brand might do best to jump on the  Labor-built Southern Suburbs Railway up to the city to see this amazing line-up of homegrown artists: rock legends Karnivool, ARIA-award-winning Drapht, the legendary Gyroscope, Bob Evans and the fantastic POW! Negro. And, of course, there is the wonderful Katy Steele and many more. WA has produced amazing musical talent. You only have to speak to my good friend Simon Collins, the music editor of The West Australian, or to Mike Tucak-a great advocate of the arts and music-to hear that. Or do yourself a favour and go to watch the brilliant documentary Something in the Water, written and directed by Aidan O'Bryan. It shows very clearly that indeed there is something amazing in the artistic waters of Western Australia that continues to produce extraordinary talent in the proud tradition of The Triffids, the Hoodoo Gurus, INXS, The Scientists, Eskimo Joe, Dave Warner's From the Suburbs, Jebediah, The Waifs, the Baby Animals, Tame Impala, SanCisco and Red Jezebel. The list goes on and on. (Time expired) Corangamite Elecorate: Regional Jobs and Investment Package",78
39,Ms HENDERSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I have some great news on how the Turnbull government is working hard to create regional jobs. Our Geelong and Corangamite regional $20 million jobs and investment fund is now open for applications. The fund is aimed at investing in projects that will diversify regional economies, stimulate long-term growth, create jobs and enable applicants to enter new markets and sectors. This is absolutely great news and shows how we are working for those regional jobs, including in my electorate. Funding will be available across three streams: local infrastructure, business innovation, and skills and training. I thank our region's jobs and investment taskforce led by Deakin University Vice Chancellor Professor Jane den Hollander for completing an investment plan to underpin the funding priorities of the fund. Thank you also to Helene Bender, Bronwynne Calvert, Elaine Carbines, Justin Giddings, John Gorman, Associate Professor Mark Kennedy, Jodie Sizer and Kylie Warne-a great team and great representatives of our community. Local businesses, councils and not-for-profit organisations are encouraged to attend a couple of information sessions to learn all about how they can make an application to this wonderful fund. This is a great day for Corangamite and shows once again how hard we are working for regional jobs across Australia. Canberra: Coalition Government",79
40,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Note to Senator Macdonald: get out of Parliament House and see the real Canberra. Come with me and see that families are juggling a mortgage, rent, a car loan and bills, just like everywhere else in Australia. Come with me and see that pensioners are trying to make ends meet on a fixed income, just like everywhere else in Australia. Come with me and see that people living with a disability are trying to lead a dignified life, just like everyone else in Australia. Come with me on a Meals on Wheels run. Come with me to the Foodbank at Lanyon, at Tuggeranong, and at Reid. Come with me to a breakfast club at a primary school or a high school in my electorate. Come with me to southeast Tuggeranong, where Canberrans are battling with internet speeds below one megabit per second-kids who cannot do their homework or their tests and small business people who have to operate out of cafes. Then you will know that your Senate estimates comments are complete and utter rubbish-headline-seeking, Canberra and Public-Service bashing, complete and utter rubbish. Those comments only underscore yet again the complete  and utter disdain that Liberals and Nationals have for Canberra and for the Public Serviceservants of democracy who take pride in their work, who take pride in serving our nation, in the regions, in remote Australia, in Darwin. They take pride in the fact that they want to make a difference- (Time expired) Page Electorate: Woolgoolga Surf Life Saving Club",79
41,Mr HOGAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This Saturday night, 3 June, is going to be a great night at the Woolgoolga Surf Life Saving Club, as they have their annual presentations to acknowledge members' achievements. I would like to start by congratulating the winner of Life Saver of the Year, Dave Tierney; the Encouragement Award, Yasmine Ruttiman; and Rookie of the Year, Taylar Briley. The winners of the other major awards on the night were Club Champions Presidents Surf Race, Grant Cook; Open Male, Scott Thompson; Open Female, Shari Genoli; Master Male, Ken Cook and Gary Westwood; Master Female, Lindy Schofield and Jane Schweikert; Under 19 Male, Jacob Sutton; Under 19 Female, Taylar Briley; Under 17 Male, Grant Cook; Under 17 Female, Yasmine Ruttiman; Under 15 Male, Sam Hodgson; and Under 15 Female, Alice Schweikert. The recipients of National Patrol Service Awards, for people who have done 20 to 30 years of patrols-what an amazing effort and time contribution-were: Gordon Abbott, Trevor Acason, Peter Brown, Paul Dwyer, Dean Evans, John Eyles, Diane Holt, Barry Mackenzie, Ted MCCartney, Anthony Neil, Les Pepper, Greg Pepper, Doug White and Robert Wright. I also congratulate those members who have done between 10 and 20 years of patrols: Neil Baker, Kirt Mavin, Kim Morley, John Portsmouth, Michael Stubbs and Michelle Stubbs. Egypt: Coptic Christians",80
42,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I join my Labor colleagues in condemning the targeting of Coptic Christians in an horrific attack last Friday in Egypt. Gunmen wearing fatigues and masks attacked three vehicles travelling in convoy and containing worshippers heading to the Monastery of St Samuel in the Minya governorate of South Cairo. The attack left 29 people dead-men, women and children-and is the latest deadly assault against minority Christians in the Middle East's most populous country. On Palm Sunday, two Cairo churches were bombed, leaving at least 45 people dead and over 100 injured. The senseless violence of this act is abhorrent. It is unacceptable and it must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. I express my heartfelt condolences to the families and friends of those affected by this horrific attack. An attack on any place of religion is an attack on freedom of religion everywhere, and Labor expresses our support for the 100,000 Australians of Coptic faith. I am very fortunate to have a strong Coptic community centred around the parish of St George in Kensington, and my wholehearted condolences go to that community. I express my sympathies to them and Australia's Coptic community. I wish you strength, courage and faith to see you through these dark times. Forrestfield-Airport Link",80
43,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I think the member for Kingsford Smith for his speech recognising the Coptics. I rise today to continue, along with my good friend the member for Canning, to update the House on an infrastructure project, which is the Forrestfield-Airport Link in my electorate. I am pleased to say that the construction of the first of the three new  stations in my electorate has started with the Airport Central Station. The Forrestfield-Airport Link will connect the suburbs of Belmont, Redcliffe, Perth airport and High Wycombe to the CBD. This is the biggest expansion of Perth's rail systems since the Mandurah rail line was completed, and, unfortunately for the member for Grayndler, it was the coalition government and the former state Liberal government that took charge to make this rail project a realitybut I am sure he might claim it. This piece of infrastructure means a 20-minute trip to the heart of the CBD, instead of what is otherwise a 40-minute drive. It is welcomed emphatically by my constituents. The construction of this rail infrastructure project is expected to create 2,000 jobs during the construction phase of the entire project-just what the WA economy needs as we transition from the investment phase of the mining boom. As we all know on this side of the House, it is job creation that drives our economic growth. This is just another example of how this government, rather than playing games and trying to score cheap political points, is delivering real and lasting outcomes for everyday Australians and my electorate of Swan. Schools",80
44,Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to condemn this government's disingenuous policy for schools. I know, because of my time in schools, because of my time leading schools, that the inequity between our schools is responsible for the inequity in the outcomes in our schools. Everyone in this country knows that to be true, because of Labor's policy. The review that was conducted under the Gillard government showed clearlyclearly!-that it was inequity between schools that was causing us to slide down those international rankings. What we put in place was an equaliser, a resourcing model that would level the playing field for every child in this country to ensure our future prosperity. To anyone on that side and anyone in the gallery who believes the Prime Minister's words when he says that money does not make a difference, I would like to invite you to the schools in the western suburbs of Melbourne, which have been on a ten-year journey of being resourced adequately, and see the results that they are getting in their classrooms. This government is being disingenuous about its school funding model. With its 20 per cent offer, it wants to walk away from public schools. It is a betrayal of the students in the schools across our country. Global Security",81
45,Mr HOWARTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," When it comes to reminders about how lucky we are in Australia we are rarely left wanting. The incident on Malaysia Airlines flight 128 last night was not terrorist related, but it tugs at the same thread of fear, doesn't it? 'Terrorist' is the first thing we think when we hear of that kind of incident taking place. When children who head out to a pop concert pay with their lives, as was the case in Manchester, do you think, 'There but for the grace of God go I'? I do. We are separated from Manchester by great distance, but it feels very close to home-those children are our children. We call their killers terrorists, but they are just murderers, aren't they? They hide behind a veil of pseudo-religious belief, but that is little more than a red herring. Some call them religious fanatics. But that seems to offer an excuse. They are straight-up murderers, and I am reassured to know that those people are in the crosshairs of the Turnbull government and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, someone I know who never takes a backwards step.  With submissions on proposed changes to values and other citizenship tests closing today, I think it is timely to consider the big picture on border protection and who we invite to become an Australian. Our safety, our sovereignty, is no accident; it is the result of an informed strategy well executed. Global Security",81
46,Dr ALY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today on the last day of this sitting fortnight, because the past fortnight has been harrowing, with terrorist attacks and the loss of innocent lives in Manchester, Kabul, Baghdad and the attack in Egypt which killed 28 Coptic pilgrims travelling on a bus in the town of Minya. This one is particularly close to home for me, because Minya is actually my mother's home town. She grew up there, and I have aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews and nieces who live there. And my sister, who grew up here in Australia, also lives in Minya. What is particularly harrowing about this attack is that it does not represent Egypt, an ancient civilisation in which various religious, primarily Coptic and Muslim, have coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years. They have coexisted because of a love for their country, the land of the Pharaohs, and a deep sense of pride that unites them as Egyptians first. The Egyptian Christian population is around 15 per cent of the population. In terms of numbers, it is the largest in the Middle East and North Africa. This week, 11 Australian bishops from various Coptic churches are in Egypt. They include bishops from the Armenian, Coptic, Orthodox and Maronite churches. They are there as part of a delegation from Australia to build on Australia's strong relationship with Egypt, and today they will be meeting with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. I call on my parliamentary colleagues and all Australians to unite against terrorism wherever it occurs and to ensure that the fight against terrorism does not weaken or threaten our shared identity. Schools Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (13:47): I would like to say thank you to the constituents of my electorate who came to my office yesterday in Sutherland to talk about the Gonski school funding. I am very pleased to quote to them from David Gonski himself, when he said of the coalition's funding increases: … I'm very pleased to hear that the Turnbull Government has accepted the fundamental recommendations of our 2011 report. … and I'm very pleased that there is substantial additional money, even over indexation and in the foreseeable future. I would like to quickly go through a few of the schools in my electorate, and I am sure those advocates at my office yesterday would like to inform these schools of how much more funding they will get next year compared to last year. I have a long list. Overall, it is $4,164,800 in my electorate. Next year, Yarrawarrah Public School will receive an additional $31,600; Engadine Public School, an additional $37,600; Engadine West Public School, an additional $85,800; Holy Family Catholic Primary, an additional $190,700; Holsworthy Public School, an additional $75,300; Loftus Public School, an additional $47,200; Kirrawee High School, an additional $175,100; Engadine High School, an additional $143,300-and the list goes on and on. (Time expired)  Hotham Electorate: Cambodian Community Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (13:48): I was very lucky to welcome a delegation of Cambodian community and religious leaders to parliament earlier this week. They represent some of the 3,000 or 4,000 Cambodian and Khmer speaking people I represent in Hotham. I am also lucky to represent three Cambodian Buddhist temples in Hotham-the Watt Buddharangsi, the Khmer Buddhist Centre and the Dhamaram Buddhist Temple. All these three temples sponsor Cambodian Buddhist monks to come and live in Australia. Those monks are absolutely core to the religious and spiritual life of the Cambodian people that I represent. They lead prayer and worship, and they commemorate births, deaths, marriages, illness and other critical life events. Immigration changes that were made in 2015 now require monks to travel to Australia under a labour agreement scheme. Previously, they were able to come under a specified religious leaders visa. Under this new scheme it is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Some examples of why this is not a good fit: under these laws the monks must be shown to have a labour agreement and be paid commensurate with people in Australia who are doing similar work, yet that sort of payment is against Buddhist teachings; only one monk per temple can be sponsored, when in fact we need multiple monks at each of these ceremonies; and language requirements are a problem, remembering that this services a mainly Khmer speaking community. So I would like to ask the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection to consider the special needs of Cambodian Australians so we can ensure that Buddhist monks can continue to provide this critical service and care to the community I represent. Capricornia Electorate: Mackay AG Trade Expo",82
47,Ms LANDRY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On 19 and 20 May, I attended the first annual two-day canegrowers agricultural trade expo at Walkerston in the northern part of my electorate. Kingsley Theiber and his team at Wests Tigers Leagues Club in Mackay had a vision to create an all-inclusive field day for our region's primary producers bringing together all sectors of agriculture. The lead-up to the event saw flash-flooding in some areas of the electorate. But Mr Theiber and his team were adamant that the show must go on. So exhibitors set up in the rain showcasing machinery, equipment, innovation, technology, services and products. Primary producers and visitors turned up in their gumboots and raincoats and went on to celebrate one of the region's largest industries. I congratulate Mr Theiber and his team on the success of the expo. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Theiber and his team for offering refuge to those residents urgently evacuated during the floods following Cyclone Debbie. These residents were offered free meals and safety at a time of desperation. I am extremely proud to see that the community spirit in my electorate is as strong as ever. Timor-Leste Delegation",83
48,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to acknowledge a delegation from the Timor-Leste Integrated Crisis Management Centre who are in the chamber today. They are here in Canberra to visit our emergency management organisations, to build those important people-to-people links, to gain insights into our crisis response institutions and to see the arrangements that we have to help us prevent, prepare for, respond to and recover from crises.  Colonel Aluk is the director of the centre and Senhor Domingos Pinto is the director of operations in the Ministry of the Interior. In a previous life, I worked with Colonel Aluk as a military adviser in Timor-Leste. I feel honoured to call him a friend. I would like to welcome him and his delegation here today in their national language, Tetum: Commandante Sira, Bemvindo mai ami-nia Parlamentu; ha'u kontente loos atu hasoru malu fali ho itaboot Aluk. Favor ida hato'o hela ha'u nia kumprimentus ba ita nia espouza, Dona Olinda. I just said: 'Welcome to our parliament. It is great to see you again. Please pass my compliments to your amazing wife, Donna Linda.' Australian Defence Force cooperation represents the commitment we have to supporting our neighbour and friend Timor-Leste. I commend their work to the House and I commend this delegation to the House. National Boer War Memorial Association",83
49,Mr LEESER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It was my pleasure on Tuesday evening, along with my colleague and friend the member for Mitchell, to host members of the New South Wales Boer War Memorial Association in the parliament. I proudly wear the association's tie today in recognition of their efforts. The New South Wales Association alone raised over $400,000 towards the Boer War Memorial. I want to acknowledge in particular Lieutenant Colonel David Deasey, the chairman of the association; and Jilly Warren, Ralph Warren and Brian Walters, who are my constituents. People from all over New South Wales, some of whom were descendants of veterans of that war and some who were just interested Australians, put forward money to build this memorial and complete the set of memorials on ANZAC Parade. Yesterday, 115 years after the close of the Boer War, Australia's own National Boer War Memorial was officially dedicated by his Excellency the Governor General. Prime Minister John Howard indicated his support for the project in 2005 and a site was dedicated on 31 May 2008. I also acknowledge the efforts of the member for Ryan in bringing about the Boer War Memorial. The Boer War of 1899 to 1902 was the first major war in which Australia fought as a nation. Figures differ, but around 23,000 troops, including 80 Australian women, served in that war. There were 43,000 Australian bred Waler horses that went to South Africa and six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross. It is wonderful to see this chapter of our history completed on our national road of memorials. Workplace Relations",84
50,Ms CHESTERS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Every question time this week we have had the government ministers come in here and talk about the magic mine that is going to create thousands of jobs. We have had one minister say it is going to create 4,000 jobs. We have had another minister say it is going to create 10,000 jobs. Another minister says it is going to create 40,000 jobs. This is just a magic mine that is going to fix the unemployment crisis of Central Queensland. If only they had the same gusto and fighting spirit for the current workers in mines in Queensland. If only they could stand up for the miners in Middlemount and stand up for the miners in the small town of Tieri, which is in the seat of Flynn. These are workers who are out at the moment and whose company is going after them. If only this government stood up for these workers against their company, which is trying to bring in an agreement that will  limit workers' ability to have workplace representation. This will allow the company to make any roster changes without consulting their employees and to pay workers based upon profit not hours and work. It will increase the costs of the company's accommodation for workers and limit the matters that they can determine by arbitration. This is what is happening right now in the mining industry. This is how mining companies are treating miners, workers and unions, like the CFMEU. If only the government cared about the people currently working in mining. (Time expired) National Disability Insurance Scheme",84
51,Ms LEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," People with disability are living more independent lives and engaging with their communities, and are either entering the workforce for the first time or returning to work. The NDIS, fully funded by this government and sustainable into the future, is customised to the individual. It provides packages of support which match people's circumstances and needs. This choice and control over the delivery of services and support will be in the hands of the people who actually use and benefit from the services-NDIS participants, their families and carers. I am excited that from July 2017 the NDIS will be available in my electorate of Farrer. More than 6,000 people within an area from Albury in the south to Hillston, Hay and Deniliquin in the west are expected to join the scheme over the next two years. This Monday, I am hosting an information session in partnership with the National Disability Insurance Agency in Albury for people with disability, their families and carers, and community members from 1 pm. I am also looking forward to meeting with some of the participants who are already in the scheme, including mum Zoe and Ruthie. Ruthie is eight and has cerebral palsy. She became an NDIS participant four years ago in South Australia before moving to Albury with her family. One of the great things about the NDIS being a national scheme is that Ruthie's support package has effectively moved with her. This information session is a great opportunity for people in Albury and across our region to have their questions answered and find out more about the NDIS. Western Sydney City Deal",85
52,Mr HUSIC,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last year, the Prime Minister announced a City Deal for Western Sydney in Redfern. Bravo! Forty kilometres away from the deep heart of the region! If it was not bad enough that they could not get the geography or politics right, the person left to fill in the details, assistant minister for cities Angus Taylor, completely cut Blacktown City Council out of the Western Sydney City Deal. Did he forget which councils are actually in Western Sydney? In May, the government announced incentives for eight Western Sydney councils to fasttrack development application approvals as part of the City Deal, but excluded Blacktown council, the largest council in New South Wales. He says he wants 185,000 extra homes approved in Western Sydney over 20 years. Well, Blacktown council approves roughly 15,000 DAs a year, or 300,000 over 20 years. Leaving Blacktown out of the City Deal puts a blackhole in the middle of whatever infrastructure plans are developed, making the overall deal compromised. One hundred and fifty thousand people are expected to move into the  north-west growth centre. Blacktown council is playing a role in planning issues affecting those residents. Politics has polluted the Western Sydney City Deal. The Turnbull government is not serious about good outcomes, just a small safe deal attracting cheap headlines. Any fair dinkum Western Sydney City Deal would have the largest council in Western Sydney smack in the centre of the deal. That is why the Turnbull government's Western Sydney City Deal, like the government overall, is all show, no go. Gilmore Electorate: Business Mrs SUDMALIS (Gilmore) (13:59): I just wanted to put a call out to my beautiful businesses in Gilmore. As from yesterday, if you need to grow your business there is an opportunity for you to do a dollar-for-dollar funding arrangement under the South Coast Jobs and Investment Package. I encourage every business to apply to bring more jobs to my region. I cannot wait to see that being done. Botanica could be coming, the alpaca farm could be going up, beef farming could be done, Argyle Meats could be growing. Every single one of those businesses can be growing. We are looking at transport capacity and at building capacity for my region, and every single one of them will be bringing jobs.",85
53,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA The SPEAKER (14:00): I welcome to the floor of the House today the Ambassador for Afghanistan, His Excellency Wahidullah Waissi. On behalf of the House, I extend a warm welcome to you. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Kabul: Attacks",86
54,Mr TURNBULL,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," This latest shocking attack in central Kabul follows a fortnight where we have seen the evil scourge of Islamist terrorism continue to exact its murderous campaign against civilians around the world. From the bombing of the arena in Manchester and the slaughter of innocent children to a suicide attack in Jakarta, the ISIL insurgency in the southern Philippines to the slaughter of Coptic Christians in Egypt, we continue to see these indiscriminate, brutal attacks committed by these terrorists. According to the latest information provided by the Afghan authorities, the death toll stands currently at 89 and may rise further. At least 350 more people were injured in the blast. Almost all of those affected were civilians, many of whom were women and children. This shocking attack comes in the holy month of Ramadan. I know that all Australians condemn the actions of those responsible, and I have written today to President Ghani to express our deepest sympathies and to restate Australia's resolve to assist and support Afghanistan in its fight against Islamist terrorism. I acknowledge also, as you have, Mr Speaker, the presence in the House of the Ambassador for Afghanistan, His Excellency Mr Wahidullah Waissi. Your Excellency, we  extend our condolences through you to the people of Afghanistan and in particular to those directly affected and their loved ones. Yesterday's attack took place on Wazir Akbar Khan Road, less than a kilometre from the Australian Embassy. This is an area I visited just five weeks ago, where I paid tribute to and met the brave men and women of our Australian Defence Force who are training, advising and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces as part of the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission. I know that many members of this House in this parliament will have been familiar with this district when they have visited Afghanistan. I can advise the House that all staff of our embassy have been confirmed safe, although, as honourable members will understand, they are very shaken by these events. We do not believe at this stage that any Australians were killed or injured in the attack. But this serves as a sober reminder of the dangers faced by those who represent our nation abroad. We are the second largest non-NATO troop-contributing nation in Operation Resolute Support and the overall second largest financial contributor to the sustainment of the Afghan security sector. We know from bitter experience that allowing safe havens for terrorists undermines our safety at home and abroad. Just yesterday, we mourned the tragic death of the 12-year-old Melbourne girl Zynab Al Harbiya, killed in another terrorist attack, in Baghdad, while visiting her sick grandfather. The first priority of my government is to keep Australians safe. That is why we have made a long-term commitment to support Afghanistan's security and stability. Earlier this week, the government announced an increase in our deployment and our support for NATO's Train, Advise and Assist mission in Afghanistan, with the number of our ADF personnel rising to around 300. As honourable members are aware, the largest single element of our deployment to Afghanistan is providing training and the necessary force protection at the Afghan National Army Officer Academy, which I have visited very recently, and I know other honourable members have done, too. They are doing vital work for ensuring that the Afghan security forces have the capabilities and the training to defend themselves and to suppress and defeat the terrorists. Yesterday's bombing only reinforces our commitment to this important mission and to continuing to support the Afghan national defence and security forces as they continue to build that capability that is essential for Afghanistan to fight and defeat terrorism at its source. The aim of the terrorist is to instil fear and divide communities and to cause communities to turn on each other. Our message is very clear: our objective is to ensure that terrorists in the battlefield are targeted and killed. And we have changed the law. My government, with the support of the opposition, have changed the law to ensure that the ADF can target terrorists in the field, whatever they are doing. Our objective is to destroy them in the battlefield, and anyone with the intent to do us harm at home will be identified, monitored, disrupted and arrested and face the full extent of the law. Australians will never bow to terror.",86
55,Mr SHORTEN,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I congratulate the Prime Minister on his words just then. I want to join with the Prime Minister in condemning this attack and those responsible, and I want to join with the Prime Minister on behalf of the opposition in offering our heartfelt condolences to the families of the dead, our comfort to the injured, and our unwavering support for the people of Afghanistan.  The Prime Minister has dealt with some of the terrible details of this incident and the terrible toll of human life. I would simply add this. While some injuries have been suffered by foreign workers, including American and German embassy staff, the people murdered by this act of terror were overwhelmingly Afghan citizens and the followers of the Islamic faith. I do not know if they conformed to every single letter and tenet of their religion-few people of any faith ever do-but I suspect they were very good Muslims, doing their best to be good parents, good citizens, good people, living the normal lives that we all recognise and, in this country, take for granted: going to the shops, heading to work, taking their children to school. I want to say that I believe that their Islam was more true, more valuable and more worthwhile than anything that the terrorists claim to believe in. At the beginning of this most holy time in the Islamic faith, this act of terror is a crime against Islam and a crime against humanity. If we needed proof that the people of Afghanistan are infinitely better and braver than the cowards who brought this criminal bloodshed to their streets, I refer to an iconic image that I hope is the enduring image of this terrible attack. The image to which I refer is of the lines of hundreds of people who were queuing to donate blood for those injured in the blast. That is the image which I hope is the enduring image. Afghanistan is Australia's longest war. I honour the 41 Australians who made the supreme sacrifice in its green valleys and dry mountains. I honour thousands more of Australian Defence Force personnel and other agencies and civilians who have served in Afghanistan in this longest conflict. We have a continuing national interest in defeating terrorism in Afghanistan and in helping the people and the government of Afghanistan build a better, safer home for themselves, where girls and boys can go to school and where citizens can live in peace. Labor supports the recent 30-person increase in Australia's contribution to the NATO-led Resolute Support training mission in Afghanistan. It takes our total commitment to 300. Admiration for the courage, professionalism and skill of our defence personnel unites this chamber, and the memory that Afghanistan was a training base for some of the Bali bombers also unites this chamber. So too does our determination to see our personnel return home safely and successfully from this mission. Whatever disagreements might follow in the hour or so to come, we are united in our commitment to the security of Australians both here and abroad, and when it comes to fighting terrorism we are all in this together.",87
56,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,I thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. As a mark of respect to the deceased and the injured I ask all honourable members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places,88
57,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,I thank the House. NA Taxation,88
58,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. New research by the ANU published in today's media reveals that, when the government's tax plan is compared to Labor's, the government's plan leaves twice as many households worse off compared to Labor's plan, and that those who are worse off are those who can least afford it. Why is the Prime Minister targeting ordinary Australians who can least afford the government's plan? ",88
59,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," What the government is doing is fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme-something that the Labor Party used to believe in. The Labor Party used to be committed to it. The Labor Party used to argue that every Australian should pay a contribution towards the NDIS, and so they increased the Medicare levy by half a per cent. They used to support that measure; they called upon us to support it and we did. Dr Chalmers: Now you want to give a tax cut to the top end.",89
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Rankin.,89
61,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Now we have this hypocrisy, this inconsistency, this cheap politics. It is seen as such by three-quarters of the Leader of the Opposition's own shadow cabinet, and it exposes him for the political animal that he is-focused only on the tactics of the moment, regardless of the national interest. Dr Chalmers: Tell us about your tax cut for the top.",89
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Rankin is warned!,89
63,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about tax, so let us talk about tax. He is proposing that the half a per cent increase would come in at $87,000. That is what he said. He said that was very fair. Let us take an example. Let us consider Mary, an experienced midwife in New South Wales. She earns $87,000. Under Labor's policy, if Mary earned an additional dollar she would begin paying an additional half a per cent on her entire income. So, on the additional $1 that Mary earns, she would pay an additional $435.39 in tax. That is an effective marginal tax rate of 43,539 per cent. Dr Chalmers: She pays for your plan, you fool!",89
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Rankin will leave under 94(a). The member for Rankin then left the chamber.,89
65,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, under Labor's policy Mary will suffer a $500 pay cut for a $1 pay rise. Under Labor's policy, a person with a taxable income of $86,500 would have a total tax liability of $21,390, leaving $65,110 after tax. But, with a taxable income of $87,001, they would have a total tax liability of $21,997, resulting in an after-tax amount of $65,004. This is the slipshod politics of envy-no economics, no equity, no judgement. No wonder Australians recognise this Leader of the Opposition is unfit to be Prime Minister of this nation. National Security",89
66,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is also to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on measures the government takes to keep Australia safe and our transport system secure?,89
67,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge the honourable member's long experience and service in our police forces. Members will be aware that a man attempted to gain access to the cockpit of Malaysian Airlines MH128 shortly after take-off last night. The passengers on the flight bravely put themselves in harm's way to restrain the man, and the incident is now resolved, with all on board safe. The Australian Federal Police is working with Victoria Police to determine the exact circumstances of the incident. I can confirm that the matter is not  currently being treated as terrorism related, and I am informed that the man has a criminal history and has previously been treated for mental health issues. The government, as it should, takes aviation security very seriously indeed, and we have a comprehensive and strong transport security system in place. It is constantly being reviewed to ensure that it remains effective and proportionate to the risk environment. We do everything we can to ensure that Australians fly safely and securely. Our transport security system, designed to keep Australians safe and prevent acts of unlawful interference, includes the screening of passengers and baggage, hardened cockpit doors and the training of cabin crew so that they can handle suspicious passenger behaviour and respond to threats to security. It involves having plain-clothes in-flight security officers and ensuring that unauthorised items are not placed on board aircraft. In April the government implemented new security arrangements for inbound flights from Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha. Passengers are now randomly selected for explosive trace detection tests prior to boarding the aircraft. The No. 1 priority for my government and every government must be to keep Australians safe and protect our way of life. That is why we are investing an additional $321 million to ensure that the AFP has the specialist capabilities it needs to address the criminal and terrorist threats in the future. It is the largest single funding boost to the AFP's domestic policing capabilities in over a decade. We recognise that law enforcement must be equipped with the resources to respond to new and emerging criminal threats. So far this year we have seen the AFP and its partners intercept record shipments of cocaine-1.4 tonnes-and methamphetamine-903 kilograms. These have been intercepted because of the resources, the training and the professionalism of these agencies. Our police and security agencies, as honourable members know, have thwarted 12 major Australian based terror plots since September 2014. They are on the front line. We are supporting them, and they are keeping us safe. Taxation Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (14:17): My question is to the Prime Minister. Analysis in Fairfax newspapers shows that a couple renting, where one partner has left university and the other is still studying, have an effective marginal tax rate of over 97 per cent when their income reaches just $37,000. Why is the Prime Minister outraged about marginal tax rates for millionaires but saying absolutely nothing about families who will pay an effective marginal tax rate of over 97 per cent?  question. I understand that she is speaking with respect to a report by the National Foundation for Australian Women that has been reported in the press. The effective marginal tax rate relates to two phenomena that might happen at the same time, or at very similar points in time. When someone's income increases they may face a new tax threshold, or they may face a repayment threshold for something like a HECS debt. Or, indeed, as their income increases they may also face the withdrawal of a benefit of some type inside the welfare system. It is obviously the case that even with high effective marginal tax rates, which very much existed under the system that we inherited from members opposite and are very much to do with many of the complications in the welfare system, it is always desirable that people are substituting income earned through employment in preference to income earned through welfare benefits. ",89
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Adelaide on a point of order? Ms Kate Ellis: My point of order is on direct relevance. The minister is answering yesterday's question,91
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. The member for Adelaide will resume her seatMs Kate Ellis: Mr SPEAKER ,91
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Adelaide will resume her seat! Ms Kate Ellis: Mr SPEAKER ,91
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Adelaide will resume her seat! The member for Adelaide will leave under 94(a)! I am not going to have members ignore me. I have made the point as clearly as I can. You are all very smart. I made the point. I asked her three times to resume her seat. The member for Adelaide then left the chamber.  NFAW's report, which was also cited yesterday by members opposite in parliament, is based on research from those two individuals. I am informed that the NFAW's statement that graduates earning $51,000, most of whom are likely to be women, will have less disposable income than someone earning $32,000 appears to assume that there are changes to rental assistance in the budget. That is not the case. I am also further informed by advice from my department that the statement from the NFAW, based on the research that members opposite cite-the statement that graduates earning $51,000, most of whom are likely to be women, will have less disposable income than someone earning $32,000-is incorrect and very misleading. Budget",91
72,Mr ALEXANDER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is also to the Prime Minister-a popular man. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the steps the government is taking to guarantee and fund vital services, such as education and the National Disability Insurance Scheme, including in my electorate of Bennelong? Is the Prime Minister aware of any alternative approach?",91
73,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. Schools in the honourable member's electorate of Bennelong will receive an extra $165 billion in Commonwealth funding over the next decade. That is part of our record investment in schools-an extra $18.6 billion over the next decade. We want every student in every region-in every town in every part of the country and in every honourable member's electorate-to get the very best start in life. They need a great education, with great teachers in well-resourced schools. We do not just talk about giving a Gonski, as the honourable members opposite do; we are actually delivering on his recommendations. We are bringing the transparency, the consistency and the fairness-the needs based funding-to the school issue. Labor treated this as a political game. They did 27 secret deals, all conflicting and all giving different outcomes-running around the country with no consistency, no transparency and no attention  to the needs based funding that the honourable member opposite said on 75 occasions was at the heart of his policy. We have seen again and again that he substitutes rhetoric for substance. Australians know that we need to have a school funding system that is fair, that is transparent and that delivers schools the resources they need. Right now, the honourable members opposite have not only voted against $18.6 billion of additional funding-they have not only sought to deny Australian schools that-but they are also opposing fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They talked about that for years too. They talked about it with empathy. They talked about it with compassion. They talked about it with pride, but they did not pay the price of funding it. The honourable member-the Leader of the Opposition-as we all know, failed to deliver the funding that our schools need and that our National Disability Insurance Scheme needs. We are ensuring that every Australian with severe and permanent disabilities can access the services that they need-so that parents with disabled children will know, now and in the future, into the years ahead, that the funding is there. We are securing the future of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, just like we are securing the future of our schools. We have made the tough decisions. We are funding it. Labor should stop the politics, stop the complaining, stop the hypocrisy and back it. (Time expired) Budget",91
74,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, Labor's plan to protect lowand middle-income workers from a tax hike and keep the budget repair levy raises more revenue than the government's plan over the medium term. Is the reason the Prime Minister is shouting about Labor's plan because it raises more money or is he simply angry that Labor will not give millionaires a tax cut?",92
75,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to respond to the member's question. What the member did not point out to the House is that at the last election they proposed to extend the deficit levy and they spent all the money. They spent it all. You do not get to spend money twice, which is what the shadow Treasurer is suggesting he can do. What he is saying is that all the money that he said at the last election he was going to spend by ensuring that the top marginal tax rate remained at an uncompetitive level well into the future over the next 10 yearsMs Plibersek interjecting",92
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sydney will cease interjecting.,92
77,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"all the money that he said he was going to have from reversing the corporate tax cuts and the small business tax cuts, he spent that all at the last election. And he still had a $16½ billion higher deficit at the last election. When he comes in here and says that he has higher revenue from this measure, he has forgotten that he has already spent the money. North Queensland: Infrastructure",92
78,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister, you and former Treasurer Swan committed $6 million to moving forward the  greatest nation building proposal in 50 years: Hell's Gate. This was destroyed by Shorten Burdekin Hydro, generating a pinprick three hours a day 50 megawatts and a meagre 80 million. Hell's Gate would generate 605 megawatts for 24 hours, 2,400 million in power, ethanol, CO2-fed algae, beef and sugar. Can the House be assured that the hydro will be overridden and Joyce-Swan will prevail, with CO2 emissions reduced by six million tonne a year-20 times the hydro-a reduction in morbidity of 15 per cent, petrol prices- (Time expired)",92
79,Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (14:27): I did not hear it to its conclusion, but I got the general gist of the question. I would like to commend the work of the member for Kennedy, who has been here for nearly a quarter of a century. I know he is a man of great vision. He was also the Minister for Northern Development in the Bjelke-Petersen government-a position he held for quite some time. I remember talking to the member for Kennedy right back in 2000, in the National Party days, and I know the vision and the passion he has for Northern Australia. Well may you have that vision, because those in the Labor Party do not and will not stand up for Northern Australia. Member for Kennedy, we have put $2.2 million on the table to fund the feasibility study for Hell's Gate because of the intrepid work and detail that was put into that by you and the former member for Herbert Ewen Jones. Of course, the current member for Herbert is not really interested in dams in Northern Australia. She is not really interested in dams anywhere. The current member for Herbert is not very interested in the Carmichael mine. But of course what we want to do is pursue-in fact, Member for Kennedy, you would be interested to know that this year we have been accepting applications from state governments for further construction funding. How many dam projects has the Queensland Labor government come through with? None. Zero. Not one. Ms Chesters interjecting Ms Butler interjecting",93
80,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bendigo is warned. The member for Griffith is warned.,93
81,Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, the Labor government wants to gut our dams policy. They want to take money out. They want to remove $232.5 million. They have no vision for this nation. They have no vision for North Queensland. You know that and I know that-that is why we have to try and move this project along. I am looking for the Labor government to stand up for North Queensland, I really am. But the problem is that when we want to try to deal with these issues we have the member for Grayndler, the shadow minister for infrastructure-but he is not so much a shadow: it's pitch black, it's radio silence; he is like a Cistercian monk, who has come in here with a vow of silence and cannot say boo unless it is an interjectionMr Burke interjecting",93
82,Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will take the interjection from the member for Watson, because the member for Watson, the Leader of Opposition Business, should give the member for Grayndler a question. You really should. You should look after your workmates. You should treat him fairly. Be fair at work and give that gentleman a question. You should let that man go to that box and ask a question-but you will not. ",93

84,Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are going to fight for this dam. I understand how important it is. I have an absolute passion for dams. I have a passion for Rookwood, in the seat of Capricornia; a passion for developing the north; a passion for dealing with water infrastructure; and a passion for Snowy Hydro 2. You cannot get much better than that. That is real vision. Inland rail is also our vision. We have vision; they have none. That is the story. (Time expired) Mr Snowdon interjecting",94

86,Mr BUCHHOLZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House the right choices the government is making in delivering fair and needsbased funding for Australian students? Why does the government believe that it is important to sustainably pay for the spending commitments that we make to the Australian people?,94
87,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Wright for his question and for his understanding of the fact that it is absolutely essential, at a time when wages growth is modest, that we guarantee essential services for all Australians. In this budget, the Turnbull government has said yes to guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely on. We have said yes to guaranteeing Medicare. We have said yes to fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We have said yes to $18.6 billion in real money, in real funding, for needs-based funding of our schools, which includes a 60 per cent increase over 10 years in per student funding in public schools in this country. That is what we have said yes to. Those opposite, the Labor Party, are, in this parliament, saying no to guaranteeing essential services. In fact, on six separate occasions in this place when it came to voting for real money for real schools they said no. A government member: How many times?",94
88,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On six separate occasions the Labor Party voted no to more funding for public schools, for non-government schools, for schools with children with disability. They voted no, no, no and no-and two more noes on top of that. That is what we are getting from this opposition. It is all about the no-it is never about the yes-on working with the government to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. But Australians can rely on the promises of this government, because they are paid for. They are paid for because this government lives within its means. Under this government, expenditure growth has been at two per cent in real terms and revenue growth at 3.3 per cent. Under the Labor Party, real growth in expenditure was at four per cent but revenue growth was at less than one per cent. The Labor Party spent money four times faster than it was coming in. That is why you cannot trust the Labor Party with their empty promises. They did not fund the NDIS, they did not fund their schools promises and they did not fund their health promises when they were in government. So, when the Australian public hears the Labor Party rattling around about spending money, we know that they will always spend it but we also know that the money is not there to pay for it. Because  this government lives within its means, as we have demonstrated again in this budget, we have reduced the growth in debt by over two-thirds from what we inherited from those opposite. Our real growth in spending is at the lowest level of any government in 50 years. Those opposite spent and spent and then they promised and promised, but we know they can never be trusted to deliver. Budget",94
89,Ms RYAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. How is it fair that in this budget an early childhood teacher in Werribee, in my electorate, who is earning $60,000 a year gets a $300 tax increase while a millionaire gets a $16,400 tax cut?",95
90,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for her question. The honourable member will be well aware that what her party is proposing, what her leader is proposing, is going to provide an effective marginal tax rate for people on middle incomes-someone who earns $1 more than $87,000; this is not millionaires-such that they will have a 43,539.5 per cent effective marginal tax rate. Basically, what Labor is proposing to do-and the honourable member should reflect on this-is provide a massive disincentive for people to do an hour's extra work. They could find themselves, by force of circumstance-no choice of their own-earning $1 more and losing all of that and hundreds of dollars more in tax. That is what the Labor Party is doing. So, they can go on about their millionaires as much as they like. The reality is that Labor is punishing middle-income earners, middle-income Australians-the very Australians we are protecting and did protect with the tax cut delivered in last year's budget. I had reason today to read the speech of the Leader of the Opposition to CEDA. There are some very familiar lines in it. He says: 'Our challenge is, what is the luck we make ourselves? How do we benefit from the Asian century? How do we make sure we do not fall behind, to stay at the front of the pack?' That is a good question-a very good question. But this is what his answer is: uncompetitive tax rates, increasing the tax on Australian companies, making Australian companies pay more tax than all the other countries benefiting from the Asian century. What he wants to do, at the same time as he poses these rhetorical questions, is provide answers that guarantee that Australia will not only not stay at the front of the pack but fall right off the back of it. That is the problem with Labor: they do not have a policy for jobs, they do not have a policy for investment, they do not have a policy for productivity. And if you do not have a policy that supports investment then you are letting down Australians today and for generations to come. Just as they have heedlessly imposed a massive disincentive for people on middle incomes to do a bit more work, so, too-for pure politics and the talk about millionaires and the politics of envy-they are putting a handbrake on growth and a handbrake on jobs. National Disability Insurance Scheme",95
91,Mr HOWARTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Social Services. Will the minister please update the House on the economic benefits expected from the National Disability Insurance Scheme? How will the government ensure that these economic benefits are achieved by fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme? And are there any alternative approaches?   Petrie for his question. As the member knows so well, the NDIS will provide a very large boost to jobs and growth, and helping people with a disability into the workforce is estimated to increase GDP by an additional $8 billion. The demand for disability services is growing rapidly as we roll out the NDIS. An estimated 60,000 more full-time workers will be required by 2020. The disability workforce is expected to more than double, from around 73,000 to 162,000 full-time jobs. I am asked whether there are any alternatives. The Labor Party now opposes the policy they used to support, to fully fund the NDIS by a 0.5 per cent increase in the Medicare levy. And, as I have noted this week, we have found many voices, past and present, supporting our policy of funding the NDIS. Admittedly the next one was a little hard to find, but boy was it worth waiting for. After a diligent search, there it was",95
92,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister knows the rules about props.  gently among the Phil Collins CDs in the bargain bin at the second-hand shop. There it appeared: a copy of the literary classic The Good Fight. Comrades-the good fight! What it says at chapter 20 is this: More savings were required to fund the NDIS. By May we had effectively ruled out every option except an addition to the Medicare levy. We needed to ensure the long-term sustainable funding for the scheme and there was simply no other workable option. There was broad community acceptance that the NDIS was a worthwhile investment-less than a dollar a day for someone on average wages. The title of the chapter that has this amazing exposition of coalition policy, chapter 20, is 'Hanging tough'. Hanging Tough is not merely the second studio album by the American boy band New Kids on the Block-'hanging tough' is the language of the street, that perfectly distils the unshakeable commitment of the member for Lilley to fund the NDIS through the Medicare levy. How is it hanging in 2016? Sadly, it is not hanging tough anymore. So we say to the member for Lilley-get tough! Toughen up! Join the good fight! Support the NDIS!  Mr Frydenberg interjecting",96

94,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. How is it fair that in this budget a flight attendant living in Parramatta in my electorate earning $60,000 a year gets a $300 tax increase, while a millionaire gets a $16,400 tax cut?",96
95,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The honourable member may ask herself, how is it fair to leave the National Disability Insurance Scheme unfunded? How is it fair to say to the parents of disabled children in her electorate of Parramatta that the money is not there? Because that is what her party has done-failed to fund the NDIS. The minister has exposed the extraordinary hypocrisy of the member for Lilley when he talked about hanging tough and his commitment to funding it. Now he is as quiet as a mouse there on the back bench, not standing up to do the right thing, which is to fund the NDIS. The flight  attendant on $60,000 in Parramatta would pay additional tax as part of the increase in the Medicare levy, and she and her family will be protected by the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It will apply across the board in exactly the same way that her party's former leader, Julia Gillard, and her party's current leader, the member for Maribyrnong, said it should all those years ago. The truth of the matter is this: Labor talks about jobs; they talk about growth; they talk about equity. But invariably the people they hurt are middle-income Australians who are seeking to get ahead. I want to draw the honourable member's attention to another passage from that memorable address by the Leader of the Opposition today. He said, 'We're taking action on negative gearing and the capital gains discount to unsustainably generous tax concessions which are distorting the housing market in favour of wealthy investors.' Mr Brian Mitchell interjecting",96

100,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party's proposal to ban negative gearing to prevent people from offsetting rental losses against their professional or salary income will put out of the market the very middle income earners the honourable member claims to have such empathy for. Who will it leave in? Wealthy investors. It will be the person with the investment income from other properties or stocks, shares and bonds that will continue under Labor's policy to be able to negatively gear. The hypocrisy, the inconsistency and the economic illiteracy of the Labor Party are writ large in this speech and in every speech by the Leader of the Opposition. Health Care",97

106,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I want to thank the member for Forrest. It was a real pleasure to join her at the Bunbury Regional Hospital only two weeks ago, where we saw the $4.8 million investment of the Commonwealth government in guaranteeing pathology services for the people of Bunbury and the people of the South Coast. We saw an investment which allowed for additional services to be put back into the hospital and into the region. Ms Catherine King: Funded by Labor!",98
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Ballarat is warned!,98
108,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We also visited the South Coast Pharmacy. At the South Coast Pharmacy he heard how the government's partnership with the Pharmacy Guild will be delivering more services for local residents directly through our support for Medicare and our support for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Just today, the member was one of those who lent her support-I have discussed this with her-for the Treasurer's bill to guarantee Medicare. We are guaranteeing Medicare, with the bill the Treasurer brought in today, not just for a short period of time but forever. Beyond that, we are also guaranteeing the NDIS. As part of the guarantee for the NDIS, I want to go back to the first time a 0.5 per cent levy was introduced. We have heard about the member for Lilley's comments on this. The bill to bring in the 0.5 per cent levy at the time was brought in by the then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who said: This reform will provide peace of mind to all Australians that if they or a loved one acquire a disability, they will be supported. The Leader of the Opposition may not have heard what she said, but you can bet he believed in it at the time. I can tell you this, Mr Speaker: whilst his hearing may have changed since then, the reality of the matter has not. We know that 100 per cent of Labor members believed it was the right thing to do at that time. We know that 75 per cent of Labor shadow ministers believe it is the right thing to do at the present time. My bet is that the vast majority of people on their back bench also believe that the NDIS levy is the right thing to do at this time. They know it. The disability sector also believes it. Here is what the Disability Advocacy Network said: It seems to us that people do understand that it's a fair way to do it, because the Medicare levy is paid in proportion to people's income … It is not an unreasonable way to pay for something that befits everyone in the country. That is what the Disability Advocacy Network says. The truth is this: it was the right thing to do at the time and it was the fair thing to do at the time. It is still the fair thing to do at this time. If you believe in the NDIS, support our levy. (Time expired) Taxation",98
109,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that under his government real wages for highpaid executives are growing, but they get a tax cut, and that real wages for people on modest incomes are going backwards, but they get a tax increase? Does the Prime Minister have any idea what is going on in the real world?  Mrs Sudmalis interjecting",98

115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Burt will leave under 94(a). The member for Burt then left the chamber.,99
116,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He knows that what we need to do is get more private sector investment, and yet what he wants, what he talks about and what he is now arguing for is higher taxes on Australian businesses. He wants to have higher taxes, higher disincentives, to invest, to employ. The Leader of the Opposition cannot have it both ways. If he wants to be a pro-growth, pro-investment person then he should stop halfway through this speech or stop after page 2 before he gets into all the politics of envy. He posed the question very well: how do we ensure Australia stays at the front of the pack? Good question. It used to be obvious to the Labor Party. It used to be obvious to the member for MCMahon, who wrote a book about it. What you need to do is encourage investment, provide incentives for people to grow their businesses and to employ and provide incentives for people to work longer, to work harder, to get better skills and increase their incomes. What they are presenting is a Medicare levy increase which will provide a massive disincentive for anybody to earn one dollar more than $87,000. A worker who, by some calculation unbeknownst to her, finds herself earning an extra dollar above $87,000 will be paying all of that and $500 more in tax. That is the one dollar increase-a 43,000 per cent effective marginal tax rate. He is only interested in appealing to this politics of envy. But I ask the Leader of the Opposition: how do you look to thousands of Australians on middle incomes and say to them in good faith: 'Everything Labor policy does will discourage you from getting ahead'? Every single measure is an attack on middle Australia and their aspirations for a better life.  Decentralisation",99
117,Mr GEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how the government is backing hard working regional Australians and spreading opportunity through our decentralisation agenda? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any threats to regional employment and our plan to drive the economic development of regional Australia?,100
118,Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (14:53): I thank the honourable member for his question. I can understand how he has a great interest in decentralisation, especially after we started the process of establishing the Regional Investment Corporation in Orange, in a regional city, building on what they already have there with Paraway financial, Macquarie Bank and its rural investment unit, the National Australia Bank, and the department of agriculture. This is a belief in decentralisation. It is a belief in creating that centre of excellence in and around Orange. Our belief in decentralisation does not stop there, of course. We have the Fisheries RDC going to Adelaide. I know the member for Sturt is very interested in that. The Grains Research and Development Corporation is going to Toowoomba, Dubbo, Perth and Adelaide. The APVMA-and we hear a lot about that-is going to Armidale to make sure that we create our centre of excellence in Armidale. The Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation is going to the seat of Riverina, to Wagga. With the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, we are establishing new offices there, especially in Wodonga. This is all about our belief and our vision for regional development. We have the vision that not only is held by us but also is held by so many others. In the recent Senate inquiry we received 200 submissions-177 supported decentralisation and only four were against. One of the councils that supports decentralisation is Cessnock, in the member for Hunter's seat. This is what the Cessnock council said: The Cessnock City Council is fully supportive, and advocates strongly for “decentralisation” of government bodies to regional areas. This includes Commonwealth entities with agricultural policy and regulatory responsibilities. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting",100
119,Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will take the interjection from the member for Hunter! The people who are against decentralisation, quite obviously, are the Labor Party. They do not support it. They had an inquiry into decentralisation, and guess where they held it? In Canberra! And then they had to find one town to go to, so they went to Townsville. So, Canberra and Townsville; that is their vision. Of course, the vision for Townsville is not so good, because the member for Herbert has not come out in support of the Carmichael mine",100

128,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. How is it fair that under the Prime Minister's $22 billion schools cut students at Our Lady of La Vang in Adelaide will lose half their funding? Does the Prime Minister realise that all the students at this school have an intellectual disability and that many students have multiple disabilities, including complex health, personal care and behavioural needs? Why is the Prime Minister cutting half the funding for each student at Our Lady of La Vang?",101
129,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for her question. The honourable member knows very well that the needs based funding model, of which she used to speak so eloquently, has been abandoned by her. Ms Plibersek: You're cutting funding for disabled children!",101

This is a familiar pattern with the member for Sydney, but just so she is clear: she has been asked to cease interjecting a number of times through question time. She has been warned that if she interjects again she will leave. If she is planning on interjecting I suggest that she start packing up.",101
133,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sydney knows very well that the recommendation of the Gonski panel in 2011 was to introduce transparent, consistent national needs based funding. And the needs based funding is based on a Schooling Resource Standard which is then adjusted with loadings for disabilities, for low incomes, for lack of English language and so forth. There is a whole series-half a dozen-of special loadings: remote schools, small schools and so forth. Now, that calculation, which has been used under the Labor government and continued under our government, has been consistent for many years. Many arguments have been made about improving and refining the SRS measure. Of course, that is a commitment the government has-we will continue to work with the sector to improve it and to refine it. As the minister for education has made clear, schools that feel the SES measure has not treated them appropriately are able to have their needs assessed on the basis of parents' income, in a much more direct and granular way. So this is a very conventional approach that has been operating for many years. It allocates the funding on a needs basis. It does so  transparently. It does so consistently. That is what Labor argued for for years. They claim to have introduced it, but they did not. Ken Boston, David Gonski's fellow member of that panel, described Labor's 27 secret deals as a corruption of the Gonski recommendations. We are not giving a Gonski; we are not talking about a Gonski; we are delivering. And we are delivering on that needs based funding, and the honourable member knows it better than most. What she is standing up for is not Gonski. It is not needs based. It is 27 secret, inconsistent deals, a corruption of the Gonski panel's recommendations. Citizenship",101
134,Mr DRUM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Will the minister update the House on reforms the government has announced to strengthen the processes around obtaining Australian citizenship? Why is it important that those aspiring to be Australians share Australian values, and is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?",102
135,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question and thank him for being a champion in this parliament for Australian values and asking no more of people than that they abide by Australian laws if they want to be an Australian citizen. The government has been very deliberate, as we have discussed in recent weeks, that we do want to make sure that, if people want to become Australian citizens, we want them to abide by Australian laws, we want them to abide by Australian values and we want them to provide for their families in the same way that many hundreds of thousands of people who have come here as migrants under the refugee and humanitarian program, for example, should continue to contribute into the future. It is not every day that I quote the Fairfax press, but today I feel compelled. Do you know why, Mr Speaker? As it turns out, the Labor Party are not only tearing themselves apart on border protection policy; they are tearing themselves apart on what I think is a pretty fundamental and easy question to answer-that is: do you support the government's position in relation to enhancing our citizenship changes? As it turns out, they do not. Dr Aly interjecting",102
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowan is warned.,102
137,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As it turns out, not only is the Leader of the Opposition unable to muster the leadership capacity to draw the Left and the Right together to support a sensible border protection policy; it now turns out that the Left, under the member for Grayndler, is mounting some sort of insurgent behaviour against the Leader of the Opposition on this fundamental issue. It seems that this civil war that has broken out between the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Grayndler has found a new home in relation to the citizenship test. I think it is a basic question that most Australians can answer. For example, if people want to become Australian citizens, should they have an adequate level of English proficiency? Should that be a basic test? Yes, it should, and that is the feedback we have had around the country. But do the Labor Party support that or oppose it? Well, some of them support it, but others oppose it. The problem is that the Leader of the Opposition has no clue which way to land this issue. The trouble is that this civil war in the Labor Party is going to continue. It will continue. Where there is smoke, there is fire when it comes to the member for Grayndler. I like that he was cuddling up beside the Leader of the Opposition before for the photo for the Saturday  papers. He knows what is going on here, and he is fanning the fire. Most Australians are completely bewildered. They think this Leader of the Opposition is not the genuine bloke that he pretends to be. Do you know what? They are dead right.

140,Mr BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports that President Trump is poised to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Just before midnight last night, in response to those reports, the chair of the coalition's environment and energy committee, the member for Hughes, posted: 'It's not confirmed yet, but have the champagne on ice.' John Howard followed the United States out of Kyoto when George W Bush rejected it. So how can anyone have confidence that this government will not do exactly that with the Paris Agreement?",103
141,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question, and I repeat today what I said on 16 November when the treaty was ratified: when Australia makes a commitment to a global agreement, we follow through-and that is exactly what we are doing. We are committed to the Paris Agreement, and we are on track to meet our targets. We are committed to ensuring that Australia has affordable and reliable energy and to achieving that while meeting our global commitments for emissions reduction. That is our commitment. What we are doing is taking real and practical action to get that job done. The Deputy Prime Minister talked about our commitment to Snowy Hydro 2.0-the largest commitment to storage to support renewable energy in the Southern Hemisphere. That is a vital project. The Labor Party, especially in the honourable member's state, allowed renewable energy, wind, to be rolled out to such an extent that it can provide well over 100 per cent of the state's electricity but then, at the next minute, zero-no storage; no plan; no backup. The Labor Party has allowed gas prices to go through the roof on the east coast, and we have had to take the steps to bring them down. The decisive action that I took, as Prime Minister, to ensure that we would limit exports so as to be confident that gas demand was met on the east coast of Australia has already seen the wholesale price come down, as it ought and as it needs to do. That is our commitment: affordable, reliable energy, and meeting our emissions reduction targets in accordance with our commitment to the Paris treaty.

148,Dr MCVEIGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the Australia-United States foreign affairs and defence ministers meeting next week? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (15:09): I thank the member for Groom for his question and his interest in this very important meeting. Next week the defence minister, Senator Marise Payne, and I will host, in Sydney, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and US Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis, for the annual Australia-US Ministerial Consultations known as AUSMIN. AUSMIN has been the principal forum for our bilateral consultations for about the past 30 years, and this ministerial meeting will be the first formal ministerial meeting with the new Trump administration. It follows on from the very successful visit to Australia by Vice President Pence and the Prime Minister's meeting with President Trump in New York. Indeed, there have been 13 ministerial visits to the United States since the inauguration-all high-level, all targeted to matters that will benefit the Australian people. AUSMIN builds on the very strong foundation of this long standing bilateral relationship, built up over 100 years and formalised in 1951 with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty by my distinguished predecessor foreign minister Percy Spender and US Secretary of State Dean Acheson. Defence Minister Payne and I will discuss with our US counterparts a wide range of matters of mutual interest and concern, particularly security issues involving North Korea; our cooperation in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria; how we work together on countering terrorism and on defeating ISIS; and our intelligence sharing for the benefit of our citizens and our region.  Australia and the United States are like-minded in our commitment to defend the international rules based order. We work together exceedingly well and very closely in regional forums, including APEC, and I am delighted to hear that President Trump will be at the East Asia Summit in Manila in November. Few countries can claim to be as close as Australia and the United States. Few countries are more important to Australia than the United States, our strongest and closes strategic and defence partner and the source of the greatest amount of foreign direct investment. Indeed, the United States is our second-largest trading partner. Together we work closely for the peace, prosperity and stability of our region, and AUSMIN provides a very valuable opportunity for the defence minister, the foreign minister and the United States defence minister to share perspectives, to share insights, not only for the benefit of the Australian people and the citizens of the United States but for our region and globally.",104

153,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," This week we have actually seen the 'tale of two puppets'. I do not mean Punch and Judy and I do not mean Bert and Ernie. I mean the member for Wentworth and Harold the giraffe! They are both noble, stately, proud creatures. They are both exotic. They enjoy a water view. They are at home with the safari set. They are both famous for looking down on everyone, and in some parts of the world both are endangered species! Now, we are hearing some familiar rumblings from the Liberal backbenchers. They have started to wonder if anyone is listening to the Prime Minister. They are questioning, with that head-slapping Conservative attitude, 'Is our message getting through?' And yet the first puppet to get it in the neck was not the member for Wentworth; it was our friend, poor old Harold the giraffe. At least he sticks his neck out for something! This is what Life Education has said: The recent news that our 2017/18 Budget Submission was unsuccessful now finds Life Education defunded by the Australian Government for the first time in ‘literally decades'. Sometimes it is the little things that speak volumes about the government. In a budget which contained $65 billion given away to large companies, banks and multinationals; in a budget which has $37 billion protected for property investors; and in a budget with $19 billion for tax cuts for the top two per cent, this mean-spirited government could not find half a million dollars for a program that last year reached nearly three-quarters of a million children. It talked about a healthy lifestyle and the dangers of drugs. And now they say that it was all an honest mistake-it was an oversight. But I can tell Australians what was not an oversight by the Liberal Party and their country cousins, the National Party: a $22 billion cut for Australian schools; cuts to TAFE, training and apprenticeships; increasing the cost of university; punishing graduates-especially women-by lowering the threshold at which the HECS repayments have to be paid; and, of course, the ongoing wreckage of Australian Apprenticeships. These are all deliberate acts of political vandalism and they undercut the key to our future prosperity: education and training. Education is how we make our luck in this country. I acknowledge the work of our commodity sectors in meeting world demand. That is fantastic. But in some way that world demand is the luck that the world gives us. This budget does nothing to address the luck that we make for ourselves-being a clever country. That is why if we want to compete in the world-if we want to be able to cope and collaborate and create in a world where we see the marvellous rise of India and China and the countries in our region-only Labor has a plan. It is Labor which will put $22 billion back  into our school system-the $22 billion that the Liberals are cutting from government and non-government schools. We heard today in question time about the special school in the South Australian system. Mr Turnbull says they are adding more money, but what the member for Wentworth does not tell us is that they are taking that increase using Mr Abbott's cuts-the member for Warringah's cuts-as the baseline. The fact of the matter is that the Catholic education system in South Australia, which run this special school, are desperate. They are the ones the parents will listen to. All of the rhetoric from the government, saying, 'Trust us,' is not going to wash with the parents. We know that some of those backbenchers with their heads down right now understand that the principals and the parents are not buying what Senator Birmingham is selling.",106
154,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Government members interjecting,107
155,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That got their heads up! And of course we will reverse the trend of privatisation in our vocational education sector. We will put TAFE back at the centre of vocational education, where it should be. We will help rebuild our TAFE campuses in the outer suburbs and the regions and we will back Australian Apprenticeships on infrastructure projects. We have a one in 10 rule for when we get elected: one apprentice for every 10 people employed on Commonwealth infrastructure projects. We will never support the government putting up the price of going to university while they cut funding to university and while they lower the trigger point at which Australians have to repay their HECS debts. Of course, the more that Australians learn about this budget, the less they like it. The unfairness is showing through more and more every day. Of course, this is especially in the way that this government is steadfastly supporting increasing the income taxes of every Australian above $21,000. They want to increase those income taxes; but at the same time they are supporting a tax cut for millionaires on 1 July this year. There is nothing fair about that. This government, in its cynical fashion, is pretending that there is only one way to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Well, we have got some advice for the government. We have come up with a smarter, fairer way: the ANU modelling shows that. We have done our own homework. We believe in a system which funds the social services of this nation without increasing income taxes on the battling, working middle-class families of this country. This government loves to say, 'Well, we've increased the Medicare levy before, so let's just bang it through.' But a lot has changed in the last four years. Back in 2013, wages growth was over three per cent. Under these rotten twisters sitting opposite, wages growth has flatlined at 1.9 per cent. I bet when you top up the wages of senior executives, wages growth for low-paid workers is even lower. We have got underemployment; casualisation is at an all-time high. This is a government that can deliver you a part-time job, but they are just not so good at delivering full-time jobs. Living standards are stagnating, and Australians know it. Apprenticeship numbers have collapsed. It is harder than ever for young Australians to enter the housing market and this government's only plan to help battling people is to increase their income taxes.  They used to scream about a budget emergency. The deficit has gone up 10 times since then. The gross debt is projected to hit three-quarters of a trillion dollars. Now, they have moved off the budget emergency and they have got a new dose of hysteria: the NDIS emergency. These people know that they do not have to give a corporate tax cut of $65 billion. They could afford negative gearing. They do not have to give a tax cut to the top two per cent, but their default position is to tax the working people of this country more and hope that no-one notices their largess to the top end of town. The Liberals can badge it whatever they like: a tax is a tax is a tax. They are increasing taxes on a lot of Australians who do not deserve it. The Liberals do it because they are too lazy to do the hard work and tackle vested interests in this country. We have got a fairer and more progressive plan. It has already been costed. It produces more in the medium term to the bottom line, and it does not slug working people under $87,000. We just heard that gobbledygook from the Prime Minister in question time. What he did not say-when he was talking about marginal effective tax rates-is that, under their plan and ours, if you earn $87,000 and one dollar then you will pay the same. What he did not have the honesty to say is that if you earn less than $87,000, you were a damn sight better off if Labor was in government. We heard the plea of the millionaires: 'What about poor us?' The Prime Minister gave it yesterday. He said, on somehow keeping in place a budget repair levy to deal with a deficit which has got worse, that this is a tax on success. Let me just remind the government of a couple of things about our definition of success. If you are a building worker helping build the buildings Australia needs: you might not earn $180,000, but you are a success in my book. If you are a childcare worker earning $60,000 a year, if you are lucky: you are a success in my book. If you are a teacher teaching our kids, if you are a policeman keeping us safe or if you are one of eight million Australians who earn less and $87,000: you are still a success in Labor's book. We do not define the size of your pay cheque and equate that to somehow being better person or not. The Prime Minister speaks about the tax on success for those who earn half a million and a million. Well, I think that their tax on the success of everyday Australians is something that we are going to call out, and we will call it out every day to the next election. We are so beyond the debate of this government when they say that somehow they have got a fairer plan. It is not fair to raise the income taxes of eight million Australians when you have other perfectly acceptable means of funding the functions of government. We suggest to the government: if you want to have a battle on fairness, bring it on, because you are more lost than Burke and Wills. You do not have a view about it. You are out of touch about Australians. And, secretly, you all know that your Prime Minister is the most out of touch Prime Minister in a very long time. (Time expired)",107
156,Mr MCCORMACK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Burke is not lost; he is just there, member for Maribyrnong. He is just behind you. I bet he is probably doing the numbers, too, just like the member for Grayndler is. There we heard 10 minutes of politics of envy. The member for Maribyrnong, the opposition leader, talks about teachers and nurses. Look out, those same teachers and nurses, if they happen to have an investment property because ' Mr Anti-Negative Gearing' is coming to get you. Back to your bunker! Off he goes, back to his bunker to count the numbers.  I like to see that there are plenty of children up in the gallery. That is great. They should know that their principals, teachers and parents will benefit from the fact that they are about to get more needs-based school funding. It is great that there are so many of them in the gallery-and they are giving a wave. They are going to be getting more funding thanks to the coalition's recent budget. For many Australians, today is just another day. They may be ordinary Australians, older Australians in need of help through the National Disability Insurance Scheme or a student sitting in a classroom-or, dare I say, in one of the galleries-which is in desperate need of needs-based funding. They might be a farmer whose crop can feed or clothe thousandssomebody from your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton. They might be a truckie travelling along one of our country's connecting highways, delivering those goods to market-perhaps from the member for Lyne's electorate to one of our fine cities. Or they could be a worker, just like 5.6 million Australians are. Almost half of our workforce who got up today went to work in one of Australia's small businesses. Ordinary Australians are at the heart of this government's agenda. Deep in the heart of those opposite, they know it is true. All of these people, all of these ordinary Australians, all of these everyday Australians are the people our budget was for. It represented them. It was fair and responsible, and provided opportunity for them. And it was measured. Our plan, outlined on 9 May, means that from the inland to the coast, in the cities and across the regions, there is a bright future for ordinary Australians who are just trying to get ahead. As we deliver our budget of fairness for ordinary Australians, those opposite, just like the member for Maribyrnong, play politics with people's lives. He would be in his little bunker now doing the numbers and making sure that the member for Grayndler is not getting too far ahead of him. There was a time when those opposite called for needs-based funding for our kids, but they sit silent as this government delivers it. There was a time when those opposite told the Liberals and Nationals to: 'Do the right thing by people with disability; support the increase in the Medicare levy.' But the opposition leader rolls his shadow cabinet to stand in the way of delivering it. There was a time when those opposite would have you believe that the Inland Rail corridor from Melbourne to Brisbane was built by the member for Grayndler himself-it was already there! But they can only muster calling it a 'valuable idea', as construction is set to begin through places such as my electorate and your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton. Deep in the heart of those opposite is a division which cuts to the core. They know this budget has a Liberals and Nationals stamp on it-a Liberals and Nationals letterhead above it-because it has real money to fund it. It is not phoney money; it is not Monopoly money; it is real money. They know it will improve the lives of those who are most in need, be they students or people with a disability. The politicking of their leader means they cannot support it. They will not support it. They will be just as obstructionist. They will just stand in the way. Ordinary Australians are the ones left behind and hurt by Labor as politics pummel people. The Labor letterhead-speaking of letterheads-says, 'We'll put people first.' What a joke that is! It is ordinary Australians who are getting left behind by those opposite. Our budget delivers for ordinary Australians. We stand with them shoulder to shoulder, and it starts with small business. Small business is everyone's business. It is ordinary Australians' business. There was a time when it was Labor's business. Once, there was a speech soaring in  rhetoric from a man who knew what it took for the economy to grow. Once there was a man who knew that our country grows when our small-business sector is strong. There was a man who invited this government to join him to boost our country's economy. That man said the following: I invite you to work with me on a fair and fiscally responsible plan to reduce the tax rate for Australian small business from 30 to 25 per cent-not a 1½ per cent cut; a five per cent cut. He continued: A 1½ per cent cut for small businesses might be enough to generate a headline but it is not enough to generate the long-term confidence and growth our economy needs. That is what he said. He knew that ordinary Australians had a big future in small business. As a minister in the Labor government he used to skite about small business and how Labor cared-or purportedly cared. Once he told ordinary Australians: Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-80s knows that part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate. He went on to say: We need to be able to make life easier for Australian business, which employs two in every three Australians. But that was when the member for Maribyrnong actually believed in something. It was when he wanted to actually support ordinary Australians instead of lecturing them. But it is clear from today's matter of public importance debate that something has changed. Today, the member for Maribyrnong thinks of just one thing: his own job; politics. He is so spooked by the machinations within the Labor Party that the references to small business have gone. So too is the belief that small business has a big future and that it creates real jobs. Gone is the support for tax cuts. Gone is the quest for growth. Gone is the jobs focus of the modern Labor Party. From the man who once told parliament about the economic boost from small business tax cuts comes today the ridiculous notion and the ridiculous belief that those with a $2 million turnover are somehow millionaires. From the man who once invited us on that journey to cut small business tax, we have had just eight references to small business in this parliament since the last election-just eight. I thought I would take a look, because surely the journeyman to 25 per cent could not have jumped that far off the bandwagon-surely not! Sadly, it seems that this is true. Of the eight references to small business from the member for Maribyrnong since the last election, three were when he was tabling the shadow ministerial arrangements. I thought I would give the so called ordinary Australians' champion the benefit of the doubt. After all, he has written a book! It is a book, I hope, like those of his front-bench colleagues, that says what they are too scared to say in this place-a book like those by the members for MCMahon and Fenner, where good sense can prevail. Alas, it is no better there. There are just a handful of references from the self-appointed small business journeyman, nothing like the 'Labor thing' the member for MCMahon once espoused-he called cuts to small business tax a 'Labor thing'. There is nothing about the good economic theory applauded by the member for Fenner. No, today the member for Maribyrnong forgets that ordinary Australians who own small businesses think about the responsibility they have to their employees, their workers. He forgets that they think about the responsibility of paying wages that support their employees'  families. He forgets that they think about the burden of far too much red tape and far too much bureaucracy. He forgets that they think about their plans to expand their businesses even further and provide even more jobs for locals. But today, just like every day, the Liberals and Nationals do think about them. We do care. We do support them. We think about those who wake up early and start work in their small business. We think about those for whom paperwork and commitments mean that the work clock ticks long past five o'clock. We think about those who employ almost half the Australians in work and the $380 billion they contribute to the nation's gross domestic product. We think of ordinary Australians doing extraordinary things in small business. That is why we have cut the small business tax rate to its lowest level-27½ per cent-in many, many decades. That is why we have an incentive of $300 million on the table, from the budget, for the states and territories to further reduce red tape. That is why our bill, which passed this House last night, will extend the instance asset write-off for another year. But as we deliver for ordinary Australians in small business, those opposite stand in the way. They voted against our tax cut. They will scrap our incentive to cut red tape. They will hike small business tax in government. Hopefully they will not get there too soon; hopefully they will not get there at all. They are not even shy about it. Gone are the days of job creation. Gone is the soaring rhetoric and the economic plan. Here instead are ordinary Australiansthe pawn in Labor's political game. I wonder what happened to Labor's small business journeyman and how we can get him back on track. How can we get him back on track? Maybe it is one of those books from the members for MCMahon and Fenner, which he can purchase from any good local bookstorenow paying less tax, thanks to this government. Or maybe it is the simple fact that small businesses-ordinary Australians, each and every one of them-have a applauded this year's budget for its fairness, its security, its opportunity for all Australians. So I will say to the Labor Party something simple: deep within their heart they know this budget is fair, they know it is fair, they know it is fully funded, they know it is full of opportunity. They know it delivers David Gonski's dream of needs-based funding for schools, with an $18.6 billion increase in funding over 10 years. In their heart of hearts, they know it is right. Mr Rob Mitchell: And in our guts we know you're nuts!",108
157,Mr MCCORMACK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, could you ask him to withdraw that. It is bad enough that he gets up and makes a false matter of grievance. He should withdraw that. He is in and out of his place. That is highly disorderly. Mr Rob Mitchell: You just lied to the parliament.",111
158,Mr MCCORMACK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I did not lie the parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask him to withdraw the statement he made-the fact is that he is out of his place-and that I lied to the House.",111
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, The Minister for Small Business will resume his seat. I ask the member for MCEwen to withdraw. The statement he made is unparliamentary and he is sitting out of his place. I heard the interjection. He will withdraw. Mr Rob Mitchell: I will withdraw to make you happy.,111
160,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Thank you. I call the member for Braddon. ,111
161,Ms KEAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," If this budget is fair, than I must be on a different planetand so must every other Australian in this country who does not believe a word that comes out of the mouths of those sitting opposite. It is quite clear that this government do not listen to people in their own communities, those people who actually elected them to sit over there; they do not even listen to them. They do not even take any notice of evidence, of research. They should take a grassroots approach to policy development by actually going and talking to the people who elected them. Or, if they cannot do that, they should take an academic approach and look at the evidence provided by researchers and independent people. I question whether they have the ability to do that-or else they would not have arrived at this unfair budget. A headline today in The Sydney Morning Herald reads 'Twice as many households worse off under coalition's Medicare levy rise plan'. Let's look at this in a little bit of detail, if you are not convinced by that. The article says: Twice as many households will be worse off under the federal government's plan to raise the Medicare levy by half a percentage point than under Labor's alternative, according to new modelling by the ANU's Centre for Social Research and Methods. And middle-income earners will do much more of the heavy lifting under the Coalition than under Labor … It continues: If the Liberal policy were in place from July 1, 2019, according to the ANU modelling, 60 per cent of households would be worse off, 39 per cent would see no change, and just 1 per cent would be better off. Now I reckon 60 per cent of those households would be in the seats of a number of those sitting opposite-maybe not the member for Wentworth, we can understand that. But many of the members over there, particularly those in regional and rural seats, would have to look at this research and question whether they support this measure. And I bet that one per cent are sitting in the seat of Wentworth. Who are these people listening to-the people who elected them or the Prime Minister? It beggars belief. When I look at the Medicare levy, I try to imagine how the government arrived at this measure. They are saying we have to give big business a tax cut. But they do not even look at their own Treasury modelling, which suggests that in 20 years time it will deliver economic growth of 0.1 per cent-negligible growth. They are not even looking at their own modelling! Let's go back to the conversation the Treasurer probably had in his office with his advisers and so forth: 'We want to give big business a $65 billion tax cut. How are we going to fund that? What are we going to do to make our budget return to surplus at some point in time? The Medicare levy was really popular when Labor introduced the NDIS'-which Labor fully funded, mind you. 'People actually thought that was a pretty reasonable measure. So let's just say that the NDIS is fully funded and we will raise the Medicare levy to pay for that big gap of giving big business a tax cut!' We have a party sitting over there saying they are the party of lower tax-that is, lower taxes for millionaires and big business, not for the rest of our community. Let's look at another measure-the energy supplement. I do not know about those sitting opposite, but I have been listening to my community because I have been inundated with letters from people in my community about the government's plan, in its budget, to remove  the energy supplement. The carbon tax does not exist any more, but we know that energy prices are rising. So Bill from Penguin says, 'Stop whacking the poor and the pensionershave a go at the rich individuals and the large companies.' Helen from Wynyard said, 'Dear elected representative, I'm horrified to read that the public are facing another threat to the clean energy supplement. Families are struggling with daily living costs. Every dollar counts. I urge you not to push people further back into poverty.' Aileen from Somerset says, 'As a pensioner in Tasmania, it costs more than a pensioner can afford to keep the heater on from about 5 pm, when it gets very cold, until a sensible bed time. Surely it is not expected that we put up with being cold. Most Aussies would not think this is fair.' Then I go to Malcolm from Devonport: 'I am a pensioner. If these Liberal mongrels have their way they will try to get rid of the energy supplement, putting a heavier burden on the poor, and look after their rich mates in the coal industry.' So we know the priorities of this government. It is not the pensioners. It is not the lowincome and middle-income earners. It is the rich and big business.'",112
162,Mr WALLACE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," The budget that was announced just a few short weeks ago is all about security and opportunity. This government, this side of the House, is all about providing opportunities for everyday Australians. This government has provided an extra $18.6 billion in Gonski needs based funding for schools. In my electorate alone, just in my 35 schools, let's just have a look at some of the schools in my electorate of Fisher. There is $27 million more for Unity College over a 10-year period; $26 million more for Glasshouse Christian College; $22 million more for Chancellor State College; $21 million more for Meridan State College; $17 more for Siena Catholic College. I was very heartened to see Brisbane Catholic Education come out in the last couple of days and support the budget education reforms. Turning now from education to infrastructure, how is it fair that people on the Sunshine Coast have spent years and years stuck on the Bruce Highway? The member for Grayndler, when he was the infrastructure minister, did absolutely nothing for the Sunshine Coast-no improvements to the Bruce Highway, no improvements to rail. How is that fair? Under this government we are spending a total of $929.3 million between Caloundra Road and Sunshine Motorway. Was that done under a Labor government? No, it was not. $929.3 million for a new interchange at Caloundra Road, a new interchange at Sunshine Motorway. This is reforms to transport that the other side and the member for Grayndler, when he was the transport and infrastructure minister, did not even dream of. This side of the House wants to ensure that people get to work safely and as quickly as possible. Those people on the Sunshine Coast who have ever travelled to Brisbane in peak hour traffic-peak 'hour' is now around three hours in the morning and three hours at night-will know and relish that this government is stumping up and doing for the Sunshine Coast things that the Labor Party never did when they were in government. But we did not stop there. In the budget we announced a further $650 million for the Bruce Highway upgrades south of Caloundra, on top of the announcement that was made in September. How is it fair that under Labor the Sunshine Coast and the Bruce Highway did not get a brass razoo? But under the Turnbull coalition government we are now seeing these sorts of fantastic funding opportunities.  And it is not just road; it is also rail-a $10 billion national rail program. That is on top of the $8.4 billion being spent on the rail from Brisbane to Melbourne. There is the $10 billion National Rail Program on top of that $8.4 billion that the Queensland a Labor state government can tender for. They can tender for that $10 billion. So we will be able to get duplicated rail from Beerburrum to Nambour. It is a matter for the Queensland state Labor government to actually put in a tender for that project. But will they do it? There is very likely chance that they will not-zero chance-because they do not want spend the money. The chances are that they do not have the money! But they would not spend it, because they do not care about the Sunshine Coast. Let us look at the NDIS. As the father of a disabled child, I know that all of you people over there, or most of you, will want to see funding for our most disadvantaged. But your leader does not want to do it, and he is a disgrace. (Time expired) Mr ROB MITCHELL (MCEwen) (15:46): We should remind those opposite that they did not want to do it. They were dragged to it. I was in this chamber. I know; they do not. They come in here late and pretend they know things. Let us go to the fundamental heart of what we are talking about today: this unfair budget. What we have seen today is a prime example of those opposite only being concerned about the top end of town. We have heard all day from this government-and the muppets keep yapping-that millionaires and people such as them, people on the front-bench like Dr Gillespie, are going to get a $6,000 or $7,000 tax cut. But what about pensioners? Why do they need to be paying more? Why will you take the energy supplement off them and only give them back $75? Why would you do that? That is the question that we ask. Why would the government do that?",113
163,Mr Wallace,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Only millionaires drive, do they? Mr ROB MITCHELL: I will take that interjection. It is a perfect example of the ignorance of the LNP. Remember Joe Hockey and 'poor people cannot afford to drive cars'? We have just had that today from another right-wing ideologue who wants to look after himself and thinks that pensioners do not deserve more money. Why does he think that people on low incomes deserve to be taxed more? Why do they deserve to have less money in their pockets? We heard it today from the prime minister. We know the Prime Minister is a wellrounded individual with his top hat, his monocle, his truffles and his money hidden in the Cayman Islands.",114
164,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Order, Member for MCEwen. Dr Gillespie: I ask the member to withdraw those comments about the Prime Minister. Mr ROB MITCHELL: No, you cannot. Learn your standing orders while you are still here and stop wasting time. Today we again heard the Prime Minister talk about people earning less than $87,000. He said, 'We actually want to help people earning less than $87,000.' They don't. They want to punish them. The Prime Minister said, 'You're rallying against people who are successful.' In the eyes of the Liberal National Party, people who are out there defending our country, police officers, nurses and all those earning $87,000, are failures. By their own words they should be hanged because of this. People earning less than $87,000 are not failures. I will tell you what a failure is. A failure is someone who goes and sits on the government benches like you lot and talks about Whyalla being wiped out, talks about $100 lamb roasts,  tries to take the energy supplement from pensioners, cuts funding from needy schools and drags Medicare prices up so that people cannot afford to go to the doctors. It costs $75 to go to a doctor on a weekend in Mernda. Who can afford that? Certainly not people who are earning low incomes and certainly not families.",114
165,Mr Wallace,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,How about lying? Mr ROB MITCHELL: I ask that he withdraw that immediately.,115
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,NoMr ROB MITCHELL: If he is going to say that I am lying then he has to withdraw it.,115
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I was listening to the member for Fisher. He did not accuse anyone of lying. Mr ROB MITCHELL: Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that you have a look at that again. He is sitting there saying that we are lying.",115
168,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I heard what he said. He did not accuse anyone of lying. I call the member for MCEwen. Mr ROB MITCHELL: What can you say? It is ridiculous that people can come in here and make mendacious claims, be deliberately untruthful and sit there and not have the guts to withdraw it. It shows what a low rent character the people who live in your electorate have as their representative. It is really disgusting that those opposite want to come in here and punish poor people to the benefit of the rich. We had a Prime Minister-when he had knifed the previous one-come in here and say that he was going to talk about economic leadership. Where did that go? Gone. 'Explain issues and foster understanding in the electorate' was his quote. Where did that go? 'Respect people's intelligence.' What did we get? 'Continuity with change'. They were that lazy, that pathetic, that they ran to a TV show to get their slogan. This is a Prime Minister who has failed and backflipped on everything he ever stood for. We all remember of the Q&A Turnbull who would sit there with his leather jacket on, saying he supported same-sex marriage and he would not lead a party that did not believe in climate change. Where did those policies go? They are gone.  Mr ROB MITCHELL: He is not leading the party, we know. (Time expired)",115
169,Mr RAMSEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I read the topic of this matter of public importance and I thought, 'There's a typo.' There has got to be something wrong here: The Government's unfair Budget hurting ordinary Australians. It is not hurting ordinary Australians. It is helping them. It is rebuilding the Australian economy. It is mapping a path for security, for expansion and for growth. That is what this budget is doing. I really wonder at those on the other side of this House, who come into this place now and are having to fight against policies that they actually believe in. They are having to fight against the things the government is doing that they know are right, because recently they were calling for them. We were just accused a few minutes ago of not supporting the NDIS. That, of course, is not the truth. That is absolutely not the truth. The Prime Minister was generous enough the other day to say, 'Yes, Labor first tabled the idea, but we backed it from day one.' So it has full support, but it does not have full support when it comes to funding. Labor half funded the  NDIS and left a black hole, and now Labor oppose the government's proposal to fix up that funding hole. It is worth remembering the reason we have to raise any tax at all is that Labor have been opposed to savings in the Senate. They have blocked the government's budget reforms in the past. It has come to the point where a responsible government has to take a responsible decision to Australia. It cannot go on and say that these things will remain unfunded forever. Because of your intransigence-not yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, I hasten to add; those who sit across the chamber-we have come to a new conclusion. And that conclusion is exactly the same as what those on the other side promoted at an earlier hour. They were the ones who raised the Medicare levy by half of a per cent to partially fund the NDIS. In a noted difference in this chamber, they found a friend on the other side. When we sat on those benches, we said, 'Yes, the NDIS must be funded.' But they did not go the full mile; but now we are, and it sticks in their craw-just as it sticks in their craw that we have delivered true needs based funding for schools, true Gonski. That is what we have delivered. That sticks in their craw. They had 27 different agreements right around Australia, and we have delivered a flat bench. Everybody gets the same adjusted on needs based social conditions. They would have loved to have done that, but they could not get it done. They had to stitch up their deals. In the past they had championed the idea of reducing taxes on small and medium businesses-but, no, they oppose that as well Dr Freelander: No, we don't. We are not opposed to tax cuts for small business.",115
170,Mr RAMSEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You certainly do oppose those tax cuts flowing through.,116
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, The member for Grey will address his comments through the chair and the member for Macarthur will cease interjecting.,116
172,Mr RAMSEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have delivered a tax cut to Middle Australia. Those earning $87,000-that is not a fortune-were getting caught up in bracket creep, and we have fixed that issue. And, at the end of the line, we are delivering a surplus-something that that side of the parliament promised to do on no less than four occasions. They never got anywhere near it, and they still do not have a path to get there. We know what would happen if Labor came back to these benches-those surpluses would just keep disappearing into the future. This government is responsible-it is meeting its commitments to the Australian public. As well, we are helping rural Australia by pumping an extra $472 million into those areas. We are helping ordinary Australians-I think that is what this matter of public importance today is about-by pumping that extra $472 million into a Regional Growth Fund, and we are helping ordinary Australians by providing another round of funding for the Building Better Regions Fund. (Time expired)",116
173,Ms SWANSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," This unfair budget is hurting ordinary Australians, and nowhere more so than in my electorate of Paterson. It is hurting pensioners in Paterson. It is hurting parents in Paterson. It is hurting schoolchildren in Paterson. It is hurting university students in Paterson. It is hurting women in Paterson. It is hurting every single person who is on any sort of income support whatsoever in Paterson. It is hurting young people in Paterson. It is doing nothing to help young people who want to own a home in Paterson. It does nothing to help ordinary people in Paterson trying to get an education-to skill, to upskill or to reskill. In fact, the only people who are getting a win out of this unfair budget are the millionaires and the multinationals-and I do not think we have all that many of them in Paterson.  I have heard from many, many people in Paterson over the last three weeks, because I get out and talk to a lot of people in my seat, about how unfortunate this budget is, and I would like to share a couple of their emails: Dear Meryl, at an exclusive $300 a head 'future of welfare' luncheon last week, Minister Alan Tudge delivered a speech likening our social safety net to 'poison'. He doesn't need the pension, does he?! The last time the Turnbull Government tried to slash the clean energy supplement to push people further down into poverty, the Nick Xenophon team, Labor, the Greens and Senators Lambie and Hinch shut it down before the Bill even made it to the Senate. Let's make sure we all hold the line again this time. Another email was titled 'A fair go for all': I don't want to live in an American-style society. Everyone deserves the dignity of a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, as well as a hand-up when disaster hits. I don't want families living in tents in church car parks and working 2 or more jobs each to put food on the table. I don't want CEOs and politicians wallowing in excess at the expense of exploited workers and taxpayers. That's a good one. Another email says: Snatching money away from age pensioners, people living with a disability and single parents is unacceptable. Especially when the Turnbull Government is pushing to give corporations a $65 billion tax cut. This is what people in my electorate of Paterson are telling me about this budget and this government-that they are extremely unacceptable and completely unfair. They wear fairness like a cheap suit-they do not understand the word; they drag it out every day and say, 'I've got to get the fairness suit on and get out there and get amongst the real people'. We actually understand the weft and warp of fairness, because it is our very fabric-we stand up every day for those ordinary people, and deliver. This is not a fair budget, and the people of Paterson know it. They do not ask for the world, but they expect a fair go and a good lifeand the detail of this budget is not lost on them. The government are chipping away at public education, they are chipping away at health services, they are chipping away at the safety net and they are chipping away at opportunity. Paterson is a place that is proud of its working-class roots. We work in manufacturing, in retail, in health care and in social assistance. These are not high-paying jobs, but they are hard working jobs. We know hard work. This budget fails these hard working people because it does not recognise or reward this hard work; it chips away at it. It is asking people to pay more in their Medicare levy, to pay more in their taxes, to pay more to go to the doctor, to pay more to get an X-ray and to pay more to get a Pap smear or a mammogram. Paterson is a place of high youth unemployment as well, yet there is nothing in this budget for young people. Our schools will lose $23 million. Our university students will be asked to pay more, our apprenticeships are few and far between and our TAFEs are left wanting. Paterson is a haven for retirees. It is a beautiful place to put your feet up at the end of your working life, and you know what they say about retirement-you never get a day off! But  Paterson retirees are not by and large wealthy, self-funded retirees; they are people with modest incomes who have squirrelled just enough away to put their feet up in modest comfort with a little bit of help-and good on them for that. Yet we want to take the energy supplement away from them so they cannot even afford to put the heater on. They will be pulling on their knee rugs and putting on their jumpers, because this government wants to take away their heating. This is a budget about values-very few values on that side but plenty on ours, and these values are not embodied by the government. The people of Paterson want a fair go. They want a fair day's pay for a good day's work, a hand up for those in need, not handouts to millionaires and multinationals, not some champagne-sipping, cigar-sucking lot. Mr RICK WILSON (O'Connor) (16:01): The theme of today's MPI is the alleged unfairness of the budget. It made me reflect on what fairness actually means, so I have listed a few issues where I think this budget is extremely fair. Firstly, is it fair to hand on my debt to my children? Is it fair for me to say, 'I'm going to spend myself into debt. I'm going to spend more than I am earning, more revenue than I am raising'? And is it fair to say to my children, 'It is your responsibility to deal with that debt'? I think it is terribly unfair. It would be terribly unfair for me to do that. One of the really fair aspects of this budget is that we are finally on a trajectory back into surplus. We came into government in late 2013, and it was the objective of the then Prime Minister and Treasurer to repair the budget and get us back into surplus as soon as possible. Those on the other side blocked every measure that we put up to get the budget back into surplus. It has been a hard road, and I take my hat off not only to former Treasurer Hockey but also to Treasurer Morrison for the hard work they have had to put into bring this budget back into surplus. And we are finally on a trajectory to reach a surplus. I think that is a very fair measure; it is a fair measure for my children, because at this stage they are going to be responsible for a large amount of debt that was clocked up by this generation, starting in 2008 with the Labor government, which had inherited $60 billion in the bank and a $20 billion surplus. That is what they inherited in 2008. They then spent that money and embedded deficits in the budget going forward, into the foreseeable future, and then blocked every measure that we proposed to try to bring that budget back under control. Another area where I think this budget is very fair is in relation to people with a disability. The National Disability Insurance Scheme was a bipartisan policy. We support the scheme not only in principle but also through funding. I am very blessed across the electorate of O'Connor. We have some wonderful disability service providers-for example, Lower Great Southern Community Living Association. I met with Ian Campbell and Penny Bryant only a few weeks ago with the Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services, the member for Ryan. Also, in the Goldfields, we have Goldfields Individual and Family Support Association. Robert Hicks and his team up there do a fantastic job delivering disability services. I have also met many of their clients as well. Those people need certainty and security going forward and need to know that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is going to be fully funded. We put up a proposal in this year's budget to increase the Medicare levy by 0.5 of per cent, because every Australian will benefit from the insurance that that scheme provides-every Australian. I think that it is fair that every Australian contributes 0.5 per cent of their income, because, as my mother used to say,  there but for the grace of God go I. Any of us or any of our children could require the services that are provided under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Everyone that I have spoken to-I obviously speak to some different people to those on the other side-feels that that is a very fair impost on the community. But I tell you what is not fair. It is not fair that someone who is earning $87,000 who might work a day's overtime will lose $500 of that in tax. That is not fair. It is not fair that a nurse or a policeman who might do an extra shift will lose $500 out of their pocket. That is not fair. (Time expired)",116
174,Mr WATTS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Thanks to a Liberal Party focus group somewhere in the lead-up to the budget fairness is now the rhetorical terrain in which we engage in this chamber. But, because it is a Thursday afternoon, let's put aside the political rhetoric and talk about the reality outside this building for a minute. Inequality is the defining economic trend of our time. It is at a 75-year high in this country. Inequality is growing at such a rate around the world that most economists, including those long hairs at the IMF, now view it as a major brake on economic growth. Inequality is becoming so pervasive that it is now interfering with fundamental dynamics in our economy and our society that we used to rely on-dynamics like reward for effort and equality of opportunity. This inequality is leaving average people feeling like they have no control over their prospects, no way to improve the lot of themselves or their families-leaving them feeling like the rules of the game are rigged against them by forces they have no power over. And it is this inequality that this government seems absolutely oblivious to. The dynamics of the modern economy, driven by technology change and globalisation, mean that we are seeing increasing returns to capital and shrinking returns to labour. Through the Menzies era, hourly labour income and productivity grew at about the same pace. The labour share stayed roughly stable and growth in inequality was kept in check. But, since the turn of the millennium, wages growth has decoupled from productivity and the real hourly labour income received by workers has failed to keep pace with their productivity growth. As a result, the labour share fell by 5.2 per cent in the first decade of the 21st century and a further 0.6 per cent so far in the second decade. Wages growth is at record lows, at just 1.9 per cent per annum, below the inflation rate. Underemployment, the number of people in the workforce who want to work more but are prevented from doing so, is at a record level. More than 1.1 million people or 8.7 per cent of the workforce want to work more but cannot. Wherever you look, working Australians are struggling. Living standards are stagnating and people are anxious and angry about it. There are no easy answers to these structural challenges, but government should not be actively intervening to make things worse. Yet that is exactly what the Turnbull government's unfair budget does. According to the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods report, released today, 60 per cent of Australians-working Australians-are worse off under this budget. Only one per cent of Australians are better off. And you know which one per centthose top income earners getting a $20 billion income tax cut in this budget. Let us put it simply. This is a budget that increases income taxes on everyone earning more than $21,000 a year-people like registered nurses, whose average salary is $55,000; teachers, $66,000 a year; fireman, $60,000; paramedics, $61,000; and police, $56,000. These are people whose wages are growing at the lowest rate on record. And this is all to fund tax cuts for  millionaires-to give people earning a million dollars a year a $16,000 per year tax cut; to give Ian Narev, the CEO of the CBA, a $171,000 tax cut; to fund $65 billion in tax cuts for banks and multinationals; and to protect $37 billion in tax breaks for property investors. And who are these property investors? They are not the middle income earners that the Prime Minister absurdly claimed in question time today. According to the ATO, only three per cent of cleaners negatively gear, nine per cent of nurses and 12 per cent of teachers. And what is the average tax benefit that they claim from negative gearing? It is less than $100 a year for cleaners, around $200 a year for nurses and around $300 for teachers. In contrast, the 20 per cent of lawyers who negatively gear benefit by around $1,700 a year and the 30 per cent of surgeons who negatively gear benefit by around $3,900 a year, all the while putting the prospect of an Australian average income earner buying their first home further and further out of reach. This budget exacerbates the inequality that I was talking about earlier and that sense in the general community that the rules of the game are rigged against average Australians. And that is not fair. You know that the government knows this too, because they tried to hide it. Previous governments of both political persuasions used to publish tables in the budget overview, showing the impacts of the budget measures, taken as a whole, on the incomes of different kinds of families. They are gone now. And we know why: because those tables would show a very unfair story indeed, with low and middle income earners going backwards while high income earners go forwards. One of the things that scares me the most about being a member of parliament today is that sometimes I can feel the wheel of progress slipping backwards-feel the gains we have made in building an egalitarian society, where everyone has an equal chance to reach their full potential, somehow slipping away. If we want an egalitarian nation, we need to fight for it in this building against those macro trends I was talking about earlier. Those of us on this side of the chamber will fight for it. We will fight for it in the schools. We will fight against the unfair $22 billion funding cut to our schools. We will fight the attacks on our universal healthcare system and the funding there. And we will fight it in our tax system because middle income earners should not pay for tax cuts for millionaires. (Time expired)",119
175,Ms HENDERSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," We heard earlier in this discussion that members opposite think that they might be living on another planet. Well, I think they are. Not only is this budget fair; it is one that delivers opportunity and security. A couple of headlines, for those opposite, who I think have probably not read the budget papers properly at all: there is record schools funding of $18.6 billion over 10 years; the so-called $22 billion was never in Labor's budget. And let us not forget the words of the former tertiary education minister in the Labor government, Craig Emerson, who described Labor's attempts to block our education bill as 'heart breaking'. He said that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to guarantee record funding for schools, and what the Labor Party is doing-and this is from a former Labor tertiary education minister-is 'heart breaking'. So we are seeing fanciful claims by members opposite, and even Craig Emerson has called them out on it. We are delivering record funding for child care and more funding for kindergartens, to fund 15 hours a week. We are delivering tax cuts for 3.2 million small businesses, to grow jobs, business confidence and investment. We are delivering massive investment in  infrastructure. We are guaranteeing Medicare. We are unfreezing Labor's indexation freeze. We are delivering a financial services complaints authority-access to justice for consumers ripped off by the banks. As for Labor: as I mentioned, Labor members, yes, are living on another planet. This is a party that championed business tax cuts a few years ago and now demonises those initiatives, in utter hypocrisy. This is a party that talks about tackling multinational tax avoidance measures that will deliver something like $4 billion in additional revenue in this financial year, and a party that votes against those measures. The Labor Party talks about standing up for those with a disability and then will not fully fund the NDIS-in contradiction to everything that members opposite have said before. This is a party that indulges in a fake class war, when it does not have the guts to admit that a millionaire is not someone who earns $87,000 a year or more. It is a party that talked about 'the most vulnerable in our community' but which, when it was in government, stripped billions of dollars out of the family tax benefit and, in one of the most shameful acts under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years, slashed the sole parent pension. Even Kevin Rudd said belatedly that that was a terrible mistake. And we hear members opposite talking about standing up for single mothers-what an absolute joke! The Labor Party left single mothers high and dry. This is a party that is so intent on being an economic wrecker that it blocks its own savings. It took $5 billion in savings to the people of Australia when it was in government and then it turned around and completely blocked those savings. This is a party with a policy black hole",120

181,Ms PLIBERSEK,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In question time today, the Prime Minister accused me of seeking to mislead the parliament about funding for Our Lady of La Vang school in Adelaide. The Prime Minister said that Our Lady of La Vang will receive an extra $3.9 million over the next 10 years and that the per student contribution from the Commonwealth in the government's estimator will go from $28,855 to $41,390 in 2027. He said: Once again, the member for Sydney set out to mislead the House with claims of cuts that are simply not true. This is absolutely wrong. According to the department's funding estimation tool, which estimates funding under current arrangements provided by the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training to the National Catholic Education Commission, per student funding for Our Lady of La Vang school for 2017 is $62,663. According to the Commonwealth government's school  funding estimator, per student funding in 2018 will be $29,969. That is a reduction of $32,695 per student.

182,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I thank the member for Sydney. NA Comcare and Seacare Legislation Amendment (Pension Age and Catastrophic Injury) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (16:17): I rise today to support the Comcare and Seacare Legislation Amendment (Pension Age and Catastrophic Injury) Bill 2017. Seacare is a workers compensation scheme especially for seafarers. It is necessary because most seafarers work outside of the state they live in. The Maritime Union of Australia surveyed its members, and around 70 per cent who had filed a compensation claim lived in a different state from the one they were injured in or which they regularly worked in. That is not surprising, given the nature of the work. Given the complex and state based nature of Australia's legal and workers compensation frameworks, this can cause significant difficulty in accessing lawyers and independent medical examiners with the appropriate accreditation and expertise. This bill amends the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Seafarers Act to ensure that injured employees in receipt of weekly compensation payments for incapacity can continue to receive their payments until they reach pension age as defined in the Social Security Act 1991. The qualifying age for the aged pension under the Social Security Act 1991 will begin to rise on 1 July this year. By linking compensation for incapacity with a pension age, rather than the defined age of 65, these amendments will ensure that payments continue without a gap. Without this amendment, payments or compensation could cease at age 65 and injured workers could find themselves ineligible for the pension until they reach the new age threshold, which will change year on year from now on. This bill also amends the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Seafarers Act to align these acts with minimum benchmarks for catastrophic workplace injuries and the National Injury Insurance Scheme. The bill seeks to bring into line benefits for catastrophically injured workers who will require intensive care and support for the rest of their lives because of the severity of their injuries. Currently there is a cap on weekly compensation that is payable for household services and attendant care services for these catastrophically injured workers, and I am very pleased to see that this cap will be removed. An employee with a catastrophic injury will also be eligible to receive compensation for household services from the day of injury, whereas under current legislative arrangements there is inexplicably a 28-day waiting period. While Labor will support this bill and the measures it takes to align payments to a pension age, it is worth noting that the government intends to steadily increase the age for eligibility to the age pension to 70 years of age. Labor opposes lifting age pension eligibility to 70. It may be all right for a stockbroker or a solicitor to contemplate a longer working life, but for a  seafarer or a stevedore-where the work is physical and at times dangerous-there are very real health and safety implications associated with forcing people to work into their 70s. Professor Mark Harris, executive director of the Centre for Primary Health Care and Equity of the University of New South Wales, notes: As we get older [health] becomes more unpredictable … Increasing the pension age from 65 to 67 was pretty non-controversial. But [in] increasing it by another three years, we're starting to get into a situation where the risks are greater. So we need to be more thoughtful about that. Professor Harris notes that people in their 70s are more prone to conditions such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis and cognition, vision and hearing loss. That means more risk to self and potentially more risk to others. In their 2013 book Lives in Peril: Profit Or Safety in the Global Maritime Industry? workplace safety experts David Walters and Nick Bailey note that: … seafaring remains a hazardous occupation. Indeed, by these measures it is clearly ranked amongst the most hazardous of occupations. In a survey, 38 per cent of 1,594 respondents said that they had worked on a ship where there had been a serious injury or fatality to another member of the crew. Twenty-eight per cent of respondents had made a compensation claim for an injury or disease due to their own seafaring work. In 2012, it is estimated that worldwide 1,051 seafarers lost their lives at work. The year before, the number was 1,095. As far as I am aware, more current figures are not available. I recommend the book by Walters and Bailey to members. It illustrates how seafarers are, in a world increasingly dependent on global trade, a vulnerable group of workers who operate in an industry where profit is clearly prioritised over safety and other conditions and which operates with limited regulatory oversight. Walters and Bailey note that the situation is likely to remain broadly unchanged: … as long as global maritime governance and regulation remains in thrall to the neo-liberal economic and political arguments that drive globalisation; and fails to enforce regulatory standards more robustly. There is a major role for government in the maintenance and enhancement of Australia's maritime trading routes both domestically and internationally. The three monkeys approach of see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil has no place in a modern democracy that purports to have some regard to the notion of fundamental human rights. Trade is vital to Australia, and we on this side understand that. As a member for a small island state that derives much of its income from the export of agricultural produce, I understand it only too well. But just because I understand the importance of trade and the importance of remaining competitive does not mean I will turn a blind eye to injustice. I will not stand idly by while shipping companies and others sack Australian workers so they can cruelly exploit men and women overseas who are desperate for any work at any cost. I will not remain silent when governments are complicit in that exploitation, whether by ignorance or design. This week in Senate estimates, Senator Doug Cameron quizzed the Fair Work Commission on allegations that foreign seafarers working on flag-of-convenience ships operating in Australian waters are being paid $1.25 an hour. 'Yes, those allegations are being investigated,' came the reply. When Senator Cameron asked if it was time the Fair Work Commission or other authorities started conducting random checks on flags-of-convenience vessels to ensure  compliance with the requirement to meet Australian standards, the response was, 'No.' The Fair Work Commission will consider investigating when a complaint is made, but it is not interested in finding out for itself whether there is a systemic abuse of Australian law. So let us be clear about what we talking about here: a flag-of-convenience vessel is a vessel registered in a country that pays no heed to international standards of vessel safely. These are the rust buckets of the sea, kept afloat by owners desperate to squeeze every last dollar of profit out of them. And if on a journey they should split in two in heavy seas, casting their crew into the deep, or spill oil or diesel onto a reef, they shrug their shoulders and say that is just a cost of doing business. My strong personal view is that flag of convenience vessels should have no place in Australian waters. They should be kept out. The mere fact that an owner has decided to register a vessel like this, rather than register in a nation that requires compliance with international standards, should be all the warning we need that we are dealing with a vessel and an owner who pay more regard to profit than safety. The issue of safety for seafarers is important to this bill. Because conditions in the industry are poor, we are likely to see more cases for compensation. A well-regulated Australian based maritime industry is better for everyone, not least the workers inside the industry. That is something that the residents of King Island, part of my colleague the member for Braddon's electorate, are learning to their sorrow. Due to the inept oversight of the Hodgman state liberal government, and particularly the state transport and infrastructure minister, Rene Hidding, this important island is facing a shipping service crisis. The new ferry service started just three months ago, but it has proved to be entirely inadequate in getting passengers and freight on and off the island in a timely manner. The Liberals appear to be all at sea and at a complete loss when it comes to a solution. Unfortunately the federal government still wants to open up and further deregulate Australian ports, leading to more uncertainty and risk to Australian seafarers. Its plan to create Workchoices on water was sunk in the Senate in the 44th parliament, but it is not giving up and is now instead seeking to amend existing legislation. The Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012 was introduced under Labor and granted preference to Australian vessels between Australian ports. There was provision in the act for temporary licences to permit flag of convenience vessels. This government, rather than issuing them in exceptional circumstances, is dishing those licences out like lollies at a birthday party. This is yet another example where Labor has sought to play a straight bat and provide provisions for exceptional circumstances, only to see the Liberals misuse those provisions to further their ideological obsessions. The result of this ideologically driven agenda is Australian shipping routes that are less safe and an industry that is more dangerous for those who work in it, leading to more claims for compensation and death. It is not often that you will find me looking to America for inspiration, but we really could learn something from the Americans' high regard for their own domestic maritime and seafaring industry. The US Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones act, requires that all goods transported by water between US ports be carried on US-flagged ships crewed by a minimum three quarters US citizens or permanent residents. Furthermore, the US-flagged ships plying those routes must be built in the US, and in the event they are repaired while overseas, the steel of foreign repair work is limited to 10 per cent by weight.  The Jones act sends the neoliberals wild, but it ensures that the US has a strong maritime and shipbuilding industry. This is important not only for jobs, but for national security. Compare that to Australia, an island nation that has run down its shipbuilding and maritime crew capabilities. For jobs, for national security and for fuel security we must do more to rebuild our capabilities as a maritime nation. I am hopeful that the government will abandon its more ideological tendencies and see the practical sense of this. There are positive signs. This government did have to be dragged kicking and screaming to invest in domestic shipbuilding rather than sending the work to the cheapest bidders overseas, but it has at last bitten the bullet, however reluctantly. Now that the government has finally committed to a local defence build, the member for Sturt is almost hopping with joy, with much of the work ending up in his home state. It is a complete coincidence, I am sure, that he happens to be the commissioning minister. I am certainly proud of the continuing shipbuilding capabilities in my home state, which was unfortunately ignored by the $30 billion defence investment. Incat is a significant international player and deserves a closer look. Indeed, I would urge the maritime industry more generally to take a closer look at what we are doing in Tasmania with the Australian Maritime College in Launceston and the Tasmanian Maritime Network based in and around Hobart's northern suburbs and Prince of Wales Bay. This group of businesses, including Incat, can provide a one-stop shop for shipbuilders who want access to the latest technology and quality products and services, including training a construction workforce or fitting out a finished ship. Members of the network, most of whom grew as suppliers to Incat, are significant exporters in their own right. Debate interrupted. NA",122
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. University of Wollongong",125
184,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT," Recently I had the opportunity of attending the official opening of the University of Wollongong's South Western Sydney campus in Liverpool. It was certainly a great honour to represent the electorate that I do, Fowler, which is now providing access for people to a first-class educational facility in Liverpool. The new campus in Liverpool represents a major long-term commitment by the university to the Liverpool region. The University of Wollongong currently provides undergraduate courses in arts, business, business information systems, computer science and information technology. The university also offers postgraduate courses in health leadership and management and a college to host university access programs and diplomas in business, information technology and legal services. To add to this, the university has recently announced an expansion of its course offerings in 2018 to include double degrees in arts/law and business/law. The Bachelor of Nursing is also set to be offered in 2020 in connection with the new Western Sydney Nursing Education and Research Centre. This will not apply a very significant role in the training of the next generation of nurses and encourage nurses to stay, train and work within the local area.  The University of Wollongong currently operates over two floors in the Moore Street facility in Liverpool, providing access to employment opportunities, public transport and the city's surrounding facilities. The South Western Sydney campus is, however, scheduled to relocate to a purpose-built building by 2020, where it is expected to cater for over 7,000 students by the 2030. This means that current and prospective students will have the opportunity to access university education without having to leave their local support networks and without the burden of lengthy travel. The South Western Sydney campus is a great achievement in itself, and a facility that was certainly well and truly needed in order to meet the higher educational needs of the booming Liverpool region. Liverpool is currently at the centre of a large-scale investment in infrastructure, both public and private, investment which will see growth in population as well as economic growth. With more than 1½ million residents estimated to be living in greater south-west Sydney by 2031, the University of Wollongong will play a significant role in the rapid expansion of the Greater Western Sydney area in itself. It will no doubt drive the Liverpool economy and empower graduates to achieve the highest employment outcomes and to meet the demands of the region. This will be even more important, given the development of the Badgerys Creek airport, a project that is set to continue the boom in Western Sydney and generate local jobs and opportunities in the area. To put this in some perspective, the Committee for Liverpool has estimated that the Badgerys Creek airport will eventually support more than 15½ thousand jobs and be responsible for contributing more than $11½ billion to the region. The University of Wollongong is also committed to strengthening the health research and education facilities within Greater Western Sydney, working to foster partnerships with: a number of medical institutions, including, particularly, Liverpool Hospital; a multinational manufacturing company, Daikin; as well as the pride of Liverpool at the moment, the Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research. These will work to produce many highly qualified graduates who will, in turn, make enormous contributions to our community. I would like the opportunity to once again congratulate the University of Wollongong, in particular its vice-chancellor, Professor Paul Wellings, for setting the precedent of access to higher education in the City of Wollongong. I have no doubt that Wollongong university will have a lasting influence helping to generate jobs, foster innovation and build the skills necessary to meet the demands of the city now and also of the nation into the future. Mallee Electorate Events Sport",125
185,Mr BROAD,ADJOURNMENT," Last night, I had a cultural experience. As a Victorian who knows nothing about rugby league, I got to sit there and learn a little bit. Dr Leigh: Rugby football!",126
186,Mr BROAD,ADJOURNMENT,"Rugby football! I was told by my senior policy advisor-as a Queenslander-that I should back the Maroons, which I did. It just goes to show that you should not always listen to those who are advising you. You should trust your own judgement. In the spirit of sport and what is great about the electorate of Mallee, we actually have an NRL league and an NRL game this coming Saturday in Mildura, believe it or not. NRL is  crossing the border. What is important about it is that it is a State of Mind event. The NRL is using sport to address people's mental health-to say to blokes, particularly, that if you have a problem you can talk to other blokes. We have a headspace for youth mental health going to be represented there. The Men's Behaviour Change will be there. The Mallee District Aboriginal Services will be there. The Mallee District Domestic Violence Services will be there. Men's Sheds, the Mildura Base Hospital, the community health facility and the Sunraysia multicultural ethnic community will be there. So it is sport doing some good things. But that is not all. There are other exciting things happening in the electorate of Mallee. Down at Nhill is the Military Vehicle Rendezvous. Nhill was a staging ground for the bombing training for Second World War aviation. They are restoring an Avro Anson aircraft there. They are also fundraising to buy a Wirraway fighter plane. It is just a classic example of how there is always stuff going on in the electorate of Mallee. On the following weekend, before I come back here, I get to open the redevelopment of the Mildura Recreation Reserve, which is for AFL football. Now, there is a code that we can all believe in! Of course, AFL football, as we know, requires skill, which is in contrast to the game we saw last night. Ping-pong! You have to be able to run, kick, dodge, handpass and catch in AFL, as opposed to just run into other blokes like in an NRL game. I will be opening the Mildura Recreation Reserve, with the redevelopment at a total cost of $1.44 million. A bit over $800,000 of that came from the Nationals' Building Better Regions Fund. What is also special about this is we have upgraded not only the footy ground but also the change rooms for the girls for their netball and the netball courts. If there is one thing that is important, it is we have to get more people more active more often. That is what we are really focused ongetting our young people involved in sport. But it goes on, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton. I know you had the privilege of coming to Mildura recently. I get to open on Saturday 10 June the Mildura Rowing Club. This is where we are getting more people more active more often-rowing. This rowing club is part of the $18 million Mildura waterfront development. Those who have the opportunity to come to Mildura now can eat the fine food in the restaurant and then walk down to the river. There are exercise and walking facilities on that riverfront. There is also a rowing club with brand-new facilities. So people will be able to do their rowing on the Murray River. Not only is rowing important; something else is very important in the electorate of Mallee. And that is coffee. Mildura was the first city outside of Melbourne to have its own barista. People do not realise that. We have a strong Italian community. Part of the Mildura Rowing Club is a brand-new restaurant that will be serving coffee down by the river. So I just want to re-cap for you: it is all happening in my patch. We have NRL, which is a game, as I say, that requires very little skill, but it is there. We have aviation heritage and military vehicle rendezvous. We have AFL grounds being upgraded and opened. We have netball clubs and rowing clubs. Finally, we have coffee. So isn't it a fantastic place to be. The weather will be great.",126
187,Mr Zimmerman,ADJOURNMENT,And they've got you!,127
188,Mr BROAD,ADJOURNMENT,"And we've got me! I can only concur with that. Sometimes wise words come out of the Liberal Party! So if you have nothing to do on the long weekend coming up in June, come up to the electorate of Mallee and enjoy all the wonderful sporting facilities, the  weather and, of course, the coffee. We will welcome you. You will have a wonderful time, I can guarantee it. Richmond Electorate: Coastal Development Mrs ELLIOT (Richmond) (16:40): I rise today to speak about an important issue in my electorate, particularly for those who live in our coastal villages. I wish to mention the alarming fact raised recently by Tweed Councillor Ron Cooper and also the New South Wales shadow minister for the North Coast, Walt Secord, that the Liberal-National Party, at both a local and state level, are plotting to build high-rise buildings in our beautiful coastal villages-in particular, Kingscliff. Many locals are rightly concerned that their very way of life is under threat from these plans; and, recently, extensive debate has swirled around the issue of high-rise in Kingscliff. However, this kind of plotting and scheming is nothing new on the Tweed Coast. This is a fight that our community has had for many years-indeed, many decades-from the days of fighting to 'keep Fingal special', right through to the Daly inquiry in 2005, which resulted in Tweed Shire Council being dismissed. That inquiry found that conservative aligned councillors were elected as puppets of a developer controlled group known as Tweed Directions and that Tweed Directions constructed a campaign funded by money primarily sourced from developers intent on securing a pro-development majority in council. The fact is that our community stands ever vigilant and continues to campaign for appropriate development in our coastal areas. Tweed Councillor Ron Cooper is a local who has been fighting against inappropriate development and fighting for the protection of our lifestyle for decades. Recently, Ron saw a problem when drafts of the new Kingscliff Locality Plan came out and one of the options was to go beyond the three-storey height limit. Ron responded by firstly launching a petition supporting the three-storey limit-a petition that has gained 40,000 signatures. This reflects the community's strong commitment to limiting building heights. On this very platform, Ron ran for Tweed Council in October last year and was elected primarily on a no high-rise agenda. During this campaign, we saw the collective forces of the National Party and their fake independent Nationals candidates, all of whom were in cahoots with the Liberal Party candidate too. They all aligned to attack candidate Ron Cooper over the issue of no high-rise in Kingscliff. Well, despite their attempts to silence Ron, he was duly elected on the back of massive support from the Kingscliff community. Once in council, Ron Cooper then moved to ensure the Kingscliff Locality Plan maintained the community's wish of three storeys. Of course, true to form, the Liberals and Nationals attacked again. Lo and behold, Liberal councillor James Owen initially lodged a rescission motion in an attempt to have this overturned. This was subsequently withdrawn, but these actions by Councillor Owen will not be forgotten. But Ron Cooper is not alone. Labor supports him all the way. I support him; state Labor supports him; and councillor Reece Byrnes, our Labor voice on the Tweed Shire Council, supports him. Most importantly, the 14,000 people who signed Ron's petition support him. Ron also has the support of his council colleagues Mayor Katie Milne and Deputy Mayor Chris Cherry, and I commend them for that. But the people I do not thank and do not commend are the other three councillors, who have made a clear choice to push high-rise buildings against the wishes of our community;  and they have done this with the full support of the state Nationals MP Jeff Provest. So when council recently voted to support Ron Cooper and protect the community's wish to remain at a three-storey height limit, we saw again, as we did before the election, a direct and concerted campaign against him by the Liberals and Nationals-a campaign, it seems, that is being spearheaded by Liberal councillor James Owen. In fact, in a radio interview with ABC Lismore on 20 April this year, he said: 'Five storeys is not high-rise. Five storeys is just allowing a bit of extra height in certain parts of town.' Well, we know that five storeys is highrise-and it is just the thin end of the wedge. We know that the Liberals and Nationals want to go further than five storeys: they want 10, they want 15; they want to have high-rise throughout Kingscliff; they want to overdevelop Kingscliff. But this comes as no surprise to those of us who know you simply cannot trust the Liberals or Nationals at any level of government. Just last week, in the New South Wales parliament, we saw the Liberals and Nationals vote against Labor's bill to ban property developers and real estate agents from standing in local elections-showing their true colours yet again. I put the New South Wales State government on notice today: if you intervene and overturn the decision of the council mandating the three-storey height limit and overturn the wishes of locals in Kingscliff and allow high-rise in Kingscliff, we will campaign against you every day on every street corner. When it comes to protecting our coastal villages, make no mistake: it is only Labor which will protect them, because we will always stand with our coastal communities. So if the Liberals and Nationals want to have a fight over high-rise in Kingscliff, bring it on-bring it on! Every day we will fight them over that. Capricornia: Infrastructure",127
189,Ms LANDRY,ADJOURNMENT," We all know that in regional and remote Australia a good road network is vital for the safety of travellers and the efficiency of local industry to get goods and resources to market. A good road is something that our city friends and foes often take for granted. The coalition is literally bridging and paving the gap. Following lobbying by the National Party, the federal government has a $6.7 billion long term plan to 'spruce the Bruce', the biggest project agenda in Australia's history. Locally, more than $240 million in improvements have already been delivered to fix the Bruce in the Rockhampton-Livingston areas in the last three years, with more funding on the way. The Bruce Highway is an important freight and transport corridor up the entire Queensland coast-effectively, a lifeline between Brisbane and the rest of the state, especially for places like Rockhampton, Marlborough and Sarina. With huge freight trucks, livestock carriers the issue of road safety is an important one. In Capricornia, on the southern side of Rockhampton, the Australian government has invested more than $210 million at Yeppen. The floodplain upgrade project passed its first test with flying colours, keeping the city's southern connection to the Bruce Highway open to all traffic during the recent major flood event. We delivered the Yeppen floodplain upgrade, and it has paid huge dividends for the region. For the first time in Rockhampton's recent history, the city has not been cut off by major flooding on the Fitzroy River. The vast majority of businesses remained open, keeping millions of dollars flowing into the region and keeping jobs in place.  Thanks to the coalition government and the work of the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, this is just the beginning. The Australian government is fully funding over $200 million for black spots and overtaking lanes between Curra and Sarina, and over $117 million for black spots and overtaking lanes between Sarina and Cairns. The $166 million Peak Downs Highway safety works are being fully funded by the Australian government. We are contributing 80 per cent of the plans and corridor preservation for the Rockhampton ring road. We are providing $30 million for Rockhampton road train access-again, an 80 per cent contribution. The Australian government has committed $60 million towards duplicating the road between Rockhampton and Gracemere, and our money is sitting there waiting to go. The Queensland government told us that they did not intend to start this project until next year. The Australian government is waiting for the project proposal report from the Queensland government to start upgrades to the Rockhampton northern access. The Queensland government has told us that they expect to commence the project in mid 2018. We are ready and waiting to support a number of other projects that the Queensland Labor government cannot keep up with: the Peak Downs Highway road widening, Clermont to Nebo, in early 2019; the Capricorn Highway upgrade, Rockhampton to Duaringa, in early 2018; and the Bowen Developmental Road sealing, Collinsville to Belyando Crossing, in early 2019. There are three packages of work, sealing roads from Clermont to Alpha from early 2018 to 2019 and the Rockhampton road train access stage 2 in early 2018. With the Capricorn Highway overtaking lanes, Rockhampton to Emerald, the coalition government is waiting for the Queensland government to provide a proposed project report. Queensland will have 10 projects funded under the Northern Australia Roads Program, and will receive around $223 million from the coalition government. We delivered a bumper deal for a critical road project, with up to $120 million now on the table to build the Walkerston Bypass. We locked in a $75 million commitment to the project last year and recently secured more as part of a wider road funding package for Queensland. These projects were not empty election promises. We are delivering beyond our election commitments because we know how important this infrastructure is for the safety and well-being of the people of Capricornia. Hinder, Mr Jayson",129
190,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," At the end of April, Canberra lost one of its great community activists, and someone who was briefly a parliamentarian in the ACT Legislative Assembly, Jayson Hinder. Jayson was a true son of Canberra. His family were the second to live in the Woden Valley, the first being Doug Anthony and his family. He had a tough childhood. When his father died in the 1970s, the family lost their home. But, as he grew up, he came to be a man who gave a great deal back to the community. At his funeral service, many of his mates recalled his willingness to help out with fixing things. He was always there offering a hand and he loved his machines. He loved his cars and he loved his bikes. He loved fixing his own and he loved fixing the cars and bikes of friends. One friend of Jayson's described him as 'Toad of Toad Hall' for his love of feeling the wind in his hair. When he was profiled by Fairfax in 2015, Jayson owned a Ducati Monster, two BMWs, a 1973 Honda and a Renault Alpine.  He played vets rugby, including in the Argentinian tour. I have to say, being a middle-aged rugby player is a considerably tougher enterprise than being a middle-aged runner. He was acknowledged in the recent bulletin of the Australian Parliament Sports Club, which stated: He played a significant role in assisting the team to become Parliamentary Rugby World Cup winners in 2015 with an outstanding performance against a Rest of the World XV comprising Argentinian, NZ and South African parliamentarians and will be sadly missed by the club and his teammates. The member for Moreton, Graham Perrett, who toured New Zealand with Jayson, remembered him as a hard-hitting, hard-tackling, free-running forward. He said: 'Jayson was fearless and hard working. As a fellow forward, you knew he was an honest player who always had your back. It was an honour to pack down with him.' I know the member for Wright feels much the same. Jayson was generous to me and my parliamentary campaigns in the ACT, and I tried to return the favour in his campaigns. He entered the Assembly in early 2016, only to be unsuccessful, despite a valiant re-election effort at the end of 2016. I was looking through and saw the last photograph that I have with him, in which my three boys met up with him at Gungahlin Marketplace. The photo tells the story. There are no voters around. We are just sitting there having great fun, with Jayson entertaining my three boys, who all have great beaming smiles on their faces. That is how I will always remember Jayson-as somebody who took social justice seriously, who, through his role in Bendigo Bank, wanted to help people, but who recognised that life is there to be lived. Andrew Barr, Chief Minister of the ACT, spoke about him as a man who had 'wheels on the road and wind in his hair'. Last month the 200 motorbike riders doing their annual blanket run for the 36th time observed a minute's silence in honour of Jayson Hinder, with Vice President Mike Kelly saying he was always a big supporter. He was valued in the legal community as well, with President of the ACT Law Society, Sarah Avery, referring to Jayson as a 'valued member of the community and the legal profession'. To die at 51 is to die too young, and I acknowledge Jayson's wife, Lisa, and their three children. The loss that they feel now must be unimaginable. We are, as a community-a Labor community, a Canberra community, a sporting community, a community who wants to see our city be an even stronger, more civically engaged city-left poorer with Jayson's passing. He reminded us of the purpose of life: to smile, to help others, to recognise that your time on the planet is short and that, if you use it for yourself, you miss out on the opportunity to do great things. Jayson did great things while he was here for Canberra and for so many of us. He will be sorely missed. Schools",130
191,Mr ZIMMERMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I am proud to represent in this parliament some 40 government and non-government schools. Since my election 18 months ago I have had the opportunity to see almost all of those schools and I have been impressed by the extraordinary role they play in the education of their students. I particularly acknowledge the role of our local principals and teachers. As the son of a primary school teacher and headmaster, I know the care and passion those in the teaching profession bring to their calling.  Those schools represent the full gamut of our educational sector. North Sydney is home to 22 government, 11 independent and seven systemic Catholic schools. All of those schools have my strong support. I firmly believe in parental choice and, with our mix of government and non-government schools, local families have the opportunity to choose an education that best meets their aspirations and the needs of their children. That is why I have welcomed the federal budget delivered by the Turnbull government three weeks ago and its commitment to ensuring every student in every school receives Commonwealth support on a model that ensures fairness and transparency. These are important reforms and, backed by an additional $18.6 billion in funding over 10 years, provide the opportunity to ensure the needs based model envisaged by David Gonski in his important 2011 report. For the vast majority of schools in my electorate, our reforms will see increased funding delivered. For public schools, funding will grow by almost 60 per cent over the next 10 years, and for Catholic systemic schools funding will increase by some 43 per cent over the same period. I do want to acknowledge that some of my local schools will see a decline in funding as we move to the needs based model. Three-St Aloysius, Monte Sant' Angelo and Loreto Kirribilli-will see the most significant reductions. I want to thank the principals of those schools for the responsible way in which they are planning for the new funding arrangements. The principal of Monte Sant' Angelo, Nicole Christensen, wrote to her parents, saying: As the schools funding model was due to expire in 2017, this announcement has not come as a surprise and is something the College Board and I have been strategically preparing for. She went on to write: In the Mercy tradition of justice and human dignity, I believe that every student is deserving of a quality education and that these reforms are necessary to provide a fair, just and transparent system. The principal of St Ignatius College, or Riverview, Dr Paul Hine, wrote in similar terms to his parents: While a loss of revenue for any organisation can be disappointing, the College believes that the needsbased adjustment is fair and equitable, as it will enable those schools with a very limited resource base to have a greater financial capacity and an expanded resources base into the future. I also know that some parents at Catholic systemic schools in my electorate have been advised fees could rise as a result of the new model. I want to reiterate that funding allocated to the Catholic Education Commission in New South Wales, based on the profile of those schools, will increase by 43 per cent in my electorate over the coming 10 years. Over the next four years funding will grow by 3.8 per cent per annum for all Catholic schools in New South Wales. Nationally, an additional $1.2 billion will be provided to Catholic schools over the next four years. Funding for systemic schools will continue to be provided as block grants and the government has made very clear that Catholic education authorities will remain able to allocate those funds as they believe is best for their school systems. So, in circumstances where funding is increasing for schools, including Catholic schools in New South Wales, there should be no need for fees to increase. Put simply, if funding is going up why do fees need to follow? I am confident our Gonski 2.0 model will see a stronger education system better able to equip young Australians, including those living in my electorate, with the education they need. In the face of these reforms it has been instructive to watch the approach of those who sit opposite representing the Australian Labor Party. It has just been extraordinary to watch the  Labor Party-which has for so long proclaimed a commitment to needs based funding based on Gonski-argue against reforms which deliver just that outcome. Perhaps it is because they are embarrassed about their own actions in government. Labor's system manifestly did not fulfil the ideals of Gonski to provide a national needs based system. Instead, we inherited a patchwork of arrangements that not only treated students differently but actually penalised state and territory governments that increased their own funding. We have also seen since the budget an attempt by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Sydney to mislead and, frankly, scare parents. That scare campaign claims funding is being cut-when quite clearly the reverse is true, to the tune of $18.6 billion. The lengths to which the Opposition will resort was on display earlier this week when the member for Sydney claimed more schools in the Catholic sector were being disadvantaged than actually exist. These are important reforms for the future of our education system and I would urge those opposite to live up to the commitment they have long mouthed for a truly national, transparent system based on needs-which is exactly what we are going to deliver. House adjourned at 17:00  Thursday, 1 June 2017",131
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Ms Bird) took the chair at 10:00. NA Roads,134
193,Ms OWENS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," My two state Labor colleagues Jodi MCKay and Julia Finn presented a petition to the New South Wales parliament with over 10,000 signatures. People signed up in large numbers in opposition to the reintroduction of the toll on the M4. We used to have a toll on the M4 when it was first built. It was abolished by the Labor government in 2010 because the freeway had already been paid for. Now, with the excuse of widening the freeway by one extra lane, the Berejiklian government is putting it back on-a $4.56 toll each way from Church Street to Homebush Bay Drive. It is not just until the expansion is covered but for the next 43 years and rising every quarter. And that is just the beginning, because a few years later, when the next section of WestConnex is completed-the M4 East, which is a tunnel from Homebush Bay Drive linking to the City West Link-it will be an additional $3.95 each way. We are talking about a person leaving Parramatta and paying $8.51 per trip into the city. That is $17.02 a day, $85.10 a week and $4,425 a year to travel to the city. You can of course get off the M4. You can go on Parramatta Road. Since the tolls were removed, Parramatta Road has been quite light in traffic. But those of us who live in that region know that the M4 is actually a local road. It is the road you use to get from Church Street to Silverwater and from Parramatta to Auburn, for example. But with these new tolls, even in the first phase of them, if you drive your kids to sport at Homebush, if you drive your kids to a soccer match at Homebush, it will cost you $9.12 for the two trips-$9.12 each way. If you get off the M4 and you go on Parramatta Road, we all know that the local trucks that drive around-the couriers, the local deliveries for that really large industrial area that sits alongside the M4are all going to be on Parramatta Road. They are not going to be paying the tolls to go on the freeway. We will not see local businesses paying the tolls-and, if they do, we are all going to pay for it every time they enter the freeway. What we are going to see again, as we saw when we had a toll last time, is incredible traffic flow on the small roads that go through our suburbs. It is going to be a case of spending the extra half an hour or 40 minutes to get your child to and from a sporting event or paying $9.12. These are local roads. The Berejiklian government deserves what is coming over this. Nobody pays $4,425 a year to drive to work. (Time expired) Egypt: Coptic Christians",134
194,Mr HAWKE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"Mitchell-Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (10:03): I want to record the Turnbull government's and all members' strong support for Coptic Christians who are in Australia and reflect on some of the incidents we have seen overseas, in Egypt, that have led to the government announcing yesterday that we will of course support Coptic Christians here and ensure that they have visas to remain while a state of emergency exists in Egypt. We have seen that IS have made increasing attacks on Coptic worshippers at the Monastery of St Samuel the Confessor, killing 28 and injuring 22. We  know that just recently, just on the last weekend, we had another brutal attack on a convoy of buses of Christian worshippers moving between churches. Since February 2017, the so-called Islamic State have called on their followers to attack Christians. The Coptic Christians in Egypt represent the last significant concentration of Christians in the Middle East, a very sad development, considering the world's history. The last significant Christian population is now subject to attack from Islamic State. The Australian government stands shoulder to shoulder with the el-Sisi regime in protecting Coptic Christians, in the declared state of emergency and in the security that they have been providing at churches. And we stand, of course, with those Copts here in Australia who have come here on holidays or to study or who have sought protection from Australia and have genuine claims. We will be carefully assessing and reviewing all of those claims. I announced yesterday that the government will re-examine any of those claims in the light of recent developments in Egypt and updated country information that has come through from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, taking into account that Islamic State is now particularly targeting those Coptic Christians in Egypt. I want to acknowledge the Australian community here and the churches that have lobbied assiduously for us to ensure that anyone here in Australia at the moment is carefully assessed and looked after. I want to acknowledge the Prime Minister's remarks. In reflecting on some of this, he said that this attack against innocent civilians, including children, is a horrific act of cowardice designed to terrorise and divide. He said: Australia stands united with the Coptic Christians in shared resolve to eradicate the scourge of terrorism … Egypt has been in a state of emergency since this began, and it will be another three months, according to the government, while that state of emergency exists. We are, as you know, working shoulder to shoulder with our partners, like the United States, to fight and prosecute the war on terror internationally. We are working domestically to protect Coptic Christians here in Australia and to make sure they are not sent into harm's way, and we will continue to carefully monitor the situation in Egypt and ensure that we take the appropriate measures from the Australian perspective to support this important community and minority in Egypt. Egypt: Coptic Christians Asylum Seekers",134
195,Mr ZAPPIA,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Earlier this month, I presented a Barnabas Aid petition drawing attention to the genocide of Christians and other minorities. On 22 May, there was the senseless killing of 22 people at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. I understand that about 116 people were also injured, and many of those are still in a critical condition. It seems that they were targeted because they were Westerners. Christianity and Western culture are often seen as one and the same by extremists. Last Friday, another 28 Coptic Christians were mercilessly killed in Egypt whilst travelling to a monastery. I understand that an equal number were wounded. Amongst the victims were also women and children. They were killed because they were Christians. It brings to over 100 the number of Coptic Christians who have been killed in Egypt since Christmas. Their deaths were not given the same level of media coverage in Australia as the Manchester killings, but those Coptic  Christians were also innocent victims of extremists, and they have families who will equally grieve for them. Being a Christian in many non-Christian countries raises the level of risk to a person's safety. As I have previously noted, 80 per cent of all acts of religious persecution in the world today are against Christians. Being a Christian in the Middle East, particularly where IS has a presence, becomes an even greater risk. I acknowledge that Christians are not the only target, but Christians have become a frequent and easy target for extremists. The facts speak for themselves. Today I join my Labor colleagues and the many community voices in calling for the government to allow people who are here as refugees or on temporary visas and who are at grave risk if they return to their homeland to be granted refuge in Australia. I understand that there are presently over 20 Coptic families-that is, about 80 people-that are facing deportation to Egypt after having had their applications rejected. I urge the minister to reconsider those cases. I also welcome the comments made just a few moments ago by the assistant minister in respect of those cases. In saying that, I acknowledge the work that has been put in by Labor's shadow minister for immigration and other Labor speakers in supporting those applications and those people being allowed to remain in Australia. I suspect it is because of the heightened publicity that was provided in respect of those families that the government has agreed to reconsider them. I also, in the same breath, urge the minister to take into account the very real ongoing risks to the lives of Christian refugees when considering other applications under Australia's refugee intake program. Page Electorate: Lawrence Hall Page Electorate: Evans Head-Casino Surf Life Saving Club",135
196,Mr HOGAN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," This year, the Lawrence Hall is turning 125, and there are big plans afoot for this weekend. The hall has a wonderful history of which the executivepresident Peter Kelsall, vice-president Peter Wright, treasurer Ellen Maloney and secretary Lorna Reeves-are very proud. I would also like to thank the trustees and the organising committee for this weekend's celebrations-Robert Reeves, Roz Jones, Nev and Patricia Taber, Kevin and Joyce Gordon, Daniel Spears, Roger and Dulcie Reeves and especially Jennifer Sumskis-for their tireless commitment to the event. The hall is a central point of any community. We have dances in our local hall. We have wedding celebrations in our local halls. We have christenings and indeed wakes. They literally witness all the major events in a community and people's lives, and, as people say, if walls could talk, what a story the walls of not just the Lawrence Hall but many halls could tell. They host many other events as well at the Lawrence Hall. They host fundraisers and events for kids. Most recently they have hosted Australia's Biggest Morning Tea, a movie night, lamington drives, Melbourne Cup events and stage plays. This weekend 3 June is going to be a big day. There is a vintage car display, a mobile library and a history presentation of the hall and the local area. The local RFS will also be cooking a barbecue for the community. There will of course be a birthday cake. Festivities start at the hall at 11 am on Saturday, and I cannot wait to join in the celebrations. I had the pleasure last weekend of attending the award celebration of the Evans Head Surf Life Saving Club. They are a small club but very committed. I would like to congratulate the  award winners: the Club Person of the Year, Paul Ellem; the Junior Club Person of the Year, Oliver Mason; the Rookie of the Year, Blair Haynes; the Charlie Sutton Perpetual Trophy went to Patrol 6, which was Paul Ellem, Jack Ellem, Timothy Solmon and Kyle Lindwal; and the Competitor of the Year, Michael Russell. In the Youth Involvement Program Awards, the Bronze Awards went to Jacob Yourell and Caleb Yourell, the Silver Award went to Aidan Yourell and the Gold Award went to Rachael Redman. Rachael emceed the events last Sunday very well as well. In the fun awards, the Duck Rollover went to Paul Ellem and Michael Haynes, and the Wombat Award-they know what it was for-went to Patrol 6. This club has also had many challenges. We have obviously had many shark sightings. Indeed I was there one day this year when there was a shark sighting. The surf lifesaving club called everyone off the beach and had many extra duties because of the extra pressures. I would also like to thank the executive-Ben Redman, David Sly, Jodie Irwin, Avan Christie, Michael Pontesract, Tom Ellis, Teena Redman, Rebecca Yourell, David Scott, Joe Sly, Donna Watts and Christine Warren-for all the work they do. Egypt: Coptic Christians",136
197,Mr KHALIL,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise to welcome last night's announcement by the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection that the government will be reviewing all previously rejected protection visa applications made by Coptic Christians. I welcome the government's reversal of their decision to forcibly send a cohort of 20 families back to Egypt and also welcome their acknowledgement of the escalating threat over the past 12 months faced by the Copts in Egypt, who have been under siege from Islamic State and their affiliates. I also want to thank the many Liberal MPs on the other side whom I have lobbied and harassed over the past seven months to make representations to the minister on this point, particularly the members for Menzies and Deakin. I especially want to thank our shadow immigration minister, Shayne Neumann, whose representations to the minister were of great importance and help to the government in reversing this decision. Of course, I received great support from the shadow foreign minister, Senator Penny Wong, and the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten. We all know that a small but good thing has actually happened for these people. Their lives have changed. Islamic State is an evil cult. Since it emerged seven years ago, it has wrought destruction and death across the Middle East and Africa. They have killed thousands of Sunni Muslims who would not fight for them, Shiite Muslims and Kurds. Minorities such as the Yazidis and the Assyrian and Chaldean Christians in Iraq and Syria have felt the full force of Islamic State's bloodlust and lust for death, and of course in the past 12 months in Egypt the Coptic Christians have become their primary target. Over 100 Copts have been massacred in their places of worship during Christmas and Easter services, and just recently on 26 May we know that 28 people were relentlessly gunned down on a bus on its way to the Monastery of Saint Samuel. Some of the survivors have told their story. When the gunmen came onto the bus, they tried to force these people to convert. They asked them to recite the shahada and to deny their faith. The men said no, that they are not going to deny their faith, and they were gunned down mercilessly. The women said no, that they would not deny their faith, and they were gunned down mercilessly. And the children said no. Some of them, Sunday school kids, started to recite the Lord's Prayer and were gunned down mercilessly. These IS gunmen,  down the barrel of a gun, tried to force these people, at risk of death, to deny their own faith, but they refused. For us in the West this kind of courage is inexplicable, but it is not unusual for the Copts because their whole church has been built on this article of faith. In fact, the Coptic calendar started on the day of the death of the first martyr and the whole church has been built on martyrdom and this very deep and strong faith. This is something that IS gunmen and Islamic State will never understand, because of their thirst for blood and their thirst for death. They will never understand the true courage of what real faith is about, because true faith comes from the heart and the spirit, not down the barrel of a gun. Egypt: Coptic Christians Regional Jobs and Investment Package",137
198,Mr CHRISTENSEN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I want to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Wills and congratulate him on the excellent work he has done. Certainly the Coptic Christian community in Egypt has been under siege. We saw the Palm Sunday bombings, bombings last year and many other atrocities. These people are in great needMr Hawke interjecting",138
199,Mr CHRISTENSEN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS,"Yes, I acknowledge the member for Mitchell as well on that. But what I really want to talk about this morning is the announcement of the rollout of the Bowen Basin communities Regional Jobs and Investment Package, something I have fought long and hard for this government to deliver for communities throughout the Bowen Basin, including the Mackay regional area, the Whitsunday regional area and Bowen. It has gone down to the coalfields, the hinterland of Mackay, Rockhampton and Gladstone. There has been $30 million allotted by the federal government to go to businesses and organisations that successfully apply for that funding. It is going to be used to transition their businesses into new markets and new processes. Perhaps they are going to buy new capital equipment that will allow them to do new things. This is an extremely practical way that local businesses can diversify. We talk about diversifying economies a lot in my part of the world. A lot of paperwork, study and research has gone into it, but we do not see too much on the ground. This is practical stuff. It gets government out of the way, apart from just handing over some incentivisation funding. What happens then is that businesses can decide where they want to put that money. They have to match it as well, so this $30 million will be an injection of $60 million into local economies throughout that part of the world, my part of the world. We are ultimately going to see out of that the creation of new jobs and the sustainability of existing jobs. We have had over the previous three to four years an economic downturn in the coal mining sector and we know how important it is for our region to diversify. I am very pleased that the local advisory group that has been looking at this has worked on different areas-tourism, health, education and the resources sector-and looked at what can happen in diversifying there. All of those areas will be looked at for funding. I encourage local businesses that think they can do something new and create new jobs to apply for these funds that are now available.  Cybersecurity",138
200,Ms BRODTMANN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Last night I was with the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute launch of the report assessing the government's progress against the goals set out in the Cyber Security Strategy released just over 12 months ago. The event provided a valuable opportunity to respond to the report-and I commend Zoe Hawkins and Liam Nevill on an excellent contribution-and to discuss issues that Labor has been pursuing on our nation's cybersecurity. Like national security, cybersecurity is largely a bipartisan issue, but that does not mean that Labor will not hold the government to account to ensure Australians continue to enjoy as safe and secure a cybersecurity environment as possible. There were a number of areas I discussed last night: crisis communication, small business cybersecurity, the need for appropriate and measurable KPIs, and the cybersecurity of government agencies. The report by ASPI is spot on when it comes to the assessment of the cybersecurity of government agencies. We still have a long way to go before our government agencies become the exemplar for private and public sector organisations in Australia. In its most recent cyber-resilience follow-up review, the Australian National Audit Office found that two out of the three government agencies audited had insufficient protections against cyberattacks from external sources. Two of the three had not effectively implemented application whitelists, which meant that users could install and run applications and bypass the whitelist completely. Only one of the three agencies audited complied with the governments mandated mitigation strategy and was found to be cyber-resilient. This was despite the fact that all three assured the Joint Committee of Public accounts and Audit that they would achieve compliance during 2016 after the first damning audit in 2014. A great deal more work needs to be done in this space and urgently. The public has a right to know that government agencies holding their personal information are secure. We need greater and regular transparency of performance so the cyber-resilience or nonresilience of our government agencies is not exposed through the occasional audit. Consideration should be given to how we achieve this. Should we have greater transparency through monthly reports to the minister on performance, in annual reports or in a quarterly report to the parliament by the minister? We should also consider what happens if government agencies do not implement their cyber-resilience strategies in accordance with the government mandated guidelines, like the outcome of the ANAO audit. These are all interesting questions that I will be considering at the JCPAA's public hearing into cyber-resilience of government agencies tomorrow. BlazeAid",139
201,Mr BUCHHOLZ,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise today to acknowledge a small army of volunteers who have appeared in my electorate, an organisation known around Australia as BlazeAid. They have marched into my electorate to help local farmers fix fences in the aftermath of the recent floods in March. BlazeAid's reputation precedes them. Originally set up after the fires in Victoria in 2009, the organisation has extended its reach to help many communities across Australia in disaster areas. In my electorate there are farmers who have been affected not only by this flood; this is the third one-in-150-years flood that they have faced back to back. Whilst we can keep  rebuilding, just the presence of BlazeAid in the community helps enormously with the mental anguish. They recognise the hurdle in front of people as they rebuild given they had just got their lives back for a second time when they were knocked over again for a third time. After sustaining devastating damage, the local farming community reached out to BlazeAid for their assistance. BlazeAid responded by setting up camp originally in the Beaudesert Showgrounds, which was the central community. Then the Beaudesert Show Society looked to prepare the Beaudesert Showgrounds for our annual show. That is a very important day on the community landscape for the community to heal because it is a time where they can come together. There is a sale . It is one of the highlights in Beaudesert, our country show. So we have set BlazeAid up at the Rathdowney and District Memorial Grounds, with people travelling from around Scenic Rim and also from out of the area to come and help in our community. Peter and Morgan have travelled from Victoria, Ross and Ann have come from South Australia, Ian has come from Darwin and John has come from Tasmania. I say thank you to BlazeAid for the work that those people are doing in my community. These people help out the people in my community who are looking for a hand. The floods did not discriminate between rich and poor, and neither do the BlazeAid volunteers. They will go wherever they are needed to get stuck into lend a hand, whether it is putting fences back up, removing debris or just doing some of those laborious tasks that allow the farmer to get on with the more annualised production tasks for the farm to generate income for next year. The 'orange angels', named for their penchant for hi-vis, are helping to rebuild our communities. BlazeAid has played an enormous role in our community. Each of the volunteers who make a contribution to that deserve all of our accolades. Adani Carmichael Coalmine",139
202,Ms CLAYDON,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I would like to start with huge congratulations to the New South Wales Blues on a magnificent victory in the State of Origin last night. The State of Origin is, of course, one of Australian sport's greatest rivalries. New South Wales and Queensland have been pitted against each other since the 1980s and for us in New South Wales it is often a long time between celebrations, but last night was hopefully a very good omen. The point of raising the State of Origin this morning is really to highlight the fact that at least that is a contest that takes place on a level playing field. Notwithstanding moments of individual talent and sporting brilliance, those teams play to the same rules. They stand a fair and equal chance of succeeding. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the Turnbull government's modus operandi. The government seem determined to invest $1 billion of precious taxpayer's money into the Adani Carmichael mine in Central Queensland. Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, I know that, coming from your region, you would understand just what kind of impact that will have on regional jobs in the state of New South Wales. Let's be clear, there is no greater direct and existential threat to jobs in my region, the Newcastle and Hunter region, than this proposal before the government now. Whilst I acknowledge that the people of Central Queensland and North Queensland, like people in my region, are very keen to have jobs in the area-I do not dismiss the value of those jobs in any way, shape or form-I contest the use of very precious taxpayer's dollars to subsidise an industry that creates jobs in one part of Australia at the expense of jobs in another.  This is not about new job creation; this is about a literal transfer of jobs from the region of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley into Central Queensland. That is not a plan for jobs and growth, which is what this government is putting up. This is a very cruel con. For those people who have concerns, on either an environmental or a jobs basis, about this mine going forward, there are a lot of questions before this parliament that need to be answered before the government goes spending $1 billion, which is the equivalent of $714,000 per job, because there are fewer than 1,400 jobs on offer. Banks Electorate",140
203,Mr COLEMAN,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," On 16 May I attended the Revesby Rovers football club committee meeting at Amour Park in Revesby. It is a fantastic club in my electorate with more than 300 players and a history that dates back some 60 years. There have been a number of issues, though, at Amour Park in recent times and it is important these issues are addressed. This year the start of the season was delayed due to issues with the preparation of the field, specifically the inability of the council to get the field ready for the start of the season. That was very disappointing and something that absolutely needs to be addressed. I look forward to working with the club on that and many other issues. I would like to thank Ev Tsoukalas for all her work and advocacy and also the club's president, Sean Russell. It was a great meeting and I look forward to many more in the future. The Oatley Heritage and Historical Society has a proud tradition of serving the Oatley community. Oatley is a unique and beautiful suburb located on the Georges River, and for more than 20 years the heritage and historical society has fought the good fight to preserve the history and environment of Oatley. Most recently, the society has worked to ensure the heritage value of Oatley train station is maintained. It has an active plaques program, where historical information about specific locations in Oatley is affixed to different landmarks, which provides a lot of very useful information for residents and visitors about the history of the suburb. Thank you to the president, Julian Sheen, to Bill Wright, the secretary, and to Kim Wagstaff, who is a very active in the society, for their continued advocacy. Last Sunday, 28 May, I attended the Mortdale Heights Cricket Club in Revesby to present the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards. The club is celebrating its 60th anniversary, and it is always great to visit and to talk with Matt Boland, the president, and the parents there as well. The club has kids from five years of age in their teams right up to senior players. This year, the 10A team won the premiership, which is a fantastic achievement. I would also like to acknowledge Alexia O'Sullivan, who is a very active member of the committee and this year's runner-up in the Banks Volunteer of the Year Awards, which were presented by Julie Bishop in April. Thank you again to everyone at Mortdale Heights Cricket Club for all your efforts in our community.",141
204,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," In accordance with standing order 193 the time for members' constituency statements has concluded. NA Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018 Consideration in Detail Consideration resumed.  Immigration and Border Protection Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $4,073,525,000",141
205,Mr DUTTON,BILLS," I want to start my contribution this morning by thanking all of the officers within Australian Border Force and within the Department of Immigration and Border Protection for their work over the course of the last 12 months. It is fair to say, as previous ministers could attest, that there is always an issue to deal with in this portfolio on a daily basis, and there always will be. These officers, in particular those on the frontline, serve our country well. We are proud of the work that they do, and we are certainly very grateful for it. I want to acknowledge the tragic passing of Brett Forte in Queensland, the senior constable who was tragically killed not far from the honourable member for Blair's electorate. It underscores to all of us that our Border Force officers are out working with the police across the jurisdictions on a daily basis. They are working with the Australian Federal Police in the raids they do and the interdictions that they make at sea, on land and at ports right across the country. It is dangerous work, and we should be reminded, at a time when we consider the expense within our portfolios, of the significant support that we are providing to those staff, because the work that they do results in our country being a safer place. The work of our counterterrorism unit officers at airports has been a significant investment by this government over the course of the last several years. Again, in this budget process, we are funding that on an ongoing basis. Why? It is because it is very important for them to, in particular, talk to young people who might be on their way to the Middle East and the number of interventions that have been undertaken are significant and continue to grow each year. They work in concert, of course, with our law enforcement and intelligence agencies and do that not only for outbound passengers but also for inbound passengers. The travelling public can be assured that the support that is there at the airports makes it safer for people to travel and makes our communities safer here, given the intelligence that is gathered at that point at the airport where there is contact made. So I want to pay tribute to all of those officers. In particular, I want to pay tribute to those officers who are involved in Operation Sovereign Borders, led by Air Vice Marshal Steve Osborne. There is a considerable amount of expenditure again in this budget for us to keep our borders secure. It has not happened by chance that we have been able to stop boats and stop drownings at sea. But getting the 8,000 children out of detention has been a significant outcome, and it would not have been possible without the assistance of those officers. Those officers that I have spoken to on the vessels in ports talk about their desire to make sure that our success continues. That is because, again, those frontline officers, over a long period of time, were involved in pulling bodies out of the water, dealing with the tragedy of a boat that had capsized and dealing with the reality of people smugglers taking money off innocent men, women and children who would hop onto these boats and, ultimately, in many cases, not make it to the destination of Australia. It is difficult work that our officers are doing in PNG at the Manus Regional Processing Centre in concert with the PNG authorities there. And, certainly, it is the case that it is difficult work for our offices and our contractors in Nauru as well. I pay particular tribute to them because a lot of criticism is levelled against them. Much of it is unjust because the work that all of these people collectively undertake on a daily basis is in our national interests and it allows us to be one of the most generous nations in the world in terms of the numbers of people we settle  here, in particular through the refugee and humanitarian program. If we do not have an orderly migration program it is clear from all of the evidence that the Australian public will not support decisions of government at a point in time that are in our national and international interests. The intake of the 12,000 Syrians was possible only because of the fact that we had stopped the boats and we had regularised arrivals in this country, that we had stopped those drownings at sea and that we had got those children out of detention. So I pay particular tribute to all those frontline officers and all of the officers within the budget unit, who report to Steven Groves, and ultimately to the secretary-the many people who have spent countless hours and given up weekends in the preparation of this budget. I thank all of them. On a number of occasions I had great opportunities to speak to staff at our offices around the country. They are wonderful people and I pay tribute to their work today.",142
206,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I join with the minister in saying that our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends, colleagues and comrades of Brett Forte, who tragically was gunned down. It goes to show just how important now our security forces are in this country-our police services. I also join the minister in thanking the men and women of Border Force and the immigration department for the work they do. It is often a thankless task and is difficult at times. It is challenging, it is physically demanding and they do not get the respect and gratitude they deserve. So I join with the minister in thanking them for the work they do. Minister, during the federal election campaign the coalition followed Labor's lead in announcing a new temporary parent visa. The coalition promised, and I quote from the policy document, that 'adult children would be required to pay a bond'. But the minister has since announced that adult children will need to pay a fee, not a bond, and that fee will be $10,000 for five years and $5,000 for three years. It is expected to raise $99 million for the budget coffers over the forward estimates. The minister has said in his department's 'frequently asked questions' page that the new visa seeks to address long-standing community concerns about waiting times under existing parent visa arrangements. We know that the department has confirmed that there has been no modelling and no additional resources in relation to these visas. Migrant community stakeholders also confirmed during the election campaign that the minister's office confirmed that there would be no cap on the visa, because it would be under the visitor visa stream, but the budget estimates confirm a cap of 15,000. The policy has not been fleshed out, with the department saying in Senate estimates that 'we have not specified that to that degree'. When asked about the types of health bills families may receive on top of the health insurance obligations, what is worse is that migrant communities are now in the tough position of having to choose between parents and parents-in-law, because only one set of parents is allowed to be sponsored at one time. There was no mention of that before the election. Why did the minister tell migrant communities one thing before the election and now deliver another with the new temporary sponsored parent visa? Why did the minister abandon his commitment to a bond and introduce a fee? What does the minister say in response to criticism by migrant communities that, by charging a fee rather than a bond, the government is simply raising revenue on the back of adult children who want to reunite with their mums and dads? Why is the minister making families choose between parents and parents-in-law?  Was this suggested by stakeholders or was it just an arbitrary decision made by the minister? What advice does the minister have for families who need to have a difficult conversation about which parents get reunited with their children? How should parents make the choice between parents and parents-in-law? Why didn't the minister mention any of this before the election? Minister, what does 'accepting legal liability for any outstanding public health debt their sponsored parents accrue' mean? Their parents will have already taken out health insurance. Will families be left with a huge unexpected health bill? Why is the minister announcing a new visa if his department has not worked out all the kinks? Does the minister accept that members of migrant communities may feel misled by the Turnbull government? Minister, simply, why have you broken your promise to migrant communities with respect to parent visas? Mr TED O'BRIEN (Fairfax) (10:39): US senator John MCCain was here in Canberra this week. It is his view that vast swathes of the world are in turmoil and that within our very region we are at a critical juncture due to risks including that posed by the North Korean regime, and I believe he is right. The global political economy is amidst a period of heightened volatility. Major conflicts are causing upheaval the world over, and, while there are also many economies crippled, there are millions of people who are struggling to survive. As I speak today, there are approximately 28 wars raging across the world. If you include smaller tribal conflicts in African states, that number jumps to 58 wars. In 2017 thus far, these wars have recorded 47,000 deaths. Due to such conflicts and the persecutions, violence and human rights abuses they create, 34,000 people are forced to flee their homes each day. We have an estimated 65.3 million displaced people around the world, about 21.3 million of whom are refugees and at least 10 million stateless. Australia is one of the few countries in the world that have a planned resettlement program. It proactively goes out and selects the most vulnerable of these people and resettles them here in Australia. This is something that all Australians should be proud of. Australians are an open, tolerant and generous people, but we are also a pragmatic lot. I have never heard any Australian suggest we should invite all 21 million refugees to immigrate here or invite all 65 million displaced people to take refuge. We want to do all we can, understanding that there will always be limits to the resources we commit and the number of people who can immigrate. A social compact, to which the minister has already referred, has emerged in Australia, and that reflects a correlation between how well the government manages its borders and the people's appetite for taking in new immigrants. But a social compact is more than just a numbers game. It is not as simple as saying: the stronger the borders, the more the immigrants. It is also about an expectation of integrity in the system, which includes ensuring that those who join us here in Australia have their allegiance to Australia and to its people. It is about ensuring that they are willing and able to integrate and to make a contribution to our community. As a nation, we rightly celebrate our diversity. Indeed, all of us except our Indigenous peoples, our first peoples, are relative newcomers to this nation. What unites us despite our differences, and what must continue to unite us, is a common set of values. The foundation upon which our future must continue to be built is a common set of values, values that bind all Australians. There is no greater value than that of freedom, for nothing else guarantees  happiness and fulfilment more than freedom, freedom realised through independence, self reliance and the dignity of the individual, the individual who is equal, no better and no worse than other individuals. It is these ideals in turn that promote the protection of free speech and property rights and encourage human endeavour and enterprise, the very things that have created the Australia of today: an open, liberal, free-market political economy that is the envy of much of the world. Is it any wonder that citizens of Australia love their citizenship? Let us not forget, however, that, while citizenship comes with rights, rights come with commensurate responsibilities. As citizens, it is our responsibility to embrace the very values that unite us, to integrate into our local communities and to contribute to our civic society. It is within this context, therefore, that I wish to ask the minister today: Minister, what action is the government taking to strengthen Australian citizenship, and why is it important that aspiring Australians share Australian values?",143
207,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," Minister, I will ask a series of questions in relation to the government's priorities concerning the staffing and resourcing of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection in accordance with the budget. Under the immigration minister's watch, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection is having more and more jobs cut from the ranks, and the minister is attempting to conceal those figures in the budget papers. The Senate budget estimates process reveals that the immigration department has had 509 employees cut from its workforce since 1 July 2016. The department started the financial year at 14,266 employees and now has only 13,757 employees. The 2016-17 budget stated that the Department of Immigration and Border Protection was going to lose an average staffing level of 305 jobs. The reality, however, is that the department has cut 509 individual jobs this financial year so far. The 2017-18 budget shows a further cut of 245 to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection's average staffing level number. That is hundreds of departmental staff who are no longer able to process visas or citizenship applications, to crack down on rorts in relation to the 457 visa program or other temporary protection visa programs or, indeed, to protect our borders. Given the government's track record over the past year, how many individual jobs is the government going to slash from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection? This Senate budget estimates process confirms that the loss includes some 250 departmental staff from call centres in Sydney, London and Ottawa, jobs that will be outsourced in the coming financial year. The department, under the minister's watch, has been forced to close its Dandenong office, which sees more than 20,000 people each year. This is happening while waiting times for visas to be processed have ballooned out. This Turnbull government's indexing of visa charges means that the cost of visas will continue to rise with no correlating improvement in assessment times. In addition, there is the fact that the government is planning on having a new department office building built in Canberra at a cost of $256 million. So the minister is closing a regional suburban immigration office, with an expected saving of only $212,000, at the same time as he is rewarding the brass with a shiny new $256 million headquarters, with an armoury whose cost to construct, ironically, is the same amount as the department is expected to save by closing the Dandenong office. Why is the minister allowing service staff, the people who actually process visas, to be slashed from his department? Can the minister explain why the government is considering the true number of employees being  slashed from the department in the budget papers? Why is the minister allowing staff to be cut from the department's visa and citizenship group while announcing sweeping changes in both areas? Can the minister guarantee visa processing times will not continue to increase while the department's workforce numbers are savaged? Why is the minister allowing the outsourcing of departmental jobs, rather than keeping them in house? Why is the minister allowing his department to prop up the department's workforce by using labour hire companies, including some 446 IT staff alone? What do these agreements mean for the cost of running the department? What do these agreements mean for the efficiency of the department? How can the minister justify staff being slashed from the department while commissioning a new, $256 million building? Why is the minister closing the Dandenong office and building a new armoury in Canberra for the same exact cost, $212,000, as the saving? When will the minister stand up for the department's workforce and protect their jobs?",145
208,Mr DUTTON,BILLS," I thank the members for their questions. In relation to the member for Blair's question on the parent visa, I can confirm that the government has made a significant investment and we do want to provide support to people who can sponsor under this visa category. It is a bit rich, though, coming from Labor, and we see it in the House, where some ministers get asked questions and others do not-nonetheless, it shows the hypocrisy of Labor, having thrust us into significant debt. Would we want to do more? Yes. Would we want to do more if we had money in the bank, to provide further support to people? Yes, of course we would. But did Labor rack up an enormous amount of debt? Have they blocked us from passing savings measures in the Senate? Yes. That is the reality of what we are dealing with here. I think the most important point to make in relation to the member's contribution on that particular topic around the parent visa is the complete ignorance about the long-run cost, particularly around health in relation to some of these people. If he is going to go out and make uncosted assumptions and commitments then let us test that, because there is a very significant issue to be dealt with here, and that is in relation to providing ongoing support around health, and the costs otherwise that can be borne not only in the forward estimates but also into the out years in relation to welfare as well. There is a significant cost to these visas that is completely ignored by Labor, and that is reality in terms what we are providing for in relation to what, I think, has been a very well-received policy. We will continue to work with communities in relation to each of those matters. I will deal also with the staffing issues raised by the honourable member opposite. It is the case that we found efficiencies in bringing the Border Force arrangements into place over the course of the last couple of years. Of course, we do not require the staff the Labor did, because we do not have boat arrivals. That is a very important point that seems to be lost on the member opposite. The most ironic part of that is that Labor is still tearing themselves apart in relation to this policy. They have not learnt one lesson and this is the difficulty. I will go to this call centre issue, because it is quite interesting. In Labor's day they allowed two call centres to be operated overseas. The Labor model was outsourcing those jobs offshore. The decision I have made in this budget is to bring our call centres back domestically and to have Australians fill those jobs. I am not going to take a lecture from the  Labor Party. We are filling those jobs with Australians. The call centre activity has been conducted offshore in two locations. I am stopping those two locations and we are going to run those services onshore. This is for a couple a couple of reasons: (1) because we can do it more efficiently here and (2) because we can increase the level of service if Australians, particularly elderly Australians, are having their calls answered and responded to in a more timely way by somebody domestically, who can answer their query. In relation to the more substantive point made by the honourable member for Fairfax in relation to citizenship, we have done significant things in this space. We have answered the call from Australians who have said to us: 'We want to have a more rigorous process in relation to citizenship.' We do want to help people from around the world. Since the Second World War alone we have settled over 845,000 refugees. Millions of people have taken Australian citizenship. We are proud of the fact that we want to continue, into the future, to accept the best people. Through these tests, and through these changes, we continue that work. I commend the member for Fairfax for his significant interest in this issue. I thank him for an excellent visit to his electorate last week where we were able to talk about substantial issues on the Sunshine Coast. His interest in making sure that the Sunshine Coast is a safer place for families and businesses to live and work deserves significant recognition and credit. In this place, his engagement with community groups across a broad spectrum is to be commended. I thank him, again, for the time we had together in Fairfax last week.",146
209,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," The government's crackdown on 457 rorts is really a sham and a con, and the budget estimates process shows that. The government's changes will not fix the widespread rorting of the 457 visa. Under the government's changes only eight per cent of visas granted will be affected. At least 18 of the occupations being removed from the list have not had visas issued in the last decade and 46 have not had visas issued in the last year. As is usual with this government, this is a political stunt. It is not backed up by policy substance. It is a rebadging of the 457 visa program, just to give it a new name. The government's plan to get tough on foreign antique dealers and deer farmers is not going to make a scrap of difference to the abuse of 457 visas by companies bringing in cheap labour. The minister and the government have rushed their temporary work visa announcement, and they failed to consult with businesses and industry. Even members of the minister's own Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, MACSM, are unimpressed, with one member resigning over the lack of consultation on the skilled visa changes. Senate estimates proved the university sector was not consulted prior to the announcement, and we have seen a spokesperson for the Minister for Communications admit that there are 'unintended consequences' of the policy. Now we have a situation where, less than two months after the minister made this big announcement, he is reviewing the list with a view to adding jobs to the skilled occupation list. Minister, how is this a crackdown? There have been no attempts to strengthen labour market testing, which the government mentioned they would do. What are the 'unintended consequences' of the minister's failed 457 visa policy? What is the minister going to do to fix these unintended consequences? Why has the minister failed to consult with industry stakeholders about the impact of the policy? Will the minister adopt Labor's policy and  commit to genuine labour market testing? Will the minister concede that his failed policy may force innovation overseas? Can the minister guarantee that funding for the Skilling Australians Fund will be met regardless of any shortfall associated with the relevant visa levy? Can the minister guarantee ongoing safeguards to ensure that there is no exploitation of overseas workers under the new temporary skill visas? And why won't the minister simply support Labor's private member's bill to put local workers first?",147
210,Mr IRONS,BILLS," Minister, welcome to the Federation Chamber. It is good to see you here. I know how busy you are and what an effective job you are doing on your portfolio. I heard the shadow minister congratulate you earlier, when he first started speaking. The Immigration and Border Protection portfolio has a direct influence on my electorate, and the coalition's strong and consistent measures to secure our borders have definitely had successful flow-on effects in my electorate of Swan. Minister, I also take this opportunity to congratulate your assistant minister and all the staff in your department, particularly on a lot of the requests for information from constituents in my electorate and some of the ministerial interventions you have made on behalf of particularly some of the church groups in my electorate. Those ministerial interventions for the people of Swan have been greatly appreciated, so thank you again to you and your staff. My electorate has a diverse range of cultures, religious beliefs and ethnicities that reside within its borders. However, one thing I hear from many across all these different areas between them is their overwhelming support for the coalition government's consistent and strong stance on our borders. When the coalition government was elected in 2013, 8,500 children had been inside the walls of detention; 50,000 illegal arrivals had flooded into Australia on over 800 boats; and, tragically, at least 1,200 people had lost their lives at sea. This tragedy and chaos are no more. Under the steadfast leadership of the coalition government, we took control of our borders and put an end to these illegal arrivals. It has now been 1,039 days since the last boat arrived on Australia's shore. In my electorate, many praised the minister for his steadfast and unwavering approach to protecting our borders, when he visited my electorate to host an immigration forum mid last year. An overwhelming number of the questions to the minister at this forum from the constituents were in regard to the 457 visa system and strengthening the system to gain Australian citizenship. Many of those who have migrated to Australia over the years know the value of Australian citizenship, and they made it plain to you on that particular day that it was important to them that we maintain the strength and the value of that Australian citizenship. I am pleased to tell those who attended the forum and who called the office to express their concerns on these issues that the coalition has been listening. We are this fixing the system, bringing back integrity to the Australian migration programs and ensuring that businesses support Australian workers and that those who share the values of this nation are the ones who are allowed to become citizens. As John Howard said in 2001, we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. Minister, strong borders are more than a national security advantage. The coalition, through pursuing strong borders, have been able to save $3 billion from the budget, which can be spent to deliver services for the community of Swan and for Australia. These are explained in the efficiencies you just mentioned in your previous answer. An example of this is the now-closed immigration residential housing in the suburb of  Redcliffe in my electorate. This has now closed and, over four years, will save the Australian taxpayers $39.1 million. Just four years ago, the concept of closing this facility would have sounded like a bit of a joke. However, under the coalition we have managed to do just that and close another 16 detention centres across Australia. With savings like these we are now able to offer another 2,500 places in the Humanitarian Program, raising numbers of refugees in our Humanitarian Program to 16,250 in the 2017-18, and increasing that to 18,750 in the 2018-19 year. The increase in the Humanitarian Program by the coalition government means that more of the most persecuted people can find safety in our country, and our commitment to stopping illegal arrivals means that we are not allowing those who threaten the safety of the most persecuted into our nation. This means the people of Swan can know that we are taking more of the people who need our help and we are not taking those who are economic tourists. As all in this chamber know, the Labor Party is divided on this issue. The opposition will say one thing to people yet, in the backroom factional deals, will do another just to ensure factional mates get up. This is the nonsense that led former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to abandon the Pacific solution and created the tragedies that we saw unfold during the RuddGillard-Rudd years. In my electorate and across the country there is broad support for a strong immigration program into Australia, as long as it is through legal means. Minister, in light of recent events, particularly those in Manchester and overseas and the release of the report about the Lindt siege, can you explain why it is important to maintain strong and consistent border protection measures? How is the government dealing with the legacy of Labor's border protection policies?",148
211,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," The Auditor-General has been scathing in its assessment of the minister's management of the department and key projects within it. In September 2016 we had the Offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea: procurement of garrison support and welfare services report. In January 2017 there was the Offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea: contract management of garrison support and welfare services report, which highlighted the minister's failures and the dysfunction in the department. The report highlighted that, under the coalition government, the department had spent over $1 billion without appropriate authorisation and had no ability to demonstrate appropriate risk management or even deliver value for money for the Australian public. It only got worse. In February 2017 The Australian Border Force's use of statutory powers report was released. In that case, the ANAO found the Australian Border Force were conducting unlawful and inappropriate searches of passengers at international airports and routinely questioning people without documenting their legal authority to do so. So it would come as no surprise that in March 2017 the ANAO released the Cybersecurity follow-up audit which found that, under this minister, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection was only compliant with one of the top four mitigation strategies and was not cyber-resilient. 'Cyber-resilience' is defined as 'the ability to continue providing services while deterring and responding to cyberattacks'. Cyber-resilience also reduces the likelihood of successful cyberattacks. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection is not cyber-resilient. It has failed to comply with the top four mitigation strategies. In fact, during Senate budget  estimates, when asked about the ANAO report, departmental officers admitted: 'I do not disagree with the Auditor-General's finding technically. Technically they are correct; we are not compliant.' This comes on top of testimony at Senate estimates that the department is regularly a target of cyberattacks. Minister, the immigration department collects and stores personal details and biometrics, including photographs and passport data, of millions of Australians and overseas travellers who pass through our borders each year. Do you agree the report accurately reflects the risk associated with the department's cyber-resilience? Given how many times the department is targeted by hackers and suspicious emails, is the Turnbull government putting the personal information of travellers at risk because of the department's failure to meet basic cyberresilience benchmarks? Does the minister believe he is putting Australia's reputation as a tourism destination of choice at risk by failing to do all he can to protect travellers' personal and travel information? Why did the minister fail to meet the 2014 deadline for ensuring his department was cybersecure? What resources is the minister allocating to ensure the department is up to scratch on cyber-resilience? Minister, can you guarantee that your department will meet benchmarks at the next cyberaudit? Are you aware that your department is under cyberattack on a consistent basis? Are you confident that the department can withstand the repeated cyberattacks? Minister, can you give this House a personal assurance that, under your watch, personal information about travellers and Australians will never be hacked from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection?",149
212,Mr DUTTON,BILLS," I thank members again for their contributions. I will touch on a couple of points made by the honourable member opposite. Firstly, in relation to the 457 program, Labor runs this nonsense line that somehow a small percentage of people or categories ultimately are affected. The fact is that everybody applying for a visa or who would have applied under the old arrangements is affected by the changes we make. We introduced labour market testing, which has been strengthened. That is not recognised by those opposite. Criminal history checks are now mandatory. Again, it affects every applicant. There is new genuine temporary entry assessment. Employers will have a strengthened obligation to contribute to the training of Australian workers. Tax file numbers will be collected and matched with ATO records. Every single applicant under the new arrangement will be subject to these conditions. Yes, we abolished the 457 program because it was rorted. Labor presided over a particular mess in this area that has been well documented. Again, the Labor Party have to own up for the mistakes that they made and that they continued to make right up until the time they were thrown out of office. Labor's CSOL contained 651 occupations. It has been reduced to 435. Of the 435 occupations on the new list, 24 are available for sponsorship only in regional areas and 268 occupations are only eligible for a two-year visa. The point is that we have restored integrity to the program. For example-and this again gives the lie to the words just uttered by the member for Blair-22,000 visas were granted under Labor in the occupations that have been removed from the list. They put the nonsense argument that we have dealt with the miscellaneous occupations on the list and have knocked out the insignificant ones, but 22,000 visas were issued by Labor under those categoriesthey are not eligible under our program.  Yes, we have said, quite prudently, that we will review the list twice yearly, as you would expect. If people have a good case to make to Employment-and we rely on advice from the Department of Employment-for occupations to come off or occupations to be listed, we will take that advice. I think that is prudent. Again, when some of these fundamental issues are missed by Labor it gives you an insight into the lack of capacity they have in management of these programs, which was evidenced so regularly when they were in government. There was reference made by the honourable member opposite to the ANAO. Those issues were dealt with by the secretary in Senate estimates, but I make the point that it is pretty hard for this department when 1,000 people a week are being pulled off boats and processed on Christmas Island and they are having to, in rapid response times, set up camps and arrangements in concert with Nauru, PNG, Christmas Island or the 17 detention centres they had to open here. What is the criticism of the Labor Party? The criticism of the department by the Labor Party constantly in Senate estimates and again repeated here blindly by the member for Blair today is that the department should have gone through every process, every procurement box-ticking exerciseAn honourable member interjecting",150
213,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,"They had to respond to people drowning at sea and a complete collapse of our border control system, and what is his criticism of it? His criticism is that the department did not go out and properly advertise or tick the boxes required through the procurement process. If that is the criticism that Labor can make, again it shows that they have learnt no lessons from their time in government. Frankly, it gives you insight into the difficulties that the Labor Party still have, why they are still tearing themselves apart internally and why there is this civil war between Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten. That is why Labor can never adequately respond to this particular issue-or citizenship. It is very clear to all of us at the moment that the Labor Party is completely torn between the left and the right in relation to these fundamental issues. It is no wonder that the Australian public is completely bewildered by the approach of the Australian Labor Party, demonstrated again today by the contributions of those opposite. I look forward in my next contribution to paying attention to a much more significant contribution to this debate by the member for Swan.",151
214,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I want to talk on an important area in terms of Border Force for the people in my home state of Queensland, the same state that the minister hails from. In December 2015, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection announced two new high-performance vessels would be delivered to Cairns in September 2016. These fastresponse boats, or FRBs, are designed to speedily intercept illegal fishers and protect our northern borders. Despite the name, the delivery of these vessels has been anything but fast. The immigration minister promised the people of Cairns that these boats would be delivered, and he has broken that promise time and time again. In September 2016 it was revealed that the delivery of the FRBs would be delayed until mid-2017. At the time, the federal member for Leichhardt was quoted in an interview saying, 'I've checked on it to find there have been some production glitches.' Senate estimates last week then revealed they have been pushed back yet again until the end of this year, meaning they will not hit the water in Cairns until at least a year after they were due. You have broken your promise, Minister.  Labor wants these fast-response boats to be delivered as soon as possible to the north to protect against illegal fishing, to protect the future of the tourism industry and to protect jobs in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait. Why is the minister incapable of delivering these two boats as he promised? What impact has the failure to deliver these boats had on the ability of the Australian Border Force to stamp out illegal fishing in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait? What communication has the minister had with the federal member for Leichhardt and, more importantly, with the people of Cairns and the people of the Torres Strait about the prolonged delay of these vessels? When was the minister made aware of the production delays? What step did the minister take to mitigate these production delays? Can the minister guarantee the vessels will be delivered to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection before the end of the year, or will he break his promise yet again? Ultimately, will the minister, with his poor performance and poor attention to detail in his portfolio, accept responsibility for the perpetual delays of the fast-response boats for Cairns and the people of North Queensland and the Torres Strait?",151
215,Mr CREWTHER,BILLS," Minister, firstly, I thank you for coming to the Federation Chamber today to answer our questions. The immigration and border protection portfolio is one that is constantly responding to international developments and events, and I greatly appreciate your consistent and reliable engagement with all members of parliament. We are an incredibly diverse country in both ethnicities and backgrounds, so your work is something that is of real relevance to people in my electorate of Dunkley and right across Australia. Given that we currently have more displaced people across the world than we did following World War II, the plight of refugees is something that is constantly topical. Approximately 23 per cent of Dunkley's population was born overseas, a figure comparable to the national average. We have a number of wonderful facilities for those newly arrived to our community, including one that I recently visited-the Sudanese homework and learning club in Frankston. This is a program supported jointly by MiCare, the New Hope foundation, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Woodleigh School. It is run primarily by volunteers, mostly students and teachers from local schools who offer their time after hours as tutors and buddies to Sudanese young people. The program demonstrates that through community support Sudanese refugee and migrant children are able to accelerate their basic literacy and numeracy skills, enabling them to succeed in school and form relationships and friendships which consequently have a preventive effect on youth crime and other social integration problems later in life. It is my firm belief that this program could be used as a template for other electorates to assist in community engagement with refugees. These programs are thoroughly deserving of support from the federal government, something which I recently raised with Assistant Minister Hawke. It is critical that we support such programs and encourage engagement and integration as well as avenues that provide refugees and migrants with the best possible resources to access the many and varied opportunities here in Australia. There has been a lot of negative press in Victoria recently about specific ethnicities and their lack of integration into the local community, so it is pleasing to be able to witness the wonderful work that is going on within Dunkley to support these people and to enable greater integration as well as mutual understanding. I believe it is groups and attitudes like these that are contributing to restoring the Australian population's confidence in our migration system.  Furthermore, the order provided around irregular maritime arrivals to Australia-particularly around the stopping of people smuggling and the drownings at sea-and the coordinated refugee intake through the United Nations humanitarian program enable us to better support a greater number of refugees in most need. Per capita, this makes us the recipients of one of the highest numbers of refugees resettled through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees program. The objective of our refugee intake focus should, without a doubt, be on ensuring that people who are most at risk are given priority to come to Australia, particularly the persecuted minorities of women and children. The fact that we have now increased our refugee intake and that there are fewer people in offshore processing facilities than there were under the previous Labor governments indicates to me the change in approach when it comes to our acceptance of refugees. I understand that at least 17 detention centres have been closed and no children are now in detention. The streamlining of our processing for communities has been productive overall and a great success. I would be pleased to see the success of our refugee program result in a higher but, importantly, orderly refugee intake in order to provide humanitarian assistance to more people, many of whom are suffering so much as a result of terrible conflicts that have uprooted so many lives. The Turnbull coalition government is demonstrating its commitment to providing assistance to ethnic and cultural groups who need aid the most, and is working with its international partners to proactively support and care for the world's most vulnerable people-people like Nihad, a Yazidi girl I met through my recent parliamentary delegation to the UK for our inquiry into modern slavery. Under ISIS, she was raped and, shamefully, sold as a sex slave, and also had a baby, whom she no longer has access to or can see. She is an example of modern slavery. She is the type of person that we should be helping. With these things in mind, Minister, can you provide me with the outcome of the intake of the additional 12,000 Syrian refugees? How does our refugee intake compare with other countries? Can you give an update on the US resettlement program?",152
216,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," Minister, during the Senate estimates process, it was a surprise to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection that the taxpayer-funded departmental website border.gov.au was linked to the Liberal Party website. The link was on a page where people would have been seeking advice about options to reunite with their parents. Instead, they would have been pushed from the departmental website to the Liberal Party of Australia's website to learn more about Liberal Party policy and the immigration minister, and to be encouraged to donate to the Liberal Party. I have already referred this matter to the Australian Public Service Commission for investigation, but the minister is yet to apologise for the gross oversight on his departmental website. Did the minister or anyone from his office ask for the link to be placed on the departmental website? How were party politics allowed to play out on a taxpayer-funded department website? How did the link end up on the departmental website three times? Was the minister aware of the links before they were mentioned in Senate estimates? How long were the links online before being torn down during Senate estimates? Who was responsible for the links being posted to the departmental website? Can the minister assure the Australian public that his department will never again be politicised like this? ",153
217,Mr DUTTON,BILLS," I want firstly to respond to the honourable member for Swan and thank him for his contribution. As he pointed out, we had a very successful visit to his electorate, meeting with some wonderful community leaders there. There was a lot to discuss, and I think they would have been very pleased with some of the announcements that we have made in this budget. The honourable member for Swan should be commended not only for his work within his electorate and the way in which he engages with his constituents to the great betterment of his community but also for the work that he does here as chair of our backbench committee in this space. He is professional in his dealings, he has a compassionate approach to cases that are brought to him as the local member for Swan, and he is to be commended for all of that work. The member for Swan's most substantive contribution, of course, was pointing out Labor's failing in relation to their loss of control of our borders and the consequences of that. I do not think many Australians fully understand the extent to which this problem has cost us in other areas of government expenditure. So far, we have spent $13.7 billion on cleaning up Labor's mess. That is a lot of money that we could spend on schools, on roads such as the Bruce Highway, as the member for Fisher points out, on helping older Australians who are struggling with energy prices-there are all sorts of things we could do. The trouble is that it has not stopped there. This problem, this mess that we are still cleaning up, is costing $1.9 billion a year. Despite all of that, the Labor Party are still at war with themselves on border protection. They still cannot bring themselves to support the government's position. They pretended at the last election that somehow there was a dodgy bandaid solution, a bipartisan approach to this issue, because they did not want to talk about it. That has not been the case since the election, and I can assure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that in the run-up to the next election we will be reminding many Australians about that. Could I cover off on a couple of issues the honourable member for Blair raised, firstly in relation to the fast boats. I have expressed my disappointment to the commissioner. I want those boats to be delivered because they will be an important asset for us. The commissioner has answered questions in Senate estimates only in the last week in relation to some of the further detail. There are delays, which, on the advice given to me, have been unavoidable, but I have been very specific in my advice to the department that I want the boats delivered as quickly as possible. There is a lot of work that we are doing in the Torres Strait, in the north, in particular around illegal fishing, and from both the commissioner's perspective and the whole organisation's perspective there is a desire to do even more, and we will continue to do that. I want to thank very much the member for Dunkley, who I think has made a wonderful contribution in his short time in this parliament. He really has taken a great interest in these matters and is secretary of our backbench committee. He is a champion of the government's policies and the many successes we have been able to achieve in this portfolio, and I commend him for the work that he has done. He asked specifically about the intake of 12,000 Syrians. I can confirm that visas have now been granted for all 12,000 additional places for people displaced by the conflict in Syria and Iraq. I am advised that, as at 19 May, 11,714 people from this group have arrived in Australia. Again, there has been incredible work done by our officers here in Canberra and, most importantly, in the posts in the Middle East.  It is an amazing story that the member for Dunkley referred to: the Yazidis. We visited one of their communities, in Wagga, only a few weeks ago. These are the people we are helping and that all Australians should be proud of. I know the member for Dunkley is proud of the work we are doing in providing support to people who otherwise, in many cases, would have faced certain death. They were being slaughtered by Isis, and we have recovered the lives of these people. We have allowed them to create a new start in our country, in Melbourne. Certainly the electorate of Dunkley is one of the multicultural capitals of our country, and we are very proud of the support that the member for Dunkley provides to his constituents. I really commend him for the work that he has done.",154
218,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I note the minister did not answer any questions about the departmental website and the links to the Liberal Party, the promotion of the minister personally and donations to the Liberal Party, and I am going to give him another opportunity to answer those questions. Minister, I am going to ask you some questions in relation to your recent comments and your campaign against the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The AAT describe themselves as 'a one-stop shop for the independent review of a wide range of decisions made by the Australian government'. They aim to make the process 'accessible, fair, just, economical, informal and quick'. They review decisions 'on the merits', which means they take a fresh look at the issues. The AAT must 'make the legally correct decision or, where there can be more than one correct decision, the preferable decision'. The minister was quoted as saying: I think for people to believe that magistrates or judges or tribunal members don't bring their own personal views to matters is a nonsense … It is in black and white on the AAT website that the AAT must make the legally correct decision. Minister, on 15 May this year a story appeared in the Herald Sun. The story revealed details about six Iranian refugees and decisions made by the AAT on their cases. Stories appeared across the print media, internet and TV calling these people fake refugees. In a public statement, the AAT confirmed: The decisions referred to in today's articles have not been published and are not publically available. That suggests that whoever released the information to a journalist may have breached the Privacy Act. During Senate estimates, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection confirmed that advice on these cases has been provided to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. Minister, did you or your office authorise the leak to the media of confidential decisions of the AAT? Will the minister uphold the integrity of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and immediately investigate the leaking of these confidential decisions of the AAT? What does the minister have against members of the AAT, who are making decisions based on law? Why does the minister persist in criticising members of the judiciary? Will the minister apologise to the members of the AAT, whose integrity and judgements have been questioned as part of the minister's unnecessary smear campaign? If decisions made by the AAT on six Iranian refugees were so bad, why has the minister failed to lodge a judicial review with the Federal Circuit Court or the Federal Court against the AAT's decisions?",155
219,Mr WALLACE,BILLS," Members opposite claim that theirs is the party that stands up for Australian workers' rights. They reckon that they have a monopoly on protecting  workers' interests. But that old claim is starting to are very, very thin. It is a claim based not on their actions in the present but on their rose-coloured memories of the past. It is a tired claim, a threadbare and out-of-date claim. Today led by a man who has spent most of his life giving workers rights away, it is nothing short of laughable. In reality, the Labor Party's interest in protecting Australian workers has long been consigned to the dustbin of history. Those opposite cynically depend on the loyalty and faith of Australian workers while they shamelessly sell them out in their own interest and for the benefit of their union masters. The evidence is overwhelming. In every portfolio, they have a black record of tireless effort to stop new jobs being created, reduce freedom and choice and defend union exploitation. One area where the bankruptcy of Labor's pretence is most clear is on the question of 457 visas, which were designed to support the Australian economy by allowing employers to fill rare, critical skills shortages in their workforce. They were supposed to help Australian workers, not harm them. Australia has a highly skilled and adaptable workforce. If an employer needs to look overseas for a skilled worker it should mean it is trying something new or rare in our country. This sort of innovation drives economic growth and creates more jobs for Australian workers. Those on the other side of the chamber have gone very quiet because they know this is extremely embarrassing for them. A well-used 457 visa program should be a positive benefit to Australian workers. What happened to the 457 visas system under Labor? How did the so-called champions of Australian workers use it? Was it to the benefit of Australians? Of course it was not. Labor, including during the time that the Leader of the Opposition was employment minister, oversaw the granting of record numbers of 457 visas, more than 110,000 of them in a single year under the Leader of the Opposition when he was employment minister. There were 457 visas for work of every kind, work that should have been done by unemployed Australians. For example, under the stewardship of the now Leader of the Opposition, 457 visas were allowed for working on construction sites-for flipping burgers, even. Yes, under the fast food industry labour agreement established under Labor by the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, fast food stores were allowed to bring in workers on a 457 visa. An honourable member interjecting",155
220,Mr WALLACE,BILLS,"It takes a lot of skill to flip burgers, doesn't it-something that Australians apparently cannot do, according to Labor! The union movement has been particularly active in filling jobs that should have gone to Australians with workers from overseas. The Australian Education Union, the Australian Services Union, the Finance Sector Union, the Maritime Union of Australia, the National Tertiary Education Union, the National Union of Workers, the 'shoppies' union, the Transport Workers Union and United Voice have all brought in foreign workers on 457 visas. We need a system that allows employers to bring in workers from overseas in certain circumstances. It is undoubtedly the case that there are skills shortages in our country and not all of them can be easily and quickly filled by local training. In emerging fields of enterprise and technology and in highly specialised roles we need to bring people into ensure that we can stay up to date and exploit new opportunities. We want genuinely highly skilled people to come to our country, grow our economy, offer our people new products and services, create jobs and encourage inward investment. But we need to achieve that in a way that puts  Australian workers first. We need to make sure that every foreign worker is adding something to our workforce, rather than taking it away. I therefore want to ask the minister three questions. Would the minister please outline what steps the government is taking to ensure that highly skilled foreign nationals will continue to be attracted to work in Australia, but will not be a substitute for Australian workers? What are the key differences between the 457 visa, and the new Temporary Skills Shortage visas? What is the rationale for the new 'two-year work experience' requirement? If this wasn't already a requirement, what was there to stop foreign graduates from competing with Australian graduates for entry level jobs?",156
221,Mr DUTTON,BILLS," Going to a couple of points made by the member for Blair in relation to the AAT, I have been very clear about the government's objective. Having secured our borders, stopped drownings at sea, closed 17 detention centres and got 8,000 children out of detention, having restored integrity to a process I want to make sure that those people who are living in our community are abiding by Australian laws. If somebody is here as a non-citizen and that they commit a serious offence against an Australian citizen then they can expect to have their visa cancelled and to be deported. Some people have made comments around the AAT process-the six Iranians et cetera. My response in general has been that I do not care if you are an elected representative, as an occupier of public office you have a public to answer to. We live in a democracy and no-one is above the public's right to question decisions made in this place, in courts or anywhere else. If the honourable member for Blair is suggesting that the Australian people should be ignored in terms of their responses to some of the decisions in the AAT, then he should be more express about it, because dancing around these issues is not going to-I don't think-satisfy the queries that are rightly put by Australians when they ask questions of some of these decisions. I think that is a fundamental point to make. To answer the member's question specifically, my office has not leaked information. Similarly, in regard to the member's question concerning the website, it is the case that, firstly, it was not something that was organised by my office, and certainly not by me. A mistake was made and it is being looked at by the secretary of the department, as he answered in estimates. As you would expect, it is not of the nature described by the member for Blair. That is the reality. I will make this final point: don't look at what Labor says; look at what they do. That was their track record in government and frankly it has been their track record again here today. This is the 36th question that the member for Blair has asked in the Federation Chamber-not one question in question time. Mr Neumann interjecting",157
222,Mr DUTTON,BILLS,"If you have something to put, or an allegation to make or a question to ask, go down to the A-league. Don't come up here into the Federation Chamber and pretend to beat your chest. Stand up to your tactics committee and ask the question in question timehas not had the guts to ask one question in question time in over 300 days. He puts out these benign press releases, which are bordering on embarrassing, and yet he does not ask one question ever-not one question ever!-in question time. The member for Blair, I think, demonstrates to his colleagues here, and certainly to his colleagues in the other place, on a daily basis why he is not up to this job. He has demonstrated it again today.  I go now to the excellent member for Fisher. I want to thank him for his question and I want to thank him for the work that he does on the Sunshine Coast. I want to say thank you for the way in which he engages in the important areas of industrial relations and workplace practices. He is an expert who has brought skills to this place. I commend him for the contribution he has made to this place already. He asked some very important questions in relation to the 457 program. I provided some of that detail earlier in my contribution, but I will repeat this point: we cleaned up another Labor mess, which was the rorts and rackets conducted in the 457 program. We found that mess and we cleaned it up. We cleaned it up because I want to see, like all Australians want to see, young Australians working in MCDonald's, KC or Hungry Jacks. I did not want to see Labor's imports working in those jobs instead of Australian workers, so we cleaned up those rorts and rackets, and we cleaned up a mess of Labor's making. We have restored integrity to another visa program. There are lots of Labor messes that remain. We will continue to clean up all of those messes. It is taking time. It will take money. What I say to the Australian public in the run-up to the next election is that Labor has learnt no lesson from their time in government. They are still fighting and they are still divided. The civil war underway between Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese is as rife as it has ever been. I think that the Australian public is starting to see through Bill Shorten and the mistakes that Labor continues to make. (Time expired) Proposed expenditure agreed to.

223,Mr WYATT,BILLS,"Hasluck-Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health) (11:37): Typically, during consideration in detail, the senior minister would make some opening remarks. However, as Minister Hunt does all the talking all of the time, I have taken it upon myself to say a few words. I want to begin on a more serious note, and start on the issues surrounding the Makk and MCLeay Oakden facility in South Australia. I was deeply shocked to hear about the mistreatment of care recipients at this service. I met with the families of some of these care recipients the other day and, quite frankly, I was horrified to hear about some of the experiences of these families and their loved ones. As a result of the incidents at this facility, I commissioned an independent review into the Commonwealth's aged care quality regulatory process on 1 May 2017. The review, chaired by Kate Carnell AO and Professor Ron Paterson, will examine the accreditation, monitoring, review, investigation, complaints and compliance processes to ensure that the regulatory system in residential aged care works effectively. The health, safety and well-being of older Australians is of paramount importance to this government. I imagine that to those of us on all sides of politics any mistreatment is not acceptable. This review will determine why the extended failures of Oakden were not identified, and the ways that we can move forward from here to achieve better outcomes for older Australians. This budget is a health budget. Specifically, there are significant measures that deliver beneficial outcomes for older Australians. Over the next five years, this government will spend $99.3 billion to support aged-care services. Spending on aged care has steadily risen since the coalition came into government. One of the most significant investments in this  budget is the $5.5 billion extension to the Commonwealth Home Support Program for two years until 30 June 2020. The huge investment in our older Australians is about supporting them to remain independent and in their homes for longer, while ensuring that they have the proper care that they require. This investment includes extending funding arrangements from 1 July 2018, with new funding conditions to provide a greater focus on activities that support independence and wellness and to provide more choices for consumers. This is in addition to the Increasing Choice in Home Care reforms that I announced in February this year. This budget also provides an investment of $3.1 million for ICT to support the My Aged Care platform. My Aged Care supports over 1.3 million older Australians in accessing over $17 billion in aged-care services. This investment will further enhance the capacity and capability of My Aged Care to support our older Australians. Specifically, the investment will provide improvements in system performance and efficiency, ensure timely access to aged care for older Australians, and enable information technology infrastructure to keep pace with the increase in the number of people using My Aged Care. This morning a $4 million My Aged Care campaign, 'Helping families access My Aged Care', was launched. Another important initiative in this budget is the development of an aged-care workforce strategy. This government is committed to providing the best possible care for Australians in aged care, and ensuring we have a strong and productive workforce is crucial to this commitment. Three million dollars will be directed towards growing a local care workforce in partnership with the Social Services portfolio, and $2 million will be redirected to the development of an industry-led workforce strategy. The task force will be led by the sector and will consult widely within and outside the sector. This has been welcomed by key stakeholders such as COTA Australia and Leading Age Services Australia. Given I am taking all the time from my colleagues this morning, I will touch only briefly on the wider health portfolio investments outlined in the bill before us. This budget is a health budget. The outcomes in this bill will deliver for all Australians. We will ensure Australia's health system is better equipped to meet current and future health needs by applying research, evaluation, innovation and the use of data to develop and implement integrated, evidence based health policies, and through support for sustainable funding for health infrastructure. We will provide sustainable funding for public hospital services and improve access to highquality, comprehensive and coordinated preventive primary and mental health care for all Australians, with a focus on those with complex healthcare needs and those living in regional, rural and remote areas, including through access to a skilled health workforce. We will ensure access to cost-effective medicines and medical, dental and hearing services, and improve choice in health services, including through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare, targeted assistance strategies and private health insurance. Protection of the health and safety of the Australian community, and preparedness to respond to national health emergencies and risk, including through immunisation initiatives and regulation of therapeutic goods, chemicals, gene technologies- (Time expired) Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (11:42): No wonder the Minister for Health did not want to go first; he has not had the best week, I would have to say. We might go to some of those particular events. Mr Hunt interjecting Ms CATHERINE KING: The minister loves to throw a few insults out-angry little ant that he is. He loves to do that, so let's make sure that we actually go to the substance of the budget. It is no wonder that he does not want to get up and talk about it. What I want to go to is, in fact, the significant rift between the minister and his secretary, which emerged through Senate estimates-the fact, Minister, that you do not have any departmental officials backing you up here in consideration in detail. We just saw a massive number of Immigration officials backing their minister up in consideration in detail, but there are very strong rumours that there is a very strong rift between the minister in the chamber and his departmental secretary. Mr Hunt interjecting Ms CATHERINE KING: Minister, how can you do good policy when you have such a problem within your department? I want to go to the first three hours of Senate estimates, where what we hadMr Hunt interjecting Ms CATHERINE KING: I would ask the Deputy Speaker to intervene on the minister here if she could, because he will have his turn to respond to questions. I want to go to the heart of what we heard in Senate estimates, which was that this government has been beavering away, allowing the department free rein, on a proposal for our public hospital system which would have seen the abolition of the private health insurance rebate and a substantial cut to public hospitals. I want to take the minister through the evidence about the development of this plan. This plan first emerged in the government's Federation white paper. This plan was discussed by the Prime Minister with premiers directly. The previous Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, raised this with the Victorian Premier and with the Queensland Premier at the time as the Commonwealth's proposal for public hospital funding. This was a government proposal. The department was then instructed to undertake work on this proposal. We know that it was discussed by senior officials because it made its way not only into the Federation white paper but also into COAG documents. So the schedule on hospital benefits that the government put forward to officials in early 2016 contained the hospital benefit schedule, and I will quote from one of the clauses of that. It said: 'To finance the establishment of the hospital benefit, the Commonwealth will repurpose existing funding, possibly including public hospital funding transfers to the states, Medicare Benefits Schedule funding for inhospital services and the private health insurance rebate.' Then during the process of Senate estimates it has emerged that the department has continued work on that proposal. It has continued work on that proposal with the tacit and explicit instructions of the minister. Mr Hunt interjecting",158
224,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The minister will have his opportunity. I want to hear the member for Ballarat without interjection. I cannot hear the member for Ballarat. Ms CATHERINE KING: This minister allowed a $55,000 departmental contract to go to a private sector company, Global Access Partners, which has strong links to the private health insurance industry. We had the minister admit that in fact he was briefed on this proposal not once but several times and that it was in his incoming ministerial government brief. Despite the fact that the minister claims to have rejected the proposal, work not only continued  beyond his claim that he rejected it but also continues to this day. The contract with Global Access Partners has not been cancelled, the work has not ceased and in fact the departmental secretary stated clearly at Senate estimates that they were awaiting a project report. So my questions, of course, to the minister are these. Is this really just a frolic by your top officials? If it is just a frolic, what disciplinary action have you then taken against them? If you have learned your lesson on secret task forces, how come the task force is actually continuing? Are you going to make this report public? (Time expired)",160
225,Mr FALINSKI,BILLS," There are many jewels in the sporting crown of my Northern Beaches electorate. Two of those are the Manly Warringah Gymnastics Club in Cromer and the athletics track in Narrabeen. The gymnastics club has 2,371 members-given it is almost to the hour, make that 2,372 members-has over 220,000 visits each year and employs 50 staff, making it the largest club in the largest state in the greatest country in the world. The club is entirely community owned and run, receiving no government funding. Forty per cent of the state team that went to the national championships were from the Manly Warringah Gymnastics Club. This is quite an achievement when you consider there are 191 gymnastics clubs in New South Wales. The club is in need of new premises. As growth of the sport of gymnastics continues to boom, the club is being squeezed out by other activities. With a membership drawn from over 55 postcodes, the club services a significant area beyond the Northern Beaches. The second sporting crown jewel is a synthetic athletics track which is the training home of current and former Olympians. The track services a region with nearly a million people within it and is used by school after school for athletics carnivals. However, the track is no longer fit for purpose and is in such a state of disrepair that it is causing injury to young athletes. The track is owned by the New South Wales state government, and I am pushing them hard to fund the million dollars needed to repair the track and surrounding facilities. In the context of these sporting jewels, I am proud that the Prime Minister has signalled a new focus on preventive health in 2017 from the Commonwealth government that will give people the right tools and information to live active and healthy lives. Sport plays an important role in improving mental health. It strengthens our community-everyone's community-along with increasing Australia's overall physical health. Participation in sport is important at all ages. I think the oldest playing rugby player in the world is a Japanese man who is 94 years of age. The National Sports Plan will set a vision for sport in Australia into the future, promoting generational behavioural change in our attitudes towards physical activity, driving healthy, active lifestyles. From 2016 to 2020, the Turnbull government will invest close to $1½ billion in sport and recreation. Commonwealth funding for sport within the Health portfolio in 2016-17 includes $40 million for Sporting Schools. The Turnbull government is investing $160 million in Sporting Schools, including an additional $60 million announced at the election to extend and expand the program. Sporting Schools is delivering in almost 6,000 schools across the country. Only 19 per cent of our kids are meeting physical activity guidelines, so the Turnbull government is right to invest in our kids' physical health. The program currently covers primary schools and, from 1 July 2017, will also cover years 7 and 8. Other investments includes: $20.4 million for sport participation activities through the ASC; $110 million to be invested in high-performance sport; $4.3 million for sport integrity  measures; $14.1 million for ASADA to deliver its programs; $11.7 million for water safety and other safety initiatives; $156 million, which was provided to the Queensland government in the 2014-15 budget for the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games; $154 million for sporting infrastructure; $2 million for legacy initiatives to support projects from 2013 to 2018; the Broadcast and Content Reform Package within the Communications and the Arts portfolio, which will include a community dividend in the form of further restrictions on gambling advertising during live sports programs; and $30 million over four years for subscription television to maintain and increase coverage of women's sport, niche sports and high-participation sports that are less sustainable to broadcast. My question is: can the minister please advise how I can pursue opportunities for federal government investment in sporting infrastructure on behalf of my community, particularly for a new home for the Manly Warringah Gymnastics Club and for much-needed repairs to the Narrabeen athletics track? Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (11:53): I note that the minister has so far not risen to answer my questions, in particular those in relation to, if the minister claims that he has put the kibosh on this Commonwealth hospital plan and that it was a frolic that the departmental secretary was on, what disciplinary action he has taken against his departmental secretary. If he was not on a frolic of his own, will you come clean and actually say what your plans were for our public hospitals? I want to go to the substance of this Commonwealth hospital benefit that this government has been working on for the past 18 months. This is not something that is new and that has just emerged. The Commonwealth currently pays for around 40 per cent of public hospital services and, through the private health insurance rebate, 30 per cent for private hospital services. Basically, under the government's plan, what this secret task force was developing was a Commonwealth hospital benefit which would have seen the Commonwealth pay 35 per cent of costs for both systems, which would have been a massive cut to our public hospital system. That is what this proposal that had been in development for some time would have done. The government cannot have it both ways. Either the secretary was on a frolic of his own-and the government should be telling us what it is planning to do about that-or the government was agreeing to the plan's development, which is what we actually know was happening. Anyone who has been in a public hospital recently would know that a substantial cut to public hospital funding, which is what this proposal would have meant, would have a devastating impact on our public hospitals. We know already, from the Australian Medical Association's Public hospital report card, that the waiting times in emergency departments and for elective surgeries have blown out under this government and that this government is responsible for dropping the NEAT and NEST targets. It has taken its foot off the accelerator in dealing with those issues. Of the 48 targets the AMA measures, our public hospitals across the country are meeting only three. Perhaps that is why the President of the AMA described the government's secret plan as a 'disaster for our public hospitals'. It would have also abolished the private health insurance rebate. The minister says he loves private health insurance, and I look forward to him saying that again in this debate, because we are planning to use it extensively, which we have done already on social media. It was in the presentation given at least twice by his top officials that the minister's plan was to abolish  the rebate. I again reiterate to the minister: it is in fact in COAG documents that that is what your proposal plans to do. The minister now says that the plan is off the tableA government member: My plan? Ms CATHERINE KING: You are not a member of the government? You are not a member of the continuity of the government? Suddenly, somehow, you are not actually part of what has happened? Now the minister claims the plan is off the table. Frankly, I have heard that before. I have been through the GP tax debate, and we all know what the words 'no plans yet' mean. We know exactly what those words mean: that in fact you have been developing them. I want to go specifically to what the budget does have. The budget papers show that in fact the government have reverted-in 2021-to Tony Abbott's hospital formula. The budget papers show they have reverted to that. After tearing up Labor's National Health Reform Agreement with the states and cutting billions of dollars out of our public hospitals as a result, in 2021 they will revert to the previous formula. The government's commitment for extra money, which they had to put in in the lead-up to the election campaign, only runs to 2020. So I want to ask the minister specifically: are you planning to bring back, in 2021, the cuts that you had in the 2014 budget? Because if you are planning to revert to that formula then that is what you are saying you are going to be doing. That represents, compared Labor's agreement, in that 2021 year alone, a $3.4 billion cut-in one year-to our public hospital system. Again, the minister cannot have it both ways. If he says he is not planning to keep the 2014 measure in the 2021 budget-that it is just a placeholder in the budget-he has a problem, because he has a significant unfunded liability. Minister, you have a big fiscal cliff coming in 2021. You have a big black hole in your budget when it comes to health. So what is it? Have you got a black hole or are you reverting to the cuts of 2014?",161
226,Mr WALLACE,BILLS," In my electorate of Fisher, we have a large number of older Australians. With the fantastic lifestyle and facilities offered by the coast, people from all over the country, indeed from all over the world, choose to spend their retirement enjoying our beaches and our hinterland. Almost half of the people living in my community are over the age of 55. Aged care is an important issue for a great many people in Fisher, and it is therefore an issue of critical importance to me. My electorate is full of active and empowered seniors. That is one of the reasons I have initiated my Fisher Seniors' Forum, through which I have learned that the experience of getting older has changed, on the Sunshine Coast and all over Australia. Improvements in modern medicine and healthier lifestyles mean that older people are more independent, self-sufficient and active for longer than they have ever been before. Just in March this year, Jean Le Brocq, from my electorate, described in our local newspaper as the 'party girl from Kawana', turned 100. A former patroness of the local bowls club, Jean still plays indoor bowls and has no intention of slowing down. As her niece Estelle says, 'Whatever is happening, she'll be in on it.' Life expectancy is rising. On the current trends, future generations can expect to still be going strong at 100 years old, like Elsie Brown. This demographic shift presents us with a challenge in terms of the sustainability of our aged-care system. The generations that are now  retiring also bring new expectations of the services they receive. Those born as part of the baby boomer generation and since are used to products and services that are tailored to them as individuals. They expect to be able to make their own decisions about their aged care, just as they have been able to make their own choices about services throughout their lives. The coalition government responded to those changes and has consistently acted to increase choice and to support sustainable, high-quality provision of aged-care services. In 2015, the government expanded-sorry, excuse me, Deputy Speaker. You've got to love technology, don't you! A government member interjecting",163
227,Mr WALLACE,BILLS,It is not a recharge issue. A government member: It's an operator issue then!,164
228,Mr WALLACE,BILLS,"It is likely to be an operator issue. But I digress. In February of this year, the minister launched the Increasing Choice in Home Care changes, which allow older Australians to direct funding to the aged-care provider of their choice. These changes make their home care packages portable if they move and allow them to change provider if they are not satisfied. The changes also further developed the My Aged Care online portal so that it operates as a genuine virtual marketplace where providers can market their services and consumers can find providers that are right for them. The Turnbull government is not just improving the way the system works. We are also investing the money that is needed, almost $100 billion over the next five years alone. We are seeing the results of the Turnbull government's commitment to aged care in my own electorate of Fisher. Last week, the results of the 2016-17 aged-care approvals round were announced. The government is investing $649 million to create 10,000 residential aged-care places to provide greater choice for consumers, especially in regional communities like ours, on the Sunshine Coast. My electorate has been a beneficiary of this program, with 140 places allocated for residential care in Fisher. In particular, 120 places were allocated for a brandnew residential-care community on the Sunshine Coast, the planned Palm Lake Care Caloundra. In addition, TriCare Kawana Waters received a further 20 places. These 140 places will go a long way to ensuring greater choice for seniors in my seat of Fisher, on the Sunshine Coast. There have of course been challenges in executing the new system. I have a constituent, Mrs Julie Penlington, who has written to me to tell me about the difficulties that a close member of her family has had in receiving a timely ACAT assessment. The process has been slow, and Julie tells me that she has heard from other older people who have unfortunately had a similar experience. We need to do everything we can to ensure that the aged-care system is straightforward to navigate and that there are no unnecessary barriers. In the light of what I said, Assistant Minister, what is the government doing to support choice in aged-care provision for older Australians? What is the government going to do to ensure that aged-care packages are accessible and to improve the process of ACAT assessment? (Time expired)",164
229,Ms SHARKIE,BILLS," I rise to ask the Minister for Health some questions in relation to the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. As the minister is aware, the program provides $1,000 over two years for free basic dental care for children from eligible families, those who  receive family tax payments. The federal government under then Health Minister Sussan Ley sought to reduce the amount to $700 over two years, citing underutilisation of the program. As the minister would be aware, in March 2016-so some 14 or 15 months ago-a review of the scheme found that the program had been poorly promoted, and it subsequently made four recommendations to improve promotion and encourage greater utilisation of the scheme among families. Those recommendations were to 'make the eligibility notification letter more attractive and recognisable as a ""voucher"" for services'; to 'engage experts in marketing and communication to better target efforts on program promotion including, for example, utilising communication channels other than the eligibility notifications'; to 'ensure hard copy notifications are sent to families who received notification through myGov, unless they have specifically opted out of hard copy communications'; and to 'provide hard copy follow-up notifications to eligible families who have not accessed services'. Minister, given it has been 14 months since those recommendations, would you please detail which of those recommendations have been adopted and implemented by government? If they have not been adopted and implemented, would the minister please detail his reasons why? I look forward to the minister's response.",164
230,Mr LEESER,BILLS," In September last year I delivered my maiden speech in the House of Representatives and I spoke on that occasion about my father's death by suicide some 20 years ago. Suicide is one of the great challenges that Australia faces. The most recent statistics we have show that over 3,000 people died by suicide in 2015-that is roughly eight people a day and 100 people in my electorate over recent years. There was nothing unique about my speech, in that in a number of the maiden speeches delivered by the class of 2016 on both sides of the House people talked about the way in which mental illness, mental health, depression and suicide had affected their families and their communities. I think that underscores what an enormous national challenge this is for our country. Suicide is by virtue of the subject matter a very dark topic, but subsequent to my maiden speech I found that prevention of suicide is something that elicits great hope right across the community. I have been humbled by the thousands of people who have contacted me to share their stories and the organisations that have been in touch to tell me some of the work they are doing. I want to share with the House a couple of stories people have told me. A fellow travelled from interstate just to see me and tell me about his worries about his son. This gentleman, whose father had died by suicide and whose son had recently attempted suicidefortunately, he was unsuccessful-wanted to know what could be done to help him. Another person who saw me told me their frightening story of having interrupted a family member in the process of taking their own life. That was a searing experience for that person. There was a person whose daughter had been going through issues with eating disorders. That had brought on an episode of depression and that person had contemplated suicide. That experience was turned around to good, as he focused on ways in which he could use some of his professional skills to help prevent suicide in his own industry. One lovely thing about this space is the way in which trying to find answers to some of these questions prompts individual action. The mental health and suicide prevention space is very Victorian Britain in its outlook. There are, I am told, in the order of 35,000 organisations in this space across the country, from very large organisations, like Lifeline, the Black Dog Institute and beyondblue, through to small organisations, which were often set up in memory  of a relative or the result of a personal experience people have had. In that respect I should acknowledge my friend the member for Eden-Monaro, who, along with me, is a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention. I have to say on this particular topic there is great bipartisan goodwill across the House. I have been interested in hearing some of the things that organisations are doing in this space and some of the good thinking that is going on in academic areas. I met the distinguished historian Colin Tatz, who reminds us that suicide prevention is not merely a health issue; it is also an issue of what building blocks you can put in society. I ran a very interesting forum with the life insurance industry because I continually heard stories of people not having insurance policies paid out where somebody died by suicide and stories of a spike after the 13th month, when somebody could qualify to take out life insurance policies. I am pleased to report to the House that it is not true that life insurance organisations do not pay out in the event of a suicide, but the evidence at the moment is inconclusive in relation to the 13 months. KPMG in particular is looking at that issue to see what evidence and information can be drawn. One of the important things in this space is that, if people understand and notice the signs and see somebody is contemplating suicide, they know what to do. In the construction industry, I was pleased to attend a course run by MATES in Construction that focuses on that particular industry. On Monday at Gordon a group of us-me along with the member for North Sydney, the member for Bennelong and some of our state colleagues and local mayors-are participating in the Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury safe talks program to inform members of parliament better what can be done to prevent suicide. Minister, there have been lots of people involved in steering the portfolio in this space, but there is a particular appreciation of the hard work you have done since being the minister. I would like you to outline to the House what is in the budget for suicide prevention. Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (12:10): I want to acknowledge the member for Berowra's contribution and his advocacy in this space and thank him for raising such important matters in this chamber here today. In particular I also want to ask the minister about public hospitals. Minister, you have had this secret task force developing something. We do not know whether the departmental secretary has been on a folly of his own or not. But, anyway, we will continue to pursue that. In particular I want to get the minister to outline what his public process is going to be for the next public hospitals agreement. Labor in government spent a lot of time through the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission doing the work. It is a significant part of Medicare and our healthcare system. What is your proposal to develop the beyond-2020 health care and hospital system? If it is not this Commonwealth hospitals benefit, which you claim it is not-we know that it has been pretty actively pursued-are you going to have a public process? In my view, you should. I also want to speak about the Medicare freeze. We had the former Prime Minister introduce the freeze in December 2014. I know exactly what the minister is going to get up and say on that, but I would remind people that in fact, because we had this weird historic indexation arrangement where the Medicare Benefits Schedule was indexed in November, Labor decided to change that indexation to July. In July 2014, under this government, reindexation of the Medicare Benefits Schedule occurred. Then in MYEFO in December 2014 this government introduced a new freeze on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. We had the  initial freeze until 2018, and then we had the government decide that they were going to bank that until 2020, saving billions of dollars, all of which they tout loudly will go into the Medical Research Future Fund. They are pretty proud of that fund and think it is a good idea, but that is all the money that they have banked from this freeze-and it is their freeze. What we did see in the budget papers-and I refer to those specifically-is that, whilst the government said that it had decided to stage the freeze, it had not decided to lift it immediately as Labor had promised to do in the election campaign. That damage still remains embedded, as does the damage that it has done to our healthcare system. Of course, the budget continues to rely on well over $2 billion worth of continued cuts to Medicare in that process. So the numbers are actually on that. We had a whole raft of things being said by the government in relation to the freeze over a period of time. We had them saying the freeze was not much, that it was only 60c. I cannot remember which member said that, but one of them said that in the chamber. They have said that they have learnt their lesson in terms of the Medicare freeze. We have also heard them say: 'It has not really done much damage. Bulk-billing is as high as it ever was.' In fact, we have seen-and the minister likes to quote the overall figure and does not quote MBS item No. 23, which is the figure that is the most important when you are referring to bulk-billing figures-bulk-billing for GPs drop again since the election. That is the actual fact. Bulkbilling has dropped again since the election of this government. That is what has actually been happening. That is what the statistics actually show. A government member interjecting Ms CATHERINE KING: You keep saying that, but it has dropped since the election. The GP bulk-billing rate, item No. 23, has dropped since the election. That is what has happened. A government member interjecting Ms CATHERINE KING: Yes, it has. You can squib if you want, but it has actually dropped since the election. We know, if we talk to people across the country, the impact that it has had. But what the government kept secret in the budget papers is that the freeze for all GP items will not be lifted until 2020. Minister, there are 113 items-including mental health plans and healthcare assessments, which provide really important services to people; pregnancy support; and long consultations-that you have decided to keep frozen until 2020. In fact, all your budget has actually done is implement the original measure of the member for Warringah, the then Prime Minister. That is all your budget has done. You have maintained that. You have delivered for Tony Abbott exactly what he wanted to do on the MBS freeze. Minister, if an election and a change in health minister would not get you to drop your freeze immediately, what will?",165
231,Mr HUNT,BILLS," Let me begin with the member for Berowra-I think that is an important place to start-and then, over the next couple of answers, I will address other items raised by other members. He has been a very courageous contributor to this parliament, particularly in the space of mental health and, in particular, suicide prevention. Today is what is known as Socks4Docs Day. One of the areas within the mental health and suicide prevention space where there has been an unrecognised and unmet need is the loss of life of and mental health issues for doctors and  medical professionals. In part, that is perhaps because of believing that they are okay and that, as the carer, they may not need care, or it is because of a fear of professional ramifications. On Friday, I had the honour of speaking with the AMA at their national conference. I said that day that we would work with the AMA on a partnership for dealing with doctors. I note that today is Socks4Docs Day, and as a small contribution I am recognising and promoting that. Much more importantly, we are developing a partnership with the doctors. In particular, we are contributing a million dollars to work with the AMA, the Black Dog Institute, beyondblue and others, as well as Orygen, with the extraordinary Pat MCGorry, on nursing, on the medical workforce and on the trainees as they are going through the process. That partnership will develop as we go forward. The next thing is that on Sunday we announced, all up, $47 million for suicide prevention, for 16 different groups, plus the Caring for Carers initiative. That will allow us to take real and constructive steps. As the member for Berowra said, there are over 3,000 deaths a year through suicide, and there are many more attempts, some of which leave permanent damage. When I visited the town of Grafton not so long ago with the member for Page, Kevin Hogan, we met with one family that had suffered a suicide attempt and was living with the tragic long-term consequences in the case of their son. We need to do more. The budget itself, in addition, has contributed $11 million for preventive activities in suicide hotspots. That includes funding for Lifeline, as well as physical barriers. In addition to that, there is $9 million towards telehealth for those in rural areas. On top of that, and perhaps most importantly, we have contributed $80 million-and we are doing this on a matched basis with the states-to deal with psychosocial services for those who will not be within the NDIS. If those services are not met, conditions can worsen, and, as those conditions worsen, the risk of people taking their own lives worsens in itself. There was, in addition, $15 million for mental health research. The member for Fisher strongly supported and advocated for the University of the Sunshine Coast and Thompson Institute research project addressing suicide and mental health issues, particularly anxiety and depression, for young people. That was also supported by the member for Fairfax. Together, they have been strong advocates in this space. Further mental health work is being led, in terms of the workforce, by the assistant minister and, in terms of those in aged-care facilities, by the Minister for Aged Care. This package is extremely important. I particularly want to focus on this. In other answers, I will address other questions, but there is-and I note the shadow minister for mental health on the other side-a shared and bipartisan approach to mental health and suicide prevention in this place. Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (12:21): Whilst I acknowledge the minister's contribution, I also remind you, Minister, that the Medicare item for mental health plans remains frozen until 2020 and that that is something you need to deal with if you are going to be serious about people's access to Medicare and that important part of the Medicare Benefits Schedule. I also want to briefly talk about out-of-pocket costs, which have risen substantially under this government, and also a little bit about prevention. Under this government, we know that out-of-pocket costs for health care have absolutely skyrocketed. The worse part is that this budget is failing to deal with those immediately. Those out-of-pocket costs have been driven largely by the government's Medicare Benefits Schedule freeze. The fact that they have not dropped the freeze immediately shows that they  have failed to understand the significant impact that this is having on members of our communities far and wide. People are seeing the impact of the government's freeze every time they go to the doctor and every time they go to see a specialist. Since the government announced the freeze in December 2014, average out-of-pocket costs for GPs have risen by $8.50 in New South Wales, $8 in Victoria, $7.70 in Queensland, $5.40 in South Australia, $7.30 in Western Australia, $5.90 in Tasmania, $5.80 in the Northern Territory and $11.10 here in the ACT. Frankly, this is the GP tax. That is what this minister has delivered for the government: its GP tax. They could not get it through the parliament, so he froze the Medicare Benefits Schedule and did it by stealth. For years and years, the government's freeze has forced GPs across the country to abandon bulk-billing and to slug patients every time they visit the doctor. The worse part is that, because the government has not dropped the freeze immediately, that is continuing to have a significant impact on GPs and specialists across the country. I do want to again ask the government and the minister: how much more will Australians have to pay before this government's freeze fully ends in 2020? Does the government have any idea of the damage that its unfair cuts are doing to Australians' ability to access the health care that they need? Why is the government making Australians pay more every day for their health care while at the same time pursuing a tax cut? One of the very disappointing areas of the budget has been prevention. There was a lot of speculation in the public health sector about what was going to happen on prevention. We had heard that some 70 proposals had been put forward by the department to ERC-that alcohol taxation had been proposed at some point but that that got knocked off, so there was no capacity for the government to actually improve its processes on prevention. We had the Prime Minister in his Press Club speech-obviously, early in the day, this minister had given him a line on health and told him, 'Our new focus is going to be on prevention.' Well, it was a pretty disappointing focus. There were a few initiatives in there which, of course, we welcome, but, really, they were far short of the millions of dollars that have been cut. In particular, I want to ask some questions about tobacco. The government has completely dropped the ball when it comes to tobacco. Yesterday was World No Tobacco Day. Under plain packaging, we have seen a significant drop in the number of people smoking, but the government has done very little. There is no national education campaign around tobaccono investment in that at all-and there have been cuts to funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking prevention, both really important programs. Really, there have not been any significantly new initiatives in this space. So I want to ask the minister: do you think it is appropriate that Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco were present at the budget night dinner, a fundraiser for the Liberal Party; that they were donating to the Liberal Party on that night? I also want to quickly ask the minister about Healthy Harold. The Minister for Education and Training, frankly, threw the Minister for Health under the bus today, confirming this morning in Senate estimates that it was a decision by Health, not Education, to cut the funding for Life Education-Healthy Harold. Why did the Minister for Health think it was okay to cut a children's health program in our schools? Frankly, is anything safe from this government's unfair cuts when it cuts funding for Healthy Harold? Minister, will you guarantee its funding? ",167
232,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS," It is my great pleasure to speak here today on the recent health budget announced by my colleague and mentor the Minister for Health. Overall, it is a fantastic budget for the health portfolio. There is over $10 billion worth of new initiatives in that budget, and they are delivering in spades. In my particular bailiwick there were some really important announcements in the rural health space. One of the mental health initiatives mentioned was a $9 million e-health initiative targeting improved access to psychiatrists, psychologists and general practitioners for remote, very remote and outer regional residents of Australia. That means, if you are seeing a psychiatrist or a psychologist, you can have access to your psychiatrist via the internet and it is paid for. Four of 10 visits have to be face to face, because we need to have that initial human-to-human contact, but this initiative will remove the major burden of travelling all over the country to get access to mental health support from a registered practitioner, either a psychologist or a psychiatrist. There are so many other initiatives-you only have to look in the general health budget. Forty-six per cent of headspace centres are in regional Australia. That is a coalition initiative. There is ongoing funding for them. We have a lot of other initiatives in the mental health space for rural access using telehealth through the PHNs. Many of them are looking at commissioning more services, and our state colleagues have already got a significant amount of investment in telehealth access. In WA and in New South Wales there are networks where remote practitioners can log-in via video linkages or Skype equivalents and get specialist advice. There are many other things that I would like to comment on. The member for Ballarat besmirched the coalition government's effort to reduce smoking. We are totally on the ball when it comes to reducing smoking. Ms Catherine King: What have you done? You haven't done anything!",170
233,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS,"We have just put up the excise for smoking, for a start, and we have theMs Catherine King interjecting",170

235,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The member for Ballarat has many opportunities to ask questions.,170
236,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS,"As I said, the excise is going up again for smoking, and we have the Don't Make Smokes Your Story campaign running. Obviously, member for Ballarat, you are so busy in the House that you have not seen any of the as on TV or the internet. Ms Catherine King: No-one has!",170
237,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS,For those of you who watched,170
238,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Order! Can I just interrupt the assistant minister. The member for Ballarat has ample opportunity to ask questions, and I would appreciate it if she would not continue with the ongoing interjections.",170
239,Dr GILLESPIE,BILLS,"Part of that program has just appeared. If you were watching the State of Origin game last night, you would have seen the Don't Make Smokes Your Story ad, which I had a bit to do with and actually spoke about on World No Tobacco Day.  The other thing is that there was a mention of e-cigarettes. The NHMRC and TGA have given very clear advice to the nation that the use of e-cigarettes has not been established as being a safe practice. There are toxins in e-cigarettes, including glycerol, formaldehyde-all sorts of things that in a heated environment can get right into your lungs. We have seen through occupational health and safety many fibrotic lung diseases and cancers that have developed over many years, and with traditional nicotine smoking and inhalation. We have a responsibility not to recommend or legitimise anything that we think is not safe. There are many things in the rural health space that are right at the heart of the coalition government, and I have mentioned just a couple of them. These criticisms are not correct at all. We are very active in this space. there are the Integrated Rural Training Pipeline initiative, extra specialist training places, regional training hubs, three new university departments of rural health-the list goes on. There are so many initiatives by this coalition government in rural health and against smoking. (Time expired)",170
240,Ms COLLINS,BILLS," Whilst we do have bipartisanship in this place to deal with the very serious issue of suicide prevention, particularly given the suicide data and statistics for Australia at the present, that does not mean that we will not hold the government to account. We did see $115 million for mental health in the budget, but, whilst we welcome that, we are concerned that it is not enough. I was interested to hear the minister's answer earlier when he talked about the $80 million that the government has committed to those people who are currently receiving psychosocial services and who will fall outside of the NDIS. I particularly liked the minister's comment that if these people do not get services their conditions will worsen if the services are not there. That is very, very true, which is why we are very concerned that this $80 million, even if it is matched by the states, assuming the states do match it, will still not be enough for those people who have serious mental ill health and who are at the moment relying on services in wonderful programs like Personal Helpers and Mentors, day to day living and Partners in Recovery. They are great programs that are working very, very well and people are getting the supports they need, but we are very concerned, and I know that people in the sector concerned, that this $80 million will not be enough. Indeed, when we asked the National Mental Health Commission's CEO, Peggy Brown, about that in Senate estimates this week, she said that the $80 million was a starting point. She went on to say that $80 million is not a lot, that it is not going to buy all of the psychosocial disability that is required. So we have a mental health expert in Dr Brown saying that this $80 million is not enough, even if it is matched by the states, and we do not know where the $80 million came from. I ask the minister, genuinely: Can you tell us where the $80 million comes from? Where is the analysis? Where is the data? Where are the reports or whatever it is that led you to come up with this $80 million? Where did the number come from? We need to know where this $80 million figure has come from, because we need to understand the number of people who will be outside the NDIS and who are going to rely on these services, because we need to make sure that the services are there. As the minister himself has said, conditions worsen if these services are not there. There are already too many gaps in the mental health services system. Already, we know, too many people are falling through the system. Already, we know, people cannot get the supports they need in time. We need to know whether this $80 million is enough or not.  The other thing I want to ask the minister is: why are you drip feeding out the headspace site announcements? It was clear from Senate estimates that the minister was given a list of 20 headspace sites to pick from, and that he has made a decision on 10. We have had three of those were announced to date, which we welcomed-Grafton, Whyalla and Mandurah-but I am concerned about where the other seven are. When are they going to be rolled out? Are they going to be drip fed at one a month? When is this going to happen? The first one was announced in February. I would hate to think that the minister is sitting on the other seven announcements from February and is going to drip them out rather than announce them all at once. We do know that there are some coming soon, but we need these services up and operating as quickly as possible, and I am sure the minister agrees. There are many members in this place who appreciate the valuable work that headspace does in local communities. It does great work in local communities, but we also know that there is a need for headspace services in other communities. We also know that many headspace sites still have waiting lists, significant waiting lists in some places. I ask the minister: Realistically, when will the rest of the sites be announced? Is there any analysis being done of where further sites are required? Are we sure that the waiting lists and the needs of the current headspaces are being met, because I am hearing serious concerns from people that there are waiting lists and people are going to headspace services and they are not getting the support they need? Headspaces were originally designed for people with mild depression and anxiety. I understand that, because of the gaps in services, headspaces are actually dealing with people who have much more severe mental ill health than they were designed to deal with. They are doing a good job of coping with what is coming through their door but the resources available to them and the gaps in the system are serious issues. In that bipartisan manner, Minister, when are we going to hear the other headspaces? Do we know about the waiting lists in the other headspaces? What is being done?",171
241,Mr HUNT,BILLS," I want to deal with a number of issues that have been raised in this consideration in detail. The centrepiece of the health budget is not the $10 billion that is being invested across different areas, including $2.4 billion in Medicare, $2.2 billion in the PBS, $2.8 billion in the hospital system, $730 million in the Mersey and other different areas. The centrepiece is the partnerships and agreements struck with not just one, two, three or four but five major health sector professional groups. In particular we have struck an agreement with the AMA and the Royal Australian College of GPs to work for the long-term benefit of the medical profession and patients. Central to that was the process of reindexation. That included-and I respond to the member for Ballarat here-for the first time since 2004 reindexation of diagnostic items. These are items I know are not on Labor's proposed reindexation list. It is not something they have ever committed to. In particular there are 58 items, including mammography, fluoroscopy, interventional radiology and computed tomography, which are still frozen under the Labor Party's proposal. Let me give you an example. Item 55848 and item 55850 for musculoskeletal ultrasound will not be unfrozen under Labor. They were not in their proposed changes. Items 56001 and 56221 for CT scans of the head and spine will not be unfrozen under Labor's proposal. They have never proposed any unfreezing of diagnostic imaging. They went through six years and did not unfreeze them.  Ms Catherine King interjecting",172
242,Mr HUNT,BILLS,Those are examples. I understand it is a slight embarrassment for them. Ms Catherine King interjecting,173
243,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member for Ballarat! This works by you getting a turn and then them getting a turn. At the moment is the turn of the minister.,173
244,Mr HUNT,BILLS,"Having made the point that we have achieved agreements-and I am advised by the department for the first time in Australia with all of these groups simultaneously-and expressed our support for the medical profession, I was surprised that last Friday the Leader of the Opposition launched a vicious attack on the medical profession. In front of the AMA Federal Council he referred to the AMA's shared vision partnership with the Australian government as a cash-for-no-comment agreement. This has been vigorously rejected by the AMA, has been vigorously rejected by the doctors and has been vigorously rejected by the Royal Australian College of GPs. None of these groups have a history of silence. These groups will not have a future history of silence I venture to predict. They are strong and independent. However, this is consistent with a pattern of attacking others. It is fine to go after me. It is fine to go after the Minister for Aged Care, although personally I would not do that. We are elected members of parliament. It is wrong to attack the AMA and it is wrong to attack health officials. I want to say to the member for Ballarat that attacking departmental officials is wrong, inappropriate and not the thing that a member of parliament-let alone an aspiring health minister-should be doing. Having said that, let me make it absolutely clear that our policy is that we believe in private health insurance. The proposal from the Federation white paper, which would see the abolition of private health insurance, is one that this government, myself and the Prime Minister comprehensively and utterly reject. It will not happen on our watch and is rejected. At the same time, we have massively increased hospital funding, at a faster rate than occurred under the ALP. We believe in private health insurance, we are funding the hospitals and we have the highest bulk-billing rates for this quarter against any previous- (Time expired)",173
245,Ms COLLINS,BILLS," I want to question the Minister for Aged Care. It was interesting that this budget did not have any aged care cuts. It is the first one in quite some time. I am pleased that the minister managed to not have aged care as an ATM for the government this time after $3 billion of cuts in the last few years. I think the older Australians, and their families who care for them, appreciate that there were not further cuts in this budget. I want the minister to answer some legitimate questions, and I want raise some constituent issues that have been raised with me about homecare services. It is interesting that backbenchers on the other side have also raised the issue of ACAT assessments and waits for homecare packages, because there is no doubt that the ACAT assessments have blown out substantially. When we asked some questions in Senate estimates last year the department said, 'Yes, there is a bit of a problem,' and they have gone off to try to talk to the states to try to remedy some of those.  Since the change of the Living Longer Living Better reforms-which were Labor's reforms and bipartisan, and I acknowledge that-there is now a bit of an issue about the actual packages and the level of packages available, and the waiting lists for those. I want to give the minister a couple of examples of what people who have contacted me have said. The first, whom I will refer to as Mr BF, is a consumer from Victoria. He was approved for a level 4 homecare package and is currently receiving a level 1. He has been queued now for 432 days for his level 4 package. These are frail, elderly people who need services. He has a diagnosis of dementia. His cognitive state is declining. It has been worsening with his behaviours and his outbursts. It is causing distress not just for him but also for his wife, who is his carer. He and his wife are in distress and they clearly are not adequately supported on a level 1 package. They have no indication of how long they are going to wait to get a higher care package and it is putting them at risk, and what is happening in that place at risk I have another one here, which is from Mr MB from South-West Sydney. He has Parkinson's disease and was approved for a level 4 package on 9 March 2015. He has now been queued for 756 days. He has not been assigned any interim package at all. He is now a candidate for a premature admission to residential aged care, because he cannot get the services he needs. Here is another: Mr B, a consumer from South Australia. He is a retried GP. He has progressive motor neurone disease. He and his wife have relocated from a regional area closer to family and medical services. He started on a level 2 package in August 2016 with an approval for a level 4 package. He now has been waiting 280 days for the upgrade. It is impossible for him and his wife to know where they are in the queue, how much further they are going to wait and where he is progressing. It has become very difficult for his wife. They cannot plan for his deteriorating condition. His wife has now had to give up her job to care for him full-time. The financial circumstances are now even more difficult for them while they try to source alternative options while they are waiting for this package. Another is Mrs A, who has organised a package for her mother. She is from Tasmania. She was waiting for her mother to be assessed by the local ACAT. She had to wait 123 days for the ACAT assessment. When it occurred, she was told that the new digital format they required to provide client data is taking excessive amounts of time now and is causing problems with the assessment and causing the time to blow out from two weeks to now three months. She was told that her mother would not even be added to the waitlist for the package until the ACAT assessment had been completed. She received approval for a level 4 package after that assessment, and she has now been told by My Aged Care that she could be waiting up to nine months for that package. These are very frail people whose condition is really serious. They are going to end up in an emergency department or end up prematurely in residential aged care. I know the minister understands this is an issue. What I would like to know is: what is the government doing to address it? Has the government done an assessment of the waiting lists? I am told that we will not have the waiting list data till July. In the meantime, what is happening to these poor people and their families is not good enough. How is the government going to fix this? It is not good enough, in today's day and age, with the money we are putting into the aged-care system, for this still to be happening to people and their families. ",173
246,Ms MARINO,BILLS," I want to ask the Assistant Minister for Health for some more information about the issues around telehealth, the initiative announced last month. As the minister would be aware, I represent a rural and regional area of Australia. I represent people in very small communities, often farming communities. I represent people from places like Augusta and Nannup, Donnybrook and Yarloop, Benger and Kirup and Balingup. All of these people certainly will have greater access to psychologists under the government's new telehealth initiative announced early last month, and that is very good news for people in those more remote areas. My area is a regional area, and I suspect that for more remote Australians this is fantastic news. We know that one in five people each year will experience a mental health issue, and we know the emotional toll on the sufferers and their families that goes with that. Of course, we know that people in the areas I am referring to either find it extremely difficult to access services or are not doing it at all. Often we see greater health challenges in rural and regional Australia because of the lack of access to services. I know that under the new arrangements up to seven of the 10 sessions currently available under the Medicare mental health plan will be available via telehealth. That is fantastic news. People will be able to claim a Medicare rebate for what will be convenient and timely online videoconferencing consultations with psychologists and other health professionals. Depending on the condition of the individual, their particular psychologist could actually be thousands of kilometres away. People will be able to access those services even when they have challenges in actually travelling to the services they need. The health professionals themselves will be able to connect sooner and more regularly to patients in need of their services. I know that Dr Ewen MCPhee, President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, has acknowledged how important early intervention in acute mental health can be. I see that most particularly in rural and regional areas. I would mention in particular the little town of Yarloop, where we saw the dreadful bushfires. There is an ongoing need for these types of services for not just the people of Yarloop but also the broader farming community and the small businesses who were so affected by those fires. It is a long-term issue for them. I know that my regional people are very strong and stoic, and often they do not talk about the problems that they might have. I think that some of them will find it far easier to be able to connect via telehealth, without fronting up at a physical location and having their car parked out the front. That is difficult for many to deal with, men in particular, which is also why our regional counsellors are so important. I know that this is very important, and it will be in the more remote and regional areas right across Australia. Assistant Minister, is this the first time a federal government is actually providing the Medicare rebate for psychological services for regional and remote Australians-something that is particularly important to them?",175
247,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,I remind members that there is five minutes of speaking time left for each side and we will be finishing the debate at one o'clock. I call the member for Franklin.,175
248,Ms COLLINS,BILLS," We started five minutes late, Deputy Speaker. I am just letting you know that that is the case.",175
249,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,We have a list of speakers to follow for adjournment. ,175
250,Ms COLLINS,BILLS,"I want to ask the assistant minister about residential aged care funding, now that I have raised some serious issues about home care packages. In my previous question is to the minister I said that the sector and the public particularly are very pleased that aged care has not had cuts in this budget, as it has in previous ones. Most of the cuts in the previous budgets have come from funding for residential aged care, particularly around the Aged Care Funding Instrument, ACFI. There has been a lot of upset over the changes in ACFI. There has been a lot of concern about the unpredictability of the ACFI modelling and the instrument itself. As the minister would know, ACFI is a complex tool for funding. For some time. I have raised the matter of this model being broken, in my view. I understand that the sector is giving the minister the same message and that the government is giving the minister the same message. Indeed, the minister engaged the University of Wollongong to undertake a review of the aged care assessment classification and funding models and to provide options. We asked some questions in estimates about when the government is going to respond to the report from the University of Wollongong, and whether or not the government agreed with the recommendations of the report from the University of Wollongong. It was very difficult to get a straight answer. So it would be good if the minister could say today whether or not he will formally respond to the report from the University of Wollongong, when he will respond to the report from the University of Wollongong, whether or not he agrees that ACFI is no longer fit for purpose and whether he believes ACFI should be replaced with a new funding model or a blend of ACFI and something else. It would be useful for everybody in this place to understand these things. The industry needs certainty and predictability of funding for aged care so that they can get beds online. The minister announced an Aged Care Approvals Round, ACAR, just last week, which is interesting because some of the places from the previous ACAR are still not filled. Some of those beds have not yet been put online. Some people in the sector do not have the capacity to bring them online because they are worried about the unpredictability and the lack of certainty in the sector and in future funding. I understand that a separate review of ACFI is underway by Applied Aged Care Solutions. I would like to know whether that report is going to be publicly released, and when. There is also the Deloitte Access Economics report, which will provide an analysis of unmet demand and the potential implications of uncapping supply in aged care. I would like to know if that is going to be released publicly, and if so, when? There are the Ernst & Young review of residential aged care legislation and the Ernst & Young consultancy to undertake an Aged Care Funding Instrument audit. So there are lots of external consultants doing a lot of the work that, I think, the government should be doing. I am curious as to whether or not these reports are going to be publicly available. Minister, could you tell us if they will be and when they will be, and why the department is not doing this work?",176
251,Mr WYATT,BILLS,"Hasluck-Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health) (12:53): I thank the member for Franklin for her questions and also the member for Fisher, in respect to the aged care assessment, ACAT, wait times. On average, for someone on level 4 it is 48 hours-it is considered to be high priority and needs to be addressed. But the other packages range between 14 to 36 days. In talking with the department I have had the department go and re-discuss matters with each state and territory, because this is a contract  we give to the states and territories to manage for the Commonwealth. In those discussions we have discovered that there are delays. They are unacceptable and not appropriate. In addressing those, I have asked the department to consider some options other than just ACAT assessments, because if there is a delay then I am concerned, as is the government, that people who have a need for aged care services facilities, either in the home or in residential care, will be delayed. That is something that both sides of the House do not agree with. We are looking at that with a view to finding better solutions than those we currently have. Ms Collins: When's that happening?",176
252,Mr WYATT,BILLS,"That is occurring at the moment, Member for Franklin. That requires a visit to each state and territory, and I have asked the department to meet with the ACAT assessors on the ground to find out the reasons that we have delays. Colleagues from both sides of the House have raised with me the substantial delays. When I am made aware of them, like the issues you raised this morning, I deal with them. I would appreciate having the details of the ones that you raised, because I will attend to them and make sure that we do not have these delays of 700, 500 or 300 days. They are totally unacceptable, and I concur with you in that regard. But once we analysed the reforms, with the use of ACFI for complex care needs, suddenly we found a pattern of inexplicable spikes in expenditure and service provision, instead of the normal trajectory. Therefore in that review the department spoke with agency providers and remedied the pattern. The government could not afford to continue with the high level of expenditure, so we capped the instrument. It was not a cut; it was a capping. People had to operate within the framework of the fiscal requirements at the time. What we saw was some of them shift to using the behavioural component of ACFI to again spike in an unacceptable way. The Wollongong report is currently out for consultation. We have worked, as we have done on both sides of the House, and continue to do so, with the aged care sector to co-design responses. That process will culminate within the next couple of months, and then it is my intention to talk with the sector and move to a funding combination that will better serve the aged care sector. If ACFI does not provide the level of guarantee in long-term planning for the provision of places and facilities then I want a better model, and I suspect that you would want the same. I will make public those other reports that you refer to, when it is appropriate. It is again my intention to make sure that the advisory committees within the aged care sector have access to that information and are briefed. David Tune's Aged Care Legislated Review will also enable input from the recommendations that he is proposing to continue from the aged care sector, because it is incumbent upon us to get this right. We owe it to the seniors in our nation, who built this nation, to have the best possible care. But I would welcome all members of this House to provide me with details where there are unnecessary and inappropriate delays in accessing aged care packages and services. Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (12:58): I note the minister who spoke then has done what he should do in consideration in detail. You have addressed the questions that were put to you by the shadow minister. We may not always agree with the answers, but you have attempted to systematically go through the problems that were raised in aged care, unlike the Minister for Health, who has not answered a single one of the questions that I asked him. Is there a public process for hospital funding? You have completely failed to answer the  questions in relation to your secret task force on public hospitals, what your department was doing in relation to the Commonwealth hospital benefits schedule and what your process is from here on. You have failed to answer the question on Healthy Harold. Here is a health department that has failed to fund this program. Your education minister said, 'No, we didn't cut the program; it was Health.' I asked you a question about it, and you could not even answer that. This budget is a litany of failures of this government and of this minister-a failure to invest properly in prevention, a failure to immediately lift the freeze on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. You were unable to get that through cabinet-still 113 items. The government likes to points to the deals. Deals are not a long-term health plan or a long term health reform plan; they are settlements of disputes. That is what you have attempted to do: settle disputes. This is not about the damage that you have done to relationships with the AMA or the college. It is about the damage you have done to the healthcare system. I look forward to the government starting to have a proper health reform agenda and a vision for health, rather than just words. (Time expired) Proposed expenditure agreed to.",177

254,Mr BROAD,ADJOURNMENT, I move: That the Federation Chamber do now adjourn. Battle of Crete: 76th Anniversary,178
255,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to speak on last weekend's events marking the 76th anniversary of the Battle of Crete and the Greek campaign in World War II. I had the honour of attending the wreath-laying ceremony at the Shrine of Remembrance, where we paid our respects to the fallen ANZAC veterans of this very important battle. Fought on the island of Crete, this battle was important not only to the World War II campaign effort itself; it was important in cementing the strong and enduring bonds between Australia and Greece-bonds of comradeship and shared values. On Sunday, I had the pleasure of attending the official luncheon at the Pancretan Village in Wantirna South, where I met the four remaining diggers of this campaign: Mr Norm Maddock, Mr Les Manning, Mr Ian Barker and Mr David Humphreys-war veterans of the Battle of Crete who have lived long and productive lives, revered and respected for their service and contribution. Norm Maddock served with the 2/7th Infantry Battalion. He joined up when he was 17 years old. He fought in the battles of Bardia and Tobruk before being sent with his battalion to Greece. He was evacuated from Kalamata in the early hours of 27 April on the troopship Costa Rica, which was attacked at sea. Norm and all on board successfully transferred to British warships. He then fought in the Battle of Crete in May 1941 at Georgiopoulos at Chania, and in the Battle of 42nd Street near Souda. Captured, he escaped and made his way to the North African coast by sea. Norm was very proud of the support of the Greek people during the Greek and Crete campaigns. In 2007, he was awarded the OAM for his services to the Victorian tramways union, of which he was a very proud union rep, and he was a member of the Australian Labor Party.  Mr Les Manning served with the 2/7th Battalion, joining up at the age of 26-'an old man', as he put it. He left behind a wife and a 13-month-old son. Like Norm, Les fought in the battles of Bardia and Tobruk before being sent with his battalion to Greece. Evacuated from Kalamata in the early hours of 27 April on the troopship Costa Rica, which was attacked at sea, Les and all on board successfully transferred to British warships. He then fought in the Battle of Crete and was taken to the Skines prisoner-of-war camp before being transferred to the infamous Thessaloniki prisoner-of-war camp and then to Germany. He returned to Australia. His son, by that stage, was six years old. The effervescent Les is a mad Richmond Football Club supporter, always attends ANZAC Day parades-including this year's-and he loves the Cretan community, marching with them on ANZAC Day. Mr Ian Barker was a gunner with the 2/3rd Australian Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery. Ian fought in the Battle of Crete. His troops were sent to defend the aerodrome at Heraklion following the defeat of the German attack on Heraklion. But, with the fall of Maleme on the west of the island, the forces at Heraklion were evacuated. Their transports were attacked as they left Crete, with many casualties. Ian suffered these air attacks and was captured following the bombing of his evacuation ship. He escaped from his POW camp in Italy, only to be captured again. Mr David Humphreys was a sergeant with the 2/3rd Australian Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery. David's troop fought in the defence of the Maleme aerodrome on the western side of Crete. He was successfully evacuated from the southern Cretan port of Sfakia. He is the only one of these four veterans who was not captured during the Battle of Crete. He continues to live in Bendigo. Many thanks also go to historian and academic Jim Claven, who has dedicated most of his life to documenting Greece's war history, including Australia's own part in it. As the secretary of the Melbourne-based Lemnos Gallipoli Commemorative Committee since 2011, Jim has written extensively on the ANZAC connection to Greece. He was instrumental in another recent significant milestone for Australian and Greek wartime recognition: the Lemnos Gallipoli Memorial, which was commissioned and unveiled on 17 August 2015. This sculpture centres around the arrival of Australian nurses on the island of Lemnos in 1915. It  magnificent sculpture of the Australian Light Horse at Beersheba, where with many of my colleagues I had the opportunity to be part of a very important ANZAC Day ceremony this year. I do want to congratulate all four of our surviving war veterans and wish them further healthy life. National Security",178
256,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT," Today I rise to speak on community protection intervention orders. Sadly, in Australia every single day I hear from police and from the wider community that young people are being groomed and influenced by radical preachers or those seeking to draw them down dark paths to commit acts of terrorism. We all know the story of Farhad Khalil Mohammad Jabar, the 15-year-old boy who shot and killed Curtis Cheng outside a New South Wales police station. In the days leading up to the shooting, police reported increased chatter about a potential attack occurring. Close to La Trobe, my electorate, we know the story of Abdul Numan Haider, who had a history of going around and preaching for IS. This included taking an IS flag to the Dandenong shopping centre. Two  police officers were stabbed outside the Endeavour Hills police station, and Numan Haider was shot by those police. We also recall Jake Bilardi, who went overseas and became a suicide bomber. Police have also stopped many other potential attacks-the Mother's Day attack, the ANZAC Day attack, an attack at Federation Square in Melbourne. These are incredibly gruesome and confronting stories. They are things that the public, rightly, is in fear about and needs the government to act upon. But we need to use our policing mechanisms to prevent them from happening in the first place, rather than having to deal with the horrible consequences. That is why it is important to look at the initial influencing stages of radicalisation. Whether those be online, meeting extremists or visiting propaganda sites, sadly, young people are being converted. Federally, the coalition government has put in place control orders, new targeted physical searches, telecommunication interceptions and surveillance device regimes to help monitor those subject to control orders. Control orders are a complex process, though, and it takes a Supreme Court judge to issue those orders. Also, I must congratulate the Prime Minister for his use of the term 'advocating' in regard to terrorism, rather than using the word 'incitement', which involves directly going and encouraging terrorist-related activity. Advocating is what I would call a slow grooming process where they work online to influence young people. AFP Commissioner Andrew Colvin said in The Australian recently: We continue to work closely with the digital industry to identify and take down violent extremist material. I also believe there is a greater awareness in our community of what is appropriate and what isn't, in terms of online commentary … This brings me to issues I have raised before: the need to stop people getting involved in terrorism in the first place, any gap that may prevent this need being met, and giving police a tool through which to act. This tool is called a community protection intervention order. It works in a very similar way to a family violence order. This means that it has a low threshold. If police were concerned that a person was being radicalised, it would be possible to go to a magistrate and make an order preventing the person from accessing material. This material could be on radical websites. Some people pretty much go and radicalise themselves. This is very important because the new legislation I spoke about earlier will stop that happening in Australia. They can also talk to people overseas. I have also heard before of people who have perhaps been kicked out of a moderate mosque and who then go and hang around outside mosques trying to influence young people to be radicalised. It is important to note, too, that with a community protection intervention order we can actually target those who are trying to radicalise others. This is something I have raised before. There is a great need for it. This is a very, very important tool, which police require right across the country. I know that it was raised with the state Labor government back in 2015, when the state Labor spokesman said to the Herald Sun journalist Annika Smethurst: There have been initial discussions between Victoria Police and the Department of Justice and Regulation on Victoria Police's proposal regarding Community Protection Intervention Orders. Sadly, we have heard nothing. This is something that police need. The police need a tool to stop young people from being radicalised, from potentially going on the internet every night and talking to others from overseas and reading material which may influence thempotentially having deradicalisation programs which they attend or hanging out with others  with similar views. This is something vitally needed by the police. We need it right now and right across the nation Broadband",179
257,Mr HART,ADJOURNMENT," Today, I would like to tell you about the absurd situation that has recently arisen in my electorate of Bass, where I believe that we can claim both the best and the worse to offer with respect to internet connectivity in Australia. In the last few weeks, unexpected NBN service outages have plagued local businesses in Northern Tasmania, specifically in Legana, which adjoins the electorate of my friend the member for Lyons. It was on the third day of an ongoing outage that a small-business owner contacted my office, frustrated and disappointed that no-one was taking responsibility to rectify the issue. Hers was one of several businesses in the Legana Shopping Centre that had been forced to, essentially, cease trading, with no phone, internet or EFTPOS services available to them. I will make the point here that these premises are connected to what I will call 'Liberal NBN'-that is, fibre to the node. After much back and forth between NBN Co and service providers, it was identified that the outage had stemmed from a problem with the local node, and that all of these businesses were operating their internet service through that node. It was, by the time services were restored to full capacity, a five-day outage. I will say at this stage, to their credit, that NBN Co were very receptive to inquiries made by my office and in actioning a response to the fault once identified. However, it remains a fact that, for almost a week, these businesses were at a distinct disadvantage-their viability crippled by being unable to access the very service they rely upon to operate day to day. In stark contrast, just across town and almost at the same time, Launceston-based telco Launtel announced Australia's first gigabit NBN connections. Using what I will call 'Labor NBN'-that is, a pure, fibre-to-the-premises NBN connection-Launtel is offering its customers internet speeds some ten times faster than the national average. The advantages that a gigabit connection can provide to Tasmania should not be underestimated. A business's productivity, innovation or creativity no longer needs to be limited by internet speed. This competitive advantage will no doubt, in my view, attract investment to our state. I hope to see interested businesses and new industries making the move to Tasmania, and to my electorate in particular. We need to prepare now to ensure that we have the skilled population ready to fill the jobs that will emerge as a result of this opportunity. Investing in the education of our children now is an investment in our economic future. As I have mentioned on several previous occasions in this place, I am a firm believer in the transformative power of education. Education is the key to transforming Tasmania's economy from its current position, of underperforming the average of the other state economies on a per capita basis by about 27 percent, by equipping a future workforce for the specialised jobs of the future. Education is also the key to transforming the poor health outcomes-in particular, in Northern Tasmania-through a range of related mechanisms like income, access to health care and greater participation in employment. Indeed, of the non-medical determinants of health, there are many individual factors that governments have little control over, such as diet, exercise and consumption of alcohol and tobacco. However, education, as one of these determining factors, is an area where government has the power to implement policies and programs that can lead directly to improved health and community outcomes.  This situation that we have found ourselves in over these past few weeks in my electorate is perhaps the most definitive example of the stark difference between the Liberals' flawed, copper based, 'fraudband', fibre-to-the-node NBN and Labor's pure fibre broadband network. The Liberals' second-rate NBN leaves Tasmanians with no connection at all. Labor's fibre-to the-premises NBN provides world-class speeds and huge potential for investment in Tasmania's economy. The flow-on effects of such investment will act to improve opportunities for jobs, education and health in our state. I note with significant interest the fact that one of the first businesses that were able to use a gigabit internet connection was a local architectural firm called ARTAS Architects. It has its head office in Launceston, in Tasmania, but has branch offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Everybody knows that architectural files and engineering CAD files are very large files, and it is important for a decentralised workforce taking advantage of the nature of the internet these days to be able to transfer those files remotely between offices. In my view, Tasmania is extremely fortunate to be at the cutting edge of internet connectivity, having these gigabit internet connections. Vivid Sydney",181
258,Mr ZIMMERMAN,ADJOURNMENT," This time of year reminds us all why Sydney is Australia's premier city, as our streets come alive with the spectacle of Vivid Sydney, the world's largest festival of light and creativity. Vivid is now one of the world's greatest events, and last year over 2.3 million people attended the festival. I am sure that even more will do so this year. I am someone who is passionate about the role of our tourism industry in Australia's economy. Vivid's boon for our state's visitor economy is enormous. It injects some $110 million into our hotels, restaurants and attractions. For a festival like this, the challenge for organisers is to make each year better than the last, no easy task, but somehow Destination NSW always seems to achieve a little bit more. I congratulate the New South Wales government and Destination NSW for giving our city such an incredible spectacle, and I particularly acknowledge the role of Sandra Chipchase, the head of Destination NSW, in bringing this event together. Since its inception, Vivid has expanded from being a CBD-focused event to one that is now reaching different parts of our city, making it more accessible for residents across Sydney. For people living in my electorate, it means that Vivid events can now be found in our very own suburbs. I particularly want today to congratulate Willoughby City Council for its work in bringing Vivid to Chatswood in partnership with the state government. Chatswood is already one of Sydney's most vibrant and multicultural precincts, and its reputation as a centre for dining and for other activities is growing by the year. Its inclusion in Vivid has reinforced that status. Last week I joined the Mayor of Willoughby, Gail Giles-Gidney, and local residents for the turning on of the lights of the Chatswood Concourse. To see so many families enjoying Vivid, particularly children-and some adults like me as well-captivated by the light installations, in our own local area was truly a great experience. Activities stretch from the Chatswood Interchange, with its 9,000-LED lightshow, down the spine of Chatswood Mall to the Concourse and Chatswood Chase. I encourage local residents who have not already done so to think about attending.  Some local residents have suggested to me over the last week how great it would also be to see Vivid events in the North Sydney CBD. North Sydney Council partnered for two years with Destination NSW to see Vivid activities on the north side of the bridge, and I know that their mayor, Jilly Gibson, was enthusiastic about its potential. Unfortunately for local residents and businesses, the majority of councillors resolved not to continue that partnership. I want to encourage North Sydney Council to work with Destination NSW to look again at options to extend Vivid to North Sydney. North Sydney historically has had the reputation of being a little bit dull after dark. That is slowly changing, and I commend the work of council and others for making that happen, as we see more developments and more opportunities for people to access what is a major CBD. Something like Vivid would enhance that process enormously. It is an opportunity missed to enliven the CBD in North Sydney, with its growing status as a hub for innovation. A celebration of the creativity present in Australia's fourth-largest CBD would provide a logical theme for future involvement. North Sydney Council only needs to look north to Chatswood to see how much a local business precinct and residents can benefit from Vivid. Vivid has grown to be much more than simply a lightshow. The festival includes more than 400 music and 280 ideas events. In addition to the opportunities at Chatswood, I want to pay tribute to the teachers and students of Bradfield Senior College at Gore Hill for deciding to once again become involved in Vivid. Bradfield college is a senior high school specialising in the creative industries, and it has an outstanding reputation for its work in this area. As part of the Vivid Ideas Program, Bradfield college played host to Creative Careers 2017 last weekend, which showcased the opportunities available to young people in our creative industries-from film and digital media to textiles and design. I had the opportunity to visit the college and to see the program in action. The enthusiasm of the students and staff was obvious, and they can be very proud of staging such an excellent demonstration of our creative industries. They are truly a talented group of young Australians with a big future ahead of them. I particularly want mention their 'Secrets' exhibition, which included a documentary made in partnership with the residents of the Caroline Chisholm aged-care facility in Lane Cove. I know that the making of the doco was a moving and revelatory experience for both the students and the aged-care residents involved. The school is led by its director, Meredith Melville-Jones, and she and her team put together an excellent program. I was delighted to be able to meet many of the students who were involved. I look forward to seeing Vivid continue to grow across Sydney and, I hope, further expand on the North Shore. It is truly a wonderful event enjoyed by so many in our community. Tasmania: Tourism Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (13:21): Tasmania is the tourism mecca of Australia. I note the previous speaker spoke of the Vivid festival in Sydney. Well, we have Mona and Mofo, so let's all share the largesse. Tasmania is the tourism mecca of Australia and we all know it. The Prime Minister knows it, but unfortunately the Treasurer does not know it. It certainly did not help us come budget day-not one little bit. The Treasurer did not mention Tasmania once in his budget speech and, when you look at the budget papers, you can see why.  The only mention of Tasmania is in previously announced projects, most of them previously funded and initiated by Labor. In a budget that claims to offer more than $70 billion nationwide for infrastructure, including for a new airport for Western Sydney and a rail connection between Melbourne and Brisbane, Tasmania has been left off the map. I spoke yesterday about infrastructure. We are actually $26 million down on last year. So in an infrastructure budget that is promising $70 billion more for the country we are actually making $26 million less. How that works I do not know in what is supposed to be a national infrastructure budget. Tourism ventures, including the completion of the Three Capes Track, were also denied funding. This is a wonderful initiative in the south of my electorate. The development of the track so far has involved more than 200 Tasmanian businesses. More than 93 per cent of the total cost of the Three Capes Track has been spent through Tasmanian businesses. It is reinjecting investment dollars into the local economy, the small businesses that the people on that side are bagging on about being their best friends. But they are not helping small businesses in southern Tasmania, because there is not a dollar in the budget for the Three Capes Track. The federal government is yet to fund the final stage, despite the state Liberal government promising $4 million towards this important project. I struggle to find anything for Australia, let alone Tasmania, in this budget to do with tourism. Tourism is meant to be one of the new engines of growth of the new economy. There was no news on funds for our other two big investment opportunities-the $160 million Cradle Mountain master plan or the gifting of the former HMAS Tobruk to use as a dive wreck off Tasmania's east coast. We know why there is no news about the Tobruk. It is because it was sold to Queensland. So Tasmania remains the only state in the Federation without a fixed ex-naval vessel dive wreck. That is a great opportunity lost for the east coast in terms of tourism ventures. I must say that the former Liberal member who I replaced was an enthusiastic backer of this project. Not even he could get this project off the ground in terms of getting the government to fund it and making sure that vessel came to Tasmania. It really is a missed opportunity for the people of my state and my electorate. It really would have kickstarted things up in that neck of the woods. That idea was sunk by this government. Tourism in Tasmania is going pretty well. It is going gangbusters, in fact. You would think that it would be a smart investment for a government to invest in tourism in Tasmania-but, no, the Treasurer does not read industry memos. In this budget, the government is providing $1.8 million, down from $5.2 million last year. It is like a Coles advertisement-'Down, down!' The budget is going down, down for Tasmania under this government. There is $1.8 million-down from $5.2 million last year-for the management of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area is a magnificent asset for Tasmania and for Australia. There is $3.4 million less in this budget for it than there was last year. It is absolutely unforgivable. Then we have our own state government adding to the problems. They are inept, lazy and not vying for one dollar of the massive funding allocated for rail infrastructure around Australia that was announced in the budget. The federal Treasurer announced about $10 billion for the National Rail Program-the other side have been banging on for the last week about how wonderful it is-and nothing for Tasmania, because the Tasmanian Liberal  government was just too lazy and too inept to put in a funding bid for the Hobart rail project, which would have been eligible. But Tasmania's capital city is getting left behind thanks to the ineptness of the Hodgman Liberal government. How great would it have been for the people in my electorate-in Brighton and Bridgewater, which are pretty low socio-economic areas-to have access to a rail spur going into Hobart? It would have made all the difference in the world to their transport connectivity. So there are some real missed opportunities for Tasmania in this budget and a real missed opportunity from the Treasurer, who apparently does not know that Tasmania is part of Australia. Bennelong Electorate: Fundraisers",182
259,Mr ALEXANDER,ADJOURNMENT," To the previous member, I share your love for Tasmania, and I holiday there at every opportunity. It is a great place to live and visit. This last week has been a very charitable one in my electorate of Bennelong and across the country. I would like to take this opportunity to speak about two of the great local fundraisers which have just taken place. Firstly, thank God for the Salvos. Despite having driven back to Sydney late on Thursday evening, I was up bright and early on Friday morning, rattling the can with other volunteers for the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal at Epping station. It was a pleasure to support the many volunteers who gave up their time to assist and collect for the Salvos. On Friday, I was joined by Charlie Chen and Narelle Walker from the local firm Outsourced Client Services Group. They did a great job. It was a pleasure to meet them and work with them. It was also a pleasure, once again, to witness first hand the generosity of the members of my community. In no time, we had collected hundreds and thousands of dollars at just one location. Thank you to the people of Bennelong and the residents of Epping for your generous hearts. A typical example of this community spirit that I witnessed was Trent, who was filling the vending machine at the station. He saw that it was quite cold and we were doing a good thing, so he approached us, said he was doing a coffee run and got us all coffees. What a great young man. We then donated money on his behalf, rather than paying him for the coffee, and he was very happy with that. The coffee was great and it allowed us to carry on with our good work. This year, the Red Shield Appeal raised over $5 million through their collections and doorknocks. This funds thousands of meals for the hungry, beds for the homeless, refuge for victims of abuse, assistance for addiction and other counselling. Essentially, it provides hope and survival for thousands of families across the country. Thanks to Trenton Brown and Nora Etmekjian for organising the event again this year and our local Salvos, Cheryl Kistan and her team. And thanks, above all, to those who gave so generously. Another worthy cause that was observed last week was, of course, Australia's Biggest Morning Tea. I was lucky enough to get two bites of the scone-to coin a phrase-by getting to enjoy the one held here in parliament and the one held in my community as well. Locally, I returned again this year to my usual haunt, because the cakes are great, in the hall of the excellent local school Holy Cross College in Ryde. Hundreds turned up for the event, as they do every year, from across the community. This year, we were even joined by Elvis-thank  you very much! Raffles, music and laugher filled the room, but it was all underlined by a very serious message. Everybody has lost someone special to cancer. Every cent raised at the thousands of biggest morning teas across Australia goes straight to the Cancer Council. The Cancer Council, in turn, spends the millions they raise on directly helping care for those with cancer and their families. They support cancer nurses, transport or accommodation, treatment advice and, perhaps most importantly, the emotional support and understanding to bring comfort to people going through what will probably be the toughest time of their lives. The Cancer Council also uses the money to fund groundbreaking research into new and better ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, with the potential to save thousands of lives. Could there be a better cause? The main day for the morning tea was last Thursday. Since then, over 25,000 morning teas have been hosted, and an amazing $1.5 million has been raised. Morning teas will continue through June, so there is still time to register for your own and raise more money for cancer. Contact the Cancer Council's Australia's Biggest Morning Tea or find them online at www.biggestmorningtea.com.au for more information. I would like to not only thank everybody involved in these two fundraising efforts for such great causes but also recognise all the other dedicated people across our community who are raising money, providing support and helping out for very good causes. Many of our local groups are dependent on volunteers and fundraisers like these. Quite simply, without these kind-hearted people, many more people would be far worse off. Question agreed to. Federation Chamber adjourned at 13:31  NA Australian Fisheries Management Authority (Question No. 632) Mr Fitzgibbon To ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, in writing, on 24 November 2016: In respect of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority confirming that the fishing trawler, the Geelong Star, is no longer under Australian jurisdiction, (a) when did the trawler officially leave Australian waters, (b) will the trawler be returning to Australian waters; if so, when, and (c) how many Australians were employed to work on the trawler.",185
260,Mr Joyce,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: These exact questions were asked in the Senate on 14 December 2016 by Senator Carol Brown. Answers to those questions were tabled in the Senate on 31 January 2017. Please refer to Senate Question on Notice No. 250. Crop Insurance Rebates Scheme (Question No. 633) Mr Fitzgibbon to ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, in writing, on 24 November 2016: In respect of a media article by Emma Field 'Multi-peril insurance: Poor uptake of rebates' (Weekly Times , 23 November 2016) which reported that there has been poor uptake of the Government's new multi-peril crop insurance rebates scheme: a) Is it a fact that only $80,000 in rebates have been approved for the 2015-16 $3.6 million annual allocation for the scheme; if so, will the Government return unused funding to budget repair; if not, what will it do with the unused funding? b) Can he provide funding detail for the scheme over the forward estimates? c) What key performance indicators will be used to assess the effectiveness of the scheme? d) Have any changes been made to the eligibility criteria for the scheme? e) How has the scheme been communicated to producers and at what cost? f) What is he doing to address the issue of farmer reluctance to take up the scheme from costs associated with application and premiums and a lack of understanding from banks and farm consultants, as reported by AgRisk in Kondinin Group Research Report issue 078?",187
261,Mr Joyce,QUESTIONS IN WRITING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: a) The Managing Farm Risk Programme opened on 29 March 2016 with $3.662 million available for 2015–16. In the 2015–16 financial year a total of $9,000 in rebates was paid. Unspent funds have been returned to the budget. b) The Portfolio Budget Statement 2017-18 – Agriculture and Water Resources Portfolio (Table 2.2.1. p34) sets out the following funding breakdown for the Managing Farm Risk Programme: 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 $3,110 000 $5,550 000 $5,475 000 c) Through the Managing Farm Risk Programme the government aims to support farmers by encouraging a more diverse and mature market for relevant insurance products in Australia to meet the varied needs of all farm businesses. The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Managing Farm Risk Programme in meeting its objectives by NA  using information collected from all applicants, as well as information that may be collected from other sources. d) No changes have been made to the Managing Farm Risk Programme's eligibility criteria, which were released in the Managing Farm Risk Programme Guidelines in March 2016. e) In April 2016, digital and print media inserts advertising the Managing Farm Risk Programme were placed at a cost of $22,944.56. Further similar advertising in February 2017 were placed at a cost of $16,263.63. Programme information has also been communicated to producers through the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources' website, factsheets, briefings for key industry groups and a ministerial media release at the opening of the programme. f) The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources monitors and reports regularly on the uptake of the Managing Farm Risk Programme. The objectives of the programme are to: 1. improve the capability of farmers to manage drought and other production risks through use of agricultural insurance 2. provide a short-term boost to the multi-peril insurance market in Australia. Taking out agricultural insurance, as well as the type, coverage and scope of a policy, are ultimately commercial decisions for a farm business, and such decisions will be influenced by the costs and benefits that would be accrued by that business. The department commenced a routine review of the programme in the first half 2017. NA ",187
