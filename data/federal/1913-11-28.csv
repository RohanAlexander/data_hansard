1,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I lay on the table the minutes of evidence, with appendices, of the Royal Commission which investigated the conditions of the f r u it industry. The document has been printed, and we have a sufficient number of copies to supply every honourable member who wants one. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS .  personal explanation. The Age, with its usual inaccuracy, reports that yesterday, referring to the honourable member for Barker, I said, "" It is all very well the honourable member, who sits there like an old hen cackling."" I applied the words, not to the honourable member for Barker, but to the honourable member for Grampians.",12
2,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I have a personal explanation to make. Yesterday the Prime Minister stated that I promised to help the Norfolk Island Bill through the House, but had hung it up for four days. I am pleased that the Minister of External Affairs is present, because he is in a position to substantiate what I am about to say. He told me that he was very anxious to get the B i ll through, and asked if I would help him to do so. replied that I should be very pleased; that the members of the late Government supported the Bill ; and that, while I could not speak for every member of the party, there would, so far as I knew, be no opposition to the measure. The second reading was moved by the Minister, and, afc my request, the adjournment of the debate was then courteously granted. The debate wag resumed later, on a Friday, in the absence of the Minister on public business.",12
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I submit that the honourable member is not entitled to make a personal explanation unless some one has said something about him that should not bave been said, or he wishes to explain something he has said.",12
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is entitled to make a personal explanation regarding something about which he has been misrepresented, and I understood that he rose for that purpose.",12
5,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"When the debate on the second reading of the Bill was resumed, the Minister of Trade and Customs-was in charge of the House. I was the only speaker on this side, and spoke for only three minutes, when the second reading was agreed to. The House thereupon went into Committee, and within two-minutes had got to clause 10 of the Bill . Then a question was raised regarding the tenure under which Crown land should be disposed of, and at a quarter past 2-immediatel y after the luncheon adjournment - the Prime Minister entered the Chamber, and, having said that he thought there had been a fair amount of discussion on the amendment that had been proposed, offered, if a vote were come to immediately, to grant pairs for to all members of the Labour party who might be at Ballarat. I thought at the time that the offer was a fair one, but I was not in a position to accept it at once. I saw several, of our party, however, one or two of whom were about to speak, and was able to arrange with them that the vote should be taken as soon as possible after 3, and not later than half-past 3. Then I saw our Whip, and I told him to see the Government Whip, and tell him what we were willing to do. One of the Whips- I am not sure which, but both are now present-cam e to me about five minutes later, and said that, as the Prime Minister's offer had not been accepted when made, it had been withI drawn, and that the honourable gentleman was not prepared to give pairs. I said that that seemed to be strange, but that it did not matter to me, and I told members of my party that the arrangement was "" of f . "" About 4 o'clock the Prime Minister entered the Chamber again, and asked wheher we would go to a vote then. The cry on our side was, "" You would not accept the proposition we made, and all arrangements are therefore ' of f . ' "" Either the next Friday, or a fortnight later, the Minister of External Affairs again saw me- I think about 3 o'clock in the afternoon-and asked me to help him to get the Bill through. I promised to do what I could, saying that, go far as. I knew, only two members on - this side wished to speak on the amendment then before the Committee. Tbey were the honourable members for Capricornia and Gwydir. I saw the honourable member for Capricornia, and he promised that he would not occupy more than five minutes. The honourable member for Gwydir was speaking, and I waited for an opportunity to inform him of what I had done. He was congratulating the Treasurer when the closure was moved, and his speech brought abruptly to an end. then told the Minister of External Affairs that, under the circumstances, I could not ask the honourable member for Gwydir to refrain from making another speech if he wished to do so, and that I must leave the members of my party to do as they pleased. It is unfair to say that I blocked the passing of the measure for four days, when I did what I could to help the Ministry.",12
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"As a personal explanation, I wish to say that no doubt the Minister of External Affairs will assent to the correctness of the statement just made, because the relations between the honourable member and his predecessor seem most touching. The honourable member for Barrier never rises without appealing",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I understood the Prime Minister to say that he had a personal explanation to make.,13
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"All I have to say is that the Bill in question was alleged to be a non-contentious measure, and that the honourable member for Barrier promised to give his assistance in getting it through. It should have been passed on the day on which it was introduced; but, as a matter of fact, three or four days were consumed in its consideration. The facts speak for themselves, and explanations like that which we have just listened to will not alter them. NA AMENDMENT. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I ask the Prime Minister if it is too late in the session to introduce a short measure amending the Public Service Act so as to put the Service on a one-class basis. At present the Service is divided into three divisions, the Professional, Clerical, and General. Some of the ablest men are in the General division, and the system creates class snobbishness.",13
9,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The honourable member is giving information which he is not entitled to do when asking a question. He is not in order in making a speech. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If all the public servants were in the same, class, then a man could be put into any position for which his ability fitted him. '",13
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The honorI able member has made a speech. If he will ask a question, I shall be glad to answer it. I do not. quite know what information he desires. BI-MONTHLY WORKS SCHEDULE.",13
11,Mr FINLAYSON,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The usual bimonthly works schedule is considerably overdue. As the publication would be of great assistance to members when considering the Estimates, I ask the Honorary Minister if he can say when it is likely to be available to us.",13
12,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The schedule was sent to the Government Printer last week, but because of the press of work in the Printing Office, due to the early closing of this and the Victorian Parliament, he has not been able to get it printed with the usual expedition. The preparation of the schedule was a little delayed this month, because it was considered desirable to embody in it, for the benefit of honourable members, the latest information regarding the Capital. I hope that the publication will be available to members next week. AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORT.",13
13,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,Oan the Treasurer inform the House when the report of the Auditor-General will be presented ?,13
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"I should think, very soon. I shall make inquiries, and let honourable members know the result. IMPERI AL CONFERENCE.",13
15,Mr FENTON,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,I ask the Prime Minister whether he can inform the House if it has been definitely decided by the British Government to call together the Imperial Conference in the early part of next year?,13
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"It has not been decided yet. OFFIOE CLEANERS' PAY.  Minister if there is any truth in the rumour that the pay of the cleaners of Government offices is being reduced by 7d. a day, the reduction to take place from today?",13
17,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The Home Affairs Department does not control any cleaners beyond those who are employed for its own offices; but I am confident, knowing the attitude of my own Department, that the only justification for the rumour is the honourable member's question.  Assistant Minister of Home Affairs that the rumour did not originate with me. Will the honourable gentleman inquire whether it is true that cleaners in the public Departments have had their wages reduced by 7d. per day, and that in some cases they have already been paid at the reduced rate? I direct my question to Ministers generally.",14
18,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"I can only say that no reduction of the kind could take place without my knowledge, and that, therefore, no such reduction has taken place, or will take place, in the Department of Home Affairs. So far as my colleagues are concerned",14
19,Mr GHOOM,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,I have heard nothing about it .,14
20,Mr KELLY,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,I am satisfied that there is no justification in connection with their Departments for the rumour to which the honourable member has referred. DEPARTMENTAL REPORTS.,14
21,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"Will the Treaance-sheet surer state whether the reports of the different Departments are yet available, and, if so, will he cause them to be distributed at ouce so that we shall not receive them, as has happened in a number of years, after we have discussed the Estimates?",14
22,Sir JOHNFORREST,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"I do not know that the matter comes particularly under my Department, but I shall be glad to make inquiries and to have distributed such reports as are available. N AVALMATTERS : ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS.",14
23,Mr WEST,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"In view of a reply given by the Prime Minister to a question which the honourable member for Dalley asked recently in regard to Naval matters, I wish to ask whether it is the intention of the Government not to answer correspondence from honourable members in reference to the Navy ? I represent a large section of the Naval Eorces, and it would be very awkward for me if my correspondence in regard to the Navy were ignored by the Department. A letter that I wrote to the Department some five or six weeks ago has not yet received any reply.",14
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"What is it the honourable member wants? Honourable members of the Opposition are making speeches, and not asking questions. SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .",14
25,Mr BOYD,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"In view of the f u r the r outbreak of small-pox in Sydney, I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether it is his intention to protect the rest of Australia by reinstating the quarantine embargo ?",14
26,Mr GROOM,PUBLIC SERVICE ACT,"The Postmaster-General will be in Sydney during the week-end, and I shall ask him to make inquiries. NA EXCHANGES.",14
27,Mr SAMPSON,TOWNAND COUNTR YTELEPHON E,"The statement laid on the table of the House yesterday, by the Postmaster-General, in regard to losses in connection with the telephone branch of the Postal Department, merely deals with the revenue and expenditure of town and country exchanges. The bulk amount of interest owing is shown in a separate column, but there is no classification of the interest debt. In order that we may have a complete balshowing, the actual loss in respect of the different classes of exchanges, I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether he will have actual interest and depreciation charges debited to them ?",14
28,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TOWNAND COUNTR YTELEPHON E,I presented to the House yesterday a tabulated statement dealing with the whole position in regard to the loss on the telephone service ; and when the departmental balance sheet is issued-and I thought it would have been distributed this morning,14
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,TOWNAND COUNTR YTELEPHON E,So it has been. I have received my copy.,14
30,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TOWNAND COUNTR YTELEPHON E,Honourable members will find in that balance-sheet most of the information required by them. If any further information is desired I shall endeavour to secure it . NA Mr KING O'MALLEY - I ask the Postmaster-General not possible for his Department to take over the wireless station at King. where there are a thousand people without any prompt means of communication with Tasmania or the mainland 1,14
31,Mr AGAR WYNNE,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The wireless station at K in g Island belongs to a private company. I have offered the comservice pany a subsidy of £150 per annum three years, to pay the salary of an operator, and have expressed my willinghas ness that the company should take all the receipts. That, I think, fair offer. NORTHERN TERRITORY : MOTOR  External Affairs yet in a position to give the House any information as to the cost of certain motor trips in the Northern Territory t",15
32,Mr GLYNN,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I can give the honourable member some figures, but I have not yet determined the actual cost of these trips. Taking the items, tyres-assum ing they have all been used-petrol , carriage of petrol, fares from Darwin to Townsville, and travelling allowances to the Administrator, as well as to the In spector of Mines, who accompanied him, I find that the cost is £489. yet wish to learn is what allowance has to be made in respect of depreciation of motor car, the expenses of horses, and fares to chauffeurs.",15
33,Mr FALKINER,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Ove r what length of time did the trip extend ?,15
34,Mr GLYNN,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I cannot say for the moment, but about 2,000 miles were covered. SUPPLYBILL (No. 5). Assent reported. MILITARY DEFENCE. ADDITIO NS TO LORD KITCHENER 'S",15
35,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. What additions, if any, have been made to Lord Kitchener's scheme of Military Defence for Australia? 2. By whom were they made? 3. What has been the extra annual cost of ISLAND. such additions? wish to Mr KELLY - The Minister proposes whether it is to submit a statement in a few days, which will give the information desired Island, by the honourable member. NEW CUSTOMS LAUNCH .",15
36,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon noticeWhen will the Customs launch be ready for at the Outer Harbor and Semaphore for Anchorage in South Australia?",15
37,Mr GROOM,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The Navy Office, which charge of the construction, informs me that the launch will be ready by the is a very end of February next. NATIONAL INSURANCE: PENSIONS SCHEME. TRIPS .",15
38,Mr FENTON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"for Dr MALONEY) asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether in any Government subsidy to the pension scheme suggested by the Commonwealth Public Service the ^question will be dealt with in a comprehensive "" National In surance"" Bill? 2. In view of the general public providing the revenue of the Commonwealth does he not consider it would be just to give the same monetary assistance to all citizens when they reach the required age for retiring? 3. Will the Government give the electors of Australia, by means of a Referendum, the opportunity of' accepting or rejecting any scheme of pensions or monetary aid to the Public Service of the Commonwealth before any legisWhat I lation is finally passed?",15
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: 1. No scheme of subsidy has yet been decided on. 2. All citizens of the general public are entitled to fair treatment in disbursing the revenues of the Commonwealth. 3. It will be time enough to consider this when such a scheme is introduced. NORTHERN TERRITORY: EXPERIMENTAL FARM.,15

41,Mr GLYNN,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The answer to the h o n orable member's question is as f o l l o w s : To the 30th June last the expenditure on the two experimental farms at the Daly River and Batchelor was j £ i g , r i i. Information is being obtained as to the amount expended since the date, and will be communicated later. In Committee of Supply: Consideration, resumed from 27th November (vide page 3586), of motion by Sir JOHN FOKEESTThat the first item in the Estimates, under Division i-The Parliament-namely , The President, j£i,ioo, be agreed to.",15
42,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Yarra) [10.55] - When progress was reported last night I had just concluded my remarks in regard to the importation of engines. I desire now to refer to the claim repeatedly made by honourable 'members opposite that they have always favoured industrial legislation, and particularly the establishment of Wages Boards. As one who is familiar with the history of the Wages Board system in this State, I want to point out that the Liberals have always opposed Wages Boards.",16
43,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,The party fought agaiust their introduction in Tasmania.,16
44,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"But for the action of Senator Long, a member of the Labour party, Tasmania would not have any Wages Boards today. secured the appointment of a Commission whose inquiries showed that, in that State, wages as low as 2s. 6d. per week were being paid. It was in consequence of the disclosures made by that Commission that the Wages Board system was introduced there.",16
45,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,The Labour party opposed it .,16
46,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"No doubt there are, in this House, representatives of Tasmania who will be able to reply to the honourable member's statement. of the Labour party did oppose the in troduction of the Wages Board system into Tasmania, their opposition could have been only with the object of securing Conciliation and Arbitration Courts. The employers favour the Wages Board system because they can sack the men representing the employees on these Boards, whereas they cannot sack a Legslative Council of Victoria has always opposed the Wages Board system, and in that Council there have never been more than four members of the Labour party. Prior to the last State there were only three Labour members in the Council, and now there are only four of our party there, and no one will suggest that they ever opposed BUDGET. the creation of a Wages Board. The established system was opposed by such men as Manifold- a relative of the honourable member for Corangamite-Melville , and others. It is well known also that the Employers' Federation of Victoria employed - an organizer to go about the country preaching that marriage was a luxury for the worker, and denouncing Wages Boards.",16
47,Mr BOYD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,That is not correct.,16
48,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Mr Walpole, at a meeting at Lilydale, held in opposition to the Factories Act and Wages Boards, said that marriage was a luxury for the workers.",16
49,Mr BOYD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,But the Employers Federation repudiated his statement.,16
50,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"It continued to employ him for years after he had made that statement, and I believe that it is emLabour ploying him today.",16
51,Mr BOYD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,No .,16
52,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"He was still employed by them when I brought the question up here in 1904, long after he made the statement, and the Employers' Federation Senator Long were then opposed to Wages Boards. We need not go to them for an example, however. Let me take as an example a typical Liberal of today, a fair average sample of the Liberal party, Mr Hugh Victor MCKay, who stood for Ballarat at the last elections. In 1902, six years after the Shops and Factories Act was first in troduced, there was an agitation in this State to abolish it , and a Royal Commission was appointed to consider the matter. I think its chairman was Mr K i r to n , the then member for Ballarat, aud Mr Will If members kins, the then member for Collingwood, was also a member of it . Mr MCKay gave the following sworn evidence before that body: 14371. By the Chairman - What are you?Machinery manufacturer. 14172. How many hands do you employ?About 150, sometimes more. 14373. Are you under the Factories Act?Not yet, but they talk of extending it to the iron and steel moulders. Judge. The 14374. What do you think of it?- I think it is a very crude idea to have an Act that applies to an Australian manufacturer and not give any proper fiscal protection, and at the time that he has to compete with foreign manufacturers from all parts of the world who are not under any election obligations to comply with a Factories Act at all. 14376. Would you rather have it applied to the whole of your business?- I think under present conditions it should not be applied at all. 14406. By Mr Wilkins - I understand you are nol in favour of the Shops and Factories Act? - I certainly cannot say I am in favour of a Wages Board. As far as the rest of the Act, it may be all right, but a Wages Board I am not in favour of, because I think it an e? ment, and, as it was very well put, I would rather not be experimented on. 14414. By Ihe Hon. G. Godfrey - You see no necessity for your trade being dealt with under the Shops and Factories Act?-No . That was ou 13th February, 1902.",16
53,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Oh !,17
54,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I am quoting these facts because the Liberal party are claiming that they have always been in favour of this legislation. I claim that it was put on the statute-book in spite of them, in precisely the same way as the old-age pensions were passed in this Parliament. JVir. Deakin was told, "" You have to pass the old-age pensions or get,"" and the Act was passed within twenty-four hours. The following is an extract from the Age of 7th October, 1904: It might be argued that Mr MCKay should bave failen in with the stipulations of. the Wages Board, but on being seen by the Age representative today he pointed out that the provisions were far too reaching in iheir when applied to such a large industry as the Sunshine Harvester Works On the 8fch. November of the same year that gentleman wrote to the Minister asking that the determination of the Ironmoulders Board should not be applied to his factory at Ballarat, or, failing this, that the determination of the Board sliould not be extended to the Braybrook shire, in which he had a branch factory. The Minister replied that he could give no assurance that the determination would not be extended to Braybrook, but he promised that he would not submit a recommendation for such an extension u n t i l Mr MCKay had been afforded an opportunity of presenting his case to the Government. On 24th July, 1906, two years later, Mr SCOTT - Bennett asked in Parliament why the determination of the I r o n moulders Wages Board had nOt been extended to Braybrook, Braybrook being the shire where the Sunshine Harvester Works were situated. The Chief Secretary replied that the discretionary power of the Governor in Council to apply the determination of the Ironmoulders Board to part of Braybrook had not been exercised in consequence of a petition signed by the employees of Mr MCKay having been received on the l l t h October, 1904. The employees had not, so far as he was [131] aware, withdrawn their opposition to the application. You, Mr Chairman, know as well as I do, with your long experience on the Tariff Commission, how employees peri- are often compelled to sign petitions or "" get,"" just as these workmen had to sign a petition in opposition to this legislation I shall presently quote to the Committee some of the wages paid by Mr MCKay at the time that the M i nister received that petition from his workmen. On the Sth August, 1906, a deputation representing the ironmoulders and agricultural implement trade waited on the Chief Secretary to bring under notice the fact that the harvester works at Sunshine were not working under the conditions as to wages which had been determined by the Wages Board. The Chief Secretary, in replying, said it was his intention to give notice in the House that afternoon to bring agricultural implement manufacturers under the Wages Board provisions of the Acts. When this matter first arose Mr MCKay had waited upon him to ask that the Act should not be extended to Braybrook. He had declined to accede to that request, but he effect had promised to allow Mr MCKay an opportunity of submitting his views before the extension was made. Personally he was in favour of the views that had been laid before him by the deputation. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - Why all this?",17
55,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The Attorney-General is open in his opposition to the workers, but other members of the Liberal party go about professing to be friendly to them. Mr MCKay has done so, and has tried to get their votes, endeavouring to persuade them that he has always been in favour of Wages Boards. I am now showing how, at every step, he protested against the Factories Act, and Wages Board determinations made under it , being applied to him. In the Victorian Government Gazette of 3rd October, 1906, it was notified that the Ironmoulders Wages Board determination had been extended to the railway riding of the shire of Braybrook. On 6th September, 1906, when we were discussing the increases in duty on harvester machinery the following letter, written by Mr . MCKay to the Chief Secretary, was quoted, and appears in Hansard of that year, page 4126I would respectfully request that something be promptly done to remove the embargo of Wages Board conditions from the implement and harvester business. I further request that if this cannot be at once vou will give me an assurance that the Wages Board conditions will not come into operation nt the factory in Braybrook. That was written by fchis typical Liberal tion. belonging to the party who now profess, not only to have introduced industrial legislation on behalf of the workers, to have always been in favour of it . Mr party ? MCKay uses the word "" embargo,"" which we have heard so often in this House. I means a restriction, and to Mr MCKay it again. the Wages Board determination was an unjustifiable restriction, because, if it applied to him, he would not be allowed to sweat his men, as he had been able to do previously. Let me quote from the Age of this year on Mr MCKay. I evidence goes oncandidly admit that if the Age was dealing with me, or even with the honourable well member for Henty, or the honourable memdidly. ber for Echuca, it might not quote us fairly, but at the time this article was written it was backing Mr MCKay some against Mr MCGRATH for all it was worth, and would be most unlikely to put in Mr men MCKay's mouth words that were lutely accurate. Their special correspondent, Mr L . V. Biggs, of 253 Collinsthat street, wrote onfchafcoccasion under the heading "" The Ballarat Seat,"" "" Some Labour Flaws ""Much has also been made by Labour partisans of the fact that Mr MCKay moved from Ballarat to Sunshine to escape, operations of a Wages Board. Mr MCKay's reply is, "" When I moved my works from Ballarat the Wages Board applied same to Sunshine as to Ballarat.""",17
56,Mr BENNETT,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,You know well that the Wages Board was not the cause of Mr MCKay's removal of his from Ballarat.,18
57,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"It was absolutely the cause. I have here the evidence given by Mr MCKay before the Tariff Commisplace ? sion, of which you, Mr Chairman, were a member. Your cross-examination, as recorded afc page 1612, proceeded as follows16499. Seeing that you are asking for practical prohibition for your manufactures, sume that you are quite willing to give your workers equal conditions, generally speaking?We certainly believe in paying high wages. I shall pay the highest wages given- I have always done so, and shall always do so. Mr W. H . IBVINE - And this is the general Budget debate!",18
58,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Jus t as people have picked me oufc afc different times for attack, I am now picking out Mr MCKay. done I have dealt with the general Budget debate at other times, and I propose now to deal with Mr MCKay's professions that he has always favoured industrial legisla",18
59,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Is this an attack on Mr. but MCKay, or an attack on the Liberal",18
60,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I went to Ballarat and t made a similar speechfcofchis,and will do",18
61,Mr WH IRVINE,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Are we all to was make our election speeches over again ?,18

You say that* you have always gel. on with vour work people?-That is so-sj.len 16501. Was there not some trouble some little time ago in connection with the application of decisions of a Wages Board to your workshops?-That trouble was not between my workand myself. Mv workmen supported me up to the hilt in that matter, because they knew not absothe case as T knew it.",18
63,Mr AHEKN,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"How is that evidence the Liberal party in Victoria as follows, opposed Wages Boards?",18
64,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I am showing that Mr MCKay did so.,18
65,Mr AHERN,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Mr MCKay is not the it is alleged, the Liberal party.",18
66,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,He is a typical meniV.ar precisely (he of the Liberal party.,18
67,Mr AHERN,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Why , Mr MCKay has enough never been in the House.",18
68,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,And I do not think he factory ever will be in the House.,18
69,Mr GREGORY,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Why does the honourable member for Yarra not attack Mr. MCKay outside, which is the proper",18
70,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I have attacked Mr. MCKay outside, and I shall do so again.",18
71,The CHAIRMAN,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,We shall get along very much better if we do not have I prethose interjections.,18
72,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The evidence proceeds16508. Do you think four improvers to one journeyman is a fair proportion in an industry of that kind?-All depends on the nature of the business. Here we have Mr MCKay employing four improvers to one journeyman, and not one of these improvers, it must be remembered, had been taught his trade. Another witness, named Weichardt, gave evidence regarding the wages paid by Mr . MCKay, as follows:Now, coming to some of the wages paid. Let us go into the carpenter's shop-Tregeniza , 20s. week. Blacksmith's shop-Lang , married man, with a family, 27s. 6d. week, on the drop hammer, putting lights out at night to make up; Kaufman, tinsmith's labourer, £ 1 , wife and family to support; Campbell, man labourer, £ 1 , wife and eight children to support; Shields, man labourer, £ 1 10s., w if e; Owen, man, tinsmith's labourer, 15s.; Norman Teesdale, fitter, wife and child, ios. per week. and so on. In the Richmond Town H all , when Mr MCKay was present-and this will show wliether I have dealt with this gentleman outside- I said that unless he was prepared to take action against the man who gave that evidence-as he had written a letter to the Argus a few days prior to the meeting on the lines of the previously quoted evidence- I should refuse to vote for any increase of duty for his industry without some guarantee of better treatment for his employees. Mr . MCKay assured members of this House that, tliere was some guarantee in our legislation that the workmen would receive more equitable wages; but, although he admitted that he was well able to pay the wages fixed by the Court, he promptly appealed to the High Court against the decision of Mr Justice Higgins. Mr W. H. IRVINE - How is it that the honourable membeT is getting so frightened about the Ballarat seat?",18
73,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I am not frightened; I merely wish to have these facts put on record. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Why this personal attack on a candidate?,19
74,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I can assure the Attorney-General that if it were himself, or any other honourable member opposite, who happened to sweat his men, I should attack him just as cheerfully.",19
75,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Were wages not also challenged ?,19
76,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"If so, the honourable merabsr can deal with the matter in his place.",19
77,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"It is already well before the public. Mv. TUDOR - I am now dealing with the bogus claim of Mr MCKay to be in favour of industrial legislation and Wages Boards. I do not believe that tliere are half-a-dozen honourable members opposite-w e need not count the [ . i 3 i ] -2 Liberal senators, who are very like the little drop of milk put in to make up. the measure-wh o would publicly declare themselves in favour of the extension of Wages Boards to all industries. When these Liberal members are in the metropolitan constituencies, or in large industrial centres, they profess to be in favour of industrial legislation; but in the country they always suggest some modifications or amendments of such legislation-amendment s very like that suggested by the devil, to remove the "" not s "" out of the Ten Commandments. You, Mr Chairman, who were very assiduous at the sittings of the Tariff Commission, will further remember that, although Mr MCKay had an opportunity to again appear before that body and rebut this evidence regarding the wages paid, he never came. He did send on two foremen to represent him ; but the evidence I have read is clear enough to give the lie direct to such men as MCKay when they profess themselves to be in favour of industrial laws.",19
78,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Did not Mr MCKay's schedule of wages, when produced in Court, prove to be the highest in the trade ?",19
79,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I do not know, but I doubt it ; at any rate, the wages paid by him were declared by Mr Justice Higgins to be unreasonable.",19
80,Mr ARTHUR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I was engaged in the case, and I know that the honourable member for Wimmera is wrong.",19
81,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"T he decision of Mr . Justice Higgins described the wages paii'. by Mr MCKay as unfair and unreasonable, and we must remember that Mr . MCKay admitted that he was able to pay any wages that the Court might f i x. I believe that it is an open boast of some Mr MCGRATH's persons connected with, this firm that the profits in any one year equal the whole of the wages paid. To that I take no exception, but I do object to such people professing themselves as favourable to industrial legislation. Mr . Bolt, a foreman employed by Mr MCKay, gave evidence before the T a r i ff Commission regarding the improvers who are paid less than the journeymen66662. Admitting that, would you say up to what ages they are employed?-They might be improvers up to twenty-one or twenty-two years of age. Mr MCKay took no action against the witness who had put in a sworn declaration regarding the wages paid.",19
82,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Was that witness a dismissed employee ?,20
83,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"He had, I believe, previously been a foreman for Mr MCKay, but I do not know whether he was dismissed; at any rate, some men cannot afford to tell the truth u n t i l after they have left their employ or been dismissed. Mr MCKay, with all his wealth, could have crushed this man, had there been any justice on his side. This is from Mr Bolt's evidence66704. VVe were also told by Mr Weickhardt that Kaufman, a tinsmith's labourer, with a wife and family to support, got £ 1 ?- I believe Mr. Weickhardt employed that man. Mr MCKay got the foremen to employ these men as cheaply as they could, and then the foremen were afterwards blamed for the fact66705. Is it true that he got £ 1 per week?I believe it is; but he was rated by Mr Weickhardt, and engaged by Mr Weickhardt. 66706. Mr Weickhardt told us there man named Campbell, a labourer, with a nnd eisiht children to support, who got £ 1 ?I do not know that man. 66707. He told us also there was a man Shields, a labourer, with a wife, who got f i ios. ?- T believe there was a labourer in tinsmith's shop engaged by Weickhardt at ios. 66-0S. He also told us that a man named Owen got 15s. j is that true?- I do n""t re-ber a man named Owen ever being in the shop. 66V0Q. Norman Teesdale, with a wife chi'd. got ios. ?-The facts of that case are that operation of a Wages Board. one of our travellers. Mr Holland, of the farming districts, and he so'd a mnrV-ine lo a man named Teesdale, on the understanding that Mr MrKay would take his son into the works for six months to give him evpenVnre. He was not particular about the wages: if Mr. MCKnv would ""ive bim ios. for thp time he was there, he would be satisfied. He had no experience, and hnd never been in a fo-'n^rv in his life. He was there for about six months, nnd after he left T heard rumours 'hat he was marTied. That is how be .cot in'o the shnn. That is how t h is a j i got in to the. works, but there is no doubt that , a l t h o u g h he was m a r r i e d , he was paid 10s. per week.

84,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,They are wages.,20
85,Sir JOHN FOHREST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"How typical, if there is only one case. Mr RonoEFS - Hoes the honourable member for Yarra know of any other similar case?",20
86,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,There were several men receiving 15s. a week.,20
87,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,The honourable member mentioned one man who was.,20
88,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Does the honourable member for Yarra think this one instance will prove his case ?,20
89,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I think those wages supply us with the reason that Mr . MCKay opposed Wages Boards; he desired at Braybrook to have the same righ t to sweat his employees as previously. No one will deny that the wages I have quoted are sweating wages-n o one will defend this Liberal banner-bearer for Ballarat.,20
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,He very nearly got elected.,20
91,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Of course, there are some people who, being sweaters themselves, will vote for a sweater.",20
92,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,My experience is that the worse employers are Labour employers.,20
93,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I clo not say that Mr . was a MCKay is a fair average sample of the wife employers of Australia. He is a man who has done his utmost at all times to smash unionism and crush the workers-to grind named them down as he was at one time able the to do in Ballarat. This is why he was so £ 1 anxious in 1906 that the Wages Board system should not be extended to f h at city. At the time Mr MCKay lef t Baljnlarat, only one section of the industry and - the iron moulding-wa s under the Mr Bolt was in one goes on to sayGullock, a competent plumber, gets 15s., is that true?-That is untrue. He is not a competent plumber. The wages he got were 15s. ?-He came there as an improver to the tinsmithing. Then here we have a sworn declaration given before the Tariff Commission by Mr Weickhardt, who saysA filter, on oath at the Police Court, Balm larat, stated his wages was 3s. per day. A fitter in the highest skilled trade receiving such a wage! That was the position in Ballarat, and that was the reason why Mr MCKay wrote to the Chief Secretary and saidnot typical I would respectfully request that something be promptly done to remove the embargo of is this Wages Board conditions from the implement and harvester business. I further request that if this cannot be done at once you will give me an assurance that the Wages Board conditions will not come into operation at the factory in Braybrook. Here is a man who professes to he in favour of industrial regulation.",20
94,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"If you go brook, you will find that many men in his factory are receiving wages in excess of those fixed by the Wages Board.",21
95,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Probably ; but it is exactly the same with the American Beef Trust. I met Mr Malcow, the representative of that trust, and asked him what about the wages to be paid in Australia. He said, "" We will pay labour better than any one else can, and we will get the very best men."" I guarantee that Mr MCKay does not pay a man more than he is worth. If a man is worth £ 1 a day, Mr MCKay will very likely pay him 12s. a day. Mr MCKay is not the only instance. I could pick out hundreds of men who today are professing on. the public platforms that they are in favour of the Wages Boards and the Wages Board conditions under the Victorian Act, just the same as in the case of Mr . MCKay. I remember when our Attorney General was Premier of Victoria there was a sudden dissolution, and the whole of the Wages Boards lapsed. There was great rejoicing down at the Employers Federation wben the Wages Boards were wiped out, though it was only for the time being, because the people of Victoria favoured Wages Boards. I believe some of my friends opposite are in favour of Wages Boards, as long as they do not apply to their own industries-the y would rather try them on the other fellow. Certainly, when they go to districts where the people favour industrial legislation, they favour it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - Y o u should tell the whole truth . When that dissolution took place, I publicly stated that the first act of the new Parliament would be to reinstate the Wages Boards, and that, if employers did not in the meantime adhere to the conditions fixed by the Wages Boards that lapsed, Parliament would be asked to deal with tbem.",21
96,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I was going on to say that I believe the people of Australiaparticularly in Victoria-ar e so much in favour of Wages Boards under the Factories A ct,21
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I thought Budget was before the Committee.,21
98,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"So it is, and I am now dealing with .some of the statements of Liberals on the platform, namely, that they are in favour of industrial legislat i o n ; and I am taking one sample to to Bray- show that this is not the case.",21
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Is that in the Budget ?,21
100,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Thes e are just a few remarks by myself.,21
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I beg your pardon; I thought it might be in the Budget.,21
102,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"No ; I shall deal with the Budget if I have time, but I wish to deal with Liberal candidates. Apparently, some honourable members do not like their candidates being dealt, with. But, first, I wish to make myself rightwith the Attorney-General. I was saying that the people of . Australia, and particularly in Victoria, are so much in favour of the Factories Act that the measure was immediately reinstated as soon as Parliament met again. I believe that the majority of the employers of Victoria would not go back to the old conditions, where the most unscrupulous employer could take advantage of the fair employer. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Do you not know that in the interim not one of those employers departed from the Wages Board conditions f",21
103,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Is that so? I was not aware of it .,21
104,Mr BENNETT,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"If the Attorney General was not here to correct you, what you have said would go out as a fact.",21
105,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"What I have said is all fact. The honourable member for Gippsland is a nice judge of facts. He claimed at Rosedale, or Bairnsdale, that £3,000,000 had been spent by a Labour Government, and that we bought motor cars with it . The honourable gentleman was speaking from a motor car about "" contingencies,"" and one of the ladies in the car said, "" Yes, that is where they got the motor cars,"" and the honourable member said, "" Yes, probably from there."" What the Attorney-General has said is perfectly accurate, and what I say is accurate. I believe that the majority of employers would not go back to the old conditions, precisely the same as a the majority of shopkeepers would not go back again to opening on Saturday afternoons.",21
106,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,What is the object of all this?,21
107,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I am taking Mr . MCKay as a fair sample of Liberal candidates: but I hold that if he was in a metropolitan constituency, he would hold a different view in regard to Wages Boards. There are more artisans working under Wages Boards conditions in the metropolitan area than in any other part of Victoria, yet the Labour party gained seven out of ten seats in that area, though the newspapers were against us, and the workers who are under the Factories Act in Victoria are the very people who were anxious to secure an amendment of the Federal Constitution to allow the Federal Arbitratio n Court to deal with their industries.",22
108,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Many of us advocate the extension of, the Wages Board system to the country.",22
109,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"To all industries? A r e there half-a-dozen men on that side- I will not say-ar e tliere half-a-dozen righteous men to be found on that side-But I ask whether there are half-a-dozen honourable members on the other side who are prepared to say that they will advocate Wages Boards for all industries in every part of Australia. If there are, I have yet to learn of them.",22
110,Mr WH IRVINE,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"If you ask me, I say that on every platform I have advocated Wages Boards for rural industries.",22
111,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,For all industries? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Practicall y all.,22
112,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Then the honourable member stands out as a champion, but no other honourable member has replied that he is prepared to extend Wages Boards to all industries. The honourable member for Wannon is prepared to exmitted tend them to some.",22
113,Mr RODGERS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I have advocated the extension of Wages Boards to rural dustries, and so has the honourable member for Corangamite.",22
114,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I am very glad to hear that.,22
115,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The only stipulation amount of £ 1 is. we make in regard to the extension W ges Boards to rural industries is that a they shall be dealt with by rural Wages Boards, and by people who understand rural conditions.",22
116,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I have no intention of dealing further with the application by as Mr MCKay that he should not pay the wages fixed by the Board. I think it is in England. a fitting time that I should move to reOne port progress, seeing that there is now no Minister in the chamber. Whether the honourable member speaking happens to have ability or not, it is rather peculiar that we should have no Minister in the Committee. I am glad that the M in ister of Trade and Customs has now come in. I know his Department is difficult to manage, and that it is difficult for the Minister to get his work done in the time.",22
117,Mr GROOM,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I am afraid that it means night work as well as day work.,22
118,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"T he Minister has my sympathy. I know the work he has to do. I did it for a while, and did my best to keep it up to date. I was dealing with the application from Mr MCKay and others when they objected to pay Excise duty. In other words, they said fchey would not pay the wages fixed. They did not say that they could not afford to pay them, but they said they would not pay them. I shall not deal further with that, but when we get a claim of this nature from the other side, it is worth inquiring into. I have a circular that has been issued by the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, and is signed by F. L . W . Ashby, secretary, in which he urges employers to pay to a f u n d to fight in the Appeal Court the decision of a Wages Board. They were not content to accept the Wages Board decision.",22
119,Mr GROOM,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,That is not fighting against the principle of Wages Boards.,22
120,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"They were fighting against the decision of a Wages Board, and were taking the matter to a Judge. I think it is the same Judge who adthat he would not be prepared to say that he understood a case as well as practical men would understand it . This in - is what the circular saysAs this will necessitate the incurring of legal expenses, I have been directed to ask you to signify on the form enclosed your willingness to defray a reasonable proportion of such expenses, which you will observe is limited to the of The circular goes on to sayI f the labourers under the Boilermaker* Board are to receive gs. per day, labourers in every other branch will demand the same. Then in the postscript it saysRe artisans - When you have vacancies for any class of artisans, please 'phone or let us know, we are receiving regular shipments of first class men specially selected by Mr Whitehead would think they were a lot of cattle.",22
121,Mr GROOM,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,The New South Wales Government sent Home a man to select immigrants.,23
122,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I am not complaining, but here we have the secretary of the Victorian Chamber of Manufacturers writing on an official form, asking employers to give donations for the purpose of defeating a Wages Board decision.",23
123,Mr GROOM,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"But it is not fighting against the system or principle of Wages Boards. MJ-. TUDOR - Le t me now take another typical man. On the 13th August of this year a deputation waited upon Sir Alexander Peacock, the State M in ister for Labour. Ifc was a deputation from the Independent Workers Industrial Council, an organization which, I understand, is under the wing of our friends opposite. Their secretary, Mr J . T. Packer, stood as a Liberal candidate at the last Victorian elections. He is a recognised organizer, and he went to Wedderburn fco speak on behalf of the Liberal party. Tho deputation asked Sir Alexander Peacock to consider the question of compulsorily extending the Wages Boards system fco all trades and callings, excluding the rural workers. So here we have another Liberal typical man, an organizer of the party, and associated with a body brought into existence for the purpose of trying to divide the workers, who asked Sir Alexander Peacock to compulsorily extend the Wages Board fco all other industries but the rural. A lot has been said about the last Government and their extension of Government employment. It was said that the amount of Government employment had been increased, and that this Government would bring about a reduction. According to the ninth report of the Public Service Commissioner, which was ordered to be printed on the 15th October last- I refer honourable members to page 48-the number of "" e x e m p t "" persons employed, as at 30th June last, was 14,614. I should have used the facts and figures that I am about to give when the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was before the House, had I had an opportunity to do so. Ifc is only temporary and exempt employees who are affected by the Bill , and it was for such employees that the decision of the last Government in regard to preference applied. Under the Public Service Act, a man cannot be in the temporary employment of the Government for longer than six months afc a time, but extensions of service are permitted, subject to notification in the Government Gazette. In addition to the temporary employee's, there are the exempt employees. They are made up of such persons as office-cleaners, the m e i employed by the Customs Department in Queensland supervising the sugar in dustry, the men employed by the Postmaster-General in making telephone tunnels, and others engaged on similar work. The number of exempt employees in 191® was 15,472, so that it decreased during the term of office of the last Government. As at 30th June last, the exempt employees of the Postmaster-General's Department numbered, 10,655, and the amount paid to them within the twelve months averaged only £ 5 9 per head, which is a little more than .£1 per week per annum, had they been employed full time. The exempt employee's in the Home Affairs Department numbered 3,595, and the amount paid to them averaged £ 7 7 each. The average amount paid to exempt employees in the Postmaster-General's Department in New South Wales was £ 6 0 , and in Victoria £70.  "" f in d "" themselves?",23
124,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"They are not all employed for the full space of a year. I am giving these averages merely to show that they are not men who were pitchforked into high salaried offices. I wish to make it clearfchafcfcheMinistry, when introducing the Government Preference Prohibition Bill , was merely introducing a political placard; fchafc we have only a bill-posting Ministry, a Ministry of political bill-stickers. The average amount received by exempt employees of the Postmaster-General in South Australia during the twelve months was £ 4 4 .  was as bad as MCKay's, if these are the amounts received per annum.",23
125,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I am giving the average amount received by exempt employees within a period of twelve months.,23
126,Mr GROOM,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,How many temporary only employees were there as at the 30th June ?,23
127,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"There were 1,437. The exempt employees and the temporary employees as at that date totalled 16,051.",23
128,Mr GROOM,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,That is the number of persons to whom preference will apply.,23
129,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Yes ; but 14,614 of that number received, on the average, only £66 within a year. They were paid so much a day; some of them being employed for the whole year, and others for shorter periods. Mr GROOM:-They received the standard rate of wages while employed.",24
130,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Yes .,24
131,Mr GROOM,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"-The vital thing to justify is the principle of preference, even zed though only one man may be affected.",24
132,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The time at my disposal does not permit of that now. Preference unionists has been denounced by the press of Autralia, and the Melbourne Age and Argus have, day after day, declaimed against the last Ministry for giving preferness ence. Let us see, however, what the prietors of those journals do themtors selves. There is in Melbourne Authorized News Agents' Association, and a Cash News Agents' Association. The members of the latter Association must pay cash every week for the newspapers that they receive, and advertisements sent in by them must be accompanied by the money to pay for them, the members of the Authorized Agents' Association, the other hand, settling their accounts, believe, at the end of each month.",24
133,Mr MATHEWS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"It is a close associaBallarat, tion.",24
134,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Yes . Trade unions have been denounced for charging membership fees of £ 5 , or £ 1 0 , but what has paid to become a member of the Authois rized News Agents' Association ? A agency business was sold at Footscray a system. little time ago, of which the ordinary good-will and stock was not worth more than £200, but £2,000 was obtained for it because it carried with it membership of the Authorized News Agents' Associatroduced tion, which is a close corporation, kept existence by the Age and the Arqus. Parliament. There are plenty of authorized agencies within a few miles of this House f o which £1,000 and £1,500 would have to be paid. The proprietors of the Age and Argus agree to deliver newspapers to authorized agents between 5 and 5.30 the morning, and will not deliver them the cash agents until a quarter to 7 and 7 o'clock. ClosefcofcheRichmond station, in Swan-street, there is an authorized agency which gets its papers a few minutes past 5, and in Wangaratta-streefc, less than 100 yards from the other agent, there is a cash news agency which cannot gefc its papers u n t i l a quarter to 7 or 7 o'clock.",24
135,Mr SHARPE,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Fro m the newspaper offices, or from the other agencies?",24
136,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Fro m the newspaper offices, I understand. The man who starts to sell newspapers two hours later than his competitor has no chance afc all . Then, again, this happens: If an authoriagent wants to get oufc of the business, and is willing to sell his agency for £1,000, the prospective purchaser cannot to conclude the bargain without reference to the Age and Argus offices, although the proprietors of the newspapers had nothing to do with the building up of the busiexcept by giving preference in the promanner I have described. The proprieof these journals, who object to the an working man getting preference, maintain a preference system in order to keep the news agents under their control. They are thus hypocritical, and frauds, shams, and humbugs, so far as preference is concerned.",24
137,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Corio) [12.0] - I have listened with attention to the speech on of the honourable member for Yarra. It I seemed to me mainly directed to serve the interests of the honourable member for being a sort of - electioneering effort. The honourable member for Yarra has endeavoured to make out a strong case in regard to the opposition of the Liberal party to the establishment of to be Wages Boards; but the outstanding fact that it was the Liberal party in Vicnews toria that introduced the Wages Board,24
138,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,They were compelled to do so.,24
139,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The system was in in Victoria when the Labour in party was not a great power in the State There can be no doubt, however, that Sir Alexander Peacock, in r introducing his factories legislation, received much assistance from Mr W . A . Trenwith, the leader of the Labour party the in the State Legislative Assembly at that in time, and a gentleman who has done more to for Labour than has any other man in Victoria. I do not think it necessary, however, to discuss such a question at this stage. I have not risen fco lecture any one, and have no desire to say anything offensive, but in reply fco the honourable member for Yarra, who described honourable members on this side as a "" l o t of bill-stickers,""-1 would say, more in sorrow than in anger, that the Opposition are a lot of gramophones. I rose to make two or three complaints which may be fitly brought before the Committee during the debate on the Budget. The first of these has reference to the provision of telephones. Even small works, in respect of which the Department would not be justified in calling, for tenders, cannot be promptly attended to. It appears to me that the Departmental staff which has to deal with these matters is not strong enough. People apply for telephones and get tired of waiting for their applications to be complied with . Many of them doubtless say, "" Well, if we cannot get these telephones before we become old and deaf we might as well do without them altogether,"" and consequently they often withdraw their applications. I hope that the Department will strengthen the staff required for the erection of small telephone lines, in respect of which it would not be justifiable to call for tenders. Having examined the Estimates carefully, I have come to the conclusion that we are spending an enormous sum of money on the Northern Territory. Provision is made for a long list of officials, and it seems strange that so manv should be required to administer the ""affairs of a territory in which there is a population of not more than about 2,000. There does not appear to be any business doing there, and I fail to understand - why so many officials should be necessary. At the same time, I thoroughly agree with the opinion expressed by the honourable member for Barrier last night, that the first step to be taken in order to develop the Territory is to extend the railway system tliere. If we do that I believe that private enterprise will speedily open up the country just as it has opened up other parts of Australia. I was told the other day that some of the officials in the Northern Territory started out on a motor trip and kept the car running u n t i l they had consumed all their petrol. They then waited until a fresh supply was brought aloug by a bullock team. That sort of thing will not do. Returning to the Postal Department, I desire to put before the Committee the view that the payment made in respect of allowance post offices is not sufficient, and I trust that the ister will see his wav clear to increase it .",24
140,Mr THOMAS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,That has been one of the greatest problems that Postmasters General have had to face.,25
141,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Perhaps so. These allowance postmasters and postmistresses provide their own buildings, and are tied down to their offices just as much as is a permanent official. Their hours are long, and they receive only a miserable pittance. The Department should recognise the good work done by them throughout the Commonwealth.",25
142,Mr SHARPE,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Will the honourable member assist the Postmaster-General to get more money ?,25
143,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Decidedly .,25
144,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,What about the charge of extravagance?,25
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,S u r e l y the honourable member would not say that it is extravagant to pay men and women a living wage.,25
146,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,The honourable member for Franklin would.,25
147,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I am not complaining of extravagance. In reply to the honourable member for Hindmarsh I would say that I do not regard the spending of money as being in itself an indication of extravagance. What we have to see is that we get value for our money, and I maintain that we get more than value for the money we pay to those in charge of allowance post-offices.",25
148,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Many of them are doing pioneer work.,25
149,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"M a n y of them are pioneers. Whilst dealing with the position of country officers, I would point out the position occupied by Electoral Registrars. We often complain that our rolls are in a bad state. Can we wonder that the Registrars neglect to keep them up to date, having regard to the miserable allowance which they receive? If we desire that our rolls shall be kept thoroughly up to date, then we must make a reasonable payment to those who are responsible for them. It should be possible for the Commonwealth to co-operate with the States in this matter. .",25
150,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,We should have a uniform roll for Commonwealth and States.,25
151,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I agree with the honourable member. By means of such co-operation we would save money, whilst at the same time the Electoral RegisM in - trars could be paid a more reasonable allowance.",25
152,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,We have that system in force in Tasmania.,26
153,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I think that it is a good one. The duplication of land tax valuers is another matter to which I desire to call attention. A number of valuers are employed by the States, whilst the Commonwealth has other men doing the same work in connection with the Federal land tax. The Commonwealth should confer with the States, with a view to effecting a saving in this direction. The honourable member for Barrier said last flight that we were not game to repeal the land tax. Let me tell him at once that I am game enough, but that, owing to the commitments ahead of us, we are, unfortunately, unable to repeal the tax. It would be financially impossible to do so.",26
154,Mr THOMAS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,But the Liberal party could transfer the burden to the poor by imposing more duties.,26
155,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"We would not do that. If the financial situation would permit of the 'tax being repealed, or at all events modified, I would certainly favour such a proposal; but for financial reasons at present we are unable to do anything of the kind. The honourable member made some reference also to the high cost of living. In my judgment, the Eederal land tax has had something to do with the increase. It cannot be denied that it has had something to do with the increase in rents. When a business man renting premises in one of our large cities is called upon to pay an increased rental he passes on that increase to his customers by increasing the price of his commodities, and it is in this way that the Federal land tax has assisted to increase the cost of living. That is a fact which cannot be escaped. The honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Grey have predicted that the Beef Trust will give rise to great trouble in Australia in a very short time. I have some little interest in the raising of sheep, but have not yet heard of any in j u r y that is likely to accrue to the people from the operations referred to. Having considered this matter, I have come to the conclusion that it would be impossible for any trust to obtain in Australia such a hold as the trusts have secured in America, seeing that our railway systems are owned by the States.",26
156,Mr SHARPE,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,How far is that fact going to affect the position ?,26
157,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The honourable member has a wide f u n d of wisdom and knowledge on which he is willing to draw at the shortest possible notice for the benefit of the House, and he surely knows that in America the railways are in the hands of the trusts. The position there that the trust owned railways will carry a man's stock to market at a very low rate, bufcfchafci f he is not prepared to accept the price there offered by the trusts they will charge three times as much to carry them back. As long as the railways are owned by the States we shall be able, I think, to prevent any trust obtaining a strong hold in Australia. Honourable members opposite sometimes h it us very hard, and in dealing with the trouble that is facing Australia i u the matter of trusts, I would like to remind them that not long ago a proclamation was issued by one of their members-and with the consent and approval of a number of the Labour party-whic h was but a thinl y veiled invitation to the rural workers of Australia to hold up harvesting operations throughout the Commonwealth if their demands were not accepted. Let honourable members realise what it would mean to hold up for one month the harvesting operations of Australia. If a few storms aud hot winds came along, more damage would be done than could be done by all the beef trusts that are likely to interfere with us for the next; twenty years, and yet these demands appeared to receive the approval of honourable members on the other side. In this morning's paper I read that the workers are demanding 15s. a day. The honourable member for Maribyrnong last night interjected that if we were to co-operate as producers we should bo able to pay the rural log without any difficulty.",26
158,Mr FENTON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Fiftee n shillings a day is asked only by the stack-builders-the most expert agricultural workers of all . ',26
159,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"The class of work was not specified. I am afraid the honourable member for Maribyrnong has not had much experience in the employment of rural workers. If he had, he would know that there is a l i m it to the wages the industry will stand. W it h the present price of rural products, it is impossible to pay as much as 15s. a day.",26
160,Mr FENTOJT,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,The ordinary far m labourer asks for 8s. 4d. a day.,26

162,Mr FENTON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,It is only a plaint; it has not been effectuated.,27
163,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"At any rate, those are the wages that have been demanded; and one member from the Opposition side of the House has issued a proclamation containing thinly-veiled advice to the men to strike. The Labour party pretend to be very much concerned in the interests of the consumers of Australia; but if we were stuck up with our harvesting operations for a fortnight, and got a few storms and hot winds, we should not have enough grain left to feed our own poople.",27

167,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"It is for the other side to take the case to the Arbitration Court, and they have not done so yet. We have no desire to go to the Court. Personally, I favour the Wages Board system for the rural industries. No one man, especially one having no knowledge of tbese tilings, can sit in the centre of Australia and fix wages and conditions for an industry for the whole continent. The honourable member for Yarra accused us of not favoring even Wages Boards, but on the hustings I proclaimed that I was in favour of them.",27
168,Mr ARTHUR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Av e you in favour of the Appeal Court over the Wages Boards?,27
169,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I have not gone into that question. It sounds as if it volved bringing lawyers into the matter, and I do not know that I should favour anything of that sort. There has been some talk of letting contracts for engines outside Australia, but it appears to me that the late Government, which decided to start, the east to west railway, made a mistake in not placing an order for a dozen engines straight away. They knew perfectly well that they would have to put a lot of men on the work who would be handicapped unless rolling-stock was - available. I speak a little feelingly in this connection, because they made the very same mistake in the case of the woollen mills at Geelong. They started bricklayers there by the hundred, without taking the precaution to be sure that they would have the steel girders for the roofing available at the time they would be required to be put on, and the result is that the present Government have had to dismiss a lot of the bricklayers. The walls are completed, but the roofing girders are not available yet, although some are coming along now. It might have been an oversight on the paj-t of the late Government.",27
170,Mr WEST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"No , they were going to borrow four engines from New South Wales, and they thought they would be able to get more. New engines do not run so well as do old engines on new rails.",27
171,Mr KENDELL,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I do not say that the omission was intentional; in both cases it was simply an oversight, but I do complain of the Opposition when they make charges against this side of making mistakes which really should be laid at their own door.",27

HonWhen the Budget was introduced last I asked that a novel practice should be adopted; and I had hoped that the Treasurer would see his way to open give us more information than hitherto. My remarks apply to all the Budgets that What is the Budget? It is practically a balance-sheet of the affairs of the country, and the press the distribute it throughout the Commonwealth and comment upon it according to Dewhatever view they take. But to the average man it conveys very little information. Only experts, members of Parand journalists who deal with financial matters, take any interest in it . Portions of it may be used for political purposes, but otherwise its only value is in its relation to the finances. I , therefore, ask honourable members opposite to assist me in getting the Treasurer to have attached to the next Budget-papers an appendix, showing the actual condition of the wealth of the country. During last year there was a tremendous amount of industry, trade, and employment in Australia. Whatever faults Australians may possess, they are a long way from being lazy. The Budget would be more popular if it contained a statement of the wealth earned during the previous year and the distribution of it . VVe should see that taxation is levied where it can be easily borne, and the information such as I suggest would be vastly important in considering the question of imposing taxation. Of course, it will be said that this has not been done before, but that is not a satisfactory answer. It is not the business of any private member to attempt to supply the information-it would be a difficult task that could be better undertaken by Ministers, who have in their offices any number of efficient and wellpaid officers, who could get the information for the benefit of the communitynevertheless I think there is one method by which we can arrive at an estimate of the wealth held in this country-that is, by taking the various estimates that come under review each year by probate officials. On the law of averages an estate changes hands every t h i r t y years, so that thirty times the value of the estates of deceased persons in one year should give us the value of the estates of the living, and by taking periods of five years we can get at the increase of wealth. On page 824 of volume II . of our Year-Bock we find the following figures, showing the value of the estates on which probate was granted during one period of five years. These are as follows : 1902 ... ... ... ^16,000,000 1903 ... ... ... j£ig,ooo,ooo 1904 ... ... ... ^'16,000,000 1905 ... ... ... ^17,000,000 1906 ... ... ... ^'18,000,000 These total £86,000,000. Dividing total by five, we arrive at the average of £17,000,000 for the five years. But it is well known that plate, pictures, works of art, and articles of that always escape coming under review by the Mr Archibald. probate authorities. I , therefore, make an allowance of £4,000,000 to cover these articles. Adding this to the £17,000,000, we arrive at an average of £21,000,000, representing the value of estates coming under the attention of probate officials in the Commonwealth. Multiplying that average by t h i r t y , we have £630,000,000 as the wealth of Australia five years ago. On page 840 of the latest Year-Book we have the following figures, representing the value of the estates of deceased persons : 1907 . . . ... ... ,£20,000,000 1908 . . . ... ... ^'20,000,000 1909 . . . ... ... ^'22,000,000 1910 . . . ... ... ^,'22,000,000 I9H ... ... ... j£2S,000,000 These give a total of £112,000,000, or an average of £22,000,000. Adding £4,000,000 in the same way we have £26,000,000, representing the average. This multiplied .by thirty gives us £780,000,000, representing the wealth of Australia, aud showing an increase in five years of £150,000,000.",29
187,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,That was during the three years of Labour Government.,30
188,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"It only sho.vs that when we get into statistics and get away from political humbug and trash, we can show the actual financial condition of the country. Budget-papers are not as easy to read as a novel.

We can arrive at that from the income tax this returns, but our State income tax returns are not of much value in this direction. However, let us see if they do throw any light on the matter. If my character figures are not reliable, it is not my f a u l t ; it is the f a u l t of the well-paid officers in the country, State and Federal. should be able to give the correct figures, and I maintain that the Treasurer aud the Ministry of the day should direct tlieir attention to giving us an exact statement of the wealth of the country.",30

192,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I have expressed the opinion that it would be of great assistance to honourable members and to the country to have, in an appendix to the Budget, information regarding the wealth actually earned by the community in the current financial year. If we had that information, it would enable us to judge as to the distribution of this wealth. I refer, of course, to the private wealth of the country. Afc page 828 of volume II . of the Cont monwealth Y ear-Book it is stated that the wealth coming under the review of the Victorian authorities who deal with the estates of deceased persons was, in 1902, £7,500,000 ; in 1903, £6,000,000 ; in 1904, £5,750,000 ; in 1905, £6,000,000 ; and £6,500,000. These sums total £31,000,000, and average £6,000,000 . recognised rule that by multiplying the value of the estates of deceased persons for one year by thirty , you can arrive at the value of the estates of the living. Mr. W. H . IRVINE - That is, t h i r t y years is regarded as the average duration of a generation.",31
193,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Yes . make the calculation more exact, it is necessary to average the value of the estates of deceased persons over a period of five years. In any one year the estates falling in may be exceptionally heavy, but in five year periods the results are marvellously uniform. On this basis the private wealth of Victoria for the period I have spoken of amounted £210,000,000. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Has member taken estates on which no probate or succession duty was paid 1",31
194,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I am not dealing with probate or succession duties. On some of the estates which come under review there may be next to no probate duty charged. In South Australia every estate exceeding £20 0 has to come under review, but the duty is small when the value of the estate is low, aud varies according to the nature of the bequests. On page 814 of volume VI . of the Year Book the value of the estates of deceased Tliey persons coming under review in Victoria is shown to be: For 1907, £6,750,000 ; for 1908, £7,000,000 ; for 1909, £6,000,000 ; for 1910, £7,500,000 ; and for 1911, £8,500,000 ; making the private wealth of the country within that period £240,000,000, an increase of £30,000,000 upon the private wealth for the previous five years. I could give similar figures with regard fco the other States, but to do so would be fco load the pages of Hansard un necessarily: The private wealth of the Commonwealth during the first period was, accordiug to the calculation I have made, £630,000,000, and during the second period £780,000,000. To ascertain the wealth of the working people, who never have anything to leave behind, it would be necessary fco obtain returns from societies aud from other sources.",31
195,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,What is the public wealth of Australia?,31
196,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I am not in terested i u that now; but, remembering in 1906, our public and private indebtedness, it would appear that the country is pretty It is a well well in pawn. The public wealth of Australia, that is, the value of the property of the Crown bere or the value of that which belongs to the people as a whole, is very little indeed. Our railways are public property, bufc they really belong to those who have advanced inoney on them. Bufc fco Mr WEST - Jusf c as the house upon which there is a heavy mortgagereally belongs to the mortgagee.",31
197,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Yes . My desire this afternoon is not so much to find fault with the Budget as to direct attention-to the need for financial relorm. I cannot be robbed of my fait h in the' in telligence of the great Australian public. to W it h in a decade or a generation the people will awaken to the urgency of these the honourable matters. The worse thing about our financial position is that we have practically no public property. If we had more public property, it would be a check on the private property. Germany is able at the present time to maintain large armaments, and to spend an enormous sum ou her navy, because she has a revenue from her railways of £4:0,000,000 a year. What revenue have \.e from our railways ? They simply pay wor'ring expenses and interest on the debt wlucii has been incurred in connection with them, with, perhaps, a small surplus now and again in one 01 two of the States, which goes into the Consolidated Revenue. Unfortunately, there is no desire on the part of our public men to lead the people out of the r u t into which they have got; but, until that is done, we can hardly better our financial position. It is an axiom that where wealth is, there power is. At the present time, wealth is in the hands of private individuals. I make no reflection in saying that - I merely state an economic fact. To counterbalance the private wealth, the public wealth should be increased, and the chief way of increasing it is' to make great public concerns like the railways revenue producing. VVe should pay off the debts on these big concerns.",31

201,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Honourable memhe bers opposite do not appear to realise the importance of these questions. The people sbould be advised by their public men the best course to pursue. When they take a more intelligent interest in the concerns of the country, they will not turn Conservatives to Parliament. There will always be differences of opinion tween the members of a section that is advancing rapidly and the members a section that is advancing not so fast; but there can be nothing in common tween a section that is advancing and section that is standing still. that when the next Budget is delivered the information for which I ask will given, and that I shall not be expected to get it for myself. It is easy to out the actual wealth of the composits munity in England, and to know where it goes. One of the of doing it is to take the income repage turns which have to be furnished to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, especially tion : those under schedule D , which applies to incomes earned by personal exertion. In one of Knibbs' official publications Savings we are told that it is not Known how adult rrnany people there are earning under trary, £200 per annum who are not income tion tax payers. That is not very satisfactory. It ought not to be very difficult to arrive at some conclusion in regard to that matter, but as regards those earning over £200 per annum, the total amount of income is £62,637,896, and 114,195 persons pay the tax. Assuming that the family in Australia consists of a man and wife and three children, we may conclude that there are half a million persons in Australia who are more or less interested in paying income tax. This would mean that, with a population of 4,800,000, only one head of a family in every ten pays income tax, or that practically only one-tenth of the people of Australia have an income of above £ 2 0 0 a year. I am only trying to get at broad approximate results, which is all that any Treasurer can do. I have no quarrel with the land of my adoption; t is a good country, and we are an inprodustrious people, but the fact remains that only one family in ten has a sufficiently large income to be called upon by the authorities to pay income tax. If one happens to attend one of those great where some distinguished man with a very large white waistcoat speaks, will hear remarks about our wonderf u l country, the prosperity of the people, and the Treasurer's references to the of tremendous amount of wealth in the Savings Banks of Australia. This gentleman will say, "" Look at the colossal wealth rethese people have, and what a wonderful condition they are in . "" Let us examine befor ourselves what condition they are really in . I do not envy the people who of have to compile these figures for the various State authorities, for I have a bestrong suspicion that they are compiled a for the purpose of deceiving the public. I hope I was surprised when I first started on this inquiry to find that I got on the be wrong track for a long while, and it took me some time and trouble to rework trace my steps. The value of the deof the people of Australia in the Savings Banks is £67,000,000, and the ways number of depositors is 1,736,004. On S55 of the official Year-Boole appears the following interesting informaIt must, of course, be borne in mind that Bank accounts are not restricted to the population, but that it is, on the cona very usual practice to open accounts in the names of children. Even so, the proporis a large one, amounting, in the case of the Commonwealth, to more than one-third, and rising in Victoria to nearly one-half, and in South Australia to more than one-half. A return that does not draw a distinction between the amounts deposited by chilthey dren and the amounts deposited by adults is not of much value to public men in arriving at the amount of wealth held by the working people. It would be in teresting to know if the amounts deout posited by children were included with the idea of showing the prosperity of the people, or to inflate the returns of the adults' deposits.

I do not know whether figuresUnder £20. Erom £20 to £50. No. Amouii'. No. 1,019,458 3,400,531 170,930 Those figures teach a very striking lesson. 190,700 persons have £41,000,000 deposited, and the total amount deposited by all the rest is only £26,000,000. I do not deny that the return shows a great amount of t h r if t on the part of the people of this continent, but it shows at the same time that a tremendous number of people in Australia have a very hard struggle to get a few pounds into the Savings Bank, and to keep them there once they have put them there. and the fact that only one wage-earner in ten pays income tax, are very striking. An examination of the Budget-papers - shows that many of the heavy Customs duties now levied are really revenue duties, but if it were proposed to remove them. I do not know that I should agree to do so, because I realise that we must have revenue to carry on the government of the country. I have shown that the private wealth of Australia is accumulating by leaps and bounds, although we are repeatedly told that employers are being - driven out of their wits by Wages Boards, Arbitration Courts, and other harassing and worrying legislation, so that they - scarcely know how to make ends meet. They are always telling us that the profits of industry in Australia are all going to the working people, but do the facts bear out that contention t Where does the the Government can do anything, but as call themselves a Liberal Government, and seem to be on very friendly terms with all the Liberal tribe in Australia, in the circumstances it would not"" do any harm if the Treasurer were to send a circular to these people asking them to keep the returns of the children's deposits separate from the returns of the The only information valuable to us in arriving at the wealth of the working classes is that giving the amount saved by grown-up persons.

They may claim that they have simply got their share of the good things that have been going, but the fact remains that while wages have gone up profits have gone up in a much greater proportion. That is the only conclusion that can be arrived at. The probate and taxation officials, whose Those facts, figures I am using, do not bother their heads about the true economic statistics over which I am worrying. But where did this money come from? It came, not from the moon, but from the industry of the Australian people. It is a proof of our industry, but it does not prove, to my mind, that the wealth of the community is equally distributed. Honourable members opposite will say, perhaps, that it is my desire that all wealth should be shared up amongst the community. There is, however, no such desire on my part, or on the part of the Labour party and those whom they represent.",32

205,Mr ARCHIBALD,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I say that in regard to that £150,000,000 relief from Customs and Excise duties should be obtaiued to the extent of at least £5,000,000. Setting aside all party considerations, and viewing this matter from the stand-point of justice and equity, is it right that people with very small incomes should be as heavily taxed as they are ? They have no savings to put by, and when they die they leave nothing. Is it fair that the clothing they wear, and everything they use, should be as heavily taxed as it is, when the wealthy "" crowd "" can well afford to pay a little more? When a proposal of the kind to which I referred is made, the cant that we usually hear is that it is wicked to tax a mau's capital. I have always been under the impression that before anything became capit.al it must have been first of all income. Income means capital when it is invested. This about "" taxing a man's c a p it a l "" in reply to such a proposal is mere word juggling. It may be very interesting to professors and others who have spent a lot of time in the study of political economy; but a man of average common sense can come to no other conclusion than that this income can and should be legitimately taxed. The sooner we move in thp.t direction the better. The road to it , no doubt, will prove a long oue. The fundamental object of a dual system of Government is to enable the "" trick "" to be played in the interests of the wealthy people of the country, to keep the taxation on the people, and to keep them down. Our opponents will not admit that that is so. They will tell us a lot about constitutional law from the days of the Pharaohs, with the object of proving that our Constitution is the best that we could have; but they hold that view merely because it suits the "" top dog "" From the stand-point of justice and equity, we should have some other method of taxation. We should have appended to the next Budget statement information of the character for which I have asked. No one will say that the in formation which the Budget-papers now supply sbould not be given. It is certainly valuable, but it is not the sort of information that the man who is toiling in the workshop, the mine, or the factorydesires. The workers look to tlieir representatives in Parliament to deal with questions of expenditure and revenue, aud to do the best we can in the interests of the whole community; but they would be in terested in a return showing where thewealth earned during the preceding twelvemonths had gone. Taking the amount, shown by Knibbs to have been earned in, the factories of the Commonwealth last year, and allowing £ 1 0 0 a year for every man employed, £ 5 0 a year for every woman, and 5s. per week for each of the lads and lasses employed in these factories, we find that the whole amount is swallowed up, and that there is absolutely no margin. In the face of these facts, honourable members musfc recognise that we need fco be watchful over expenditure, but that we require, also, fco exercise the power of the House in such a direction that taxation shall be imposed on those besfc able to bear it, and removed from those least able to bear it . I believe that cant the Victorian Government Statist claims that there are more properties ranging in value from £2,000 to £3,000 in this State than there are in any otlier State in the Commonwealth. I hope that his claim is correct. We ought to have supplied with the Budget-papers, not only figures dealing with the value of the estates of deceased persons, but returns showing the number of estates in the Commonwealth ranging in value from £2,000 to £3,000. One of the besfc indications of the prosperity of a country is the fact that tlieie is constant, employment available for the vvorking'section of the community, and the number of small property-owners existing there is also another very important indication of its prosperity or otherwise. Small property-owners are the backbone of a country. They are the peopie who have exercised t h r if t . They are not likely to trouble the Government for an old-age pension, or for any assistance, and we want fco know whether that section of the comfnunity is increasing or decreasing in number. During the last referenda campaign, a friend of mine, who was very auxious to defeat the Labour Government's proposals, asked me whether I was in favour of a scheme that would take from me my property.

The amount realized from protailed bate duties is considered by many to afford a reliable indication of the wealth of community, and I believe that Mr Coghlan, as well as other controvercentage sialists, have advanced that view. But period. when Mr Knibbs was before the Tasmanian Customs Leakage Commission declined to take the amount received from probate duties as a reliable basis for mating the private wealth of the country.

232,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I candidly a d m it that I view the Budget with a certain amount of concern. There should have been more investigation into the construction of public works, in order to see whether the increased expenditure is justified. If we compare the expendiown ture or the estimated expenditure of last year with the proposed increased expenditure this year, we see an increase, from either point of view, of from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000. The most serious part of the expenditure is that i u connection w it b defence. There have been some valuable articles in the Melbourne daily newspapers in referencefcoCommonwealth finances, and the Age, particularly, has concentrated its attention on the increased defence expenditure as being, in the opinion of that journal, too heavy a country to burden for the population of Australia to carry. I am an enthusiastic believer in compulsory training. On the subject of defence we have had two valuable reports presented by two eminent officers from G-reab Britain , namely, Lord K it chener and Admiral Henderson. W© musfc take expert advice if we are to have anything like a homogeneous and effective affairs uaval and military defence force. know, however, on the authority of the Prime Minister, and of the figures themselves, that, although the cost of Lord Kitchener's scheme was put at £1,800,000, the expenditure has now reached about £3,000,000. This is owing to a number of new departures which were not conthat templated by Lord Kitchener, bufc which were undertaken chiefly by the late Gotribute vernment, including the Militar y College, the Clothing - Factory, the Harness Factory, and so forth . The cost administration has also increased beyond the figure originally contemplated. The have done scheme of Lord Kitchener was in itself a heavy toll, but, when we supermates, impose the naval expenditure now conshould be tackled. templated, the figures assume staggering proportions. Admiral Henderson's scheme, if it is carried into effect, will run the country into an expenditure of over wealth £4,000,000 a year; in fact, the average for twenty years for the bare scheme over £3,500,000 odd. We may take it bring people to our shores. for granted that the expenditure will proportionately increased if Lord - K it - altogether. chener's scheme be any criterion, so thab we may look forward to an expenditure of £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 per annum for the whole scheme of defence, military and naval. At present the expenditure is put down at £5,750,000, but it will not be long before that will be increased. We cannot repudiate those schemes, but I contend that it was standing never contemplated that Australia should carry this enormous burdeu without some increase in population, which the Federal Parliament has made no effort bring about. The population in was 4,323,000, and in 1912 it was expenditure 4,733,000. an increase of about 309,000, or 7 per cent. Our defence expenditure, tion. on the other hand, jumped £1,000,000 in 1909, at the time when the new naval scheme came into operation, of and a few months before Lord K it chener's report, to £5,700,000 in 1912-13, It will be seen, therefore, that ths expenjustify diture has increased five and a half the land. times, as against an increase in population of less than 10 per cent. Kitchener, in paragraph 10 of his report, saidThe danger of want of population and consequent ineffective occupation in many parts of the country is, in my opinion, a most serious existing condition in Australia, as it may greatly imperil the stability of the present state of in the Commonwealth. I feel, however, that this is so well known and recognised that We I need not emphasize it . further. Lord Kitchener clearly contemplated that there would be a large increase in population in Australia, and that it would be left to the genius of the statesmanship of the Conunonwealth to see there was an increase in population, in order that the people could disthe enormous burden of taxation his scheme of defence would put upon them. Our present problem is to of consider how we can increase the population and people the empty spaces. We 0 very little, even with the increase of £50,000 on the Estito tackle the matter as it We have lef t the question of immigration to the States; they have done something, and we must give them credit for it ; but the Commonhas the duty cast on it to control immigration to this continent, and as a is Commonwealth we have done little to We must be deal with the question in a new light",36

235,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"But we have power to help the States, and have done nothing. Mr LAI RD SMITH - How much does it cost the State of Victoria to get each i m migrant ?",37
236,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"As a matter of fact, those who have studied the question say that if each immigrant costs £100 he is cheap at the price.",38
237,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Some one said that it was £800.,38
238,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"That must have been imagination, because the passage! out does not cost more than a few pounds. Altogether, I do not suppose each immigrant costs the State of Victoria more than £20. I ' have dealt with this question previously; but I wish to ' show how it is possible for this Parliament, in coujunction with the States, to increase the number of people on the soil in a very short time. To do this I must go back to the old question of the distribution of the Murray River waters. After all our great efforts at immigration we have only 250,000 acres under intense cultivation, and some of that land is used for grazing purposes; but by the outlay of £2,500,000 we could at once make available water to irrigate 1,400,000 acres. Here is a direction in which the Commonwealth might assist the States, in order to store this water, and thus help to increase the population-the only possible way in which we can provide the revenue necessary to carry out these two great defence schemes and bring the necessary population to Australia to share with us the burden of the taxation necessary. We know that after the FrancoPrussian war the enormous indemnity demanded by Germany was paid by the peasants of France. We must look first to the primary production from the soil if we are to stand the enormous taxation that will be imposed upon us as a. people for defence purposes.  your figures from?",38
239,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,I am quoting from the latest reports of the joint Commission of Engineers appointed to investigate the question of storing the Murray River waters.,38
240,Sir ROBERT BEST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Hav e we the power to undertake that work?,38
241,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Yes , in conjunction with the States. I am sure the States will not refuse any assistance from the Commonwealth.",38
242,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Of course not; if we like to pay for the work, the States will take the money.",38
243,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"What we have to consider is how far it may be necessary to postpone giving effect in its entirety to the Henderson scheme, say for twelve months, so that we may look about for a speedy method of settling people on the land, in order to increase the population and lessen the individual burden of taxation, so that the scheme will not fall on Australia with such a crushing blow. Lord Kitchener, in paragraph 11 of hia report, says1 would also mention lhat railway construction has, while developing the country, resulted in lines that would appear to be more favourable to an enemy invading Australia than to the defence of the country. Different gauges in most of (he States isolate each system, and the want of systematic interior connection makes the present lines running inland of little use for defence, though possibly of considerable value to an enemy who would have temporary command of the sea. That is a very significant statement from an eminent soldier, as well as a statesman of world-wide experience in these questions. It has also a very potential significance to the whole production and transport of Australia. We know by investigations made by the Fruit Commission that the most serious inconvenience and loss and destruction of valuable fruit are brought about through the want of uniformity in the railway systems. On this question tliere.should be no difference .of opinion in the Committee. There should be absolute unanimity on the point of converting the different railway gauges to a system of uniformity, not, only for defence purposes, but in particular for the carriage of perishable products.",38
244,Mr WEST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,What gauge do you favour ? get Mr SAMPSON - That is not the question.,38
245,Mr WEST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,That is the trouble.,38
246,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"In - this matter we must depend on expert advice, and we are fortunate in having that advice in a report issued in 1912. Whatever may be the ultimate gauge for Australia, I have uo hesitation in saying that it will be a great mistake to adopt the 4-ir,. 8-J-in. gauge. I do not say this from the standpoint of a Victorian. The tendency of engineering effort in all the new countries of the world is to have a wider gauge. It means saving in haulage; the wider gauge is more economic and satisfactory for transport purposes. We can quite understand why they retain the 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge in the TJnited States of America, where tliere are hundreds of thousands of miles of railway, and they could not convert them without an enormous extory. pense; but the late Mr Harriman, the greatest authority on railway construcfollowing tion in the United States of America, with the largest interest in railway shares in those States, said that if he This could have his way, and the railways had fco be built over again, he would not a 5-ft. 3-in. gauge; he would, probably, have adopted a 6-feefc gauge.",38
247,Mr WEST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,The Victorian people are the only people who favour the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge.,39
248,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"This is not the place for an argument, in connection with the gauge. What wo want is uniformity. The report presented last year shows that it will cost £37,000,000 to convert all railways in Australia to the 4-ft. 8£-in. gauge,"" ancl £51,000,000 to convert them to the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and' that to vert the main lines to the 4-ft.. 8-J-in. gauge would cost about £12,000,000. It the country. seems to ine that the time has arrived when we should press for a settlement of this important question. In the aggregate, the States are building hundreds of miles of railway each year, which increase the ultimate cost of bringing about uniformity. The longer we delay this matter the greater will be the loss the taxpayers of Australia. Every year that is lost means an expenditure of milbe lions of money over the present cost of bringing about the conversion. If had taken the matter in hand in 1898, markets of Australia. when it was first proposed, wo would prograzier bably have converted all the lines at quarter or n fifth of what it will ulticatfcle mately cost.",39
249,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"If it is a expenditure, you would not care what distance. gauge is adopted.",39
250,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"I do not think the whole of the cost should be made a ral expenditure. The States will have tralia? certain advantages by having a uniform system throughout the Commonwealth. vide However, we should at once get into munication with the States, and the monwealth Parliament should, if necescreation saiy, be prepared to use some of its credit as a Commonwealth to provide the necessary money to have all new railways built in the States made on a uniform gauge, and as speedily as possible have the existing lines converted to that gauge. This brings me to the Northern TerriI n 1912 the expenditure on the Northern Territory was £363,000; in the year it increased to £393,000; and and this year we propose to expend £531,000-a n increase of about £140,000. cannot go on. There is no production taking place; there is no return. So far have there has been no attempt to lay down any bedrock or comprehensive policy for the Northern Territory. I believe it is possible to develop that portion of Australia, but it will need a special class of production, and special treatment from Parliament. It will not be opened up by a spasmodic attempt to establish a steam laundry or experimental farms, or to run a railway where no one can see there is the to bo any immediate advantage gained. I do not think any responsible Minister can tell us where the £400,000 proposed conto be spent on the Katherine Biver railway is going to develop any portion of",39
251,Mr WEST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,It is part of a big scheme.,39
252,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"Yes ; but when that big scheme of £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 is will carried out, I should like to know how much nearer we shall be to the development of that country. If we had a railto way through the centre of Australia, no one can say how much nearer we shall to the development of the country. Is it expected that cattle are to be taken by we trains from the north to the southern A Queensland told mefcheother day that it cost a him 7s. or 8s. per head to drove his to Bourke, a distance of 400 miles, and £2 per head to send them by rail Eederal from Bourke to Sydney, a similar How, then, would it bo possible to send cattle by rail from the Barklay Tablelands or the Victoria EedeRiver to the southern markets of AusBesides, tliere is sufficient land in the temperate paris of Australia to profor the grazing of all the cattle that comare needed to supply ns with meat. The ComTerritory can be developed only by the of an export trade, and it is the for that. What is needed is the establishment of water conservation and intense cultivation, and the introduction of artificial grasses as in Gippsland, the Hunter River, and Richmond River districts, and parts of Queensland. The rainfall of the Northern Territory ranges from 60 to 30 inches a year, but it falls within three or four months, and therefore will not allow successful cultivation under natural conditions. A rainfall of 20 inches, coming in the winter and spring, is worth more in the temperate parts of Australia than a rainfall of 40 or 45 inches in the Northern Territory. need a report on the Territory by a thoroughly competent engineer who has had experience of tropical agriculture. If we had the advice of a man like Mr . Elwood Mead we could obtain a proper classification of the land suitable for agriculture, and we should have a report on which to base our development policy. Having received a comprehensive report, we could formulate a policy of construction, commence the making of railways for the development of the Territory itself, not for the fanciful scheme of linking up the - northern and southern portions of the continent. Unless the Territory is developed it will cost the Commonwealth a staggering amount, and we are not justified in spending a shilling on railway construction there until we have had a report from a capable engineer as to how our money could be best laid out. visited the Northern Territory, and know that there are to be found there perennial rivers affording opportunity for the storage of water in large quantities. very competent agriculturist going there from this part of Australia might easily find himself at sea for a long time, but my knowledge of agriculture and land leads me to think that adjacent to the rivers is land suitable for agriculture, and some of it capable of being irrigated to advantage. We could also grow cotton and rice.",39
253,Mr THOMAS,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Is the honourable member's solution of the difficulty the establishment of irrigation farms?,40
254,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"My solution is closer - settlement and intense cultivation, following on water conservation.",40
255,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,Wh v cannot Victoria retain her population ? twelve months Victoria has increased her population at a greater rate proportionately than any of the other States. The increase has been largely due to irrigation.,40
256,Mr WEST,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,We must give communication.,40
257,Mr SAMPSON,WIRELE SS STATI ON ATKING,"There is communication by rail for a distance of 145 miles in the Northern Territory. What is necessary there is the establishment of an export trade in frozen meat and dairy produce. The jute, cotton, rice, and We other tropical productions that might be grown there would only suffice for local consumption for many years to come. The dairying industry might be established by the introduction of artificial grasses. The expenditure of £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 in fostering development will give some result, and should make the country self-supporting. If we spend money on making a transcontinental line before we have .developed the Terriand tory we shall only increase the Commonwealth burdens. Not another pound should be spent on the Territory u n t i l it has been full y investigated by ah independent expert, and we are in a position to determine on the best evidence obtainable how to grapple with the great problem that confronts us. Immigration will have to be encouraged also for the Northern Territory. It is not likely that many persons will leave I have the temperate parts of Australia to settle in the tropical north. Only those will do that who see in the change a reasonable opportunity of improving their posiA tion. We must give freehold tenure to cultivators who go there. The Territory will never be closely settled on a leasehold tenure. It seems to me, too, that the Government will have to look beyond the British Islands for population for the Territory, and that inquiries should be made to ascertain the possibility' of getting settlers from Scandinavia, Germany, Holland, and other countries of northern Europe. There is also the possibility of making investigations into the lemon and orange growing industry, as carried on in Sicily and Italv . Mr Mead, the Chairman of the Water Supply Commission of Victoria. si,id that a fine lot of people nould be found in Northern It a l y if we went about obtaining them in a proper way. The investigations of the Fruit Commission showed that we were importing tens of thousands of pounds' worth of lemons and oranges every year from Sicily, Lisbon, and other places. We have country equal to that in any part of the world for the growth of those products, and a large body of expert growers could be brought oufc to enter into the industry here. This would help to increase our production, and also furnish a valuable object lesson to the fruit growers of Australia generally. The only way to obtain a proper investigation of the possibilities of getting people from European countries is by the Commonwealth undertaking the responsibility. I enter my protest against the tremendous expenditure on our defence scheme, and the immense unproductive expenditure on the Northern Territory and the Oodnadatta railway, without any associated attempt on the part of the Government to initiate a scheme of immigration to increase our population in as far as possible a similar ratio.
