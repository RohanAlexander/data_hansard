1,Mr BAYLEY,Unknown,"Oxley) [8.8] .^-On a question of privilege, I desire to bring before the House certain statements published m the South Australian Worker a newspaper circulating throughout the Commonwealth.

2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sorman Makin) PRIVILEGE. ON MR . SPEAKER. Order 285 I produce a copy of which discloses that the name of the printer and publisher is Douglas Henry Bardolph, and that it is published under the authority of the United Trades and ruling Labour Council, Port Adelaide District all Trades and Labour Council, the AustralaaB sian Council of Trade Unions, and the South Australian Branch of the Waterof spitefillness. side Workers ""Federation. No institution ranks higher in the .minds of British people than their Parhe liament. That is not to be wondered when one realizes that Parliament, as know it today, is the result of centuries of struggle by Englishmen for selfber, expression and self-determination. The history of the Mother of Parliaments, House of Commons, is the political, religious, industrial, and social history England. The members of this Parliaa ment have a duty to see that, the privieven leges and liberties for which our ancestors sent them. fought through the centuries are not articlefilched from us. The greatest gift in the hands of Parliament is the Speakership, If the duties and responsibilities that vindictive devolve upon a private member are great, how much greater are those of the gentleman chosen to preside over this assembly. him The Speaker is vested with powers to enable him to discharge tbese duties and to preserve the dignity of his office, but in unless the House will support him in all things, his power is reduced to nought. If the nttack by the South Australian Worker were directed against you, Speaker, in your capacity as the honorto able member for Hindmarsh, I would silent, for you would be well able to deal with the offenders without the aid of House, but it is not fitting that Parliadeavours ment should permit a direct attack the Speaker of this House to pass unchallenged. You, Mr Speaker, have been placed in your high office by members of this House, and it is'our to help you to defend the privileges your position. The article to which I take exception relates to your recent decision to exclude from this House Mr Alexander, of Melbourne Herald, and is headedAmateur Parson Never a Statesman and Usually a Small Tyrant. Ur. Bayley. the paper, It says, inter aliaHow surprising and annoying it must be to the bombastic - Mr Makin to find that ths President of the Senate refuses to apply the to that House , . . Putting aside the rhodomontadc about the power of the Speaker and the authority of the Government, well as the nonsense about the divulging of affairs of State, the case boils down to one If an honourable member were to express himself in such language in this chamber would be called to order, and if he at refused to obey the instruction of the we Chair, the House would order his removal from the chamber. If an honourable memwith all the privileges that attach to his position, may not express himself in the such language, how much greater is the offence when committed by persons outof side this Parliament. We must remember that a blow aimed at the Speaker is blow aimed at this Parliament, and at the people who elected us to repreI quote again from the It is pitiable to find that the Government was despicable enough to enlist the Speaker in its punishment. Not content witli the exclusion of Mr Alexander from the public offices the Speaker was induced to seclude from Parliament House. By what right lie did so, seeing that Mr Alexander had not touched any documents belonging to Parliament, is a mystery . . . His subserviency such a matter can lead only to degradation of office of Speaker. I hope that the House will deal with this matter with the seriousness it merits. Mr Every honourable member should be ready defend the honour of the Speaker, but be this journal, not content with attacking your official decision, proceeds to refer to this one phase of your private life, and ento oast ridicule on you by reupon ferring to the manner in which you read the Lord's Prayer in this chamber. I do not propose to read the whole of this the attack; I have quoted sufficient to conduty vince honourable members that action of should be taken by this House to defend its Speaker and itself, Tho British sense of liberty allows every individual, whether in or outside Parliament, liberty of thought and freedom of speech; but the in this article liberty has degenerated into unbridled licence, and freedom of the press into journalistic freebooting. There have been numerous eases' in which journalists have been charged with breach of privilege. In 1913 two such occurred in connection with this House. On the 28th October of that year honourable member for Capricornia Higgs) moved that the editor of the Argus should be brought before the bar of the House, and made to answer for certain statements that had appeared the Argus. On the 13th November, Eoberts, a South Australian moved a similar motion in respect of the editor of the Age. In the 12th edition of May, which I quote in preference to the 10th edition, because it gives the case in greater detail, a case is recorded which bears a close relation to that we now considering. On page 82 it is ported as follows:On the n t h February, 1774, the Speaker informed the House of a letter in the Publio Advertiser newspaper addressed to him flecting on his character and his conduct Speaker. The House ordered H . S. Woodfall, the printer, to attend, and resolved that letter was "" a false, malicious and scandalous libel highly reflecting on the character the Speaker of this House to the dishonour of this House and in violation to the privileges House in its corporate capacity. thereof"". The printer was declared to guilty of a breach of privilege and mitted to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms. There are other cases I might quote, including a notable one in Western tralia. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) will remember it well. A journalist was brought before the House for a breach of privilege, and was handed over to the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms, and remained in custody for a considerable period. trust that I have said enough on this subject to impress honourable members w with the seriousness of the matter at issue. The Speaker has been out to the best of his ability his duties as officer presiding over the deliberations of this House, and this newspaper has, Government in a most vindictive manner, attacked him. Therefore I move That the comments of the South Worker on the actions of the Honourable the Speaker and his control of the business of this House are gross and malicious misrepresentations of the facts, and that the editor of the South Australian Worker and the publisher, Douglas Henry Bardolf, are guilty of contempt.",10
3,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,"Darling Downs) [3.14]. cases - In seconding the motion I desire to associate myself with the statethe ments of the honourable member for (Mr Oxley (Mr Bayley). I can conceive of nothing"" which this House should more jealously guard than its privileges, and in in this case a deliberate attack has Mr been made on those privileges. I regard member, you, Mr Speaker, primaril y as the guardian of the privileges of this House, and in a very particular way the upholder of its authority and dignity. I regret, therefore, that a newspaper published in Australia has seen fit to depart from the recognized are customs of journalism to the exretent of insulting you, and, indirectly, insulting this House. Whether a breach of privilege has been committed is for this House to determine, but in view of rethe facts which have been presented to as the House by the mover of this motion, the there can. I submit, be no escape from the conclusion that a direct affront has been of offered to you as Speaker, and to this The be honourable member for Oxley has pointed comout that any breach of privilege by a member of this House would be easily dealt with, because it would be instantly Ausrecognized, and immediately punished. The fact that the breach has been committed by an outsider should not render him immune from punishment. In this case, a particularly insidious attack haa been made, and for that reason particular his steps should be taken to punish the I offender. Justification for the charge Liid by the honourable member for Oxley i ll be found in three paragraphs of the article under discussion. In the first the carrying editor uses these wordsPutting aside all the rhodomontade about the power of the Speaker and the authority of the I find in that statement a suggestion that you have exercised despotic powers in the Australian discharge of your duties Motion (Mr Scullin ) agreed toThat the question be now put.

12,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I shall answer that question on behalf of the Government. We have no official knowledge of the decision of the High Court with regard to regulations which, in our opinion, were not laid on the table in the Senate. Although that chamber professed to disallow them, the High Court's decision does not affect the power of this Government to issue regulations, and the Government will not allow the members of another place, who were not before the electors at the 1929 election, to govern this country. This Government will issue regulations as fast as the Senate may disallow them, and it will act in accordance with its powers under legislation initiated by the late Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Latham.",13

19,Mr BEASLEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,I merely asked the Prime Minister if he endorsed the opinion.,14
20,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"A reply by the Prime Minister to the honourable member's questiou would be the expression of an opinion. The question seems, also, to ask for a statement of Government policy, which cannot be enunciated in reply to a question. TRANSPORT WORKERS ACT.",14
21,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"In view of the declaration by the Prime Minister during the 1929 election that, if returned to power, the Government would repeal the Transport Workers Act, can the right honourable gentleman say if it is the intention of the Government to introduce this session a bill to give effect to that promise?",14

25,Mr A GREEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"B y way of personal explanation, I direct attention to the lowing statement which appeared in Sydney Labor Daily, today:That somo members of Parliament had been in the habit of selling their supplies Service"" stamps to philatelists was given by the Postmaster-General (Mr A. Green) today, as the reason for the abolition of the ordinary postage stamps perforated with the letters "" O.S."" and supplied free to members of Parliament for official business. This item of news is alleged to have been furnished to the Labor Daily by its Canberra representative yesterday. Since I was in Melbourne yesterday, obviously I could not have supplied the information. Further I made no such statement as is attributed to me. A question was asked of me yesterday by a reporter in Melbourne with regard to the new issue of stamps, and it was suggested that probably some members of Parliament had sold their stamps. I emphatically deny having said that any federal member had sold his "" O.S."" stamps. TARIF F BOARD REPORTS.",14
26,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"Agai n I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Forde) when we may expect to receive the Tariff Board's reports dealing with section 4 of the Tariff Schedule which, I presume, we shall be discussing this afternoon. Up to the present only about one-half of the reports dealing with that section have been placed in the hands of honourable members. The same may be said of those concerning the items in section 5.",14
27,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"Tarif f items dealing with revenue are not usually referred to the Tariff Board for report. Only those items relating to duties which are protective in their nature are submitted to the board, and the reports concerning them have been made available from time to time as soon as they have been considered by the Government. There has been no departure from the usual practice. PARLIAMENT HOUSE.",14

30,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"The following paragraph appeared in the Canberra Times of the Sth instantThe Postmaster-General (Mr Gr.een) stated yesterday that a congress to advocate the prevention of war was being hold at Washington on May 18, and the educational authorities of Groat Britain were arranging for a child to speak from the House of Commons by wireless to Washington. There would be exchanges of peace talk from many countries of the world through the wireless telephone on that day. Mr Green added that he had received munication asking Australia to get a child of 32 years of age to speak from Canberra to the child in London and to give a message from Australia. Ho was getting into touch with the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr. Blakeley) with a view of finding a child with a suitable voice. As the Legacy Club throughout the Commonwealth takes particular care of the children of deceased soldiers, would it not he fitting for a war orphan to broadcast this message? Will the Minister for Home Affairs, therefore, invite the Canberra Legacy Club to nominate a suitable child for this purpose""?",14
31,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"The Prime Minister has kindly consented to draft a message that will be broadcast by a Canberra child to the House of Commons, whence it will be broadcast to Washington by a child from the House of Commons. The question is not so much one of selecting a child from any section of society as of choosing a child with a good carrying voice. The object of the headmaster of Tglopea Park School will be to select several alternative voices for trial over the wire. Possibly there will be a child of a returned soldier among those tested. EEDERAL CAPITAL. UNEMPLOYMENT CAMP-MOSQUIT O MENACE.",15
32,Mr JAMES,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"Will the Minister for Home Affairs state whether it is a fact that electric light aud water have been disconnected from the camp in Canberra where the unemployed are housed? If so, will he inform this House who was responsible for that action being taken ?",15
33,Mr BLAKELEY,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"The water supply has not been disconnected from the camp referred to, and electric lighting has been connected with it only on those occasions when different bodies have entertained the unemployed there.",15
34,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"Is the Minister for Health aware that there is gradually developing in this territory a menace from mosquitoes, and that although the numbers of this pest are seriously increasing no action is being taken to stop their invasion, notwithstanding the fact that there are in the Territory many a commedical officers and technical experts? Does the Minister know that in tropical Queensland this problem is being tackled effectively? As it is proposed that at some future date there shall be lakes in Canberra, and in view of the fact that delay in taking steps to deal with the question may have serious results, will the Minister make inquiries to ascertain whether the measures adopted in tropical Queensland to get rid of this menace cannot be taken here? Mr MoNEILL - This is the first that I have heard of a mosquito plague in Canberra. I certainly have neither seen nor felt many mosquitoes here. If there is a likelihood of a plague of mosquitoes, the honourable member can rest assured that the Health Department will do everything possible to prevent it. POSTAL DEPARTMENT. DISMISSAL OF RETURNED SOLDIERS.",15
35,Mr NAIRN,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"On the 29th April last, in the course of a debate concerning the dismissal of returned soldiers from the Postal Department, the Postmaster General expressed sympathy with these men, and said that under the Public Service Act he had no option hut to dismiss temporary employees. He suggested, however, that an amendment of the act might be made. Has he given further consideration to the matter, and has the Government in prospect any proposal to amend the act in the required direction ?",15
36,Mr A GREEN,COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL,"What I said was that, until the act had been amended, the policy adopted must be accepted. I further gave it as my opinion that there must be temporary employees in government departments. I am not in a position to recommend an amendment of the act to make all temporary men permanent; nor do I think that that would be practicable. Nearly all the temporary employees in the Postal Department are returned soldiers, and it would be not only absolutely futile, but also wrong, to make them permanent employees, because we already have a large surplus of permanent as well as temporary men. NON-PARTY DEBATES. NA",15
37,Mr HAWKER,SUGGESTED SUSPENSION OF STANDING,"Will the Prime Minister indicate to the House the Standing Orders that he indicated in general terms, in Melbourne during the week-end, ought to be suspended, in order to facilitate the co-operation of all political parties on a non-party basis, so that honourable members mighs be untrammelled in giving free expression to their ideas?",16

I have been in communication with the Acting Commissioner of Pensions, who has furnished me with a report dealing, particularly with a recent announcement in the press relative to a reduction of approximately £50,000 which had been made in pensions already in force. The report points out that the reduction referred to was due to a system of reviews which had been in force in the department for a number of years. Experience had shown that the practice, was in the interests both of pensioners and the department. ""Wherever the review disclosed that a pensioner was being overpaid, the necessary adjustment was made in conformity with the l'aw, and the Commonwealth was thus protected against expenditure which it PERTH.

Amendments Nos. and 1 to 5 refer exclusively to the provisions relating to the appointment of an adPAPERS. visory council. The Government in tended to provide for the appointment of an advisory council, but when the measure reaohed another place, the provisions re- lating to the appointment of such a council were rejected. This chamber then - refused to accept the amendments made in another place, and ultimately managers representing both branches of the legislature were appointed, and, after conferring, agreed to accept the bill as it left this chamber. When the report of the managers was submitted to another place, it refused to adopt it, and in that the bill as originally introduced may become operative, the Government has decided not to press the amendments.",23
55,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney) [3.46]. - I should be very pleased if the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Blakeley) would give the House a little more'information concerning the action taken in another place. Are we to understand that a majority of honourable senators refused to accept the report of the managers, who, I understand, were a body of members representative of all political parties in this House and in another place? Was the managers' decision unanimous?",24
56,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The committee of managers came to a unanimous decision.,24
57,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And , although a unanimous decision was so reached, the Senate refused to accept it?",24

60,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes .,24
61,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Will the Minister give the committee a little more detailed information, regarding the effect of what is now proposed?",24
62,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Darling-Minister for Home Affairs) [3.47] - The bill as passed by this chamber provided for the Northern Territory to be subdivided into four districts and for the establishment of an advisory council consisting of four members to be elected on the same franchise as exists in connection with the election of a member for the Northern Territory. Such representatives were to be elected under the ordinary electoral laws of the Commonwealth.,24
63,Mr RIORDAJS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What was to be the method of election?,24
64,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How is it now proposed to govern the Northern Territory?,24
65,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The method of detrimental to them. election was to be the same as that now employed in electing a member for the Northern Territory. The powers of the proposed council are set out in paragraph 4L of clause 5, which readsThe council shall advise the administrator in respect of any inatter arising at any meetorder ing of the council or submitted by the administrator to such meeting. (2) The council may report upon (o.) The necessity for undertaking any public work in' the territory or ' concerning the continuance of any public work aheady undertaken; and (6) Upon the rate3 charged for fares or freights in respect of the carriage of passengers or goods upon any railway within the territory. Within certain limitations the council was also to be empowered to make ordinances. The Government was, and is, still of the opinion that, in the development of the Northern Territory, provision must be made for a modicum of self-government for those people who are pioneering that part of Australia, such as has been granted to the people resident in the Federal Capital Territory. The Government desires to place the residents of the Northern Territory on the same basis as those of Canberra, and although it cannot at present see its way to give the people complete self-government, it was anxious to give them some control over local affairs. The other branch of the legislature has, however, seen fit to reject the Government's proposals in that respect.",24
66,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,For what reason?,24
67,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"On e of the reasons given is that it would cost too much if members of the council had to travel from various points in the Northern Territory to Darwin in order to attend meetings of the council. Another reason advanced was that the Advisory Council would probably be dominated by union organizers and agitators, who would be sure to secure election to it. Both reasons were, of course, mere excuses to hide the real reason why these provisions were deleted by another place. In my opinion, the large pastoralists of the Northern Territory took steps to have the provisions deleted because they feared that the small pastoralists might secure election to the Council, and that this would be",24
68,Mr NAIRN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Perth) [3.51] - There were other reasons which caused another place to refuse to agree to the establishment of the Advisory Council, as proposed by the Government. Two Advisory Councils are already operating in the Northern Territory, one of which is located at Darwin and the other at Alice Springs. These are advisory in the real sense, and they will remain.",24
69,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But they "" do not exercise the power which it is proposed to vest in this council.",25
70,Mr NAIRN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is true. One of the principal reasons why objection has been taken to the setting up of the new advisory council is that too great power is being vested in it. The council would, for instance, have the power to make ordinances. This would mean that it would practically govern the Territory. The fear that the council would be dominated by agitators is a very real one. Earlier today I directed attention to reports from Darwin as to the conditions at present existing there. The town is in the hands of the communists. Although it is only a small settlement, 22 cases were listed for trial at the last criminal sessions. But from all these committals there were only two convictions, in the other cases there were either acquittals or disagreements by the jury, or the charges were withdrawn by the Crown. The communists are openly boasting that the Government is afraid to prosecute them, and the citizens of Darwin are afraid to do their duty as jurymen for fear of retaliation by these lawless persons. That state of affairs has been brought about largely, because the Minister has repeatedly interfered and meddled with the administration of justice in the Northern Territory, by quashing convictions or refusing to take action on the advice of his officers. The local hoboes have sent messages to the Minister requesting him to adopt various suggestions, and in one case a threat was made to him through a trade union in Broken Hill that certain action would be taken against him unless he upset the decision arrived at by a local officer. That kind of thing has seriously contributed towards the disorder that prevails in Darwin today. It is not surprising, therefore, that strong objection should be taken to the setting up an advisory council clothed with the power the Government proposed to give it.",25
71,Mr RIORDAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Kennedy) [3.55] The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn) has said that the Northern Territory is at present under the control of the communists. He admitted that there were already two advisory councils operating at the northern and southern end of the territory. Who was responsible for the appointment of those bodies? Had the people of the Northern Territory any say in the making of the appointments? In my opinion, the conference managers adopted a reasonable attitude on this matter. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) was one of the managers. With his intimate knowledge of Northern Territory affairs, he agreed that it would be wise to give the people a measure of self government. Why should we object to the people electing their own representatives to the proposed advisory council? The honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) says that, if this is done, communists may be elected; but he appears to have forgotten that it is proposed to divide the territory into four sections for the purpose of electing this council. This would mean that the people who are developing this great territory, whether they be operating in a large or a small way, will determine who shall represent them. Surely there is nothing wrong in that. These peopleare putting up with great inconveniencein developing this huge territory which,, in the past, has received very little attention or assistance from this Parliament. In view of the fact that the electors will be divided into four groups, it is most unlikely that communists will be in the ascendency. But in any case, it is for the people to decide whether they want, or do not want, a communistic government. If Australia decided to elect a communistic government tomorrow, it would be improper for this Parliament to attempt to put any block in the way of their doing so. Probably some honourable members opposite would like to take the franchise from certain people in Australia because they returned to power a Labour Government; but the majority of the people will not agree toa policy of that description. Why should the people of the Northern Territory have inflicted upon them, as the controller of their affairs, a retired commissioner of the police?",25
72,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He is quite a young man, and not retired.",26
73,Mr RIORDAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I submit that the people should be permitted to elect their own representatives. It is true that the majority of the population in the Northern Territory is centred at Darwin... Most of the other residents are interested in cattle-raising, and they employ very little labour except aborigines, who will not have a vote under this measure. Consequently, these people, who will have the chief say in three of the four divisions, will be able to elect a pastoralist to represent them if they believe that such a man is best able press their opinions. The representatives of another place who sat in. the conference of managers were very reasonable. At first their views were somewhat similar to those expressed by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) but after they had heard the Minister and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) explain matters, they were of the opinion that the clause giving the people of the territory the right to elect their own administration should staud part of the bill. Actually what the honourable member for Perth fears could occur most easily under the measure in its amended form. If communism exists in the territory, it must surely find expression through the preponderating population centred Darwin. However, the bogy of coni'munism with which the honourable member has, endeavoured to frighten us is too absurd to warrant much consideration. The people of the Northern Territory are good citizens of the Commonwealth, the majority of them having gone to that remote area at the special request of those who desired, to employ them there. Another class is represented by that stalwart Australian, the prospector, a type that has done much to develop,, not only the Northern Territory, but the Commonwealth generally. During the last weekend I saw in Sydney a picture depicting the so-called pioneering efforts of a gentleman in Arnhem Land, who was supposed to have explored country previously untrodden by the white man. Flies and other pests associated with the tropics were shown as part of the hardship to which that gentleman had been subjected. As a inatter of fact, prospectors searched that country for gold and valuable minerals years before he set foot in it. Yet the prospector is the type of citizen to whom the honourable member for Perth and his like object to give the right of adult franchise! His arguments are unworthy of a representative in this chamber. I believe that the objections that have been raised to this bill by another place areso much humbug, talked by people who do not know the condition of the territory or the spirit that animates its. inhabitants. I to ex- remind honourable members that the quickest way to spread discontent and encourage communism is to deny to people the right to elect their own representatives or to have any say in their own government.",26
74,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney) [4.4]. - I endorse the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan). It is rather strange that this matter should be brought up following the eulogy of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley), of the self governing rights of the people of this country. The honourable member spoke at some length to express his feelings on the importance of the right of the people to govern themselves. At the time he was referring to an article that appeared in a South Australian newspaper which at he alleged had attacked this institution, and urged that we should at all costs safeguard the privileges of popular representation and free speech, which were established after much sacrifice in the past. This bill was designed to confer on the people of the Northern Territory just those self-governing rights to which the honourable member referred; rights which are enjoyed by honourable members and those whom they represent. In the circumstances, I regret that the Minister and the Government have seen f it to accept the position that has been forced upon them by another place. It is as well that I should remind honourable members that - some of the rights and privileges enjoyed by the representatives of other parts of Australia are denied the representative of the Northern Territory in this chamber. It is true that he takes every opportunity to associate himself actively with thing that concerns the territory, hut has no opportunity to register his vote accordance with his views.",26
75,Mr RIORDAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member was supposed to be a communist before he came to this Parliament. Air. BEASLEY - Any one who opposes the existing social order, and protests against injustice is branded as one who is not fitted to occupy a place in any other representative assembly. That is one of the many subterfuges resorted by the ultra-conservative element. ever, the people are becoming more more enlightened, and that sort of propainsisted ganda finds little favour with those who are prepared to view matters in proper light. It is not sufficient that honourable member for the Northern Terdealt ritory should merely express his views this chamber. He should also be perquashes mitted to record his vote, particularly matters such as the committee is now debating. I understand that when a conference ter's electorate. of managers is convened, to deal with matters such as this, it is the usual custom for the opinion of both chambers to be - not spread lies. expressed per medium of the conference manager^. The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Blakeley) admitted that this occasion the conference came unanimous decision. It is, therefore, strange to me that those in another place should reject the recommendations of its conference representatives. That made a farce of the whole proceedings. Members in another place have used occasion merely to extract from the vernment as much information as could on the subject, in order to bolster up their arguments, and thereby to defeat the intentions of the Government. The honourable member for Kennedy fully expressed my views on this matter. If we believe in and accept the principle of self-government, which provides that the people shall elect their own reprethat sentatives, it is absolutely wrong that should, on this occasion, jettison those rights as is now proposed, merely accede to the request of the majority in another place.",27
76,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Balaclava) [4.7] - Th honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) may always be trusted to say a everyword or two in favour of the extreme he element in the community. In dealing in with this measure, he could not refrain from coupling with it the - writings of a certain extremist newspaper in Adelaide. The honourable member advanced a strong claim in favour of self-government, but in my opinion, he is more concerned with the doings of those men who have caused Darwin to be regarded as such a blot on the fair name of Australia, the "" r e d "" this or element. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) was quite right. As to soon as there are any disorderly activities Howon the part of that element-suc h as and occurred recently when the extremists upon using the main street for their demonstrations instead of occupying the more suitable spaces that could be the allotted to them, and were in consequence with by the law-the Minister for in Home Affairs comes to their aid, and any conviction. The honourable on gentleman does that because the "" red "" element in the territory brings pressure to bear through the unions in the Minis",27
77,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Tell the truth. Do,27
78,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am merely repeating on what is common knowledge. If the Goto a vernment was really serious in its very expressed desire to assist the Northern Territory, it should take steps to improve the civil amenities of Darwin. The town has has no water supply; there is inadequate hospital provision, and no proper school the accommodation at the Katherine, and Goi f the Darwin jetty were improved, they much unnecessary manhandling of cargo would be avoided, with a consequent decrease in the cost of commodities. However, it is apparent that the Minister and the honourable member for West Sydney are concerned only with pampering those who cause such a lot of trouble in the north. Recently special constables had to be sworn into cope with element, and they dealt with the we extremists, but punishments were made later with a forebearance out of all proto portion to what they deserved. I take exception to what the honourable e member for Kennedy said about' the Northern Territory having a retired police inspector foisted upon it as Government Resident. The gentleman concerned is a comparatively young man, with a distinguished war record, who was previously an officer in the Commonwealth police service. He was a Commonwealth investigating officer who was promoted to the high position of Government Resident.",27
79,Mr RIOEDAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He was not a Commonwealth inquiry officer, but a retired police officer.",28
80,Mr WHITE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is referring to a previous administrator. Colonel Weddell, the present Government Resident, was formerly an investigating officer connected with the Commonwealth Police. I support the motion.",28
81,Mr MARTENS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Herbert) [4.11] - I associate myself with the remarks of the honourable members for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan) and West Sydney (Mr Beasley) notwithstanding what the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has said. I am acquainted with some of the residents of the Northern Territory, and I know that they are not inferior to the people of any other part of Australia. Their representative in this House is not a communist, but a man who is as intelliter gent as is any member of another place. E regret that the Minister brought this matter before us today, as owing to cumstances over which he has no control, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), is absent. I do not believe in taking from any section the community the right to administer tory. their own local affairs. For 30 years every proposal for advancement has been regarded by honourable members opposite, and those whom they represent, as undesirable agitation; it has been referred to in the same contemptuous terms as have been used by them today. It is regrettable that such remarks should be made whenever it is desired to liberalize the franchise. Even though the residents of Darwin might be disposed to elect a man holding advanced, or even extreme, views, the residents of other portions the territory not so closely associated with industrial conditions, would not do so. But even if they did, they would have the right to do so. This Parliament has no right to dictate the class person'who shall represent any section the community; it is for the electors to return to Parliament, or to elect to other bodies, men to represent their views, whether others agree with those views or not. The greatest possible freedom should be given to the people in the matter of self-government. The proposal before us is to reject a decision unanimously made by the managers appointed by both Houses. I do not understand why the Minister should be willing to agree to the proposal of another place. He says that he does not wish to lose the bill. I submit that the members of another place should be made to accept the responsibility for rejecting the measitre which waB sent on from this chamber. This House should not subordinate itself to another place. The reason advanced for not accepting the unanimous decision of the managers, namely, thai; the people of the territory would probably elect communists to represent them, will not bear investigation. It is ridiculous. I do not know the pros and cons of the matters referred to; nor do those honourable gentlemen opposite who have seen fit to make cheap gibes about the Minister having quashed the convictions of men found guilty of breaches of the law. No Minisof the Crown, irrespective of party, would quash a conviction without feeling that he had good ground for doing so. cirI regret that the Minister has seen fit to accept the Senate's amendments, and also that he has brought this matter before us today, in the absence of the honof orable member for the Northern Terri",28
82,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Parkes) [4.14] - I support the Minister, although as one of the managers appointed by this chamber to confer with those appointed by another place, I agreed with the decisions arrived at when the conference sat. With other honourable members, I agree, that the residents of the Northern Territory should be given representation; but the area of the territory is so vast that it is difficult to do so. On one occasion, when Minof ister for Home and Territories, I was interviewed by a man from the Northern Territory who had had a three weeks' ride on horseback from his station before he reached the railhead. If the people of of the Territory are to have representaof tion on a council sitting at Darwin, much time will be lost by the elected representatives in getting to and from the council meetings.",28
83,Mr MARTENS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The logical outcome of the honourable member's reasoning would be that the people of the territory should have no representation whatever.,29
84,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Northern Territory were self-supporting, I would say that the people there would be entitled to full representation on any council entrusted with the management of local affairs; but the position is different when this Parliament is responsible for financing the territory.",29
85,Mr RIOEDAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member agreed with the decision of the managers.,29
86,Mr MARR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have already admitted that. But the Minister has seen fit to accept the amendment of the Senate. The people of New Guinea are also crying out for representation; but it is difficult to accede to their request, as honourable members who have visited New Guinea will admit. We all agree that those of our people who are opening up new country in outlying places are entitled to representation^ and to whatever assistance we can give them. Nevertheless, in view of the Minister's acceptance of the Senate's amendment, I think that the committee would be justified in supporting him.",29
87,Mr CURTIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Fremantle) [4.17] - I understand that the unanimous report of the managers was subsequently amended by the Senate. In those circumstances, I do not propose to support the Minister in the stand that he has taken.",29
88,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Angas) [4.18] - I regret that the Minister has agreed to the Senate's amendment, for it seemed to me a step in the right direction to give the people of the Northern Territory some measure of self-government. Whatever may be the position at Darwin, I have no fear that the people in the southern portion of the Northern Territory would elect any communist to represent them on the council. It has been urged that attendance at council meetings would necessitate a great amount of travelling, with consequent expense. In my opinion, that travelling, instead of being a reason for not granting self-government to the residents of the Northern Territory, is an argument in favour of self-government for them. I know that at least one of the three commissioners did a great amount of travelling, and that his visits were greatly appreciated by the people with, whom he came in contact. I cannot speak of the travelling done by the other commissioners. I understand that if we agree to the Senate's amendment we shall revert to the old system of control by two administrators, instead of one.",29
89,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is so.,29
90,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unde r that system the Northern Territory made no progress in the past. ' I regret that this small measure of self-government, which, in my opinion, was a definite step forward, has been scotched.",29
91,Mr JAMES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hunter) [4.19] - I do not propose to cast a silent vote on this occasion. I am entirely opposed to the dictation of the Senate in this instance, as I was to dictation by that body last year in connection with certain arbitration proposals. I blame the Government for its weakness in accepting dictation from another place. It is only fair that the people of the Northern Territory should be given the right to determine the conditions under which they shall live; and, therefore, I shall not support the proposal of the Minister. Adult franchise is a most democratic principle and should not be denied to any section of the comnxunity. I oppose any alteration of the bill as it left this chamber, and I therefore intend to vote against the amendment inserted by another place.",29
92,Mr KEANE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bendigo) [4.21] - I have little knowledge of the subject before the committee, and I , therefore, do not intend to discuss it ; but as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) is ill I ask the Minister to adjourn the debate so that the honourable member may have an opportunity to participate in it.",29
93,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Henty) [4.22]:-There seems to be a good deal of misconception still 'in the committee as to the reason for the attitude adopted by another place in respect of this measure. I am strongly in favour of the establishment of advisory councils, because in the case of a Crown colony-the Northern Territory being really in that position-the beginning of popular government is brought about as a general rule by the establishment of such a body. But I know of no instance in which an advisory council in a Crown colony has been established upon the basis of manhood or adult franchise. Had the Government proceeded on different lines, a successful council, and one which would have been acceptable to this Parliament, might have been appointed. Under the present proposal all four members of the council may be residents of Darwin.",29
94,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is impossible.,30
95,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is nothing in - the bill to prevent that from taking place. Another objection is that the four members of the council may be of one political colour. The Northern Territory is somewhat different from southern Australia, because it depends absolutely upon outaide capital, and if we set up in the Territory a form of government based upon adult franchise I venture to say that within two years a great deal of the - capital now invested in that country will have been withdrawn and few white workers will be left there. I believe that if the Minister now submitted a proposal for the appointment in the Northern Territory of an advisory council, its members to be representative of particular interests, he would receive the support of all honourable members.",30
96,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member contend that the Territory cannot progress unless we subordinate all our interests to those of capital?,30
97,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Certainl y not, but the establishment in the Northern Territory of government by popular voice would be prejudicial to the introduction of capital, and it would, within a few years, entirely depopulate that country. I suggest that a proposal to appoint an advisory council of four members consisting of two representatives of the pastoral industry, one representative of the mining industry, and one representative of the workers in the Territory would be acceptable to all honourable members. I am glad that the Senate has seen fit to amend the bill as it left this chamber, and I trust that the Minister will insist upon his proposal.",30
98,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Warringah) [4.25] - I support the motion moved by the Minister. Some honourable members adopt the unreasonable and persistent attitude of disagreeing with any proposal emanating from another place.,30
99,Mr CURTIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,My objection in this instance is that another place has amended the bill despite an agreement arrived at by managers representative of both chambers.,30
100,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am glad to have the honourable member's explanation, because his few remarks were capable of a different construction. Nevertheless it is quite reasonable for members of another place to differ from the managers that they appoint. They have equal rights with members of this chamber in the discussion of all legislative and administrative matters; and if they think that the views of the managers appointed by them are capable of improvement they are at liberty to disagree and to vote accordingly. There is no ground for opposing the amendment made by another place. It is a distinct improvement on the bill as it left this chamber. I therefore support the proposal of the Minister.",30
101,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Newcastle) [4.27] As the honourable member for the Northern Territory is ilL and cannot, at this stage, attend the committee, I ask the Minister to adjourn the debate.",30
102,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I shall do so later.,30
103,Mr CURTIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Fremantle) [4.28] - I do not resent or dispute the right of another place to amend bills that originate in this chamber, but in this instance the position is somewhat different. We had reached the stage at which both chambers disagreed in respect of a proposed alteration of the law. The Constitution prescribes a method whereby both chambers may resolve their difficulties. It prescribes that each chamber shall appoint managers. In this instance, managers representative of all parties in this Parliament were appointed. They conferred together, and arrived at a reasonable arrangement to permit of the difficulties between both chambers being overcome. I require a substantial and convincing argument to be advanced before I am prepared to depart from the unanimous finding of those managers. It was open to another place to reject in to to, the decisions of the managers, but it did not do that. It regarded the report of the managers as if it were a further amendment to the bill. When managers, knowing full well the views of their spective chambers, have succeeded in arriving at a unanimous decision I cannot agree to depart from it until an argument more substantial than that advanced by the other chamber is placed before us.",30
104,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Darling-Minister for Home Affairs) [4.30] - Neithe r branch of the legislature is bound to accept the recommendations of a conference of managers, even though their decision might be unanimous.",31
105,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But that is the usual practice.,31
106,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Not necessarily. The fact that such conferences are provided for indicates that either House may accept or reject the recommendations of its managers. There are two main principles involved in the bill, and the greater principle, in the estimation of the Government, is the abolition of the North Australia Commission, and the substitution for it of the system of administration previously in vogue. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) said that it would be unwise to revert to the old system. All I have to say is that the adoption of the new system has not improved matters; in fact, it has made the government of the territory more costly and unwieldy than before.",31
107,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The commissioners were nominees of the Government.,31
108,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member is apparently confusing the semi governmental powers of the residents with the administration of the territory, which is quite a distinct matter. Advisory councils now function, both in North Australia and Central Australia. administration is carried out partly by the North Australia Commission and partly by the Administrator. It is proposed that the administration shall be in the hands of one officer instead of three, as at present.",31
109,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They were not elected by the people, but were nominees of the Government.",31
110,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was never intended that all members of the advisory councils should be elected. The proposal to give a modicum of self-government to the people of the Northern Territory has nothing whatever to do with the administration. The advisory councils re- were permitted to give advice to the Administrator, who could accept or reject it as he thought fit. The Government considers it essential to abolish the North Australia Commission. This has heen agreed to in another place, but the other portion of the measure relating to the advisory councils has not been accepted. While I agree that the people of the territory should have some kind of representation, the question arises whether, if the Government cannot secure the passage of the whole of the bill, it should lose the opportunity to have the more important part of it put into law. According to representations by the Public Service Board and the Auditor-General's Department, the alterations proposed under the measure would effect a saving of £8,000 a year. In the opinion of the Government, an effective and economical system of administration is proposed, but we are prepared to forgo, for the time being, the provisions relating to the advisory councils.",31
111,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why does the Minister think that one man will be more effective as an administrator than three.,31
112,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I dealt with that aspect of the matter at fair length in introducing the bill, and the readiness with which members of all parties accepted my statement that the abolition of the commission was desirable seemed to indicate that the policy advocated was sound. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn), and the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) have made certain statements alleging interference on my The part with the administration of justice in the Northern Territory, and I keenly resent what they have said. The honourable member for Balaclava rarely takes trouble to ascertain the facts of the cases that he discusses, but when an honourable member with a legal training, such as the honourable member for Perth, takes even greater liberties with truth, one wonders whether his legal training is comparable with that which usually distinguishes members of the profession of the law. The honourable member for Perth said that I had interfered with the course of justice at Darwin, and that, at the behest of trade unions at Broken Hill,, I had released certain men. That statement is not correct, and I suggest that the honourable, member should withdraw it. As a matter of fact, certain organizations at Broken Hill asked me to do something which I refused to do. I think that the honourable member should accept my assurance in the matter. Any remissions of fines or sentences granted by me in the Northern Territory have been based on a strict sense of justice. I recently took part in an election campaign in New South Wales, during which I spoke in about twenty country towns, both large and small. In no less than three instances the traffic was diverted from the main streets in which the meetings were held, and the people accepted that procedure as entirely proper; but, on my return to Canberra, I found that, because of obstruction of traffic in the streets of Darwin, certain men had been arrested. I could not agree that that action was justified, and, therefore, I took the - necessary steps to have the prosecutions withdrawn. At no time have I done anything against the best interests of justice in the territory.",31
113,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Was Minister asked to interfere in the matter ?,32
114,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), on account of indisposition, is unable to attend to his parliamentary duties today, and, in response to the request that has (been made to me, I move that progress be now reported.

115,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [4.40] - I have given a good deal of consideration to the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn). I have also consulted Cabinet on the matter, and I want to announce at once that Cabinet the has decided that the rates of duty proposed in the schedule shall remain. On the 25th May, 1927, a conference of ComI regret monwealth and State representatives upon uniform standards for foods and drugs, carried the following resolution:4. The conference reaffirms the resolution of the conference of 1913, which was reaffirmed by the conference of 1922, that, "" All spirits imported in bulk to be sold in bottles under the label or name of any distiller, manufacturer, or agent, outside the Commonwealth, should be bottled in bond under customs supervision, and should be labelled 'bottled in bond TABIFF. by ' (here adding the name of the manufacturer CUSTOMS DUTIES. or of the agent within the Commonwealth)."" That was regarded as an additional means of ensuring that spirits true to label would reach the hotel keeper and, to that extent, safeguard consumers.",32

That guarantee is possible when spirit is bottled under the supervision of an officer of the customs departQUEENSLAND. ment.,33
120,Mr WATKINS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The amendment has no relation to the rate of duty.,33
121,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The amendment proposes to reduce the rate of duty on brandy bottled out of bond, and, I take it that the same proposal is to be submitted in regard to other spirits.",33
122,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is there any Tariff Board report on the matter, seeing that this is not a revenue duty.",33
123,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is one of the duties that increase the revenue. Bond stores cost a good deal, and the operationof this duty has resulted in the establishTASMANIA. ment of additional bond stores. This, in turn, has led to an increase in revenue. Certain peopio who have not bottled in bond have paid the extra duty, and thus VlCTOBIA. increased the revenue.",33
124,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The revenue has 'fallen in consequence of the increase of the duties on spirits.,33
125,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It has fallen in respect to duties on spirits as it has fallen in respect to every other luxury item in thej schedule, and not because of this particular increase. Even if the rate of duty on whisky had been decreased, the depression in Australia would still have brought about a reduction in the consumption of whisky.",33
126,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"To some extent that is true, but as the duties have gone beyond a certain level the consumption has fallen.",33
127,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Regulation s under the Spirits Act of 1906-23 lay down certain conditions in order to safeguard the public. Regulation 7 reads as follows:Upon the written application of the owner and satisfactory proof as to the identity of any under customs control, an officer may mark or cause to be marked the description of such spirits in the following manner:1. Casks and vessels - The - marking shall be effected by affixing on the head of each cask or vessel or case the prescribed stamp or seal. 2. Bottles - The prescribed stamp, shall be placed on each bottle, and,, in addition, if desired by the owner, the prescribed seal shall be impressed in wax or otherwise on the cork or capsule of everv bottle. The stamp to be used for descriptive purposes shall be adhesive not less than two inches in diameter or such smaller size as may be authorized by the Comptroller in special cases, printed in black letters on white ground, and in the following design, but the descriptive terms varied to suit the requirements, provided that a reduced facsimile of the stamp may be used for miniature bottles. That r e g u l at i o n was issued by the B r u c e Page Government. The Spirits Act 1906-1923, contains t h is d e f in it i o n "" Australian Standard Malt means whisky which complies with the following requisites:(a) It must have been distilled wholly from barley malt by a pot still or similar process at a strength not exceeding forty-five per cent, over proof. (?>) It must have been matured, while subject to the control of the customs, by storage in wood' for a period of not less than two years; and (o) It must have been certified by an officer to be pure whisky containing ull the essential elements of pure malt whisky. The act also lays down the conditions to be observed in the making of Australian blended whisky. The extra duty of 5s. per gallon on spirits bottled out of bond was imposed for three reasons. First, as a measure of protection to the public because the extra duty would be an inducement to have spirits bottled in bond under customs supervision, thus ensuring that what was put into the bottle was true to label.",33
128,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That does not guarantee the purity of what comes out of the bottle.,34
129,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I admit that the customs officer cannot police the spirit until it reaches the consumer, but bottling in bond under customs supervision is a help to the State officers. In Victoria, for instance, there are over 2,000 hotels and only one inspector.",34
130,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The protection of the public, against the adulteration-of foods and drinks is a State matter.",34
131,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But this additional safeguard was recommended by a health conference representative of the Commonwealth and the States. Secondly, the bottling in bond is also a means of increasing the revenue, although that is not an important consideration. Thirdly, it is a means of creating additional employment in connection with the manufacture in Australia of bottles, cases, and straw envelopes, and gives work to extra bottlers and packers in bond stores.",34
132,Mr CURTIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Tb e question is whether whisky should be bottled in bond or out of bond. Employment is not increased merely by bottling in bond.,34
133,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Employmen t is not a big factor, although it is a consideration. The extra import duty of 5s. on spirits Whisky"" bottled out of bond embraces whisky, brandy, and gin under the customs tariff, and whisky, brandy, gin, and liqueurs under the excise tariff.",34
134,Mr HAWKEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"""Why not rum ?",34
135,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable member can show good reasons for the inclusion of rum, I shall be prepared to consider them. No objection has been raised to the 5s. extra on brandy, gin, and liqueurs bottled out of bond, because those lines are practically all bottled under customs supervision in bond.",34
136,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who asked for this alteration ?,34
137,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This is an administrative act based on a recommendation of health officers who want to ensure that only pure liquors shall be sold to the public.,34
138,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The importing distillers asked for it.,34
139,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is true that the importing interests are in favour-of it, and I believe that they have circularized every honourable member on the subject. An important consideration is that if a hotel keeper sells a ""house"" whisky, it is subject to no other test than that of alcoholic strength.",34
140,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And the consumers' taste.,34
141,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"After one whisky, some persons do not know what they are drinking. During the last six months, the Customs Department have located, in New South Wales alone, six illicit whisky stills. Some of their product was sold by sly-grog shops, but quantities of it were bought by hotel keepers, although, fortunately, the majority of the licensed victuallers will have nothing to with it.",34
142,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This duty will not retard the sale of illicit whisky.,35
143,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bottlin g in bond under customs supervision will be an additional check. "" House "" whisky can be a product of illicit stills, or Australian whisky, or cheap imported whisky, or a blend of all three. The only condition the hotel keeper has to observe is to keep the whisky up to the stipulated alcoholic strength. If he puts cheap imported or illicit still whisky into a decanter and observes the standard of alcoholic strength, no action can be taken by the inspector. The recognized proprietary brands are bottled in bond under customs supervision and check samples are submitted to the health authorities. By comparison with the check samples, the inspector can determine whether the whisky in bottle is true to check sample.",35
144,Mr KEANTE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the only actual test.,35
145,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is the only means of ascertaining whether a bottle labelled Dewar's contains Dewar's whisky, or the product of an illicit still. By offering an inducement to distillers to have their spirits bottled in bond, under customs supervision, wo increase the guarantee to the public that the liquor is true to label.",35
146,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The inspector does not test the whisky to decide whether it is Dewar's or Black and ""White.",35
147,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"B y comparison with the check samples, he can satisfy himself whether it is Dewar's or Old Court, or some inferior brand.",35
148,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The inspector tests only for strength and purity.,35
149,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Excludin g rum, at least 95 per cent, of the total spirits sold are bottled brands. The number of hotel keepers who have a sumcient trade in their own bottled brands to require the whole time service of a bottler is very limited; probably there are not more than 25 of them in the whole of Australia. One objection taken to the new duty is that pilfering from the cases occurs between the bond store and the hotel. It is true that a bottle of whisky can be removed from a case in a railway yard, or on a wharf, but that evil is no greater than the pillaging of casks. In Brisbane a few years ago a hole was bored in a cask on the wharf, a tap inserted, and the whole of the contents drawn off. Another practice is to shift one of the hoops, bore a hole in the cask, draw off two or three gallons of whisky, plug the hole, and knock the hoop back over it. When that is done, the consignee may never know that he has been robbed. The hotel keeper is able to tell whether a case has been interfered with, for if the contents rattle when the case is shaken, he knows that a bottle has been removed. We shall be told that efficient inspection is being carried out by the various State Governments. Statistics prove that in some of the States there is very little supervision, whilst in others, where the number of licences is large, the inspectors are far too few to supervise .the trade efficiently. In New South Wales there are two liquor inspectors under the control of the Health Department. The number of victuallers' licences is approximately 2,200, and they are distributed over the whole State. In Victoria, there is one liquor inspector, controlled by the Health Department; the licences in that State are: victuallers, 1,803; grocers, 258; clubs, 122; railway refreshment rooms, 32, and steam packet, 6; a total of 2,221 retail licences, apart from wholesale licences. In Queensland the liquor inspection is a small portion of the duties of food inspectors, and, therefore, the supervision is anything but efficient. The number of victuallers' licences alone is 1,350. There are no liquor inspectors in South Australia, liquor inspecting being a portion of the duties of health inspectors, who have to supervise also milk, meat, and other foods. In that State -650 hotels are licensed. In Western Australia, the liquor inspection is in the hands of two inspectors who are under the control of the Police Department. In Tasmania, there are approximately 400 licensed victuallers, and there again the control of liquor standards is in the hands of food inspectors, and is only a small portion of their duties. The additional os. a gallon on spirits bottled out of bond will encourage the bottling of spirits under customs supervision, and will, to some extent, protect the public against imposition and fraud.",35
150,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How much duty has been paid under this provision?,35
151,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Government losing revenue as a result of it.,36
152,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"An officer of the department is at present investigating this matter, and it has been found that there has been an increase in revenue as a result of the duty. It has also resulted in the opening of additional bond stores in which liquor is bottled under supervision. This condition will have its repercussions in other industries, in as much as the demand for bottles, cases and straw envelopes will be largely increased. Moreover, it will be the means of increasing the revenue - where importers do not take advantage of the lower rates operating under the bottling provisions. Bottling under supervision was made subject to by-law in the resolution of the 26th of March, 1931. This action was taken for the purpose of giving the department full control over bottling operations, and also to enable it to prescribe the strength of spirits which may be bottled at the lower rate of duty. It had been found that, in order to obtain the benefit of the lower rates, importers were bottling the spirits at proof and overproof, and after duty had been paid, the bottled spirit was poured back into casks, and broken down in strength before being sold to the public. As the object of the item was being defeated, the by-law provision was added to prevent importers adopting such methods. Honourable members must not overlook the fact that in the excise tariff provision is made for full control over the manufacture of spirit. For instance, Item 2 (r>) providesWhisky, distilled wholly from barley malt by a pot still, or similar process, at a strength not exceeding 45 per cont. overproof, matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, and certified by an officer to be pure malt whisky. As"" a result, Australian whisky or other spirit which is bottled under customs or excise supervision, carries a label that certifies as to its quality, and the whisky may, therefore, be said to carry a government guarantee as to quality. If this is the law in respect of Australian spirits, surely there is no reason why the Government should not apply similar conditions for the protection of the public in respect of whisky or other spirit which is imported. Since this additional duty on spirits in bottles was imposed, 24 additional bonds have been opened in the [00] is Commonwealth. They are giving employment to bottlers, and the spirits are being bottled under customs supervision.",36
153,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How many persons are employed in those bonds %,36
154,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is difficult to ascertain the actual number. Some of them are employing four or five, others three or four, and others less. The Customs Department today is experiencing grave difficulty in policing our excise regulations. An increasing number of persons is making whisky in the backyard, on the farm, or elsewhere. The Comptroller-General of Customs advises me that the illicit distilling of whisky is on the increase. Those who make the whisky have to get rid of it somehow, and if they are able to dispose of it to hotel keepers who mix it with an Australian whisky or some cheap imported brand, customers who are served with it out of a decanter on the counter have no means of knowing what they are drinking. This provision requiring a higher duty to be paid unless the whisky is bottled in bond under customs supervision goes some way to meet the recommendations of the Melbourne Health Conference held under the aegis of the Bruce-Page Government. That conference recommended that the Government should forbid the sale of whisky not bottled under government supervision. In view of the present state of the national finances, I trust that honourable members will recognize the unwisdom of reducing this duty at the present time.",36
155,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If the Government wanted more revenue it would reduce the duty. i,36
156,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In Great Britain the duty on whisky is approximately 75s. a gallon, as against 45s. in Australia.",36
157,Mr FRANCIS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is the strength of the whisky imported into Great Britain ?,36
158,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member knows that the British duty is much higher than the Australian duty, and now that the Government needs all the revenue it can obtain it would not be advisable to reduce this duty. I ask the committee not to agree to this proposal, nor to the proposal which will be made later to reduce the duty on imported whisky by 12s. a gallon. That proposal will be advocated on the ground that it will reduce the price of a nip of whisky by Id., and will thus encourage the drinking of more whisky. I doubt whether it will have the effect claimed for it, and it would mean a loss of £300,000 to £375,000 a year in Customs revenue. The Government cannot agree to the loss of so much revenue at the present time.",36
159,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Henty) [5.12] - The proposal before the committee is that the import duty of 45s. on brandy should be increased to 50s. when the imported spirit is not bottled in bond. An amendment has been moved to revert to the original position. I . am surprised at the action of the Government, first in having proposed to increase the duty, and then in having insisted upon the increase. In the course of a debate on the Northern Territory bill this afternoon we, on this side of _the House, were charged with being concerned with the big pastoral interests in the north. If ever there was a pandering to big interests in any trade, it is to be found in the Government's support of the big whisky importing interests by the imposition of this additional 5s. a gallon duty. The really big Scotch associated distillers bottle their whisky in bond. In the propaganda which they are distributing to members at the present time they assert that they have used no influence with the Government to bring about this additional impost of 5s. I am sorry to say that that is not so. I had this case before me here in. Canberra two years ago. I have no quarrel with those interests, but I feel in duty bound to state what happened. They strongly urged me to agree to an additional import duty of 5s. a gallon On imported whisky not bottled in bond. Obviously their object was to weaken the competition of other whisky-importing firms. This increased duty constituted a very definite penalty upon every seller of hulk whisky in Australia. This increased duty meant nothing to them, but it did penalize their competitors who imported in bulk, and paid duty on bulk. The Government has been levying an extra toll of 5s. a gallon on every importer of bulk whisky, whether a hotel keeper or wine and spirit merchant, and has, in my opinion, brought about a change for the worse in the selling and consumption of whisky. Despite what the Minister has said, the bottling of whisky in bond does not necessarily guarantee its purity. We all know that the best grades of whisky in this or any other country are not sold in bottles, excepting in small quantities. Any person wishing to get the least harmful whisky possible will buy high-grade bulk whisky. We have in Australia a considerable number of old-fashioned and honourable wine and spirit merchants, who have been carrying on a wholesale trade in whisky and other spirits, selling a few gallons at a time to pastoralists and other persons who prefer to buy their whisky in bulk. Those firms are being penalized by this extra 5s. duty, and many of them are being driven out of business. This measure discriminates unfairly against those who are importing the best and purest whisky at the present time. I wish to say nothing against the proprietary whisky bottled in bond, but everybody knows that it is not really old whisky. It is relatively new and, relatively, not so good as that sold in bulk. In the interests of the wine and spirit merchants, who may be classed as the most reputable of liquor traders, and of those engaged in the sale of bulk whisky all whether it be known as house whisky or otherwise, the committee should not sanction this increased duty on whisky not bottled in bond. The-duty constitutes a grave interference with the liberty of the subject. It will not operate in the interests of temperance, nor will it guarantee the purity of the whisky sold. The Minister said that it would make it more difficult to dispose of illicitly distilled spirit. I cannot agree with that contention. If those who make such whisky are prepared, with the connivance of the publicans, to cheat the Customs, they will not sell the whisky in bulk, but will put it into Dewar's and Buchanan's bottles, or into those of other firms. It would be only another step for them, having broken the law in one respect, to go a little further and pass off their whisky as one of the proprietary brands. I also challenge the statement of the Minister that it is the duty of the excise officers to check all whisky sold, to see that it is true to label. Their duty is only to determine its purity and strength.",37
160,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The excise officers check the strength of whisky in bulk, then check it again after it is bottled, and report the result to the department.",37
161,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In the various States special machinery exists for checking houee whisky and other draft whisky, and the checking is done just as carefully as when the whisky is in bottles bearing well-known labels. No guarantee of purity is provided by the imposition of this extra duty. In my opinion, the Government is going outside its proper sphere altogether, and is concerning itself with what is really one of the proper activities of the States. What business is it of the Minister to exercise supervision over the sale of spirits in hotels? There would be as much justification for Commonwealth supervision, of the retail milk supply for the people of Australia. Not one reason has been advanced to justify this change, which, as I have said, has been made on the representations of the big whisky importers. Possibly it is something in the nature of a sop to them for the great increase in duties which importers of spirits have to pay on gin. Mr FoEDii - The big whisky importers are much displeased with the Government's action in regard to whisky generally.",38
162,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Memorand a which I have read from the whisky distillers, including representatives of John Dewar, James Buchanan & Company, the Distillers Agency Limited, John Walker, and the White Horse brand, urge the retention of the extra 5s. per gallon.",38
163,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They are asking for a reduction in whisky duties amounting to 12s. a gallon.,38
164,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister is referring to an entirely different matter. As one reason for the change, the Minister said something about the additional employment which the new duties would provide. Figures which have been supplied to me prove the contrary condition to have arisen. One statement, relating to the number of employees engaged in the bottling and distributing of imported and other spirits in New South Wales, shows that in November, 1929, the number of employees in bond and bottling warehouses was 350, while in March of this year it was only 229.",38
165,Mr MARTENS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Who supplied that information ?,38
166,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is contained in a circular from the Wine and Spirit Merchants Association of New South Wales. I assume that the members of that organization know what they are talking about.,38
167,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not the honourable member realise that through rationing and surcharges on duties whisky imports have materially declined?,38
168,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am stating the position that obtains today. A few minutes ago the Minister told the committee that this duty had added substantially to the revenue, and had also been responsible for an increase in employment.",38
169,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I said that it had resulted in some increase in revenue.,38
170,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The figures which I have quoted show that there has been a decrease in employment since this duty was imposed. I come now to the question of revenue. Even in the prosperous years just before we began to feel the effects of the depression, the increased whisky duties did not check .the steady downward trend in revenue. It is obvious, therefore, that this increase from 45s. to 50s. will mean less revenue. Many people who approve of restrictions being imposed on the use of alcohol, will commend these higher duties on spirits. I do not propose to discuss .that aspect of the matter at this stage. The point I wish to emphasize is that these increases have been responsible for a decline in revenue, without any compensating advantage in the way of additional employment, as the Minister has suggested. Possibly there has been a slight increase from licence-fees for additional bond houses, but that is a relatively minor matter, and will not affect materially the deficit of approximately £20,000,000 for the current financial year. It is regrettable that the Government should have played right into the hands of the biggest whisky combine in the world. This particular duty strikes a definite blow at a great many traders in this country, and it will do nothing to improve the quality of the whisky consumed in Australia. On the contrary, it will limit the consumption, of the good quality draught whisky; it will restrict rather than extend employment, and will mean a substantial loss in revenue. I hope that the committee will agree to the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn).",38
171,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wakefield) [5.28] I very much regret that the Minister did not submit these new spirit duties to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. We should then have had an open inquiry, and been in a better position to judge the merits of the duty now under consideration. The circumstances surrounding the imposition of these duties on spirits arouse suspicion concerning the bona fides of many of the Government's tariff proposals. As the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) has explained, this additional duty on bottled imported whisky benefits one of the biggest combines in the world. The principle was introduced first in the excise regulations. In that form it benefited a well known Australian company in which Mr. John Wren is largely interested. In the general debate on the tariff, I quoted figures' showing how this discrimination between one set of distillers and another benefited particularly the Federal Distilleries Limited, and when the committee is considering the excise tariff, I shall make a more detailed examination of the proposal. The introduction of this principle in the November excise tariff of 1929 caused great consternation among publicans and wine and spirit merchants, and as a result of the agitation which followed, a circular was sent to every member of this Parliament from the Licensed Victuallers Association of Queensland, explaining how the new proposal affected its members. A little in another tariff schedule, this objectionable principle of discriminating in favour of the big interests to the detriment of smaller traders was extended to imported spirits. Since this attempt to distinguish between spirits bottled in bond and spirits removed from bond in bulk is not, strictly speaking, a revenue question, it should have been submitted to the Tariff Board. Had that course been taken and an investigation made, we should not have heard many of the rumours that have been in circulation during the last eighteen months with regard to this and many other items in the schedule. In its original form the duty applied to gin, whisky and brandy. Strangely enough the brandy makers did not ask for it.",39
172,Mr KEANE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How can the honourable member say that?,39
173,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Ver y many brandy distillers are among my constituents. Naturally I know what are their views upon this matter.,39
174,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There has been no objection from brandy distillers.,39
175,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I admit that someparticularly the big brandy makersderive some benefit from it, and naturally they are now well disposed towards this discriminating duty. Some have told me that they approve of it, but they have also said that they did not ask for it. It is interesting.to note that rum, which is produced in Queensland, has been omitted from the list of spirits upon which this handicap has been imposed. The Minister has said that if we could advance any good reason Avhy rum should be included, the Government would consider it. I am not suggesting that rum should be added to the list. I content myself with protesting against the action of the Government in requiring the smaller traders in otlier potable spirits imported or produced in Australia to bear the expense of this economic waste, in the interests of the bigger concerns. The principle is most objectionable. It is regrettable that all these new spirit duties were not referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. By failing to take this course, the Minister, I suggest, did not observe the provisions of the Tariff Board Act, which require him to refer to the board for later, inquiry and report any request for, among other things, new, increased or reduced duties, or the deferment of existing or proposed deferred duties. It cannot be claimed that this duty is revenue-producing. The Minister has admitted that its effect on the revenue is trivial, the only additional revenue received from it being in respect of licensing fees for a few extra bonded stores. It is also an infringement of the spirit of the Constitution, which by section 113 lays it down that the control of alcoholic liquor is specifically reserved to the individual States. Under . the hollow pretence of imposing a revenue duty, the Government is introducing something which it professes is in the interest of the control of liquor, but which really has the effect of helping the big interests in the trade. This duty is especially objected to by licensed victuallers, who are not able to carry on their bottling operations as they have done in the past, with an ordinary staff during a slack period. Any bottling they now require to be done has to be carried on under bond conditions. The Minister has said that there are not more than 25 hotels that can afford to run a bonded store in which to carry on these operations. That means that practically all the liquor must be bought in bottles. Then there are the smaller merchants who do not import the big proprietary brands, but who purchase superlative quality whiskies which do not have to be advertised expensively for the purpose of effecting sales. These smaller merchants are put to very considerable expense by having to keep a bonded store. In many cases this regulation is an inducement to prepare whisky for market in such a manner as to prevent its being bottled under the best conditions. When whisky is imported, it is considerably stronger than when it is sold, and it is broken down by being diluted with a certain quantity of distilled water. To be properly broken down, that diluting process should occupy several days. The time taken in this operation does not matter very greatly when a large quantity of whisky is being handled and the bonded store is being used almost continuously. But the expense to a small merchant having a customs representative present while the whisky is being broken down is very considerable, and there is a strong inducement to bottle the whisky before it and the distilled water have been completely "" married "". That alone is a severe handicap on the smaller merchant, and is one of the reasons why this form of duty recommends itself and gives a comparative benefit to those who import on a very large scale. Then again, some of the principal advocates of bottling in bond- I do not say that this applies to the Scotch combine-partiall y avoid expense by the use of a comparatively cheap capsule and label. Upon delivery, the Avhisky is poured either a cask or into the publican's bottles, the distiller's bottles then being returned at a trifling expense. Erom that it will be seen that this boasted protection of the public really amounts to nothing.",39
176,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do they use the same capsule ?,40
177,Mr HAWKEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They could not use the same capsule; but the cost of that which they use is very small. This practice practically amounts to the delivery of the whisky in bulk.,40
178,Mr GKEGOEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It would be too expensive for country people.,40
179,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is too expensive for small people in the cities, as well as for country people. A direct obstacle is being offered to the sale of spirit, because its cost is raised. It is an example of economic waste, resulting in the contraction of consumption. It makes the article sold more expensive, and in the long run increases unemployment. I strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn), first of all because the cost of marketing whisky, brandy and gin is increased and their consumption correspondingly reduced. In addition, a large number of people are being prevented from making a livelihood, and the revenue is being prejudicially affected. Secondly-and this is a very important point-the tendency is to increase the number of public officials. The Minister boasted about the number of new bonded stores there would be, and of the work that would be provided. Only government officials will secure employment. If it were good for the country to increase the cost of goods by adding to the number of government officials employed there might be something in it ; but I do not believe that it is, and I am quite certain that the prosperity of the country will not be increased. But my greatest objection is that this duty further enriches the richest section of the trade-the big importing combines-and makes it difficult for the smaller merchants who handle some of the superlative Scotch whiskies to remain in business. Lastly, apart from what has been done on behalf of the Scotch combine, the track is covered of into the particular Australian firm which derived the greatest benefit when this principle was first introduced into our excise law. I hope that the committee vvill accept the amendment.",40
180,Mr GIBBONS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Calare) [5.43] - The amendmenthas a great deal to commend it. The lowering of the standard of the alcoholic liquor distributed among the community would, undoubtedly, lead to extraordinary demoralization. But the suggestion of the Minister in that direction is not borne out by the facts. The distribution of alcoholic liquor at the present time is such that those who consume it do so with a sense of security because of the close supervision that is exercised over its distribution by the State authorities. If there were any guarantee that this was a protection to the public it would be worthwhile.",41
181,Mr JONES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Do you not think that it is?,41
182,Mr GIBBONS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not. I consider that the existing supervision is a. sumcient protection for the public.,41
183,Mr KEANE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Has the honourable member ever drank really bad whisky?,41
184,Mr GIBBONS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I never drink whisky. That, however, does not imply that I am influenced by the big brewing or distributing monopolies in a way that would prevent me from applying common sense to the consideration of this question. An evil that is developing in connection with the distribution of alcoholic liquors in Australia is the private "" trustification "" of the different factors associated with their importation and manufacture. There is little doubt that if this attitude is persisted in, the tendency will be to curtail the distribution in small bulk lots. No action of mine will place a handicap upon those who aresuffering inconvenience from that over-capitalization. If there is a private trust which operates tyrannically, it is that represented by the great importing and brewing monopolies in the Commonwealth. I propose to vote against the additional duty, and to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn).",41
185,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Cowper) [5.48] I have been rather interested in the. discussion that has taken place on this, the first item of the tariff. It appears to me that it has given the lie direct to the whole of the election propaganda of the Labour party at the last election, and also to subsequent statements made on behalf of that party regarding what would happen when its tariff was introduced. It will be remembered that the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Theodore) stressed before numerous audiences at the last election the iniquity of the action of the Bruce-Page Government in having imposed a tax of 2s. a gallon on whisky. v He assured his hearers everywhere that a Labour government would place no duty upon the food and the drink of the people, especially the working class; that liquor and tobacco would be exempt, and that any additional revenue found to be necessary would be obtained in other ways. Now the Minister has asked the committee not to reduce this duty, because the revenue would be lowered.",41
186,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I mentioned whisky duties generally, because I knew that representations had been made to every honourable member to reduce them.",41
187,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Prio r to the last general election the present Treasurer (Mr Theodore) and other Labour candidates clearly stated that the Labour party believed in the imposition of customs duties to encourage the establishment of new industries, in order to provide employment, and not for the purpose of obtaining revenue. The Minister (Mr Forde) now states that the duty provides the Government with a certain amount of revenue.",41
188,Mr KEANE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But there has been a change in our economic position since then.,41
189,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The statement to which I have referred was made on the 10th October, 1929, and on the 11th December of the same year higher duties were imposed solelj for the purpose of increasing the revenue. Apparently the Labour party has changed its attitude with respect to customs duties and other forms of indirect taxation very rapidly. Prior to and for several months after the last general election, the present Minister for Customs and other members of the party to which he belongs stated that the imposition of higher customs duties would result in additional employment, The Minister mentioned numerous new industries that were to be established, in some of - which he said 5,000 additional men would eventually be employed. A representative of the coalminers totalled up the number or additional men who, according to the Minister, would be provided with employment, and found that practically 1,000,000 additional men would be employed.",41
190,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is nonsense.,42
191,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The industry under discussion provides a typical instance of what has actually happened as a result of the Government's tariff proposals. In so far as the distillation of spirit is concerned, possibly 24 or 25 additional men have been provided with employment, while approximately 2,000 men who were previously engaged in the handling and distribution of spirituous liquors have been thrown out of work. It is estimated that in New South ""Wales 606 fewer persons are now engaged in the handling and distribution of spirit than was the case eighteen months ago. The Minister frequently stated that thousands of additional men would be provided with work, but the facts in this instance disclose that as a result of the higher duties imposed employment has been seriously curtailed.",42
192,Mr KEANE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"""Where did the right honourable member obtain those figures?",42
193,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They were supplied by the Licensed Victuallers Association of New South ""Wales, and I have also received similar figures from the Licensed Victuallers Association of Queensland, and other sources, which confirm my statement. Up to the present no one has attempted to disprove their accuracy.",42
194,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The . decrease, if any, is due to general trade depression and a consequent heavy falling off in the consumption of spirits.",42
195,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister said that these and other duties are imposed to protect industry and to provide employment. But he now admits that such is not the case. In reply to a poiut raised by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), he advocated the retention of the present rates in order to protect the revenue.",42
196,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The consumption of all spirituous liquors has been affected by the depression.,42
197,Dr EARLE PAGE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister should give all the facts in connection with this industry, and tell the committee that, notwithstanding the higher duies, which he said were imposed to provide additional employment, there has been an actual diminution. I have yet to learn that this Parliament is the place in which effect should be given to the desires of commercial combines in this country. The duty now under discussion has been imposed to encourage' the bottling of spirits in bond, but it benefits only certain commercial combines, and is of absolute detriment to those engaged in the business in a small way, such as wine and spirit merchants and hotel keepers generally. I wish to - register my protest against any action which is against the interests of small men, who are as much entitled to consideration as are those engaged, in business on an extensive scale. The Minister, in making a futile attempt to justify the retention of this rate, based his argument on the necessity of only the purest liquor being made available to the public. Surely he recognizes that the purity or otherwise of spirituous or other beverages is a matter for the State authorities. It is his duty to prove that, whisky bottled out of bond is not so pure as that bottled under the supervision of excise officers, and until he can do so the committee should give those engaged in business in a small way the benefit of the doubt. I am glad to see that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) is to receive support from a quarter from which we do not usually expect it. Pair play is bonny play, and I trust that a majority of the committee will support the amendment.",42
198,Mr JONES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Indi) [5.58] - I was rather 'surprised that the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), who is a medical practitioner, should discuss this subject from the employment standpoint rather than from that of public health, which is of paramount importance. ""When I was abroad some yeai'3 ago I had the opportunity and privilege of inspecting certain British industries, including the whisky distilleries of John Power and Sons in Dublin. During my inspection, the process of distillation was fully explained to me by one of the firm's representatives, who assured me that only the best of ingredients were used, and that they were blended in the most scientific manner. I said that in sucb circumstances whisky should be a healthy beverage, and he informed me that it was, but it must be good. As the object of the Government in this instance is to ensure that the public shall be supplied with a pure spirit only, the proposed duty should be adopted. In my younger days I was employed in gold-mining. During a severe epidemic of influenza the position became so serious, ten or twelve or more men falling sick daily, that I conferred with my mate, who occupied an adjoining hut, when we decided that the best preventive was whisky. We purchased a bottle, which at the time could be bought for 7s. 6d., which we shared, and we were the only two out of 400 who were not affected.. During the war, influenza, in a very severe form, was raging throughout Europe, and a conference of medical men, held in London, recommended good whisky as the best cure. From, that time whisky was ordered for those who were suffering from that complaint, but it was distinctly stipulated that the whisky must be of good quality. As the imposition of this duty is to ensure that only brandy of the best quality shall be available, and as that is the main consideration, I intend to support the duty provided in the schedule.",42
199,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Swan) [6.0] - I was somewhat in doubt as to how to vote on this item, seeing that the commodity involved is a luxury, and revenue is needed, but after hearing the remarks of some honourable members, particularly to the effect that under these duties revenue has decreased, I feel that a reduction in the rates may result in higher revenue being obtained. It is extraordinary to find the Government imposing an additional 5s. per gallon on all brandy bottled out of bond upon the flimsy excuse that such an imposition will assist to protect the health of the people. Many honourable members are aware that it was once the practice of whisky consumers to travel a considerable distance to visit some sturdy old publican who retailed a particularly good whisky from bulk supplies. It is remarkable to find that the proposal of the Government in this instance operates only in the interests of big commercial combines, to which honourable members opposite were once very strongly opposed. . Apparently, the Government is entirely disregarding the interests of the smaller men. The late President Wilson 'once said that if big corporations contribute £50,000 towards party funds they naturally expect their interests to be safeguarded. Whose interests are being protected in this case? We have a good idea as to who were being looked after in connection with certain excise duties. If one-half of what we have heard is correct, it is fairly clear that",43
200,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member should not judge others by his own standard.,43
201,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am basing my contention on my experience of the Minister since he has been a member of the Government.,43
202,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member should say what he means.,43
203,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,In this instance a big advantage is being given to certain combines.,43
204,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member should be more specific.,43
205,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The present Minister was not in charge of the department at the time to which I refer. The Minister states that no influence has been brought to bear on the Government. I should like to know in whose interests this thing has been done. Are we to believe that the Government has acted only in the interests of the poor people, in order that they shall have pure liquor ? As has been pointed'out, the payment of an extra 5s. a gallon purchases the privilege of poisoning the people at will ; so long as the Government gets the extra 5s. a gallon, the people do not matter. I should like to know in whose interests this is done.",43
206,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is done in the interests of the people.,43
207,Mr GREGORY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then it is similar to the embargo on galvanized iron! The committee would fail in its duty if it allowed this item to pass. For years the same amount of duty has been charged on whisky brought here in bulk; but the ordinary trader is no longer permitted to import whisky in the way that he imported it in the past. Why should he not have the same right to poison the people as is given to the big combine ? I hope that the committee - will insist on the duty on all whisky entering Australia in bulk being the same, irrespective of the persons importing it. In view of the need, for increased revenue, I am prepared to tax luxuries even more than at present; but it does appear that the big increase in the duties on spirits has decreased, rather than increased, the revenue. The Government would do well to consider a reduction of duties on spirits generally. - Mr D. CAMERON (Brisbane) [6.8] E support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn). In December, 1929, the wine and spirit section of the Brisbane Merchants Association communicated with the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Eenton) in regard to the duty on whisky. The contention raised at that time applies with equal force today. In that letter it was statedAt a meeting of members of the wine and spirit section of the Brisbane Merchants Association held recently, the. special excise of duty of os. per .gallon imposed by your Government was given great consideration owing to the far-reaching effect it is going to have upon the trade generally. For instance, at present nearly every merchant in the State bottles his wines and spirits in his own store, out of bond. Under the new regulation, this procaclure will be abolished a merchant has his own bond. In Queensland, there arc only one or two firms with their own bond-th o cost of licence and customs Hittention being prohibitive for the average firm. Therefore they will all be compelled to either cease business or purchase their requirements in a cased condition from the distillers in the southern States. Most of the wine and spirit houses will have to dispense with easily one-third of their present bottling staff, as it will be impossible to compete with the southern distillers, who will bottle under bond. This factor is not the only aspect to be considered. Take the following:Label-printvrtfi Trade - The Queensland w i ll receive no orders for printing wine and spirit labels, as these will be supplied from Melbourne, as the goods will arrive ready for sale to"" the hotel keepers. Bottle Merchants and Glassworks - Neithe r the bottle merchants nor the local bottle works will be necessary to the wine .and spirit trade if the present Os. excise impost is not repealed. Carters - The bottle, glassworks, and printing carters must be affected by the regulation. In fact, all trades in any way connected with the wine and spirit business must feel in a few months that this new tariff regulation is a serious matter. It will increase unemployment, and will mean that in place of the various wine and spirit stores all employing bottling staffs, they will only be acting as distributors for the southern manufacturers. In the past, the various wholesale wine and spirit merchants have bottled in their own stores without any penalty, and our members would respectfully ask you to use your efforts so that this 5s. bottling under bond impost is removed. At present they are subject to constant inspection by the Health Department, all their wine and spirit departments being compelled to be up to requirements, and the records prove that the members of this association have honourably conducted their businesses. We feel that with your assistance, members will be able to remedy their troubles. Subsequently to that letter being sent to the Minister, he met a deputation representative of the licensed victuallers throughout Australia on the same subject. There has been no change in the position since that time-May , 1930and, consequently, I support the amendment.",43
208,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Warringah) [6.12] - I agree with the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) that this is a most extraordinary proposal, coming from a. Government which practically won the election on the promise of its campaign director in New South Wales that no additional duties would be placed on spirits and tobacco unless if a Labour government were returned. The Government which ""made that promise has imposed duties so high that they have resulted in a loss of revenue to the Commonwealth as well as a loss of employment to many Australian citizens. It is time that a strong protest was made against the non-fulfilment of the promises made at election time. The Minister has not justified the retention of this duty. As has been pointed out, the Government's proposal is in the interests of certain combines in this counprinters in try ",44
209,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sitting suspended from 6.1J/. to 8 p.m. [Quorum formed.],44
210,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Before the dinner adjournment I was pointing out that the Minister has failed to justify the retention of this additional duty on whisky. The honourable gentleman took up a great deal of time in explaining that the duty was imposed as a safeguard to the public health, following upon certain recommendations that were made by a commission which investigated our pure foods legislation. I .submit that that consideration does not arise in. a taxation measure such as this. These additional duties are imposed not to safeguard the public health, but purely for taxation purposes, to obtain more *evcnue for the government of the country. It has been pointed out repeatedly by honourable members on this side of the chamber that this additional impost is distinctly in the interests of the great whisky combine, and is detrimental to those of the retailers and smaller trades people. Why should the Government manifest this great care and interest on behalf of that combine?",44
211,Mr KEANE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Eo r many years the honourable member paid great attention to their interests.,45
212,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member is talking in that maudlin fashion that is characteristic of him. H is interjection has no relevance to my statement. I am asking the Government what justification it has for protecting the combine to the detriment of smaller interests.,45
213,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What combine?,45
214,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The por honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) knows perfectly well additional duty is imposed in the interests of the whisky combine, and that i militates against those of the retail traders. I have here a statement of the case from the point of view of Licensed Victuallers Association of the Commonwealth of Australia, which, I vent submit, affords a conclusive answer to the the defence raised by the Government. The association summarizes its to the duty as follows:I. The additional duty of 5s. per gallon spirits bottled out of bond (on top of heavy customs and excise duties), is an unfair on the retailers of Australia, and prevents them association. from selling bulk spirits to the public at a cheaper rate than bottled proprietary spirits. The retailers are prevented from to the general public an article which it wants, at a cost less than that at which they are compelled to sell the proprietary article.",45
215,Mr JONES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The quality of whisky is not guaranteed.,45
216,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The factor of quality does not come into question. Bottled spirits are just as open to the allegation of dilution or impurit y as are bulk spirits. The association continues2. A tax of this nature is not in force in any other part of the world. I draw special attention to that statement, which takes back my memory to the original imposition of this duty and the rumours that were then current with respect to it . The fact that a similar tax is not imposed in any other country in the world causes me to believe that there is ample justification for the allegations that were then made, and that are still current. I invite the Minister to explain why his Government has departed from a custom that obtains in every other part of the world. There i seems to be some reason of a knock-out nature for this departure, which is not apparent on the surface. The statement proceeds3. The safd tax does not give the slightest extra protection to the public. 4. The said tax does not, and cannot, create any additional employment. 5. The said tax is responsible for practically no additional 'revenue to the Commonwealth Government. 0. The said tax imposes a serious disability on the hotel keepers throughout Australia (99 cent, of whom are not in the position to . establish bonded warehouses in which to bottle that this their own spirits). Honourable members opposite have asked t in what way the combine is assisted by this provision. The answer is clearly given in the last paragraph. The associathe United tion goes on with its reasons7. The real object of the said tax is to prehotelkeepers from selling bulk whisky to public, and to force them to deal exclusively with the proprietary lines of spirits bottled objections by the whisky combine. That is an answer to those who want on to know where the interests of the whisky combine come in . My allegation is amply tax substantiated by the opinion of the Evidence of that nature should have some weight in this chamber if the matter is to be decided on its selling merits, unbiased by ulterior reasons.",45
217,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What are those 1'G £15011S ?,45
218,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member knows them well bulk enough. The next paragraph readsThe tax in question was asked for by. the members of the whisky combine, who are the only beneficiaries under this special tax. In the interests of the public, as well the interests of the retailers, we confidently appeal to you to assist in having this imposition removed. My only interest in this matter is a desire to obtain additional revenue for the country, and to provide more employment. I submit that by retaining this duty the Government will not only reduce its revenue, at a time when more is badly needed, but that it will also decrease employment to a community that is already suffering severely from unemployment as a result of the policy of this Government.",45
219,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Lilley) [8.9] - I cannot work up any particular enthusiasm for the interests of the liquor trade. In my opinion there can be only two reasons to justify the Minister in persisting with these duties, the health of the general public, and the obtaining of additional revenue. The Minister has stated that he is acting on the recommendations of a certain health conference that was held in Melbourne some time ago, but he admitted that he was adopting only portion of those recommendations. would be interesting to discover precisely the nature of the recommendations that are being adopted, and those which the honourable gentleman prefers to ignore. It is well-known that the Government is exceedingly impecunious and is looking about in all directions for additional revenue. Unfortunately, the Minister has not taken the committee into his confidence by stating how much revenue it has derived from these duties, and what are his future expectations. That information is necessary if the committee is to arrive at a reasonable conclusion in the matter. Some little time ago I received correspondence that had passed between the Brisbane Customs Department and a Queensland firm that is importing "" Cairns "" whisky- a very superior article, for which there are not many agencies in the Commonwealth. The firm concerned is in a country district, and asked that it should be allowed to' bottle this whisky, under the supervision of the police. Its request was refused by the Customs Department, which stated that it would be necessary to send a Customs officer to that country town to supervise the bottling, all expeuses incurred to be paid hy the firm. That, of course, was as in an impossible arrangement, as it would unduly increase the price of the articles I urge the Minister to accede to the very strong representations which have been made to him in this matter by the retailers. I am aware that the Government is very desirous of making ends meet, but this is a very poor and inadequate method. It is quite evident that the Government hoped to obtain increased: revenue from this source, but from the figures I have beeu able to obtain it would appear that the only result is the creation of embarrassment and unnecessary expense to the retail trade, and that no protection has been given to the whisky industry. I suggest that the Minister should make a more satisfactory reply than he has done to the criticism that has been levelled at the imposition of this duty.",46
220,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wannon-Minister for Health) [8.12] - I support the action of the Government in this matter. When the Government assumed office it found the exchequer very short of revenue, It and examined every avenue in an effort to discover ways and means to supplement its income. It very naturally turned to the Customs Department, and whisky was one of the first items chosen upon which to impose a heavy duty. It must be kept in mind that the people of Australia stand for a policy of protection. I disagree entirely with those who maintain that this additional duty is intended to bolster up the interests of the whisky combine. However, irrespective of whether that is so or not, the Government has to find revenue, and it considers the imposition of this additional 5s. a gallon on imported whisky not bottled in bond a reasonable one.",46
221,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The higher the duty, the lower the revenue of the Government.",46
222,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If that is so, the logical action is to reduce the excise duty. If one or the other is done, the revenue of the cOuntry must diminish materially. Further, if the duty were reduced tomorrow a nobbier of whisky would not cost a farthing less than it does now. An honourable member says something about Dewar's whisky. That has always been considered a very good whisky, although I am' not a whisky connoisseur. But we have to bear in mind that spirit manufactured in Australia compares; after maturing for a few years, more than favourably with the whiskies manufactured in Scotland.",46
223,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Some of it is chain-lightning.,47
224,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is not. The honourable member must be thinking about some of the bad mixtures that are obtained, at times, in back country towns. The usual brands of whisky, brandy, and rum manufactured in Australia compare favourably with the spirit obtainable in any part of the world. The Government is in need of revenue, and if this duty is removed, it will have to obtain the lost revenue from somewhere else.",47
225,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If every one could bottle, the revenue might be effected.",47
226,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But every one cannot bottle; they have not the facilities for doing so. M!r. GULLETT - That is the injustice of the thing.,47
227,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am aware that is impossible for every one to bottle; but I am concerned about the revenue aspect of the subject. If this duty is removed, the retail price of a nobbier of whisky will not be reduced. It must be remembered that the duty was imposed chiefly to provide revenue. The Government was and is in urgent need 'of money. If the duty is removed, the loss in revenue will probably be between £20,000 and £30,000 per annum. I urge the committee to agree to the item. If subsequent experience shows that the duty inflicts an injustice on those who have no facilities for bottling whisky, the Government can review the matter. I support the item, first, because I am a protectionist; secondly, because the Government needs revenue, and, thirdly, because the removal of the impost will not cheapen the price of whisky.",47
228,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Henty) [8.17] - I make a final appeal to the committee to support the amendment. The issue is simple. I cannot understand the attitude of the Government. There is no case for the imposition of this duty on the ground which the Minister has suggested, that it is necessary from a revenue point of view, as will be shown when we are debating the principal whisky item. In recent years, every time the duty on whisky has been raised, the revenue has suffered, because the consumption of whisky has been seriously reduced. The issue before us is between two parties. . One party has been described, and properly so I am afraid, as the whisky combine, though I do not use the term in a sinister .sense. This party is composed of the five great Scottish whisky firms:-James Buchanan and Company Limited, John Dewar and Sons, Limited, Distillers Agency Limited, John Walker and Sons Limited, and White Horse Distillers Limited. The other party consists of small Australian business men-thousand s of licensed victuallers and thousands of wine and spirit merchants throughout the country. These are the conflicting parties. The imposition of this 5s. extra duty on imported whisky not bottled in bond severely penalizes thousands of business men domiciled in Australia, and with capital invested in this country; but it confers a substantial benefit upon the big whisky comit bine domiciled on the other side of the world, and with all its capital there.",47
229,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Thos e people have put their money into this industry in Australia and are building it up.,47
230,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But thousands of our own people have invested their money in the business here, and they are being penalized by this duty. In a great many instances, they can no longer carry on business as direct importers. It is a gross interference with the liberty of the Australian business man to say that he shall no longer import bulk whisky without incurring a penalty of 5s. per gallon. I appeal to honourable members opposite to support the amendment, because it is in the interests of thousands of Australian people who have invested all their money in Australia. Surely the interests of these should be considered in preference to the interests of the great millionaire whisky trust, the shareholders of which are all on the other side of the world. It is remarkable that this Government, of all governments, should be fighting so aggressively and pugnaciously in the interest of this millionaire concern in Great Britain, and against the interests of thousands of our own people in Australia. I know where this application came from, for it came to me from these very companies, when I was Minister for Trade and Customs. And it came from no one else. It was never even suggested to me that the imposition of this duty would serve any other interests than those of the people who made the application. When the proposal was put to me I laughed at it, because it was so absurd. I told the applicants that it was an impossible proposition. They must have thought that I was very young, or very simple, or very new in my department to expect that I would agree to such a proposition. The choice between the conflicting interests was so obvious. Why should the great Scottish whisky firms be not only exporters from overseas, but also importers, retailers and bottlers in Australia? Why should not our own licensed victuallers and wine and spirit merchants buy whisky wholesale in Great Britain if they desire to do so? Every other retailer in this country can buy wholesale overseas. Why should not our licensed victuallers and wine and spirit merchants be permitted to. buy whisky, brandy, and gin at their discretion at the source of supply? Why should they be dependent on these five millionaire firms, and be obliged to take from them such supplies as the combine cares to dole out to tliem at a fixed price? The whole thing is an outrage upon Australian business interests, and it is amazing that this Government should expect even its own supporters to vote for the proposal.",47
231,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is there a full opportunity for overcoming the difficulties mentioned by the Minister in regard to quality and. proper supervision?,48
232,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Most honourable members know that the best, purest, and least injurious whisky in this country is that which is sold here in bulk. Before the imposition of this duty a man who had £10 to spend on whiskyand who placed an order with one of the wine and spirit merchants for a quantity of bulk whisky, obtained better whisky in that way than he would have done by spending the money on bottled whisky. It is the ABC of the whisky trade that bulk whisky is to be preferred to bottled whisky. Everybody who knows anything about the whisky trade knows that the proprietary bottled whisky is a relatively new, though, sound, whisky. If a person wants the whisky which is least harmful to the consumer, he obtains bulk whisky every time. We know very well that every reputable wine and spirit merchant established for any length of time in our country towns takes a pride in selling a good draught whisky. Such firms used to import quantities of such whisky, and retail it in small quantities to the country people as one of their specialities. In the great majority of cases, it was regarded as a very good whisky. But since the imposition bf this duty, many of these firms have lost that trade, and some of them are going out of the business.",48
233,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They are doing nothing of the kind.,48
234,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Minister for Trade and Customs wants some first-hand information on this subject, I ask him to communicate with the wine and spirit merchants of his own town of Rockhampton. He will soon discover from them that a rank injustice has been done to such firms, some of which have been in the business nearly 100 years. Such firms have been in the habit of selling bulk quantities of their particular whisky to pastoralists and others outback; but now they have to pay a duty of 5s. per gallon for the right to do this business.",48
235,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,They can bottle the whisky in bond.,48
236,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They cannot, for only comparatively few of them have the facilities for bottling in bond. It would uot pay many of them to take out a bond licence. I am amazed that this so-called democratic Government) should have imposed this duty, which is opposed by the licensed victuallers. It is one of the most outrageous little things ever done.  Minister for Markets) [8.27] - On e is puzzled to know why the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) should beat the air so much.",48
237,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A rank injustice is being done, and the Government is playing up to the millionaire whisky firms.  honourable gentleman, in making his wild statements, has forgotten the facts of the case. Almost the last word he said was that the licensed victuallers were against. the imposition of this duty.",48
238,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,So they are.  read to honourable members a resolution in regard to this subject carried by the Council of the Licensed Victuallers Association of Viotoria.,48
239,Mr NAIRN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is the only one of its kind that was carried, and the body that carried it had to resign over it.  not the only one. The resolution reads as follows:That this council is of opinion that the policy of the federation in supporting Australian manufacture should be approved, and that the action of the Federal Government in increasing spirits bottled out of bond by 5s. a gallon is in the interests of the public of Australia, and as long as the federal president, the secretary, and the treasurer pursue these objectives they will have the complete confidence of this council.",49
240,Mr BRENNAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is a knock for the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Parkhill).,49
241,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is not. I quoted the resolution of the Licensed Victuallers Association of Australia, the senior body.",49
242,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The chairman of that council, I am told, was an employee of one of the distilleries specially favoured.  honourable member for Wakefield (Mr its Hawker), who is interjecting, would be else! well advised to consider how the barleygrowers in his electorate will regard his attitude on this subject. In making insinuations against what he calls whisky combine, he is reflecting upon the Australian distilleries, which are the principal buyers of the barley grown his electorate. The barley-growers of Australia are keenly interested in. subject, and the honourable member will find it difficult satisfactorily to explain his position to these producers, for he levelling a serious indictment against them this evening. The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) when oent. he mentions certain names in an effort doubt, to bolster up his pet theory, is using poor form of argument. What has the sales name of any person to do with the buildproportion ing up of an Australian industry? Pracbe tically all imported whisky arrives bulk. It is put into bond, and the importer may do one of two things. He may bottle it in bond under the superinflicted vision of the Customs Department, or may bottle it out of bond in which case an additional duty of 5s. a gallon is imposed. He has then a free hand to do what he likes with the whisky. I am not imputing motives, but I say that the door is left open to him to sell whisky that is not true to label.",49
243,Mr GULLETT,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the Minister suggest that the importer habitually does that?  the door is left open to him to dispose of it in any way he likes. We should, in the public interest, close that door.' We should ensure that the purchasing public is getting an article true to label.",49
244,Mr CURTIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Eve n if an importer pays this tax of 5s., the door is still left open to him to sell whisky not true to label.  an argument in favour of increasing the tax. In any case, the tax is a deterrent only. We do not inflict it upon the imported' so long as he is prepared to give a guarantee that the article he sells is true to label. Is not the public deserving of some consideration in this matter ? Is it not entitled, in regard to the whisky that it purchases, to the same guarantee that it receives in regard to purchases of bread, butter, or anything",49
245,Mr AROHDALE PABKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Why is not this tax imposed elsewhere in the world?  the honourable member is wrong again. The licensed victuallers of Victoria recently passed a resolution in favour of taxing in whisky bottled out of bond. They did that in the public interests. The honorthis able member for Henty also said that this tax imposes a hardship on the hotel keepers in regard to the sale of house is whisky. I cannot understand that argument, because statistics show that of the spirits sold in Australia about 70 per represents single bottle sales due, no to the early closing laws, the greater a part of the balance representing nobbier over the counter. By far the .greater of these bottled spirits would proprietary brands. About 5 per cent, in would represent sales of bulk or house whisky. In view of those figures, I fail to see that any great injustice is being upon the hotel keepers who are he selling house whisky, in oonsequenoe of the imposition of this taxation. I cannot understand ""why the honourable member should not be anxious to. protect public interests, because the public has. the right to get an article true to label whether it be butter, bread, whisky, or anything else. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker) made a most amazing attack upon a local industry-the Australian distilleries. He, evidently, does not want this industry to be established in this country. The statistics show that an enormous quantity of barley is. consumed by these distilleries, and upon making inquiries, I find that most of this barley comes from South Australia and, in particular, from the electorate of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Hawker). Peninsula, which is part of the electorate of Wakefield, is regarded as one of the largest barley producing areas in Australia.",49
246,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is why I contend that whisky should not be overtaxed.  honourable member evidently agrees with me that the growers in his electorate produce most of the barley which is consumed by the Australian distilleries. Take, for instance, the Eederal Distillery. That distillery, for the four years ending the 30th April, 1927, purchased £43,000 worth of barley, and from that date to the 30th of April, 1930, its purchases of barley amounted to £46,770. Those figures exclude the value of barley and other grain used by other distilleries operating in Australia. The honourable member for Wakefield will, in view of those statistics, agree with me that this industry is of great assistance to the barley-growers in his electorate. They are assured of a market at a time when they and other primary producers are faced with falling prices and the uncertainty of sales. The barley^growers have the best market of all-the local market.and it will be lost to them if the Australian distilleries are destroyed.",50
247,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Will the explain how the removal of this special tax of 5s. on whisky bottled out of bond will affect the local distilleries?  /replying to the honourable member for Wakefield, who, this, afternoon, attacked the local distilleries. He referred to them as a huge combine. I am defending this industry and showing that the honourable member should be one of the first to support the distilleries because they are the principal consumers of the barley that is produced in his electorate. He refuses to give protection to this industry in this instance, and to. be consistent he must oppose every item in the tariff that gives any forin of protection to the Australian distilleries. The Government, in imposing this tax of 5s. on whisky bottled out of bond, is endeavouring to protect the people of Australia by ensuring to them an article that is true to label. Yorke Mr NAIRN (Perth) [8.45] - The  Moloney) was asked a very plain question, but he made no attempt to. answer it ; in fact he strictly avoided it. He was asked how the distilleries of Australia would be adversely affected by the removal of the special duty of 5s. a gallon on whisky bottled out of bond. It is more likely that these distilleries would be assisted, because every rise in the price causes a diminution in the consumption, and the interests of the distilleries would be best served by an increased consumption. I do not suggest that the Minister would knowingly mislead the public, but he has drawn attention to a resolution of the Victorian Licensed Victuallers Association, which, if it went unexplained, would be misleading. As a result of that resolution, a federal conference of licensed victuallers was held almost immediately, and the decision of the Victorian body was repudiated. The members of the committee of the Victorian Association resigned their positions, and these were taken by other members. In reply to the statement of the Minister that the hotel keepers favour this special duty, I may mention that I have received circulars frpru the Licensed Victuallers Associations of Queensland and Western AusMinister tralia to the contrary effect. I have personal knowledge that the New South Wales association is strongly opposed to the duty. I alsp have a letter from the United Licensed Victuallers Association of the Commonwealth .of Australia, dated the 29th April, 1931, and the first paragraph reads as follows:I am directed by the federal committee of management of this association representing the hotel keepers throughout Australia to urge you to record your vote against the special duty of os. per gallon on certain spirits (not bottled in bond) when such duty comes up for ratification in the Federal Parliament. That letter shows that the Licensed Victuallers are unanimously in favour of the removal of this impost.",50
248,Mr JONES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What about the health of the people?,51
249,Mr NAIRN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"This duty gives the public no protection whatever in regard to the quality of the liquor supplied. The danger to the public arises from the sale of illicitly distilled spirit. There is no likelihood of cheap deleterious spirit being brought in from abroad, since there is an import duty of 45s. a gallon. Nobody is likely to import inferior potato spirit, or ""moonshine"", in face of that enormous duty. All the deleterious liquor is manufactured locally in illicit stills, and the bottling of whisky in bond affords no protection against that class of spirit. The illicit stuff is disposed of largely through certain hotel keepers, who assist in this dishonest trade. That of hotel keeper takes a bottle - of spirit of a proprietary line, pours out a half or a quarter of it, and fills up the bottle with illicitly distilled spirit. The fact that the bottle was originally filled and corked in bond affords no protection whatever to the public. In one respect, the special duty, together with the other high imposts, encourages illicit trading in Australia. The high charges have increased the price of whisky up to about 85s. a gallon. That is almost a prohibitive price, and it encourages the illicit distiller and the dishonest hotel keeper who is prepared to indulge in this sly trade. If whisky were cheaper, it would not be worthwhile taking the risk of disposing of illicitly distilled spirit. If the owner of an illicit still sold his product at only one-third the ordinary price, he could make a large profit, because he pays no duty. It has been claimed on behalf of the Government that this special duty will cause an increase of revenue. I understood the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) to say that he estimated that about 99 per cent, of the whisky imported into Australia was bottled in bond. If that figure is approximately correct, the amount of extra duty collected on what may be called bulk whisky is negligible, and is likely to be offset by the reduced consumption attributable to the excessive price. Before the late war, whisky of good quality was sold in bond at from 5s. to 10s. a gallon, but the present price of whisky, of about the same quality as that sold by what is called the combine, is from 32s. 6d. to 37s. 6d., a gallon. So far as I can see, there is no justification for that great increase in price, because the costs of production in Scotland are not materially higher now than they were' before the late war. .Many Scottish manufacturers who are operating outside the combine are able to sell whisky here at from 18s. to 20s. a gallon. For the most part this is good, matured spirit, because these manufacturers have not the ready turnover enjoyed by the big combine, and, on the whole, their whisky is held for a longer period than that sold by the combine. Honourable members know that practically every club and hotel of type standing has its house whisky. Since bulk whisky is generally of the best quality, and most hotel keepers pride themselves upon the quality of their house whisky, it is possible to obtain a better whisky from sources outside the combine than from within it. For these reasons the public should not be deprived of the chance of obtaining a good, wholesome whisky at a reduced rate. We should look at this matter from a broad point of view. Why should those who wish to purchase whisky be obliged to pay an extra duty on top of the present high impost? The way in which the prices of all commodities have increased in Australia is absurd. These high prices are one of the serious causes of the reduction of trade, and of the present depression. In dealing with this tariff item, as with all the others, we should act on the principle that the lower the prices at whioh goods can be supplied to the publio, the larger will be the turnover.",51
250,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wakefield) [8.55] The remarks of the Minister for Markets  reply. In the first place, he contended that opposition to differentiation between certain distilleries and others involved an attack upon the Australian distilling industry, to the detriment of the use of Australian barley. What I object to is differentiation between one distillery and another, and in order to make a differentiation between a distillery favoured by the Government and others, the price of Australian whisky is raised. reduces the consumption of the article, and, therefore, reduces the sale of barley.",51
251,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not the honourable member know that a controlling interest in both distilleries in Australia is held the whisky firms who control the distilleries in Scotland?,52
252,Mr HAWKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is the case today; but it was not so when this new principle was introduced. One of the effects of the special duty was to enable one of the Australian distilleries to sell out to another on very favourable terms. The Corio Distillery is not the only producer of whisky in Australia. Milne and Company and Tolley and Company, of South Australia, both produced an Australian whisky, and, before the special duty was applied, their spirit was sold over bar counters in Adelaide at 6d. a nobbier; but the effect of the duty was to raise the cost of the article so that it could not be sold at that price. That was favoring one distillery at the expense of others, and it is that to which I object. There were certain distilleries which preferred to send their whisky out in bottles. They had a very large trade, and did a lot of advertising; but there were the smaller local whisky producers who had certain trade connexions, and who supplied the hotels in their own localities at a price lower than that charged by their competitors. These manufacturers supplied a perfectly wholesome article in bulk; but since the Government has made the distinction to which I have referred, whisky is made more expensive, and the effect has been to reduce the market for Australian barley. However, we are now discussing import duties, and that is where the most serious discrimination occurs. smaller merchants to whom I have referred are being placed at a disadvantage in competition with the big proprietary firms. The Minister for Markets, in view of his experience, should not have used such unsound argument as was employed by him when he quoted the resolution carried some time last year by the council of the Licensed Victuallers Association of Victoria. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. This Nairn) pointed out that that resolution was arrived at contrary to the wishes of the majority of the licensed victuallers of Victoria and of Australia, and consequently the members of the council had to resign. The chairman of that council, by I am informed, was an employee of one of the distilleries that was specially favoured by this new kind of differentiation in regard to duties or an employee of one of its largest shareholders. Naturally he supported the interests of the distillery on the council, to which he was elected because of the position held by him in a hotel which the distillery or one of its shareholders owned. The fact that the resolution was afterwards rescinded, that the members who carried it resigned and that it was overruled by the Federal Council of the Licensed Victuallers Association, shows that the Minister did not display his usual astuteness in accepting it as sufficient justification for his attitude today. I am referring to the Minister for Markets  assist his colleague he has acted on this occasion with an impetuosity which is rare in his case by advancing any argument, good or bad. One would hardly expect it from a man of his experience and acumen. But the arguments against the imposition all hold good. It is practically no safeguard to the public. On the contrary it makes the product more expensive, decreases the revenue, increases unemployment, reduces the market for Australian barley and favours the rich and the strong as against those who are in a small way. I feel confident that the committee will set its face against this most astonishing innovation.",52
253,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney) [9.2] The As the discussion proceeds it appears to me that some very important information is being disclosed, and that we have readied what we might call an interesting stage. In my desire to understand how local distilleries are affected I asked the Minister for Markets for an explanation.  the honourable member that I was replying to an attack made on the local distilleries.",52
254,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But it appears to me, from what I can gather, that the argument that whatever whisky is prevented from being imported by small importers because of the extra impost may be produced by the local distilleries, is counteracted by the fact that it may also be produced by the larger distilleries mentioned by the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett), Buchanan's and White Horse. It seems to me the local combine and the overseas combine are all in the one boat, and that the extra imposition will not affect the local situation at all.",53
255,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It affects the local hotel keeper.,53
256,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But it does not affect the local distilleries, and, as it does not achieve anything from the point of view of providing employment, I must dismiss that aspect from consideration. Then there is the question of bottling; but whatever is not bottled in bond must be bottled by the local hotel keeper, therefore, the argument that this imposition provides extra employment also breaks down, and I can see no warrant whatever on the facts already adduced for the extra imposition.",53
257,Mr COLEMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it not better to have all spirits bottled in bond under super- vision?,53
258,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When the honourable member for Henty was speaking I asked him a question by way of interjection, and gathered from him that the Customs Department has a method of checking bottling by which the public is safe guarded as far as possible. In the circumstances I cannot see that any great safeguard is furnished even if the whisky is bottled in bond. The hotel keeper who wishes to deceive the public will do so, no matter what happens. I am anxious to know what the Government's real intention is. I gather from what has been said that it believes that it is protecting the public and creating more employment, and I also believe that it is anxious"" to secure more revenue. But I feel that the employment argument has been exploded, and also the idea of protection of the public. Therefore, at present, it appears informed to be only a matter of more revenue. References have been made to other statements in the past. I know nothing about them. I take it that the Government is honest in its endeavour to do its best in the interests of the country, but when I realise that this imposition cannot provide extra employment or protect the public, it seems to me that the whole question boils down to that of getting extra revenue. If that is so we might hear something further from the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Eorde).",53
259,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wide Bay) [9.5] - The Minister for Trade and Customs has emphasized the desire of the Government to protect the health of the community, and has argued that a label on a bottle should be a guarantee that the contents of the bottle are true to label. In some districts a man would be a simpleton if he thought that he would get his spirit true to name because the bottle is labelled. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) holds that the Government's desire is to secure revenue; but the Government's revenue proposals were contained in schedules which were laid on the table long before this particular impost was made known. As a matter of fact the real reason for the extra impost has not been given by the Government, or, so far, by members of the Opposition. The real reason is that one distillery was in the advantageous position of being able to sell its whisky bottled, whereas the other, not having the whisky five years old, was not in a position to bottle its product, and would, therefore, be obliged to sell at 5s. a gallon more than its competitors.",53
260,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Does the honourable member know that the Corio Distillery has never sold a gallon of whisky, and was always in favour of this impost?",53
261,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It found that it could not compete with the other distillery when this unfair imposition was put on, and it was obliged to amalgamate with it in order that it might get some advantage from this particular impost, and be in a position to market whisky in Australia in the five years that are to come. The Minister knows that the 5s. excise was put on to give a particular distillery in Australia an advantage, and not to provide the public with a whisky true to label. Auy one who would use an argument similar to that with which the Minister has tried to gull the committee and the country, could justly be accused of trying to deceive the public. The whisky that is now prevented from being imported by this extra 5s. a gallon was bought by the publican or wholesale merchants. To-day the combine has the advantage. The publican who sells a whisky as his house whisky assures the public that it will get what it asks for. It is a far better guarantee than can be given by customs officers away in a bond store, seeing that the whisky bottled in bond may afterwards be put into hotel cellars, and opened by any one at any time. Many of our merchants imported their own whisky, and sold it in 2-gallon, 4-gallon, or 5gallon kegs. It was the whisky mostly consumed in. country districts, but the trade is now to be placed in the hands of the few who have the means of bottling their whisky in bond-the combinesunless of course the people who formerly bought kegs are prepared to buy bottles subject to this extra impost.",53
262,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The reputation of hotel keeper would depend on his putting up a good whisky.,54
263,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Abso lutely. A hotel keeper is proud of the reputation his house whisky earns for him. His custom depends to a large extent upon the reputation his whisky gains. If people want whisky in a bottle, well and good, but the imposition of this extra 5s. is not fair. It brings no increase of revenue to the Government, and its sole purpose is the one I have mentioned. It has justly deserved the ire it has aroused among the licensed victuallers of Australia. I remind the Minister that the Licensed Victuallers Association in his own State has all along protested against this imposition. I trust that the committee will not allow this favouritism to continue. It is useless for the Minister to speak about the Corio Distillery. Whatever was done in the past will not affect what is being done today. The Australian distilleries are all one concern today. This duty has not been imposed to give the public anything better than they can get without it.",54
264,Mr BEASLEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Are the overseas interests tied up with the local distilleries?,54
265,Mr BERNARD CORSER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"To a certain extent they are, but the Australian shareholders have an interest in the local concern. Since the Minister has tampered with these duties there has been a slackening in the trade, excise revenue has fallen, employment has been reduced, and the public have not got what they should get. In regard to the Minister's claim that this has been done to protect the public, I remind him that quite recently provision was made to allowmore water to be added to whisky, probably with the intention of enabling the public to buy more water and less whisky. The Minister's excuses are not sufficient to justify an imposition which has proved detrimental to the interests of licensed victuallers, wine and spirit merchants, and the public, and would prove detrimental to the distilleries which might wish to commence operations in Australia in the future, not in association with the existing distilleries. Mr .MARTENS (Herbert) [9.13] - I am not at all satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister for Trade and the Customs (Mr Forde) as to the good that will be done by bottling in bond. It is just as easy to empty into a cask whisky bottled in bond as it is to do so with whisky not bottled in bond. I am convinced of the honesty of the majority of hotel keepers, and I am aware that many hotels have built up reputations for their house whisky. Customers have passed other hotels to visit those where they know they can rely on getting a good house whisky which appeals to their palates. I believe that a great hardship was done to many people, particularly wine and spirit merchants and hotel keepers, when this impositic-s. was made. These people are employing just as much labour as is being employed under present conditions. 1 do not think that the revenue is materially affected. If it is I should like to know to what extent it is. Various arguments have been advanced against the new duty, but the most amusing was the statement by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Parkhill) that this is the country in which it has been adopted. If the new duty had any inherent merit, the novelty of it would not be an objection. - I am under the impression that no other country has a Transport Workers Act providing for the licensing of employees, but the honourable member for Warringah made no protest against that legislation on the score that it was unprecedented. Therefore, the fact that this extra duty on whisky bottled out of bond does not operate elsewhere carries no weight with me. Nevertheless, the Minister will be well advised to accept the amendment, because he can trust the inspectors employed by the State Governments to do what is necessary to protect the public. Any malpractices can be easily punished. A matter of more grave concern to both Commonwealth and State Governments is the illicit distillation of whisky. I recollect hearing of an old hotel keeper who said that the rum he stocked was so good that if , after taking two nobblers man would not fight his own father he was a coward! I am fairly certain that that rum was not bottled in bond. Illicit stills are in operation in many parts of the Commonwealth, and I am sure that the Minister would be very glad to be able to suppress them. There is no doubt of the harmful nature of the spirit they produce. A great friend of mine was in the Townsville Hospital for a long time in a semi-paralyzed state because of alcoholic poisoning. The doctor assured me that his condition was caused, not by the spirits ordinarily sold in reputable hotels, but by the product of illicit stills. The majority of the publicans may be trusted to do rightly by the public - I give no credence to the statement that the new duty has led to a decrease of revenue. Owing to the depression people are less able to buy either whisky or beer, and I have been informed by an officer of the Customs Department that the consumption of beer in Australia this year is 8,000,000 gallons less than last year. I am certain that that would not have occurred in normal times. It is true, however, that people generally are becoming more temperate, and that change may be expected to be reflected in the quantity - of alcoholic liquors consumed and the Mr Martens. revenue collected from customs and excise duties. No good purpose can be only served by continuing the extra duty of 5s. on spirits bottled out of bond. I am certain that the quality of the liquor sold to the public will be the same whether it is bottled in or out of bond. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [9.19]. - This extra duty on spirits-bottled out of bond will not increase the volume of trade done by Australian or overseas distillers. Publicans have been accustomed to buy their spirits in bulk and bottle them on their own premises. On account of the depression many publicans in New South Wales are unable to pay their rent, and if they are deprived of the privilege of bottling their own requirements, they will be penalized, and no benefit will accrue to the public. The new impost will not lead to the distillation of more whisky or to the employment of more people; nor will it give greater protection to the public. Every State Government employs inspectors to police the liquor laws by periodically sampling the of it, a spirits sold in hotels.",54
266,Mr BEBNABD COBSEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Eve n when the spirits are - bottled in bond those inspectors will still be necessary. Mr E. RILEY - Of course. If the publican is required to pay an extra 5s - a gallon for bottling spirits out of bond he will pass the duty on to the public. I shall vote against the item.,55
267,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.21] - I was amused by the statement of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) that honourable members supporting the Government are fighting for the interests of the big whisky combine. I remind the honourable member that, in 1926, when  and Customs, proposed certain duties for the protection of Australian distillers, the honourable member made an impassioned protest against any increase of the duty on imported whisky and roundly condemned the Australian product. On that occasion he fought gallantly in the interests of the big whisky combine in Great Britain. Again, when the honourable member for New England (Mr. Thompson) made out a good case for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the activities of the tobacco combine, the honourable member for Henty, who then occupied the position I now hold, resolutely opposed the proposal. Subsequently, the committee was appointed and made .some very helpf u l recommendations for restricting the - operations of the combine, which the honourable memher for Henty - championed. The extra duty of 5s. a gallon on .spirits bottled out of bond had yielded .£15,000 additional revenue up to the SOth June, 1930. That amount, although not large, is not negligible. The duty had been imposed before I assumed control of the Trade and Customs Department, but I stand by it because I believe it to be in the interests of the consumers, although it does not go so far as the recommendation of the Health Conference in 1927, that all spirits imported in bulk should be bottled in bond under the supervision of a customs official and should be labelled ""bottled in bond by so and so "". Mr COLEMAN,-Why was not that suggestion adopted?",55
268,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If the 5s. duty is not effective we can consider the advisability of going a step further. At any rate it is a move in the right direction.,56
269,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Can the Minister answer the repeated rumour that this duty was imposed to suit John Wren?,56
270,Mr FORDE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Most definitely it was uot. My predecessor, Mr Fenton, first decided that the duty should be imposed. The Government knows no individuals in this matter. The duty has been imposed in the interests of the consumers. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) said that the duty was imposed to give one distillery an unfair advantage over another. When that suggestion first came to my notice I rang up the Corio Distillery and was informed by the manager that his firm was in favour of the extra duty of 5s. imposed on whisky bottled out of bond. He said that as his - firm had to adhere to the strict excise regulations requiring all its operations to be under the supervision of a customs official, the big hotel keeper who wanted to blend cheap imported or Australian whiskies, bottle them in his own cellars and sell them at high prices, should be subject to the same restriction or pay a higher duty. That is a reasonable contention. It is clear, therefore, that the statement of the honourable member for Wide Bay is absolutely untrue. The honourable member for Henty asked how the wine and spirit merchant can import had whisky and bottle it out of bond. The new duty will not prevent that. Many wine and spirit merchants have licensed bond stores, in which they can bottle their bulk whisky under customs supervision. Many people would prefer that there should be no testing of spirits. If a State with 2,000 licensed hotels has only two inspectors a particular hotel may be inspected only once in twelve months and, perhaps, not at all. A prominent official of the Licensed Victuallers Association of South Australia said that his hotel had not been visited by a health inspector once in three years. Probably, the same boast could be made by many other publicans. Those wine and spirit merchants who have not their own bond stores can open a casual bond for a fee of £30, plus a charge of 3s. 6d. an hour for the services of a customs officer. That can be done also by an hotel keeper, but many of those in whose behalf honourable members opposite are speaking do not want customs supervision of what they put in their bottles. Fortunately, that is not true of the majority of hotel keepers; most of them are of a very fine type, but black sheep are to be found in the trade as in every other section of the community. A wine and spirit merchant can open a half-time bond for a fee of £165 a year or a full-time bond-and there are many throughout Australia in which bottling could be done for hotel keepers-for £325 a year. Twenty-four additional bonds have been opened since this duty went on. This provision ensures that the bottling is done, as it were, in broad daylight under official supervision. What is the position of hotel keepers at places such as Sydney, Brisbane, Maryborough, Eockhampton, &c, as referred to by the honourable member? It is provided that where customs officers are located, hotel keepers may have spirit bottled in bond under customs supervision at a charge of 3s. 6d. an hour, so that no hardship is inflicted. In most cities and ports there are certain bonded warehouses which specialize in storing spirits. With the provision in force that all spirits must be bottled in bond or pay an extra 5s. a gallon, the practice will grow up of these bond proprietors bottling their clients' spirits, thus obviating the need for the smaller importers to set up their own bonds. Ninety-five per cent, of the spirits sold are bottled brands, leaving only 5 per cent. bulk. To hear some honourable members opposite one would imagine that the greater part of the spirit sold in this country was disposed of in bulk. Such a contention is all moonshine, as is also the assertion that the best whisky is bulk whisky. Only too often importers get in a cheap line of bulk whisky, put it up in bottles,' and call it best house whisky, after having, perhaps, mixed it with some cheap Australian spirit. The number of hotel keepers whose trade is sufficient to keep their own bottlers fully employed is very small, probably not more than 25 in the whole of Australia. Under this provision, work will be provided for more persons than will lose their employment. It has been shown that an additional £.15,000 has been collected by the Customs. Department as. a result of the duty. While this provision will not go all the way towards achieving that close supervision over the bottling of spirits that was proposed by the Health Conference in 1927, it will at least go part of the way. It will not inflict any hardship upon any section of the community. It has been stated by honourable members opposite that the new provision has resulted in a falling off revenue. Any reduction in revenue has not been due entirely to this duty, or to any other. It may be partly due to such causes, but the sale of beer and spirits all kinds has been affected by the depression in the same way as that of other articles. Every factory is suffering as a result of the depression, and the fact certain persons who have been selling spirits are not employing as many workers as before is no argument against this duty. Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL. (Warrinanswered gah) [9.35]- - The real point at issue not whether the purity of spirits shall be maintained;. that is a matter for the States which have provided for it under State law, and have appointed special inspectors. What really concerns this committee is the amount of revenue which is to be returned by the imposition of the duties, and the Minister has side-stepped that issue throughout the whole of his two long speeches. He admits that there has been a falling off in consumption, but claims that it is due to the prevailing depression. Then why not meet thedepression by reducing the duty, since the public are evidently not prepared to. buy at the price which this duty makesnecessary? In 1913, the duty on spirits was 14s. a gallon, and 2,251,000 gallons were imported. The duty was increased in successive stages to 17s., 20s., 25s... 27s. and 30s. In 1924-25 the quantity of spirits imported was 1,200,000 gallons, a. falling off of over1,000,000 gallons. This was directly due to the increased customs and excise duties, and the result was a reduction in the national revenue. It is not the duty of this Parliament, when discussing the tariff, to consider the moral aspect of the matter, or whether the country would be better off under prohibition. As I have said, our concern is therevenue, and whether the duties areequitable. It has been claimed that theimposition of high customs and exciseduties have resulted in a loss of revenue,, and further, that this duty favours the big overseas distilleries at the expense of the hotel keepers, and wine and spirit merchants, whose money has been invested in this country. The large overseas distilleries, whose shareholders, are in all on the other side of the world, are not concerned with the welfare of this country to the same extent as are the thousands of hotel keepers who are paying of Australian wages to Australian workmen. The big distilleries, it is true, are paying wages to English workers, but we hereare more concerned with the protection of that Australian workmen. I appeal to the committee to vote for thereduction of this duty in the interests of Australian workers,, and to increase the customs revenue. That, after all, is the chief consideration,, and the Minister has not the argument advancedin is favour of it. The Minister has notanswered the claim that a reduction of duty would result in increased revenue,, and' it is revenue we want now when we are facing a deficit of £19,000<,000. TheMinister has also failed to answer the statement of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Oorser) that inserting when this extra duty was first imposed the Corio Distillery waa placed at a disadvantage as compared with another' distillery in that it oould not market its whisky in bottles because it had not been matured for five years. that the two firms have amalgamated there is no reason why the duty should not be removed, but the Government will not remove it because it thinks that the reason for the imposition of the duty would then be too obvious.

PAIRS. (2) When exceeding the strength of proofWhether or not bottled in the Commonwealth under customs supervision subject to such conditions Honourable members will notice that I have reverted to the original - wording of the Customs Tariff 1921-28. During the general debate much irrelevant matter was introduced in the discussion on bottled spiiits. I was sorry to hear the Minister say that be could not agree to a reduction in the duties, giving as a reason his belief that the schedule would produce a greater amount of revenue than would be obtained if the duties wore lowered by 12s. per gallon proof. An examination of the figures does not bear out the Minister's statement. All the items in this division may be regarded as luxury items. This is particularly true of the one under discussion. The moral effect on the community resulting from the consumption of alcoholic beverages does not enter into this discussion. Nondrinkers will not contribute to the Tevenue under these items. Figures supplied recently by the Minister show that there has been a serious and progressive decline in the consumption of imported and Australian whiskies during the last few years. The lessened spending power of the community is, to some extent responsible, but a much more important factor is the exceedingly high rate of duty imposed upon these items. It is a well known economic fact that unduly high taxation will defeat its objective, namely to secure revenue. No one can doubt that the High rates on these items is largely responsible for the serious loss of revenue to the Government. The Ministry would be well advised to Tecast these duties with a view to securing the maximum amount of revenue. Mr ""WATKINS - Does the honourable member propose to deal with the excise items also?",56
271,Mr R GREEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . I take the following extract from a pamphlet entitled, "" The Case for Australian Whisky "" :During times of prosperity, such as we have experienced in the years gone by, it may have been reasonable to expect that there would not be a serious decline in consumption. However, a comparison of the total whisky clearances (imported and Australian) in the as to the bottling and na Commonwealth for the last financial year, to the strength of the ended 30th June, 1930, with those for the year spirits as arc prescribed ended 30th June, 1914, discloses a drop in by departmental by-laws, consumption of more than 1,000,000 proof per proof gallon, British, gallons or practically half the pre-war con33s.; intermediate, 47s.; sumption. general, 48s. Because of a still further reduction in the spending power of the community, the curve indicating the decline in consumption has been much sharper during the laBt twelve months. Nevertheless it cannot bo contended that the lessened spending power of the community for the financial year ended 30th June, 1930, as compared with 1914 explains fully the drop in consumption by practically one-half. For the real reason we must look elsewhere and, as I have already stated, the high rate of duties must be regarded as an important contributing factor. Imports have declined from 1,349,086 proof gallons five years ago to 946,523 proof f allons for the nino months ended 31st larch this year. The average yearly drop is approximately one-third. I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; progress reported. House adjourned at 9.59 p.m.",59
