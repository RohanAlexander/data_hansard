0,NA,Unknown,"Thursday, 24 November 2011 The SPEAKER (Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 09:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA NA Speaker Resignation The SPEAKER (09:01): Today marks my 1,382nd day as Speaker of the House of Representatives. I have at all times tried to uphold the fine traditions of Speaker, and to the best of my ability have attempted to carry out my duties in the most independent and non-partisan manner possible. As members are aware in this the 43rd parliament, to further avoid controversial party political matters I have divorced myself from involvement with the federal parliamentary Labor Party. In this era of minority government I have progressively become frustrated at this stricture. My desire is to be able to participate in policy and parliamentary debate, and this would be incompatible with continuing in the role of Speaker. As a consequence, when I vacate the chair at the end of this short statement, I will the Governor General to tender my resignation as Speaker of the House of Representatives. I thank all members for their cooperation, which they have dispensed to varying degrees depending upon the individual. I thank everyone who works for the Department of the House of Representatives under the capable leadership of the Clerk, Bernard Wright, and Deputy David Elder. They serve us well. My gratitude goes to the diverse range of officers of the Department of Parliamentary Services: from gardeners to guards, technicians and tradies, researchers to reporters, Hansard. They serve us well. To Presidents Hogg and Ferguson, with whom I served as co-presiding officer, and the members and officers of the other place with whom I had interaction, I thank them for their forbearance. All these people ensure that the Australian parliament remains an enduring effective institution. My staff in the Speaker's Office have assisted me and kept me well grounded. I believe that members would agree with me that they carry out their duties with integrity and professionalism. Finally, I acknowledge my eternal indebtedness to my 'trouble and strife', Michele, and the four generations of my family without whose support I would never have been able to achieve the high office I hold. Late yesterday I ascertained that the Governor General is available for my call before 9.30; therefore, I must depart. I go placidly with my humour intact. I wish you all well. Members having risen in their places",19
1,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,"Order, order, order! I thank the House and invite the Deputy Speaker to take the chair.",19
2,Mr ABBOTT,HOLDERS," We have just had something very unusual happen in this parliament and, on indulgence, I wish to acknowledge the importance of the occasion which we have just witnessed-an occasion of which we had no notice. I say that without any criticism whatsoever of anyone. It is a remarkable thing for this parliament to witness, out of the blue like this, the resignation of a Speaker-a Speaker who has served this parliament with distinction for the last four years. Honourable members: Hear, hear!",19
3,Mr ABBOTT,HOLDERS,"I would like to say on behalf of the Liberal and National parties that Speaker Jenkins has been an adornment to this parliament in the chair. He has conducted himself in the chair with good humour, with impartiality, with forbearance and with patience. For that, he has our thanks and our enduring respect. Someone who has been one of the really superior Speakers of this parliament has left the chair-and, while we do wish him well in his retirement from the Speakership and we do wish him well in his re-entry into the internal debates of the Labor Party, one must assume that something extraordinary is happening inside the Labor Party for the Speaker to resign his office to go back into those debates. I simply wish to say, to mark this momentous occasion, that former Speaker Jenkins does have our respect and our gratitude, and whoever is to take his position will have our support and our encouragement.",20
4,Ms GILLARD,HOLDERS," A remarkable thing has happened in this parliament this morning. It is my intention to make some statements about Harry Jenkins later this day when he is in the parliament. As he has indicated, he has gone straight from this place to see the Governor General. There will be remarks that we want to make about him as Speaker; there will be remarks that we want to make about him as a member of the Labor family. But, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will do that later this day when Harry Jenkins is available to be with us. NA Afghanistan Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:08): The government is committed to providing regular reports and updates on Afghanistan, including and in particular to the parliament. This year I have reported to the parliament on four prior occasions, in March, May, July and October. This will be my last parliamentary report for this year. The Prime Minister reported to the parliament earlier this week on Afghanistan, describing the day-today work of our men and women in uniform and our civilians and articulating Australia's future commitment to Afghanistan. I take this opportunity to provide further detail on the Australian Defence Force's (ADF) operations in Afghanistan. There have been a number of developments since my last update in October, including with respect to detainee management, the focus of my remarks to the House today. Detainee Management Australia takes the issue of detainee management very seriously and has a robust framework for detainee management in Afghanistan. In December last year, I announced the details of Australia's detainee management framework in Afghanistan following the Dutch withdrawal from Oruzgan Province on 1 August 2010. In developing our detainee management framework, Australia has had two priorities in mind: first, the critical need to remove insurgents from the battlefield, where they endanger Australian, International Security Assistance Force and Afghan lives, and second, the need to ensure humane treatment of detainees, consistent with Australian values and our domestic and international legal obligations. The detainee management framework draws on applicable international standards and advice from international humanitarian organisations. Under the framework, detainees apprehended by the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, are transferred either to Afghan custody in Tarin Kowt, or US custody at the detention facility in Parwan, or released if there is insufficient evidence to seek prosecution through the Afghan judicial system. Arrangements are in place with both the Afghan and United States governments that include assurances on the humane treatment of detainees and access to those detainees by Australian officials and humanitarian organisations to monitor their ongoing welfare. During my most recent visit to Oruzgan I again visited Australia's purpose-built screening facility at Multi-National Base Tarin Kowt where detainees captured by Australian forces are held for a limited time for screening. Again an opportunity was given to show representatives of the Australian media this facility, reflecting Australia's commitment to transparency with respect to these matters. The facility is structured to ensure the humane treatment of detainees, consistent with Australian values and our domestic and international legal obligations. Detainees are able to freely practice their religion, and provided access to exercise, adequate food and water, suitable sleeping arrangements and other amenities. Resumption of detainee transfers In my last statement to the parliament on 13 October, I noted that Australia had suspended the transfer of detainees to the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS) in Oruzgan in early July this year. The Australian government's decision to suspend detainee transfers to the NDS in Oruzgan was in response to concerns raised by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) about the treatment of detainees in southern Afghanistan. It is, however, important to emphasise that ISAF's concerns did not relate to any allegation of detainee mistreatment against the NDS in Oruzgan where Australian Defence Forceapprehended detainees are transferred. In my last statement to the House, I also welcomed the release of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) report into the Treatment of conflict-related detainees on 10 October this year. The report raised serious concerns about the torture and mistreatment of detainees in a number of NDS and Afghan National Police (ANP) facilities across Afghanistan but found no evidence of detainee mistreatment against the NDS in Oruzgan Province. The Afghan National Police (ANP) headquarters in Oruzgan was listed as a facility of concern. ADFapprehended detainees are not, and have not been, transferred to that ANP facility in Oruzgan. It is important to emphasise that UNAMA found that detainee mistreatment was neither institutional nor Afghan government policy. In addition, UNAMA's report did not raise any concerns about the NDS in Oruzgan, and specifically named this facility as one of two are in Afghanistan where UNAMA had found no evidence of detainee abuse. Despite these findings, the government wished to fully consider the report's implications and seek assurances from Afghan officials. Australia strongly supports a unified ISAF approach to concerns about detainee mistreatment. ISAF has since directed that transfer of detainees to Afghan facilities not identified by UNAMA as a facility of concern may be resumed. Since the decision to suspend transfers was made, the Australian government has undertaken extensive consultations with the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), ISAF partners and the Afghan government. During this process, no basis for concerns with the treatment of detainees by the NDS in Oruzgan has been raised. As a result, the government has now determined that the transfer of ADFapprehended detainees to the NDS in Oruzgan will resume. The resumption of detainee transfers to the NDS in Oruzgan will support ADF operations and help Australian personnel and the Afghan National Security Forces remove suspected insurgents from the battlefield, enhancing the protection of ISAF and Afghan forces, as well as the security of the local population Oruzgan. The detainee monitoring team of Australian officials will continue to work closely with Afghan authorities and security forces to provide mentoring and guidance in detainee management and handling practices. The detainee monitoring team visits detainees who are transferred from the Initial Screening Area to Afghan custody within 72 hours of transfer. The detainee monitoring team already conducts regular visits to monitor the welfare of all ADF apprehended detainees transferred to Afghan or United States custody until the point of release or sentencing. The frequency of the monitoring will temporarily increase following the resumption of transfers to assist in ensuring current standards regarding the humane treatment of detainees are maintained. Efforts to improve detention standards within Afghan detention facilities are also being supported by ISAF at the national level. In close cooperation with the Afghan government, ISAF is undertaking remedial measures in detention facilities of concern, including facility inspection, training in human rights, formal certification of facilities and monitoring the welfare of detainees in the longer term. Australia not only takes our obligations for ADF apprehended detainees seriously but we are also committed to seeing improvements in the wider Afghan detention system. Australian personnel are involved in ISAF's broader program focused on improving standards in Afghan detention facilities. We are also exploring the provision of training on human rights for Afghan personnel in Oruzgan. Through their participation in this ISAF-led process, Australian personnel may become aware of allegations of detainee mistreatment. Any such incidents are reported through the ISAF system. The Australian government is committed to continuing transparency with in the Australian public on detainee management practices in Afghanistan. Australia will continue to work with our Afghan partners, as well as the International Committee for the Red Cross, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan on detention issues to promote the humane treatment of detainees. Update on detainee allegations Australia continues to make clear its commitment to open and transparent detainee arrangements in support of ADF operations in Afghanistan. In the period from 1 August 2010 to 18 November this year, Australian forces have apprehended 1,074 detainees. Of these, 154 have been transferred to Afghan authorities, namely, the NDS in Oruzgan, or United States authorities. The remaining detainees have been released following initial screening. In the same period, I am advised that the ADF has captured 11 people who were subsequently released, and then recaptured. Six of the individuals in question were released as there was insufficient evidence to warrant their continued detention. Of the remaining five detainees, five out of the 11 recaptured, there was sufficient evidence to warrant their transfer and prosecution. Two were subsequently transferred to United States custody at the detention facility in Parwan, and three were transferred to Afghan custody at the NDS detention facility in Oruzgan. I also provide an update on the number of allegations of detainee mistreatment we have received against Australian forces: in the same period 58 allegations have been made against the ADF. To date, 36 of these allegations have been fully investigated and have been found to have no substance. The remaining 22 allegations remain under review and investigation. These allegations and the outcomes of the comprehensive investigations are reported both to ISAF and relevant NGOs. Deployment of an interrogation capability In my March statement to parliament, I foreshadowed that the government would consider further developments to the detainee management framework, including the appropriateness of the length of detention in the Australian Initial Screening Area to enable the possible collection of further information. In my July statement, I advised that the government continued to consider this matter. Ongoing careful consideration of all aspects of this matter and preparation for the possible introduction of such a capability has occurred since then. Today I announce that the government has authorised a team of Australian military interrogators to be deployed to Afghanistan in preparation for next year's northern summer fighting season. The interrogation of detainees is a capability used by other ISAF partners. The capacity to interrogate will allow the ADF to play a larger role in the collection of information against the insurgency in Afghanistan. Interrogation has proven valuable in detecting and preventing insurgent activity. Australian soldiers have a strong interest in being able to contribute to building this intelligence picture. The knowledge that captured insurgents hold can lead us to the location of the improvised explosive devices and weapons caches that cause injury and death. It can also reveal details of insurgent leaders, transport routes and locations. Interrogation can assist us in obtaining the information that we need to unravel insurgent networks and prevent the harm they intend for our soldiers, our ISAF partners and the local population. In addition to the deployment of an interrogation team, the Australian government has decided that the length of time for which detainees can be held in our Initial Screening Area may be extended beyond the current 96 hours for an additional three days, with a possible further extension of another three days. While 96 hours is appropriate for our previous role in basic screening, a longer period of time may be required for more complex questioning of detainees of interest. This approach is consistent with the timelines other ISAF partners such as the United States and the United Kingdom use for interrogation. As well as providing credible intelligence, these changes will support the successful prosecution of detainees through the Afghan judicial system. Australian forces will be better positioned to provide evidence and to determine whether an individual possesses intelligence that could assist our efforts or those of our ISAF and Afghan partners, in addition to determining whether a detainee should be released or transferred. This possibility of a longer period in detention beyond 96 hours and interrogation will not be used for all individuals captured by the ADF. Australia will continue to use the current ISAF mandated time-frame of 96 hours, to establish whether a detainee should be released, transferred or be detained for a longer period. Only detainees who are assessed by intelligence professionals as potentially having information that would make a material difference to the safety of ISAF personnel and the local population will be held beyond 96 hours. Interrogation is an issue that must be managed carefully and sensibly and it is important to be clear about the conduct authorised under these expanded arrangements. Australian Defence Force interrogators are highly trained and ethical professionals. Their duties in Afghanistan will be in accordance with approved techniques consistent with Australia's domestic and international legal obligations. Physical or mental mistreatment has no place in interrogation: interrogation is an extended questioning process conducted by trained professionals within strict guidelines. Such ADF trained and ethical interrogators will not mistreat a detainee. Like all members of the ADF, the interrogators are trained in and adhere to Australian law, and the Law of Armed Conflict and international human rights obligations. This change is consistent with Australia's domestic and international legal obligations. The ADF has established safeguards and oversight procedures, which the government has reviewed carefully and considers appropriate to the rigorous governance measures required. Interrogation will be subject to audio and visual recording through the CCTV system within the initial screening area, and strict approval processes with senior oversight will be followed. The government and the ADF remain steadfastly committed to ensuring that detainees apprehended by Australian forces are treated humanely and treated in a manner that is consistent with both our domestic and international legal obligations. Together, these expanded arrangements will help ensure that Australian forces have a larger, more accurate understanding of the insurgency. Significantly, this will improve the protection afforded to our military and civilian personnel and assist the achievement of our objectives in Afghanistan. In line with the government's strong commitment to openness and transparency, I will continue to provide regular updates on Australia's detainee arrangements, including this interrogation capability. CCTV system In my March report to parliament, I advised that the then acting Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) had advised that some failures of the initial screening area's CCTV recording system had been identified. I advised at the time that the ADF was addressing this issue and had begun to put in place procedures to resolve the matter, including immediate action to ensure continuous footage is being recorded and archived. In my May report to parliament, I further advised that the CCTV system at the initial screening system was functioning and continuous footage was being recorded and archived. In my July report, I advised that there have been no further issues with the closed circuit television (CCTV) system at the initial screening system and that the system was functioning and continuous footage was being recorded and archived. I am advised that there was a recent issue with the system's power supply that resulted in the loss of a small amount of footage. There were no incidents during this short period in which the system was not recording and initial screening area staff conducted visual monitoring to ensure the continued safety and well-being of the detainees. This issue has since been rectified and additional safeguards, including revised procedures for the operation CCTV system, have been implemented. Other detainee matters In my July report I noted the investigation into allegations that the ADF initial screening area team in Afghanistan did not adhere to administrative procedures. I will advise on the outcome of this investigation in due course. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the House and I present a paper tabled in conjunction with my ministerial statement.",20
5,Mr DREYFUS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:25): by leave-I move: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Fadden speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 16 minutes. Question agreed to.,25
6,Mr ROBERT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," I rise to respond to the Minister for Defence's fifth update to the House. He said in his March update, the first of the five this year, that he would seek to make timely, relevant responses on combat operations in Afghanistan and, to his credit, he has kept his word. I note the machinations of this morning and the loss of Speaker Jenkins. Despite having been tossed out nine times in this parliament, I am sure none of which were my fault, I certainly echo the Leader of the Opposition's words that the House has wide regard and respect for Speaker Jenkins. I am sure he will be missed, certainly on the reruns of the Sunday television programs. I rise for the fifth time this year to to the Minister for Defence. Last Tuesday I responded to the Prime Minister's update in respect of combat operations in Afghanistan. I thank the minister for the opportunity to respond to his comments. I note the time the minister spent with respect to transition and the way transition is going. The coalition offers wide, deep and lasting bipartisan support to combat operations in Afghanistan; the bipartisan support is not conditional, except on the national interest. Whilst bipartisan support is given freely and given widely with great trust, we do acknowledge that it is not a blank cheque. We do expect to be kept updated, both publicly through the House and privately through the statutes of the House. I acknowledge that the minister does both of those to his enduring credit. The Lisbon treaty set the transition date for 2014, a date the coalition accepts and acknowledges. The government, to their credit, has also reinforced this by making it clear that any withdrawal from Afghanistan will be metrics-based and based on a sound judgment at a command level. We believe the government continues to hold to that account and I note the minister's comments on transition that we have now moved to a stage of mobile mentoring teams. We are moving away from an establishment of 30 footprints and forward patrol bases to manning 11 bases, and the minister hopes to have the permanent manning down to four patrol bases with the extensive use of the mobile mentoring teams to make up for the reduced footprint of Australian soldiers. I note the minister's comments that the transition is going well. In terms of stability, economics, infrastructure and construction, things continue to improve. The Leader of the Opposition and I were at the forward patrol base in the upper reaches of the Mirabad Valley, six kilometres outside Tarin respond Kowt, in October 2010, when a massive firefight was underway to capture the ridgeline above the Mirabad Valley. In May 2011 I went back to that patrol base and sat down with the leaders of the community, including a number of former mujaheddin fighters, in a traditional shura for an hour and a half. The issues of security, defence and insurgency were not raised once in that hour and a half, yet six months before there was a brutal firefight on that ridgeline to capture the area. Six months later, such was the degree of security that in that one and a half hours of discussion the issues raised included: when is the road coming to the Mirabad Valley? Thank you for the mosque. When are we looking at replacement crops for poppies? How are we dealing with economic activity? When is the school replacement going in? How is the issue of markets being addressed? There is no greater example of the transition from combat operations to economic activity than in the Musaza'i patrol base, seven kilometres outside Tarin Kowt in the Mirabad valley. Its testimony adds value and weight to the minister's words that the transition is moving sensibly and appropriately. With respect to the minister's announcement, the coalition supports the commencement of the transfer of detainees to the Afghan National Director of Security, the NDS. It is fundamental that the NDS within Oruzgan are capable, are appropriate, have enough staff and resources and the proper processes to enable them to effectively take detainees to prosecute information available to them, to treat them humanely within the rules of armed conflict and, within a civil society, the law, and then release them or move them through to a court process. The minister has provided a range of assurances that the Afghan National Director of Security is operating within these norms. The investigation the minister alluded to has shown that in the Oruzgan facility no non-compliance was found. The coalition accepts that and supports the commencement of the transfer of detainees. We also support the length of time to hold detainees increasing from 96 hours to 10 days, which is in line with our ISAF partners. In the previous four responses I have made to the minister-in March, May, July and October-I have called consistently for a number of things to occur, including for the time to hold detainees to be widened from 96 hours to the full 10 days in line with our ISAF partners. The minister, to his credit, has agreed to that and has given the instruction for that to occur. That will give the military a whole range of options to use. It is important that in armed conflict, which is ostensibly a battle of wills, we provide our military with the full gamut of combat power and the full gamut to achieve effects on the battlefield. One of the major ways to achieve an effect on the battlefield is a full and proper prosecution of information and processing that into intelligence. It is impossible and has been impossible to fully prosecute that battlefield effect while holding detainees for only 96 hours and, in that, only allowing a limited degree of tactical questioning. In line with that, the coalition supports the minister's moving towards setting up a full primary interrogation centre which allows the full prosecution of information from detainees. Likewise, the coalition supports the full use of our detainee facility. The Commonwealth has spent $5 million on a state-of-the-art ostensible interrogation facility, and we have not used its full gamut of capabilities for 12 months. With the announcement by the minister that a full interrogation capability will be sent to Afghanistan, it will allow us to fully prosecute that information effect on the battlefield. I join the minister in acknowledging that some people may have concerns, especially around the term 'interrogation' and what it actually means. I note the member for Eden Monaro is here. He was in Iraq during the Abu Ghraib affair and played a significant role in bringing sanity to what was otherwise an insane situation. He and I both know, having served operationally overseas, that perception can tend to be a long way away from the fact. Let me assure people that interrogation is as much an art as a science, but it is an incredibly disciplined art and a disciplined science. We are talking about a primary interrogation centre that includes full medical support, full psychological support, substantially trained interrogators and where everything is captured on CCTV. There is also full access for the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations. I can speak with some authority on the issue of interrogation, being a trained military interrogator-probably the only one the House has had for a while, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. Mr Stephen Smith: Forever.",25
7,Mr ROBERT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Or perhaps ever. As a trained interrogator I know patently well what is involved in the art and science of interrogation, how we deploy it and what we do with it. I also say to Minister Smith that I have spent 24 quality hours in one of our Australian interrogation centres. It is very hard to be an interrogator unless you have undergone the process of being interrogated to know how both sides of the fence work. With that experience from my former military days-looking across at the member for Eden-Monaro, a former colonel in the military who has great experience in this matter as well-I can say with some authority that the minister's decision to employ the full gamut of interrogation capability, based on 12 months of deliberation and making sure things will work appropriately, is sound and sensible. It will be managed and monitored. I believe the minister has deployed a one-star general to manage detainee management, so there is tremendous oversight. We will have a full range of interrogators under a suitably senior officer, all videotaped, all managed, with every word and action accountable and this will finally allow Australian forces to fully prosecute all detainees and to seek out, through tactical questioning, the information detainees may hold and the value that information may have. We will be able to determine what is more appropriate for which detainees and which should be held for longer periods of time for the full extraction of information that may be worthwhile and of value. For those who hear the word 'interrogation' and immediately picture Abu Ghraib, I say with great confidence and experience that that could not be further from the truth of what interrogation capability brings to the fore. We are talking about suitably trained intelligence corps officers. As we know, the intelligence corps of the Australian Army is one of the finest and most professional corps. It will do the nation proud in its use of interrogation. I note the minister has told of 1,074 detainees from 1 August 2010 to 18 November 2011. That is an enormous number of people captured on the battlefield or detained at checkpoints because of information that had been gathered. People were detained by special forces because they were persons of interest. This enormous number of people needs to be tactically questioned and their information, alibis, equipment and what they have on them needs to be assessed by an intelligence professional. Decisions then need to be made about what to do with them. With that number of people coming through a detainee management system, it is crucial that we have a viable NDS which we now do as the minister has assured the House, with 154 being passed to the NDS or US forces. That still leaves over 900 people passing through the Australian system, not going to the NDS or the US forces, that the Australian system will either release or now has the opportunity to pass through to a primary interrogation centre for the further extraction of valuable information. I think we can all be assured that our ISAF partners will be incredibly pleased with the decision that has been made. Whilst we look at a number of people recaptured, that is inevitable within a theatre of combat operations. Now, hopefully, with the implementation of the PIC, we will see the incidence of recapturing and redetaining certainly reduced as we can more formally address the issue of information extraction. I note that the minister has said that of 30 or 40 allegations that have been fully investigated, for those who have actually made complaints within our detaining facility, none have had any basis to them. I suggest with some confidence that probably none ever will. I think it is axiomatic that those detained on the battlefield-especially knowing full well that we are a First World nation and we operate within the rule of law, a nation that is accountable, and that detainee numbers will be reported to the people within parliament and that each investigation will have suitable oversight-are well aware of the First World rights that they enjoy within our First World facility, and I note that the Taliban would never afford us even a Fourth World right or, indeed, any of our soldiers such rights. Having said that, we are better than that as a nation. We are better than who they are and what they do in terms of their actions. So it important that we continue to thoroughly investigate each allegation as it arises, that those to date have had no basis, and we will continue to investigate and to show the Afghan authorities, as well as the nongovernment sector within Afghanistan, that we follow complaints to the letter of the law. It is important that our soldiers, sailors and airmen also understand that we will continue to follow those processes wherever we go. I can only assume that the minister will continue next year his tradition this year of updating the House at least every quarter-I see a nod from the minister-to ensure that the parliament is fully abreast of where things are going in Afghanistan. The next year will be a decisive year in terms of combat operations. This year, over the last winter, the Taliban have not regained any of the losses through the last fighting season leading into the next. They have not regained the any of the initiatives. As the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, prepares to transition across from MTF 3 to MTF 4 based on the 8th and 9th Battalion over the Christmas period, it is my expectation, from looking at what our soldiers, sailors and airmen have done to date, that that initiative will not be resumed by the Taliban. Next year we will see a transitioning down from more patrol bases to mobile mentoring teams. It will see the further destruction of the intelligence, communications and command elements of the Taliban, and further economic development within the community. Let us not underestimate the value of economic activity or the work that the Provincial Reconstruction Team is doing. When the sealed road from Chora to Tarin Kowt went in, the price of palm oil in Chora, that used to be seven times that in Tarin is Kowt, dropped to only twice that price. That type of productivity improvement-using the noting language we would use in parliament-is fundamental to the lives of people. And whilst many of the people will question the legitimacy of the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Jawara, it is incredibly difficult to say that the ISAF forces are not delivering value when suddenly the price of palm oil has dropped from seven times down to two. It is a tangible reminder of the value of what we are doing in this theatre. I thank the minister again for his update to the House. He knows that the government enjoys full coalition support in the prosecution of combat operations. The coalition support the minister's announcements on the commencement of the transfer of detainees to NDS, the ability to hold from 96 hours to 10 days. We support the implementation of the PIC and the full use of the detaining facility. I thank the minister for his update to the House. NA Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth-Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:41): I thank the member for his remarks and his good-natured and professional cooperation on these issues, and also for his support on the matters I have announced. Mr Deputy Speaker, I wonder whether I could ask the indulgence of the House to make a personal explanation.",27
8,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS, Does the minister claim to have been misrepresented? Mr STEPHEN SMITH: I do.,29
9,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," proceed. Mr STEPHEN SMITH: Thank you. I have been very badly misrepresented in today's Financial Review in the story on page 1, entitled 'Gillard bows to US on submarines'. Firstly, the story is wrong. It frankly a nonsense. There has been no pressure on Australia from the United States or any country about these issues. The story is a fabrication. At the end of the story it says: A spokesman for Mr Smith declined to comment. No approach was made to my office or to me by the newspaper or the journalist concerned about these issues in respect of which there is a very serious misrepresentation. The story is wrong. It is a nonsense. NA Corporations Amendment (Further Future of Financial Advice Measures) Bill 2011 First Reading Bill-by leave-and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Shorten. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",29
10,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (09:43): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I introduce a bill to amend the Corporations Act 2001 to bring into effect significant reform to the regulation of financial advice, which in turn will enhance trust and confidence in the sector. Financial planners and those who work in the financial services industry implicitly understand that the brand of financial advice Please needs renewal following a string of collapses including Storm, Trio and Westpoint. I believe that the vast majority of financial planners do see their role as making their dealings with customers such that, after having dealt with the planner, the customer is is better off than if the customer had never sought financial advice to begin with. This is why I am a believer in the importance of financial advice, because we should always endeavour in whatever we do to leave those in our families, in our immediate families, in our streets, in our neighbourhoods, in our towns and in our communities better off than before they had transactions with us. I believe that rule applies in business, in community, in politics and in financial planning. The initiatives in the bill implement part of the Future of Financial Advice reforms, which form the government's response to the inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into financial products and services in Australia. This bill represents the second of two tranches to implement the FOFA reform package, with the first tranche being introduced into this House last month. The bill includes two key measures representing integral components of the reforms which go to the heart of boosting professionalism in the financial advice industry. Firstly, the bill imposes a statutory best interests duty on financial advisers. As its name suggests, the duty requires advisers to act in the best interests of their clients, and put their client's interests ahead of their own. The best interests duty is a legislative requirement to ensure the processes and motivations of financial advisers are focused on what is best for their clients. It is true this will ultimately lead to better advice in many cases, but first and foremost it is about regulating conflicts, not the intrinsic quality of the advice provided. The best interests duty does not require that advisers give the best advice. It does not invoke punishment if, with the benefit of hindsight, the advice does not prove to be perfect. It is not about guaranteeing clients the best investment returns on products. In being able to satisfy the duty, the bill strikes a balance between certainty and flexibility for the adviser. The duty requires the provider of the advice to take steps that would be reasonably regarded as being in the best interests of the client, given the client's relevant circumstances. In other words, discharging the duty will be relatively simple in some situations, and more involved where the circumstances are more complex. By the same token, for the adviser that wants certainty around compliance above all else, the general obligation is supplemented by a provision setting out steps which, if satisfied, will be deemed sufficient for the adviser to have fulfilled the general obligation. This is a common-sense proposal which is long overdue. For the majority of advisers, this merely codifies how they already go about their business in dealing with clients. For those advisers that have not always put their client's interests first, this reform will no doubt require them to make changes to the way that they do business. This can only to be a good thing, both for the client and for the advice industry generally. Secondly, the bill implements a key aspect of the government's response to the Ripoll report-a ban on the receipt of conflicted that remuneration by financial advisers, including commissions from product issuers. It is absolutely crucial to the integrity of the advice industry-or any industry involving a high degree of trust and responsibility-that the consumer can be confident that the adviser is working for them. It is only by ensuring that advisers' only source of income is from their clients that clients can be sure that the adviser is working for the client, rather than a product provider. For the most part, advisers will not be able to receive remuneration-from product issuers or from anyone else-which could reasonably be expected to influence financial advice provided to a retail client. If an adviser is confident that a particular stream of income does not conflict advice, then these reforms do not prevent them from receiving that income. For example, in the case of the receipt of income related to volume of product sales or investible funds, there is a presumption that that income would conflict advice. However, this is a presumption only, and if the adviser can demonstrate that the receipt of the income does not conflict advice then such remuneration will be permissible under the bill. But the message is clear-if in doubt about whether certain remuneration will conflict the advice that they provide to client-the adviser would be prudent to err on the side of caution. I should note that, despite this necessary and overdue measure to eradicate conflicted remuneration, I am encouraged to see that a very large proportion of the industry is already moving away from product commissions and moving to a fee-for-service model. This is not only better for the client, borrowed. but also best professional practice. Many professional advisers working under a full fee-for-service model, who have already turned off their trail commissions, will not be impacted by these reforms, except that there will now be a level playing field in the industry as far as legitimate remuneration sources is concerned. Increased transparency of fees will also assist consumers in comparing different advice costs, thereby enabling greater competition across the sector. Also banned is the receipt of 'soft-dollar' or 'non-monetary' benefits over $300, with some exceptions around education and professional development. This creates hard obligations in regard to the practice that industry codes require of their members already. The bill also contains some additional measures in relation to other forms of remuneration. Advisers will not be able to charge asset based fees-that is, fees calculated as a percentage of client funds-on client moneys which are borrowed. Under the current law, an adviser can artificially increase the size of their advice fees by 'gearing up' their clients. While most planners advise their clients responsibly in this regard, such a fee model does not engender the right behaviour and is prohibited under the bill. I should emphasise that there is nothing to prevent advisers under this measure from their recommending a gearing or borrowing strategy to their client. To the contrary, if this is in the client's best interests then they should proceed with such a strategy. However, they will need to charge the client for those services in some other way, for example, by charging a flat fee or hourly rate. Advisers can continue to charge asset based fees on client funds that are not The bill also bans volume based shelfspace fees from funds managers to platform operators. In short, product issuers will not be able to purchase 'shelf-space' on a platform menu by paying inflated fees. Platforms should be incentivised to put the most appropriate products on their menus, rather than lease positions to the highest bidder. Payment flows which represent reasonable value for scale will remain permissible. Finally, while these measures around remuneration are important, they represent a large change to the industry and to individual businesses. It is for this reason that existing trail commission books will be 'grandfathered'. This means that commissions from business entered into prior to the reforms can continue. Of course, commissions on new business and clients after 1 July 2012 will not be allowed. This is a just outcome, and provides an adequate cushion for the industry to structurally transition once the new laws are in place. The government's financial advice reforms complement our commitment progressively increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. You cannot encourage and compel Australians to save more for their retirement without ensuring the system is operating in their best interests. In summary, the measures in this bill support the key public policy objectives of the Future of Financial Advice to improve consumer trust and confidence in the financial advice they receive, and improve professional standards. Debate adjourned. NA Murray-Darling Basin",29
11,Mr BURKE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (09:52): by leave-I rise to confirm to the House that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will release a draft plan for the Murray-Darling Basin on Monday 28 November. In developing this plan, the authority, led by chair Craig Knowles, has worked closely with irrigator groups, environment groups, scientists, local and state community leaders and state and territory governments of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT. The draft plan is required to be built on the foundations of the best available science and to optimise the environmental, social and economic outcomes. Across Australia, everyone understands the challenges we face in the driest inhabited continent. In most of the country we have an ongoing cycle described as droughts and flooding rains. This cycle will not change. is a cycle which presents challenges for our food and fibre producers. It is a cycle felt acutely in the Murray-Darling Basin. Of the water which makes its way into basin rivers and creeks, more than 40 per cent on average to is diverted for human use. We run our river system hard. Inevitably in this debate, arguments will occur about whether a particular policy position is good for irrigators or good for environmentalists; good for South Australia or good for Victoria and New South Wales, for the ACT or Queensland. The guide to the draft plan proposed a recovery range of between 3,000 gigalitres and 4,000 gigalitres as a long-term average. So inevitably, some irrigators will compare the draft plan to the 3,000 gigalitre scenario and some environmentalists will compare it to the 4,000 scenario. A debate about numbers does not answer the question about what we are trying to achieve. What we want to achieve is a healthy, working Murray-Darling Basin. Water, There has been a tendency to look at the extreme scenarios in considering Murray-Darling Basin reform-the years of deepest drought or the years of the highest flood. During times of drought, people have argued the case for reform as if we could prevent a future drought. And in the wet years, I hear it argued that there is plenty of water around and nature has fixed the problem so we do not need water reform anymore. Murray-Darling Basin reform is about the in-between years. It is about the in-between years because you need to keep the system healthy enough so it can approach the drought years with a level of resilience. An example of building resilience is the iconic river red gums. We nearly lost vast tracts of red gums during the last droughtnot simply because of the drought itself, but because the red gums had been living for It years as though there was only ever drought. They had been dry for so long that they did not have a sufficient level of resilience when the drought actually hit. For the health of the system and to flush salt out of the Murray-which is both an environmental requirement and requirement to ensure water is suitable for productive use-we need to ensure regular and strong flows of water out of the river's mouth. That is why I have set the benchmark that the Murray mouth should be open nine years out of 10. This benchmark preserves the basic environmental standards that we need for a healthy working river system. Considering total volumes without talking about the objectives risks delivering on the total volumes without delivering on the reform. It is essential to get the arguments back to the fundamentals of what we are trying to achieve in the Murray-Darling Basin. We want to restore the system to health. Murray-Darling Basin reform has been put in the too-hard basket for too long. This government is committed to reform for the Murray-Darling Basin that will restore our rivers to health, support strong regional communities and sustainable food production. That is why we are making record investments in infrastructure projects to improve irrigation efficiency and get more water back to the environment. And Commonwealth environmental water is being used to help achieve a healthy, working Murray-Darling Basin. When the Murray-Darling Authority presents its draft plan for the basin, it will inevitably generate significant debate. But we should not expect a consensus position. In different parts of the Murray-Darling Basin, communities have different things at stake. That is why when the Murray-Darling Basin Authority presents its draft understandably there will be protests from some environmentalists saying that the numbers are too low and protests from the same people that were burning books a year ago saying that the numbers are too high. a The consultation conducted by the authority over the last 12 months has been significant, and I have also been working with representative groups and organisations as well as state governments across the Murray-Darling Basin. I would add that there has been further consultation conducted directly by this House, led by the Windsor inquiry, to which the government will provide its formal response shortly. I acknowledge the chair of that committee, the member for New England, and his presence in the chamber. It is important to dispel a few myths that were put forward a year ago and that will no doubt be put forward by some again soon. Firstly, there is the myth that we are forcibly taking water from irrigators. This is wrong. If irrigators do not choose to sell their water or participate in our programs, the government has no interest in compelling them to do so. The only water the government has ever bought is water from someone who has an entitlement and decides to put all or part of their water on the market for sale at a price they choose themselves. If people do not sell water to the government, there are still other water traders on the market. The government has only bought a Basin portion of what is put to it each time a tender is run. And if a person who sold the government water wants to re-enter the market to buy either temporary or permanent water, they can do so. different Secondly, there is a water market, whether the government is buying or not. The concept of the Swiss cheese effect within plan, irrigation districts can occur at any time either through irrigators when, in the past, they have sold their entire entitlement to the government or when they have made a similar sale to other irrigators within the catchment. What we will have in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is a sustainable diversion limit that must be reached by 2019. The best thing for communities is to steadily stage water recovery for the environment over time between now and 2019. There is no better time to pursue that transition than now, when allocations against entitlements are at or close to 100 per cent and people have more water because of the breaking of the drought. But this is not only pursued through buyback. It is also pursued through significant infrastructure investment. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has advised that 1,068 gigalitres has already been recovered which will count toward achieving the new sustainable diversion limits. Recently I signed an agreement with the Victorian water minister for the second stage of the Northern Victorian Irrigation Renewal Project. This project will provide a further 214 gigalitres of water for the environment through investment in infrastructure. This project takes the total to 1,282 gigalitres. Based on the remaining investment from the Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure Program, we are projecting an additional 400 gigalitres of water which will be recovered through onand off-farm infrastructure and environmental works and measures. This would take us to 1,682 gigalitres of water recovered for the environment with the remaining water needed to be recovered over the next eight years. The myth that there is rush for communities to achieve the transition is wrong. Any transition will be gradual. The next drought will come and we must not stand still waiting for it. Over the next four years, there will be a prioritisation of funding for infrastructure projects compared to water purchases. These projects make more water available for the environment and deliver an extraordinary benefit in upgrading infrastructure for producers. Water recovery must continue at a steady pace. If we do not do that, we will let communities down horribly and they will feel the pain of required adjustment later. Out of all this reform in the Murray-Darling Basin, at first glance, in the flood years it will not look that different. But we will have a situation in the in-between years where levels of resilience for the ecology of the rivers does not decline the way it used to. And when drought hits, allocations will go down for environmental water holdings just like they go down for irrigation water holdings, but the system will approach the drought in a standard of health that it has not experienced for generations. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to get the reform right, and the responsibility will rest with all of us in this parliament. When the starter's gun fires and the draft plan for the Murray-Darling Basin is released on Monday, there will be people who will see a huge political interest to engage in misinformation, to claim water is being ripped from communities, to claim a whole lot of things. But we should not miss this opportunity, and let us not miss this opportunity. The right reform is better for irrigation, better for communities, better for people who drink from the Murray and better for their water supply. It is better for the one river system that stretches across our continent. We can say we are not going to wreck it; we are going to restore it to health. The government is committed to tabling a final Murray-Darling Basin Plan in the parliament in 2012 that restores our rivers to health, supports strong regional communities and sustainable food production for the future. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to let the member for Groom speak for 11 minutes. Leave granted.",32
12,Mr BURKE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Groom speaking for a period not exceeding 11 minutes. Question agreed to. Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (10:04): This will be news to me as I read it as well, so I am sure it will only go for 11 minutes! I thank the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities for the opportunity to respond to his statement on the Murray-Darling Basin. It has been almost five years since John Howard announced that the Commonwealth government would seek to establish a Murray-Darling Basin Plan to finally put the management of the Murray-Darling Basin on a national basis. As the Prime Minister said at the time: We could muddle through as has occurred in the past, but frankly, that gets us nowhere. Without decisive action we face the worse of both worlds. The irrigation sector goes into steady but inevitable decline while water quality and environmental problems continue to get worse. I give credit to the Labor Party at the time for supporting what was a comprehensive and bold step to provide the necessary national leadership to solve this problem. As the minister has stated, these changes were never going to deliver consensus. Changes on this scale would always be difficult for some. Adjustments to lower water use were a necessary reality but never easy ones. But this is precisely why these changes need to happen in partnership with the basin communities. There are 2.1 million people who live in the basin, and I am one. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you are another. I live right at the top, so I get first go at the water. I think of the South Australians every time. I press the button! If it were a state it would be the equal fourth biggest state of our nation, on par with Western Australia. Another one million people in South Australia rely on the basin for reliable water supplies. Many of the 2.1 million people who live in the basin have invested their lives in providing 40 per cent of Australia's agricultural output, including almost 95 per cent of Australia's oranges, 93 per cent of Australia's almonds and 68 per cent of our tomatoes. I note that, despite these contributions, the minister on Insiders Water, a fortnight ago remarkably stated that the Murray-Darling is not about food security. Minister, just because cotton and wine grapes are grown in the basin does not mean you can ignore the 90 per cent of the other agricultural output that is grown there. Many others not involved directly in agriculture rely on the irrigation industry to provide the economic base of their jobs and their businesses. The minister says that purchases are made from willing sellers. That is true, but there is nothing willing about Paul Pierotti, whose furniture business sales in Griffith have dropped by 20 per cent since the release of the guide. There was nothing willing about the 10 per cent average drop in house prices in the months after the guide was released. As the Labor Party moves to another inevitable policy fiasco, there are people that are left behind. The irrigator can sell out and move to the coast, but the mother with a mortgage is left behind with a diminished asset but the same amount owing to the bank. Unfortunately, the people of the Murray-Darling feel let down by a government that has promoted uncertainty through constant delays in the plan and has chased the political prize of water buyback targets rather than delivering water savings in a way that has fostered a true partnership between the government and basin communities. The government took 18 months to establish the authority alone. This year the draft to the Basin Plan has been delayed three times. These are not just the political views of this side of politics. May I remind the House that these are the considered judgments of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia. The Labor Party, the coalition and the crossbenchers all signed off on the report on the Murray-Darling, which concluded: The Committee heard of grave mistrust of this departmentthat is, the minister's Department of Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communitiesacross Basin communities resulting from the failure of the department to identify and respond to community concerns on a range of issues. In addition, this department has demonstrated a consistent failure to deliver water programs, including strategic water buyback, which is best interests of productive communities. This department should no longer be responsible for delivering these programs. I think that the last part deserves repeating and emphasis. The judgment of this House, including Labor Party members, is that the government has consistently failed to deliver its water programs. Despite these damning allegations, the government has accepted only one of the 21 recommendations made by this committee. These water programs were absolutely essential in delivering a solution to provide environmental benefits at the least economic and social pain. Principal among these was the $5.9 billion that the coalition put aside to help modernise Australia's irrigation network. Such investments would deliver more water for the environment and irrigation communities. However, this government has spent just $245 million on projects which will actually deliver water into the Murray-Darling Basin environment. Only 33 gigalitres of water had been transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, which works out at $7,400 per megalitre of water saved. Instead this government has raided the funds we set aside. From the $5.9 billion Infrastructure Fund that we established, this government has allocated over $2 billion to projects which have nothing to do with delivering water to the environment, including over $200 million for the bureaucratic expenses of its water manager and the expenses of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, and $8 million for an Water, advertising campaign in the Murray-Darling. We must remember that it was always the coalition's plan, right from the start five years ago, to prioritise these investments over the buyback of water. That was because these investments gave communities the best chance to adjust to a future of lower water in the availability. Instead the government has adopted the exact reverse approach. The government had spent $1.54 billion on water buybacks by 30 June 2011. Labor has mismanaged the buyback program and has failed to end the non-strategic buyback of water, despite that being a recommendation of the House of Representatives committee. In its election policy last year, the coalition promised to make the buyback program 'more strategic'. Every year Labor has spent more on water buybacks than planned and less on water-saving infrastructure than hoped for. It is $200 million ahead on water buybacks but $1.25 billion behind on infrastructure investments compared to its original plan. For every one bucket of water the government has saved through investment in infrastructure, it has bought back 24 buckets. The minister is absolutely wrong to say that the Basin Plan will start in 2019. It has started now. For the town of Collarenebri, the purchase of $300 million of water from the Twynam Agricultural Group shut down its cotton gin. For them the plan is not starting in 2019; it is being felt right now. I note that the minister suggests that the draft Basin Plan will be released on 28 November. It surprises me that so many members and senators already seem to have a copy of this draft under their arm. If the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area had as many leaks as the authority, it would be a national disgrace. At the very time that the government should be partnering with local communities to deliver reform, these leaks to stakeholder groups and the media have just added to the angst and uncertainty. Why should Lateline get a copy of the plan before the people of Griffith? Why should the press gallery get a copy of the plan before the people of Renmark? Indeed, why should the opposition have a copy before the people of Dirranbandi? I think that what was most remarkable about the minister's statement was that it barely mentioned the communities of the Murray-Darling. The coalition firmly believes that any Murray-Darling Basin Plan must deliver an equal balance between economic, social and environmental factors-that is, it must deliver a triple bottom line. Everybody accepted that the guide would have to be a social and economic disaster for regional Australia. That is why the government ran a thousand miles from it not long after it was released. It is up to the government now to regain the trust of the people of the basin. It is up to the government to prove that the draft that will be released next week is materially different from what was dumped on communities last year. But the minister has failed to do that this morning. There was no mention of how the government has listened to communities since last year. Only a few days before the plan's release, we still do not know when and where consultations will be held. Once again the government is keeping the people of the basin in the dark. The plan that is released next week will be judged on some clear principles. First, the plan must return water to the environment, but the plan must be about environmental outcomes, not a number. The government must clearly show what the environmental benefits are and at what economic and social cost. Second, the plan must be based on an equal consideration of economic, social and environmental factors. It must deliver a triple bottom line. Third, the plan must provide a detailed plan for the economic and social future of basin communities and involve local communities in true consultation and engagement. Fourth, the plan must clearly show what environmental assets will be watered and when, and it must include a detailed environmental watering plan as required by the Water Act. Otherwise how can we decide how much water is needed if we do not know what we are to do with it? Finally, the plan must take into account the natural limitations of water delivery in the basin. It is simply not acceptable to flood vast parts of private land for the purposes of environmental watering. The coalition will support a plan that can deliver on these outcomes. The problem is that the government is starting from a long way behind. They have lost the true trust of the people in the basin and they have lost the true trust of a vast number of Australians. (Time expired) People Trafficking Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (10:17): by leave-I am pleased to be speaking on the government's anti-people-trafficking strategy. On Tuesday the government tabled the third report of the Anti-PeopleTrafficking Interdepartmental Committee. As Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice, I am the lead minister for Australia's whole-of-government anti-people trafficking strategy. I oversee this collaboration with my ministerial colleagues-the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for the Status of Women-who have responsibility for particular aspects, including the peopletrafficking visa framework, the Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program and Australia's aid program. People trafficking is a serious, complex and international crime. It causes grave contraventions of human rights. All around the world, slavery and servitude remain the daily reality for many of our fellow human beings-and Australia is not immune. That is why President Obama, during his address to the Australian parliament on 17 November 2011, described a 'yearning for liberty and progress', a yearning for freedom. Indeed, President Obama described this yearning for an end to such criminal practices when he talked about those 'women of courage who go into brothels to save young girls from modern-day slavery'. While most identified trafficking victims in Australia have been women in the sex industry, a growing number of people-both men and women-are being trafficked to Australia to work in other industries. For many in our community, the term 'people trafficking' conjures images of women in brothels being kept in sexual servitude. While this is the terrible reality for some, in Australia we are combating people being trafficked and exploited in different settings, including forced labour in construction, hospitality, agriculture and domestic labour. Globally, people trafficking takes many forms: forced or bonded labour, domestic servitude and forced marriage, sexual slavery, organ harvesting, and the exploitation of children. The Gillard government is committed to doing all that we can to eliminate people trafficking in all its strategy in forms in Australia and abroad. Australia's anti-trafficking strategy The Australian government has a comprehensive set of actions in place which targets people trafficking in all its forms, including for sexual and labour exploitation. Since Australia introduced its whole-ofgovernment strategy in 2003, Australian authorities have identified 187 suspected victims. Fortunately, compared to many of our neighbours, the number of victims identified here is low. Our strong migration and border controls and our geographic isolation mean that opportunities to traffic people to Australia are limited. We are, however, a destination country for victims of trafficking, in particular for people trafficked from Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea. While the number of victims is comparatively low, one victim is one too many. That it is why it is important to never lose sight of the impact exploitation has on each individual. In short, it is devastating. People are brought here either forcibly or under false pretences with the promise of a good job or further education. The image of Australia as a land of opportunity is far from what trafficking victims encounter. They are subjected to appalling treatment, often locked up and made to work in slave-like conditions. They are cut off from family and friends. The human face of this crime can be seen in a recent case. A young man was brought to Australia from India to work in a restaurant. When he arrived at his new job, he faced the following conditions: working 12 hours a day seven days a week with few breaks, and being forced to live and bathe at the restaurant. He had limited freedom of movement, was continually abused and his family back home was threatened. In another case, a woman from the Philippines was brought to Australia for what she thought was a marriage. Instead she was kept as a slave. She was forced to work 12-hour days in a shop for little pay, and on returning to the residence of the offenders, where she lived, she worked as a domestic helper performing household chores and providing childcare services. She spoke little English and was culturally isolated. When she tried to flee her passport was confiscated. Cases like these reinforce the need for the Australian government to do all it can to prevent people trafficking and practices akin to slavery, to equip our agencies to investigate and prosecute offences, and to support and protect the victims. This is a commitment that the government is delivering upon. Delivering for Victims Since 2007 the Australian government has provided more than $70 million to support a range of domestic, regional and international anti-trafficking initiatives. During the past year these initiatives have provided support to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and other forms of forced labour, and brought about the successful prosecution and conviction of a number of people traffickers. Australia provides a comprehensive range of support services for suspected victims of people trafficking. Since 2004, the Support for Victims of People Trafficking Program has assisted 187 people-167 of whom are women and 20 men. Of these, 151 were women trafficked into the sex industry, while the other 16 women and the 20 men were allegedly trafficked into other industries. A total clients were on the support program at some point during 2010-11, including 29 new clients referred to the program during the year. The Australian Red Cross provides the support program on behalf of the Australian government, and I thank them for their invaluable efforts. A typical client of the support program is a woman whom I will call Ms J. Ms J was trafficked to Australia for the purpose of sexual exploitation and was referred to the support program in 2006. Ms J gave evidence against her alleged traffickers at trial and retrial. After assisting police and prosecutors, and due to the danger she faced in returning home because of that assistance, Ms J was granted a visa that allows her and her children to live in Australia permanently. Ms J has now been reunited with her children. She is studying and her children have settled into school, and the family now looks forward to a stable future. In 2010-11, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship granted 42 witness protection (trafficking) (permanent) visas-28 to victims of trafficking and 14 to their immediate family members. This is the visa that allows trafficking victims such as Ms J to remain in Australia permanently if they have assisted the Australian Federal Police with a trafficking investigation or the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions with a prosecution and if they are likely to be in danger if they are sent home. Since 2007, the Australian Federal Police has undertaken more than 200 investigations into trafficking related offences. Peopletrafficking investigations are often long and complex and require significant resources. They often include close cooperation with counterparts in source countries in order to break transnational people trafficking of 80 syndicates. In 2010-11, the AFP undertook Operation Burlywood with the Royal Malaysian Police, which resulted in the disruption of a major trafficking syndicate operating between Australia and Malaysia. Since establishing its specialist trafficking in persons teams, Australian Federal Police investigations have led to the conviction of 14 people in Australia for trafficking and slavery offences. Three more matters are currently before the courts. In 2010-11, two people were convicted and a third person was sentenced. The couple convicted ran a brothel and brought five women to Australia from Thailand. The offenders forced all of their victims to work seven days a week, on average for 16 hours a day. The victims were forced to work and sleep in locked premises, and were not allowed to leave the brothel except in the company of the offenders or a trusted associate. Their passports were confiscated and they had their access to the outside world cut off. The offenders forced the victims to work during severe illnesses and infections. The couple were each convicted of 10 slavery charges at both trial and retrial, and in December last year were both sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. These convictions are a clear warning to people who believe they can commit these abhorrent crimes with impunity: slavery and people trafficking will not be tolerated in Australia. They will be prosecuted with the full force of the law. In addition to these strong criminal sanctions, a variety of important civil mechanisms exist to address exploitative conduct. For example, during 2010-11 the Fair Work Ombudsman undertook more than 585 investigations involving foreign workers and recovered more than $510,000 in unpaid entitlements from their employers. The Australian Building and Construction Commission also regulates compliance with wages and entitlements in its industry, and recovered $15,700 on behalf of foreign workers. Regional commitment and collaboration Internationally, Australia is a recognised regional leader in efforts to combat people trafficking and takes an active role in international efforts. Australia and Indonesia co-chair the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. The Bali process provides a strong platform for cooperation between countries in our region with a shared interest in the prevention of irregular migration, including people trafficking. Another key part of the government's national and international strategy to prevent trafficking is addressing the factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking. In 2011-12, Australia will provide $4.8 billion in official development assistance to help reduce poverty and promote sustainable development. The aid program addresses violence against women and children, and includes a number of activities to help combat people trafficking and labour exploitation at the regional level. The aid program also supports NGO projects in the region that raise awareness, strengthen community resilience to trafficking and support victims. Yesterday I convened the annual National Roundtable on People Trafficking. The round-table brings together anti-peopletrafficking NGOs, service providers, support organisations for victims of crime as well as legal, employer and union bodies to implement a whole-of-community approach to fighting this crime. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Minister for the Status of Women joined me at the round-table. At the round-table, we were joined by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, Joy Ezeilo. Ms Ezeilo is currently in Australia for a full program of meetings with agencies and NGOs which deal with people trafficking. The special rapporteur is responsible for assessing measures taken by countries to target people trafficking and to protect the human rights of trafficking victims. Australia strongly supports this mandate and the government welcomes this opportunity to discuss its successes and challenges with Ms Ezeilo. Government focus for 2012 At last year's round-table, the government released two discussion papers for public consultation, one on the criminal justice response to slavery and people trafficking, and one on forced and servile marriage. Both papers sought views on whether the existing offences in the Criminal Code sufficiently cover all forms of exploitation and all forms of slavery-like conduct. I was pleased by the level of community engagement on these issues and at this year's round-table I released exposure legislation on these issues for comment by stakeholders. Also at last year's round-table, I announced funding for non-government bodies to undertake projects to raise awareness of labour exploitation and to provide outreach to groups and individuals who are vulnerable to this. This initiative is an important aspect of the focus we have put on labour trafficking and exploitation in recognition that the sex industry is not the only industry in which trafficking victims are exploited. The Australian government has now provided five organisations with a total of just over $486,000 for this work. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Hotels Association, the Australian Red Cross, Asian Women at Work and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union are the five organisations who have been beneficiaries of the government support. And I would like to thank the agencies which make up the IDC, particularly those dedicated officers in the front-line agencies which provide direct support and outreach to victims. The Australian government remains committed to working in partnership internationally and domestically with nongovernment organisations to raise awareness, bring the perpetrators to justice and protect and support victims. During the coming year, the Australian government will continue to work to strengthen our framework to combat people trafficking in all its forms, to ensure the most comprehensive and robust response possible. Only by working together can we combat this heinous crime. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Stirling to speak for 14 minutes. Leave granted. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Stirling speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 14 minutes. Question agreed to.",35
13,Mr KEENAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," If I may, I will begin, like other speakers have begun today, by paying tribute to the outgoing Speaker, who has now joined us in the chamber. I think all members of the House would acknowledge what a wonderful job he has done in his four years in the chair, and we certainly wish him well as he returns to being the more humble member for Scullin. We wish him well for his future parliamentary career and we acknowledge the authority and the grace with which he presided over the House. And, certainly, Mr Acting Speaker, we would hope that that authority and grace would be something that could be vested in whoever is going to be elected as his successor. I am very pleased to respond on behalf of the coalition to the statement from the Minister for Home Affairs as to the government's response to people trafficking. The coalition welcomes moves to strengthen the law in relation to people-trafficking offences announced yesterday as part of the fourth national round-table on people trafficking that the minister convened with his colleagues the Minister for the Status of Women and the Minister for Immigration. It certainly builds upon the strong work that was started under the previous Howard government and which has been continued since the government changed in 2007. We must however be careful to ensure that the government gets the balance right and that the people-trafficking net does not unintentionally capture those who do the right thing. As this is a government whose record on delivery is littered with failure, blunder error, this must be one area where the government finally gets it right. The minister refers to circumstances where those who have come to Australia have been promised educational opportunities or opportunities and he refers to civil remedies available, including activities undertaken by the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We should be careful to ensure that those who operate lawfully and do the right thing are not penalised or discouraged from pursuing lawful options. Many employers, particularly in the agriculture, tourism and mining sectors, are complaining loudly about the shortage of skilled labour and the large number of vacant positions that simply cannot be filled. In my home state of Western Australia the labour shortage is particularly acute, and we would hate to see a repeat of the circumstances that we saw prior to the global financial crisis, where I was personally aware of businesses that literally closed their doors because of their inability to find labour so that they could run that business. Additionally, the vocational and higher education sectors are large exporters of Australian services, and Australia has a strong international reputation for delivering a high-standard, quality education. The value of this to the Australian economy is between $17 billion and $19 billion every year; indeed, it remains one of our most important exports. We need to encourage the overseas education sector to grow and prosper, not to blunt it. Many in the sector, particularly private education providers, have complained that the Labor government changes have simply gone too far and have directly contributed to a decline in student enrolment numbers. The always present danger is that this and Labor government is addicted to doing the bidding of its union masters. Unions like the CFMEU and the AMWU, for example, have openly complained about the use of overseas labour and demand a return to protectionist work labour market measures-measures that would be disastrous for Australia's already flagging productivity. Caving into these demands can have unintentional consequences, including the loss of productivity and the foregoing of opportunities for growth and expansion. Yes, the coalition agrees with the government that people should not come to Australia with false hope and under false pretences, with promises of jobs and qualifications. But at the same time there must be a balance struck between addressing the lawful desire to export education services and fill jobs that remain empty and ensuring that situations like those that the minister has just described are stopped and eliminated. The contribution of the union movement to the round-table, particularly as they are currently enjoying a return to 1970s policy positions, should be examined and carefully considered to ensure that there is no blurring of the line between the need to stamp out trafficking and exploitation and the desire to implement protectionist measures to pursue unrelated aims. That is why it is vitally important to get this right. Trafficking and exploitation are unacceptable in any circumstance and would never be condoned by any government or political party. But it is crucial for us to get these policy settings right and not to allow measures implemented to be viewed as a means to pursue other unrelated ends. The opposition is well known for its strong stance on all matters relating to protection. We equally have a long standing interest and record in combating cross-border crime. We therefore welcome the opportunity to support any measures that will further this aim and further the important fight against trafficking that has resulted from the round-table process on people trafficking. The coalition believe that we not only have to make laws that criminalise and punish this behaviour but also must ensure that we enforce these laws and that our police, immigration and border protection agencies have the resources to support them to do that job. The coalition is particularly concerned about sustained and deep cuts to enforcement agencies, including the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, which has been savaged under this government, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Crime Commission-agencies which are integral to the fight against people trafficking and agencies that are going to find it harder to that job with less money and fewer personnel. People trafficking is a complex crime and a major violation of human rights. It takes place for a variety of reasons, including sexual servitude, domestic labour, forced marriage and sweatshop labour. Women, men and children can be victims. While there is limited hard information on the number of people trafficked and the target industry in which they are trafficked, evidence suggests that the trafficking of women into prostitution is the major and certainly most visible form of trafficking taking place. It is widely recognised that people trafficking has become well established and, sadly, an enormously lucrative business throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Australia, sadly, is viewed as a destination country for persons trafficked out of Southborder East Asia. There are several reports of immigrants, particularly from India, the People's Republic of China and South Korea, who voluntarily migrate to work in Australia but who are later coerced into exploitative conditions. At this point I would like to acknowledge the work of the former, Howard government in this area. The former, coalition government's response to people trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region has included developing anti-trafficking initiatives between governments and providing aid to the region which is aimed at alleviating the economic and social conditions that allow trafficking to flourish. In particular, the Howard government and Indonesia cochaired two regional ministerial conferences on trafficking and smuggling in the years 2000 and 2003, now commonly referred to as the Bali process, which the minister briefly touched on in his address. In October 2003 the former, coalition government announced additional anti-trafficking measures, with a $20 million package targeting sex trafficking in particular. The package included a new Australian Federal Police unit, the Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Teams; new visa arrangements for victims of trafficking; victim support measures including counselling and legal and medical support, to be administered by the Office for Women; improvements to legislation, making people trafficking punishable by up to 20 years in jail; and a promise to ratify the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Notably, Australia was already a signatory, and this treaty was subsequently ratified in 2005. In 2004, the former, coalition government produced an action plan to eradicate trafficking in persons in support of the 2003 announcement. In the last budget of the coalition government, a further $38.3 million over four years was allocated, including $26.3 million for new initiatives. Since then, the coalition has continued to consider the issue a serious one and has supported a range of anti-people-trafficking measures, most of which have a sextrafficking focus. The newly renamed Human Trafficking Teams of the Australian Federal Police are at the front line of tackling this problem. On behalf of the opposition, I wish to pay tribute to the teams' men and women, who work so hard in very difficult circumstances, investigating trafficking cases and bringing them to court. Of course, we share their terrible disappointment when these prosecutions are not successful. We must remember that, where you find this type of crime, you will find other types of crime, and it is vitally important that the Australian Federal Police is properly resourced to do the job that is asked of it. I am sure all members of this place will acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable for even one person to fall victim to this heinous crime of people trafficking. The coalition broadly supports the minister's statement and believes that Australia does have a very important regional leadership role to play in this area and will continue to support any moves that this parliament adopts to combat this hideous crime. NA Cyber-Safety Committee Appointment",41
14,Mr SHORTEN,COMMITTEES,Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (10:41): I move: That the House concur with the resolution of the Senate. The Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety was established by resolution of the House on 29 September 2010 and the Senate on 30 September 2010. The committee tabled an interim report on 20 June 2011. The resolution of the Senate enables the committee to report from time to time but requires it to present its final report no later than 30 April 2013. I commend the resolution to the House. Question agreed to. Publications Committee Report,44
15,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES, I present the report of the Standing Committee on Publications sitting in conference with the Senate Standing Committee on Publications. Copies have been placed on the table and I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report. Leave granted.,44
16,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the report be agreed to. This morning concluded the last meeting of the joint Publications Committee meetings for the year. I would like to thank my parliamentary colleagues who serve on that committee from both this House and the other place. Much of the committee's work goes unreported, other than the fact that the committee works very efficiently and effectively. As a consequence, not much is known or heard of about the Publications Committee. As much as politicians would like to take responsibility for that, the staff of the committee do a fantastic job ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the committee in a way that delivers service to this place and the Senate. The staff, Mr Dennis Pecar, Ms Anna Gadzinski and Mr Matt Keele, have shown themselves to be thoroughly dedicated to their task and have demonstrated all their responsibilities a way that we should all be proud of their professionalism. Regularly when we talk about reports in this place we tend to actually talk about the substance and probably less about those who actually do contribute in such a real way to make these reports so effective. In the case of the Publications Committee I, together with my parliamentary colleagues serving on that committee, have not only faith but total admiration for the dedication and professionalism shown by the committee's secretariat. Question agreed to. National Broadband Network Committee Report",44
17,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network I present the committee's report entitled Review of the rollout of the National Broadband Network-second report, together with the minutes of proceedings. In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.",45
18,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This is the second report to examine the detailed performance measures provided by NBN Co. and government. It allows direct comparisons to be made between the foundation documents of NBN Co.'s corporate plan 2011-13 and shareholder ministers' letter to NBN Co. of 17 December 2011. The committee noted the financial result of a lower than expected capital expenditure and higher than expected operating expenditure than set out in the NBN Co. corporate plan. These figures could be an early warning that it is costing NBN Co. more to do less than was forecast in the in such corporate plan. The committee, however, has accepted that there are reasons for the differences, but it will watch these figures closely. Value for money for taxpayers is the critical key performance indicator in turning this good concept into an even better reality. Because there are unresolved issues between various stakeholders and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the NBN rollout time frame set out in NBN Co.'s corporate plan has slightly slipped. Providing certainty for markets, investors and consumers demands greater attention from government to resolve outstanding regulatory issues so that no further slippages occur. If these outstanding matters can be addressed quickly, 2012 does have the potential to be the year of the NBN. The move from test sites to broader rollout will engage more people, and see more retail engagement and more innovative strategies and products introduced into Australia. Regional and remote Australia will then finally have the opportunity, through the next steps of satellite, wireless and fibre-to-thepremises, to be better engaged in the economy and services. The committee's last recommendation called for better engagement with the NBN for low-income households and other disadvantaged groups, so that these opportunities can turn into real, ongoing and substantial change for the better in rural and remote communities. Before making some general comments, I would like to summarise our other recommendations. The first of these asks the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to revise the presentation of its six-monthly reports on KPIs to enable information to be compared across years. Recommendation 2 requests department to review its clearance processes to ensure that answers to questions on notice asked by the 57 committee members are provided on the due date. Two recommendations deal with a subject close to my heart, the rollout of the NBN in regional and remote Australia. Recommendation 3 urges NBN Co. to publicise as a matter of urgency its policy and costings for extensions to its planned rollout of fibre, so that isolated communities are aware of how much NBN Co. would charge them. Recommendation 4 emphasises the importance of NBN Co.'s consultation about the rollout of the NBN. During its hearing in Broken Hill in July, the committee heard from several witnesses from that region about the lack of information from NBN Co. about the NBN generally and about likely connection dates. While we are aware that the NBN is at an early stage of rollout, it should be clear that four of our five recommendations seek to improve the flow of information from NBN Co. and the department. This focus arose from two concerns. Firstly, while regional and remote Australia particularly needs reliable and fast broadband, communities all over the country have until recently had no idea when they might be connected to the NBN. While NBN Co. has a public education program, it was only with the release of its 12-month national rollout plan, on 18 October, that many communities had definite information on when they might be connected to the NBN. The committee notes that NBN Co. plans to release its three-year indicative rollout 'early next year'. Annual updates, combined with education and consultation programs, may provide communities with greater certainty about likely connection dates. the Secondly, some of the delays in receiving material from the department have been unacceptable. The committee was concerned that, if these persisted, delays in the receipt of material on KPIs would continue to hamper its work of reviewing the rollout of the NBN. While this report was being cleared through the committee, we became aware of a major change to the term of the interim agreement that retail service providers have to sign with NBN Co. Neither the department nor NBN Co. saw fit to advise us of this significant matter, as just one example of the process at the moment that the committee is concerned about. I would like to thank all committee members, all 57 of them as I mentioned before, for continuing to focus on Australia's need for speed in the development of information communication technology over and above all other policy or political considerations, and what is one of the hotly contested issues in this place. I would also thank the secretariat, who are here today, again for their work on what is a challenging public policy oversight role. As it is the appropriate time of year at present, say Merry Christmas to all in the secretariat and thank you for your ongoing work. I commend the report to the House. Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (10:51): by leave-I rise to make a brief statement on the second report of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network on the rollout of the NBN. As the deputy chair of this committee, I would like to associate myself with the words of the chair, the member for Lyne, in tabling this report. This is the first report to deal more comprehensively with what has occurred to date in relation to the NBN rollout. The first report released by the committee was really a brief overview, while we awaited the first report of NBN Co.. This second report considers the NBN Co.'s report. Importantly, it notes that many of the rollout's milestones and targets have been met. In many areas there have been delays, as the chair has mentioned, and there are issues about competition and providers. We will continue to work through those issues in future reviews and reports. Certainly, 2012 is going to be an important year for the NBN Co. rollout. We have welcomed the 12-month plan released by NBN Co., which is outlined in the second report. Importantly NBN Co. has advised the committee that early in the new year it will be releasing its three-year plan, which is eagerly awaited by the committee and the broader community. Everyone is very interested in knowing what the plan is for that rollout-which suburbs and households will get the benefit over the next three years of the NBN coming to their town. In this area people are not asking why we are doing it, but how quickly can we get it. That is why this three-year plan is so important. The decisions of the ACCC are going to be very important in 2012. We are waiting on a number of those decisions-matters that I are currently under consideration which will impact on the future of the NBN Co. rollout. I suspect that will be the subject of the committee's third report, which is due in June 2012. There are positive signs already as witnesses in the second report say that, due to structural separation, there are new providers coming into providing greater competition. We hope to see more of that and it is something that is positive for the broader community. Like the chair, I would also like to thank the secretariat and all members of the committee for all of their work this year. As deputy chair, I would also like to thank the chair of the committee for all of his work in trying to manage all the committee members. It is an interesting committee and a very important one. The NBN Co. rollout has major implications and benefits, not just for households but also for businesses, for education, for health. That is why this inquiry and these reports are going to be very important over the coming years as the NBN rolls out. I look forward to continuing my work with the committee. Once again, I thank all of those who have been involved, not just in the development of the second report but also in the ongoing work of the committee.",45
19,Mr TURNBULL,COMMITTEES," by leave-I join the chairman, the member for Lyne, and the deputy chairman, the member for Petrie, of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network in thanking the secretariat and wishing them and all the 57 members of the committee–as the chairman reminded us we have-a very Merry Christmas and a break from surveying the NBN for at least a few weeks over the holiday period. However, I must observe that the quality of the reporting and accountability of the NBN Co. remains inadequate. This has been the subject of some criticism and commentary in the report. There are fundamental questions associated with the rollout of the NBN that the NBN Co. has declined to respond to in any meaningful or cogent way. The NBN is so expensive because of the decision taken by the government to build this telecommunications network, this new broadband network, by connecting households directly with fibre. It is well understood that the vast bulk of the cost of any new telecommunications rollout is the civil works and, obviously, the more of that civil work component there is, the more expensive it is. That is why in most markets around the world-almost all markets, in fact-telcos and governments are using a variety of technologies to get the most cost effective upgrade of broadband services that they can. The committee has sought to get some coherent, detailed answers from the NBN Co. as to why it is not considering other technological approaches, in particular the approach of fibre to the node, which, as the House has heard me say before, in the UK will nonetheless deliver 80 megabytes per second speeds for the cost of a third or less of fibre to the home. That speed is way in excess of the speeds demanded or needed by households at the present time or for the foreseeable future. This is a fundamental question. The NBN Co.'s response has been simply to say: 'The government has told us to do fibre to the home and that's that.' Having said that and particularly in the constrainedalso capital circumstances of today with so many financial risks abounding, any company would and should be constantly reviewing the way in which it is seeking to achieve its objectives with a view to determining whether there are more cost effective approaches. One of the other issues associated with this that the report touches on but only briefly is the use of the hybrid fibre coax networks. Telstra's and Optus's hybrid fibre coax networks, which were built originally to deliver pay television and still do so in the case of Telstra's, pass about 30 per cent of Australian households. The Telstra network in Melbourne is currently new running at 100 megabits per second and it is offering that very high-speed service. For a relatively modest additional cost, Telstra is going to upgrade its HFC network in other cities to 100 megabits per second. That is hardly surprising; everywhere in the world pay TV cable networks are used for the delivery of broadband services and, even where there is fibre-to-the-home cable, HFC cable is a very important competitor and a provider of facilities based competition. Every other market encourages the cable to provide competition. Even in markets where fibre-to-the-home networks have been built, governments encourage the HFC owners to provide continuing facilities based competition. Not so in Australia; as we have seen with the Telstra agreement and the legislation supporting it, the NBN Co. will be a fixed line monopoly, and the government has spent billions of dollars to pay Telstra and Optus not to use their HFC network to provide broadband and voice services once the NBN is rolled out. This is not only an extraordinary act in terms of anti-competitive conduct and really quite at odds with policy everywhere else in the world where governments seek to promote that type of facilities based competition, but extraordinarily wasteful. I will conclude on the issue of waste. We should consider that 30 per cent of Australian households will very shortly be able to access 100 megabits per second broadband via the HFC networks that have already been built and paid for. In Melbourne and in other cities that is already available through Optus and Telstra. That HFC network, at the expense of billions of dollars of taxpayers money, is to be rendered obsolete and effectively decommissioned so as not to provide broadband services in order to enable the NBN Co., spending yet more billions of dollars of taxpayers money, to build a fibre-to-the-home network which will provide, so it is promised, 100 megabits per second. In other words, billions of dollars will be spent so that households will have access to bandwidth at a speed which is exactly the same as they can get today from the HFC. That really sums up the wastefulness of this project. The challenge that the committee faces is getting genuine accountability from the NBN Co. So far in the public hearings we have only heard from the Chief Executive, Mr Quigley, and I have to say getting information from the NBN Co. has been like drawing teeth. The NBN Co. has to do better than that. If it were a publicly listed company it would be much more transparent and much more accountable. The great irony of all of this is that, because the taxpayers of Australia own this company, it is reluctantly accountable and accountable to a much lesser degree than if it were owned by a bunch of pension funds or foreign pension funds and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Our resolution as a committee for the new year should be to try to get the same level of transparency and accountability from the NBN Co. as a publicly listed company does-as, for example, Telstra provides. In doing so we should hope-and this may be a triumph of hope over experience, but it is the festive season, the season of hope-that the government would support us in that endeavour.",47
20,Mr HARTSUYKER,COMMITTEES," by leave-I take this opportunity to make a few remarks in relation to the report of the National Broadband Network committee because the committee has the very important function of informing the parliament of the progress of the project. I think the report fails insofar as it does not address the key issues of time, cost and revenue-the three keys to this project-in a meaningful way so that the Australian people can draw meaningful conclusions as to how the project is going in relation to the original corporate plan and in relation to its budget. It is vitally important that the ultimate format of the report reflect this progress. As a committee of the parliament, we have a responsibility to advise taxpayers and the parliament on where the project sits in relation to its progress. My concern is that in a number of key areas the report is deficient. It provides a great deal of information, most of which is already publicly available, and it aggregates that information in a useful format as far as it goes. But there are a couple of key points which are missing. The first point is in relation to the cost of the project and the risk to which the taxpayer is exposed. We saw the abandonment of the initial tendering process for major contracts back on 1 April this year. The NBN Co. had gone out to the market, had received prices from 14 tenderers within the industry but was unable to get a tender which met its budget expectations. That tender process was abandoned and subsequently a deal was concluded with Silcar. NBN Co. advised the deal was within the budget parameters. The committee and the parliament do not know how that was achieved. We do not know what 'within budget' strictly means. We all take a literal interpretation of what 'within budget' means, but we do not know the sorts of risks that the Australian taxpayer has been exposed to in order to meet that within the budget classification. We may have substantial risk in relation to extension of time. We may have substantial risk in relation to industrial disputation or escalation of labour rates. We may have substantial risk in relation to the increased cost of materials. We just do not know. I think it is incumbent on NBN Co. and on the government to allow the sort of reporting which would enable the committee to do its job and to report back to the parliament on that very important issue. On the issue of time-a vitally important issue-the report fails to be provided by NBN Co. with accurate programming information so that the parliament and the Australian people can monitor the progress of the project against the projections that NBN Co. makes, and so that the parliament and the people of Australia can be aware of any potential risks in relation to time blowouts on the project, which ultimately manifest themselves in cost blow-outs. We do not have that sort of detailed programming information across each of the sites or across each of the individual projects within the project itself; we just do not have that detail. We have some general narrative as to which projects are progressing or which projects have been commenced, but we do not have a detailed programming document that allows the reader to sit down and say, 'Well, the work in Kiama is three weeks ahead of schedule,' or 'The work in Armidale has been completed on time,' or whatever the case may be. The reader of this report cannot determine the status of the project in relation to time. The third point I would like to touch on is the issue of take-up rates. The report is grossly inadequate in relation to the take-up of the project. Senator Conroy has been out in the media arguing that, because only two per cent of the people in Armidale have sought to take up the NBN within a particular area, that is irrelevant with regard to the fact that ultimately there will be a switchover and ultimately those people will be forced onto the NBN-so what is the worry? The worry is that the current take-up rates are a very good test marketing exercise and a very good indication of the likely demand for upmarket packages. If people are not rushing to get the basic package of 12 megabits per second, it stands to reason that there is not going to be a great deal of demand for packages beyond 12 megabits per second, and therefore the additional revenues necessary to underpin the project will not be received. I think that these are three very important points that need to be addressed in ongoing reports. I certainly hope that will be the case. I certainly hope that the NBN Co. will be far more transparent in its dealings with the committee into the future and I look forward to improved information being provided to the parliament in future reports.",49
21,The ACTING SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Does the member for Lyne wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated on a future occasion?,50
22,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the report.,50

24,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Main Committee for debate. Question agreed to. Public Accounts and Audit Committee Report,50
25,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES, On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I present the following documents: Report 427: Inquiry into national funding agreements; Report 428: Review of Auditor-General's reports Nos 16 to 46; and the government response to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit Report 422: Review of the 2009-10 Defence Material Organisation Major Projects Report. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the reports. Leave granted.,50
26,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"On 9 February 2011 the committee agreed to conduct an inquiry into the national funding agreements between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The inquiry focused on the implementation of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. This agreement came into effect on 1 January 2009 with its key features including: rationalisation of the number of agreements, a shift from an inputs focus to an outcomes focus, and increased flexibility for the states and territories. The committee has an ongoing interest in achieving value for money for the Australian taxpayer and felt that the distribution of the $45.5 billion in payments for specific purposes under the intergovernmental agreement deserved some parliamentary scrutiny. We found that there was overall support for the new framework and its underlying principles and intent. The committee believes that the new agreement is a significant milestone in federal financial relations and that it has the potential to alleviate some of the historic confusion and discontent within Commonwealth-state relations. However we also found that the implementation of the agreement leaves much to be desired. In particular there were shortcomings with the performance reporting framework, the establishment of key performance indicators and the collection and quality of data. The committee's inquiry also found that the cultural change needed across the Public Service has been slow and that inadequate parliamentary oversight also needs attention. Performance reporting is critical to measuring success, and the committee believes that more work needs to be done. To start with, valid key performance indicators must be developed, followed by the timely collection of better quality data and, finally, this data must be interpreted in a meaningful way. It is essential that KPIs are measurable, relevant and directly related to outcomes. While initiatives are underway to improve performance reporting, more needs to be done. The committee has recommended that efforts are made to streamline reporting by developing a single report for use by multiple agencies and establishing a core set of standard data requirements across key areas. The need for cultural change is another crucial element to ensure the full implementation of the framework's principles. We are aware that cultural change across the Public Service will take time, but it is urgent that the change is actively promoted and encouraged. We have made recommendations to encourage and enforce the application of the underlying principles of the new framework including using staff training to foster cultural change. Parliamentary scrutiny plays an important role in ensuring value for money for the Australian taxpayer. National funding agreements are typically negotiated at an executive-to-executive level, only sometimes receiving parliamentary oversight after signing. As the committee, we found that despite high-level mechanisms for parliament and the public to scrutinise this funding, these mechanisms do not provide an adequate picture of national funding agreements. The committee has therefore made a range of recommendations to enhance scrutiny of the overall process. This includes the tabling of key reviews and reports such as those by the COAG Reform Council and the Productivity Commission. Government statements in reply should also be tabled and the committee has asked for an annual statement by the Prime Minister outlining the contribution of national funding agreements to the well-being of all Australians. The Commonwealth and the states and territories are always going to hold differing perspectives on the best way for funds to be transferred and the balance of roles and responsibilities across jurisdictions. We have even seen some of that played out publicly over the last week. We believe, though, that if implemented effectively the federal financial relations agreement will provide a means to reconcile these differences. It is therefore important to acknowledge the problems identified with the implementation of the framework during this inquiry and also a number of related external reports with similar findings. With this in mind, the committee urges the Commonwealth government to seize the opportunity to take consolidated action to address the issues raised within the framework. With these changes, Australia will be well positioned to continue on the reform pathway in the coming decade. On Auditor-General's reports Nos 16 to 46, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as prescribed by its act, examines all reports of the Auditor-General and reports the results of the committee's deliberations the parliament. This report details the findings of the committee's examination of the 2009-10 financial statements of the Australian government entities plus three performance audits selected for further scrutiny from the 31 audit reports presented to the parliament between November 2010 and May 2011. The Public Accounts and Audit committee reviewed several audits by the Auditor General to gain a broad perspective on the operational effectiveness of Australian government departments and agencies, including audits of the financial statements of Australian government entities: the Digital Education Revolution program, the National Secondary Schools Computer Fund, maintenance of the Defence estate and management of student visas. We were pleased to see another year of positive results for the financial statement audits of Australian government entities. However, to further improve transparency, the committee has asked the Department of Finance and Deregulation to look into improved cross-agency and crossjurisdictional financial reporting as part of the Commonwealth financial accountability review. The National Secondary School Computer Fund looks set to meet its target of providing all students in years 9 to 12 with a computer by the start of the 2012 academic year, but evaluation mechanisms are still unclear. The committee has recommended the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations publicly release the 2012 midprogram review findings within three months of completion. With $20 billion at stake and reports of deteriorating assets due to management issues and a lack of funding, the committee also heard that the management and maintenance of the Defence estate was improving. To ensure to progress continues, we have recommended Defence provide a status report to the committee within six months. We have also asked for a progress report on the student visa program from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations within six months in light of the recent release of the government's response to two major reviews impacting the program and a history of incomplete or unimplemented reviews and evaluations. Overall, this inquiry has demonstrated Australian government departments and agencies are well positioned to continue meeting their financial management obligations. It is also clear that the departments reviewed are making progress in addressing outstanding issues highlighted in the ANAO reports. However, there are still areas of concern. We have seen examples of rushed implementation of programs at the expense of whole-of-project planning and reviews undertaken at significant cost to the taxpayer that remain either incomplete or only partially implemented. I encourage other departments and agencies across the Australian Public Service to learn from the findings of these inquiries. In doing so, I stress to all agencies the importance of reflecting not only on their own performance but also on the challenges, achievements and creativity of others so as collectively find new and better ways to deliver services to Australians. Finally, on the review of the 2009-10 Defence Materiel Organisation major projects report, by convention the Public Accounts and Audit Committee regularly tables government responses to its reports in the form of executive minutes. In tabling the government response to the committee's report No. 422, I wish to note the committee's initial concerns with the content of the response. In particular, I note the response to the key recommendation of the report is not to be delivered until March 2012 when the committee requested it by 31 August 2011-a delay of around six months. The committee will be taking up these issues with the minister. In closing, I sincerely thank each committee member for the bipartisan spirit in which work continues to be done on these inquiries and the ongoing focus on better public administration for Australians. As well, as it is Christmastime and because a lot that of work has been done, I also thank the secretariat of the JCPAA for their good work and welcome the impending birth of the first baby of the committee secretary Mr David Brunoro. I commend the reports and the government response to the House.",51

Question agreed to. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Bombing of Darwin Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) acknowledges 19 February 1942 as the day Darwin was bombed and marks the first time Australia was militarily attacked by enemy forces; (2) reflects upon the significant loss of life of Australian Defence personnel and civilians during the attacks and casualties of the bombings; (3) recognises that the attack remained a secret for many years and that even today, many Australians are unaware of the bombing of Darwin and the significant damage and loss of life which resulted; (4) also recognises the campaign of coordinated bombings against northern Australia involving 97 Japanese attacks from Darwin, to Broome and Wyndham in the west, to Katherine in the south, to Townsville in the east over the period February 1942 to November 1943; and (5) calls for 19 February of each year to be Gazetted as 'Bombing of Darwin Day' and be named a Day of National Significance by the Governor General. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (11:23): Before I begin my remarks on the motion, I would first like to pay special tribute to the former Speaker, the member for Scullin. I thank him for his humour and patience with all of the new members of this House. I am delighted that the Prime Minister, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Labor Party have finally come on board to support this motion on the bombing of Darwin moved by the coalition earlier this year. My motion was never about politics; it is all about my community. My local community is passionate about the commemoration of the bombing of Darwin and about ensuring that all Australians understand our contribution to the defence of Australia in the darkest days of World War II. The bombing of Darwin was the first time Australia was attacked by enemy forces. Bombing raids by Japanese forces over Darwin continued for many months and extended to other northern Australian cities, including Broome, Cairns and Townsville. More than 250 people were killed in the attack on Darwin and many more were injured. A United States Navy destroyer, the US Peary, was also sunk in Darwin Harbour, one of eight vessels sunk that day. More bombs were dropped by the Japanese on Darwin than on Pearl Harbour 10 weeks earlier. The significance of this event was further highlighted only last week by US President Obama, who visited my electorate to lay a wreath on the US Peary memorial site, and he noted that the bombing of Darwin in 1942 was Australia's Pearl Harbour. Since my first days in this parliament I have been a vocal advocate of Australians better understanding the bombing of Darwin and the role Territorians played in the defence of Australia during World War II. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for working closely with me on this initiative, which is something I worked on prior to and after my election to parliament some 15 months ago. Today's outcome is also a significant event for Dr Tom Lewis of the Darwin Military Museum. He has worked tirelessly for a number of years to raise awareness of this event and he was one of the key members of the public who lobbied me to make sure that I brought it to the attention of the House. I also acknowledge Darwin Lord Mayor Graeme Sawyer and his aldermen, who have also been instrumental in ensuring that I raise awareness of this very, very important date in our history. I am delighted is going to be supported and that it has come in time for the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin. I acknowledge the efforts of all the people who have raised awareness of this event. I thank my colleagues Senator Scullion and Senator Ronaldson, who were able to have the same motion passed in the Senate. From now on, 19 February each year will be recognised by all Australians as a day of significance. I thank the House and in particular my coalition colleagues for their support. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Dairy Industry Debate resumed on the motion: That this House notes the importance of the dairy industry to the health and well being of Australia. Question agreed to. Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) condemns the: (a) Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel; and (b) targeting of Max Brenner chocolate cafes as part of this campaign; (2) rejects this tactic as counterproductive to the promotion of the rights of Palestinians; (3) reiterates Australia's support for the two-state solution and the right of the Israeli and Palestinian people to live peacefully within internationally recognised borders; and (4) urges the leaders of the Israeli and Palestinian people to resume direct negotiations. Question agreed to. Child Care Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: that this motion (1) notes that: (a) in the 2010 11 Budget, the Gillard Government has not considered the implications of removing Commonwealth funding for Occasional Care Child Care; and (b) the consequence of ceasing this funding has caused Australian families real hardship as they struggle to find alternative sources of child care; (2) acknowledges that: (a) there are no other Commonwealth funded forms of child care to fill this void; and (b) withdrawal of this funding has resulted in job losses in the industry; and (3) calls on the Government to reinstate Commonwealth funding for Occasional Care Child Care.",54
33,Mr Bandt,BUSINESS,"I seek leave to briefly speak again in this debate to move an amendment. Leave not granted. Question agreed to. Goods and Services Tax Israel Debate resumed on the motion: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues are distributed to the States and Territories in accordance with a formula driven by Horizontal Fiscal Equalisation (HFE) principles and are legislated for in the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009; (b) for 2010-11, Western Australia received just 68 per cent of what it would have received if GST revenue was distributed across Australia on a per capita basis-the lowest relativity applied to any State since the formula was introduced; and (c) every other State and Territory, by contrast, received not less than 91 per cent of what it would have received if GST revenue was distributed evenly across Australia; and (2) calls on the Government to amend the Act to stipulate a minimum GST revenue-sharing relativity of 75 per cent, which would allow continuing respect for the principles of HFE, but with proper recognition for population, and without Western Australia being unfairly penalised for its disproportionate contribution to our national economic prosperity. to which the following amendment was moved: That the House: deletes paragraph (2) of the motion and substitutes: (2) calls on the Government to refer the matter of the minimum share of GST allocated to Western Australia to the GST Distribution Review for further consideration and analysis.

38,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (11:46): I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Today this chamber considers amendments to the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 passed by the Senate last night. This government is unequivocally of the view that family violence and abuse of children are entirely unacceptable. The amendments respond to recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. These amendments will simplify the bill, deliver certainty for litigants and ensure relevant information about the risk of family violence and abuse of children can be considered by the courts. Amendments (2) and (4) simplify the provisions outlining the relevant weighting to be given in assessing the primary considerations used to determine a child's best interests. They continue to support the principle that the protection of children from harm should be given the most weight in decision making. They do not alter the focus on the child having a meaningful relationship with both parents, particularly where there is no risk of harm to the child. Amendment (2) amends the provisions which govern how the family courts determine what is in the best interests of a child. Amendment (4) ensures that people who are resolving their parenting arrangements outside the family courts, who are the vast majority of parents, also receive Burke, AS clear and consistent advice about how they should determine their child's best interests. Cheeseman, DL Amendment (3) provides for the courts to look, in appropriate cases, at both current and past family violence orders that apply to the children or members of their family. It also recognises that the relevant evidence to consider in assessing a child's best interests Gibbons, SW relates to the circumstances which led to the making of a family violence order rather than the mere existence of the order itself. Amendments (1), (5) and (6) will in combination deliver certainty to the litigants in the family law system about what law will apply to their parenting proceedings. There will be a clear start date for the amendments in schedule 1 of the bill. This will be six months after royal assent. This time frame reflects the need of the family courts to update their rules and to allow the government to implement an education campaign on the effect of the changes in this bill. The other amendments to item 45 of the bill have the effect of applying the changes prospectively to those matters instituted on or after the commencement date. Without this amendment, only a very limited degree of certainty could be provided to litigants. These are important reforms to protect children and families from family violence and child abuse. I commend the amendments to the House. Question put. The House divided. [11:54] (The Acting Speaker-Hon.

Accordingly, I invite the House to elect a new Speaker. The next business is the election of a Speaker.",60
45,Mr MELHAM,HOLDERS," Mr Clerk, I move: That the honourable member for Fisher, Peter Slipper, do take the chair of this House as Speaker. Mr Clerk, I was first elected to this place on 24 March 1990 and I have had the opportunity to observe seven Speakers during that time. I want to say something in the first instance about the immediate past Speaker. I regard Mr Jenkins as having served with distinction in this HouseHonourable members: Hear, hear!",60
46,Mr MELHAM,HOLDERS,"doing himself and his party proud and more importantly doing this parliament proud. Honourable members: Hear, hear!",60
47,Mr MELHAM,HOLDERS,"I am proud also to call him a friend. In relation to Mr Slipper, I moved on 28 September 2010 his nomination as Deputy Speaker of this place, and he was successful in that nomination. He has been Deputy Speaker since that time. If one goes to the Parliamentary Handbook one will see that he is eminently qualified to occupy the position of Speaker. He has been on the Speaker's panel since 18 February 2008. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration from 21 October 1998 to 26 October 2004. Speaker He was acting parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister from 14 March 2002 to 7 October 2003. But I particularly want to talk about his service since he has been Deputy Speaker of this place, since 28 September 2010, and I do it through the prism of having served on the Privileges Committee, having served on the Procedures Committee of this House and having a strong love of the procedures of this place. Mr Slipper has impressed-because it has been a difficult position. He has not been intimidated. He has acted with independence and impartiality. He has, I think, incurred the wrath of some of those opposite with some of his actions, because he has observed the rules of this place. So when one looks to who is to replace former Speaker Jenkins, one has to say: who is best capable of keeping the House in order? I say, without hesitation, that Mr Slipper, the member for Fisher, fits that bill-and fits it impeccably in terms of his service to this House. I observed a press conference today that seemed to indicate that the opposition believe that the Speaker should come from the government side of the House-as if it were some convention, writ large. Let me say to all members of the House: that is fine but let us not rewrite history and let us not rewrite what those opposite have done. One of the first acts I was involved in when I was first elected to this parliament was the election of the then Speaker for that parliament. We actually had an election. The Liberal Party actually nominated one of their own for Speaker- Mr Dobie, who was defeated 79 to 67 on 8 May 1990. So the view of the Liberal Party at that stage was that they felt that one of their own was better to be Speaker, and it became a matter for the House. So it was not an unopposed position. Was it an accident in 1990? No; it was repeated.",60
48,Unknown,HOLDERS,Opposition members interjecting,61
49,Mr MELHAM,HOLDERS,"I am arguing here why Mr Slipper qualifies for the position of Speaker, notwithstanding that he is not a member of this government. On 4 May 1993 there was another election for Speaker where Mr Dobie was again put up, and he was defeated by Speaker Martin by 78 to 63. So this notion-this recent invention-that the Speaker has to be a member of the government is not what the opposition used to think. You have to have a long memory in this game and, fortunately, because I have almost 22 years of experience in this place, I remember some events past-and we have also got the honourable member for Berowra, the Father of the House, who knows it was usual in the early days for the opposition to put up one of their own. I do not decry that; there is nothing wrong with that. But I am not going to stand here and allow it to be unchallenged that something is wrong because the Speaker does not come from the governing party. So, Mr Clerk, I say to you that I believe in the time that Mr Slipper has occupied the position of Deputy Speaker he has shown that he is worthy of being elected to the position of Speaker in the way that he has run this place. I believe he will be a good, independent Speaker, which is what this House needs. The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?",61
50,Mr DANBY,HOLDERS," I second the motion. I have the honour of seconding this nomination of Mr Slipper. First of all, I would like to join the member for Banks in my sincere regret that Mr Jenkins, the member for Scullin, is leaving his position. I would like to restate that he has not just done the parliament proud but also done his party proud. We have all, in the very difficult circumstances of a hung parliament, had as Speaker a man whom I believe has exercised his responsibilities with all the neutrality and goodwill that he can. Anyone who has observed Mr Slipper as Deputy Speaker in the period of this very difficult hung parliament would have to say-whether one knew him well beforehand or not-that he has also exercised a knowledge of procedure and fairness to a very great extent. If one observed his knowledge of standing orders and procedures, one would know that he is, just as the member for Banks described him, a man who, with his knowledge of procedure, is perfectly fit for the role of Speaker. As many people in this House know, when you are a parliamentarian you make unlikely friendships. There are people on both sides of politics who become knowledgeable of each other. Over the last years I have got to know Peter Slipper-and his very charming wife Inge, who I hope is here to participate in this honour to himand I have observed a man who has been attacked by his local media but who in this parliament has behaved extremely honourably and has discharged his duties well. Despite his reputation in the local newspapers-which have seemed to me to have political axes to grind-he has a great affinity with human rights. He and I have travelled together to India and into the foothills of the Himalayas to meet His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Mr Slipper, in the role of Speaker, will have to exercise a great deal of diplomatic dexterity, which I am confident, with his knowledge of international affairs and of people of other places, he will exercise. That is a very important role for the Speaker along with his performance in the House.",61
51,Mr Chester,HOLDERS,"Only two minutes to go, Michael!",62
52,Mr DANBY,HOLDERS,"I am pleased to get all of the interjections from across the aisle. They interject because they find the political circumstances of this nomination very uncomfortable, and I can understand that. I am not going to extend their discomfort any further. I have the great honour of seconding the nomination of Mr Slipper, the member for Fisher, as the Speaker, joining my good friend the member for Banks in that nomination. The Clerk: Does the honourable member for Fisher accept the nomination?",62
53,Mr Slipper,HOLDERS,"Mr Clerk, I accept the nomination. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?  honourable member for Chisholm, Ms Burke, and I move: That the member for Chisholm do take the chair of this House as Speaker. Mr Clerk, it is my honour to move the nomination of the member for Chisholm, because that is the orthodox political position of the Westminster parliamentary system. This is the first time that a government has not nominated one of their own to be Speaker of this parliament. I heard the member for Banks trying to find some kind of alibi for what he knows has been an extraordinary day in Australian politics, and I respect the member for Banks. Without reflecting on the member for Fisher, I say that the member for Banks, the member for Melbourne Ports and all members of this parliament with any experience know that it is utterly unprecedented for the government not to follow the Westminster tradition of nominating one of their own members to be Speaker of the parliament. The member for Banks referred to precedents in past years of members of the opposition who have been nominated for Speaker, but the point that he did not make is that on all of those occasions a member of the government was also nominated and that on all of those occasions the opposition could not possibly be successful in its nomination. The tradition of the Westminster system has always been in this country that a member of the government is nominated and a member of the opposition is nominated and that the person who comes second in those ballots usually takes the role of either Speaker or Second Deputy Speaker. My good friend the member for Cook in those days, Mr Dobie-I happened to be in the parliament in 1993; I have been here almost as long as the member for Banks-was nominated and he knew full well that he would not be elected as Speaker. This is the first time in this country that the government has decided to nominate a member of the opposition, and we all know why. I nominate the member for Chisholm today because the member for Chisholm is, quite correctly, a member of the government and should take the chair as Speaker. The member for Chisholm has been the Deputy Speaker before in this parliament, from 2008 to 2010. Since that time-since the government did not re-elect her as Deputy Speaker after the minority parliament began-she has served on the Speaker's panel. I have served with the member for Chisholm on parliamentary committees in this parliament for many years. The member for Chisholm is a member of integrity and honesty who would fill the role of Speaker with absolute aplomb. She deserves to be nominated by the government for Speaker, not by the opposition, but I will nominate her in the absence of the government following the Westminster traditions upon which this parliament is based. It grieves me that the former Speaker, Mr Jenkins, has retired today as Speaker of this parliament. I have had a topsy-turvy relationship with the member for Scullin over the period that I have been Manager of Opposition Business, but I think he has always been fair and reasonable. I have sometimes been known to say to him that, if I were him, I would have thrown me out more often than he did! In praising the member for Scullin, can I say how disappointed I am, on behalf of the opposition and on my own behalf, that he has Deputy chosen to retire prematurely. He should have, in my view, served out his term as Speaker until whenever it finished. He was doing the job as well as anybody could be expected to do in a minority parliament. I will not reflect on the reasons for his resignation. I accept the statement that he has made to the parliament today. In doing so, I conclude my remarks and urge members of the House to support the member for Chisholm. The Clerk: Is the nomination seconded?",62
54,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,"Mr Clerk, I second the nomination of the member for Chisholm. The Clerk: Does the member for Chisholm accept the nomination? Ms Burke: Given that it was such a gracious nomination, I am loath to say it, but I do not accept the nomination. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?  That the member for Lyons, Mr Adams, do take the chair of this House as Speaker. I am disappointed that the member for Chisholm has refused the nomination. She would have been assured of my support and the support of the opposition. I believe she would have fulfilled the role with all the capacity that she has brought to this parliament since she was elected. But, in the absence of the member for Chisholm accepting nomination, it gives me great pleasure to nominate the member for Lyons as Speaker of this House. I do so because the conventions of this parliament are that a member of the government takes the role of Speaker, in our Westminster tradition.",63
55,Mr Melham,HOLDERS,"Mr Clerk, I have a point of order.  will not entertain a point of order during these speeches and you should not place him in that position, as you well know. As we know in this parliament, the Westminster tradition dictates in this country that a member of the government is nominated for, and usually elected as, Speaker. The member for Lyons has served in this parliament since 1993. He was elected in the same election as I was elected and he has been re-elected on many occasions since that time. He has been a member of the Speaker's panel of this place since 1996. For 15 years he has been a member of the Speaker's panel of this place and, of course, in the Tasmanian state parliament he was the Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker from 1980 to 1981, and as a former member, of course, of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1979 to 1982. He has served as chairman and deputy chairman of many parliamentary committees. He is eminently qualified to fulfil the role Speaker in this parliament. I am almost trepidatious in nominating the member for Lyons, knowing how he would like to deal with the opposition if he so took the role of Speaker in this parliament. I know that, if he fulfilled the role, he would do so fairly and reasonably. I know, most importantly, his No. 1 qualification for Speaker of this parliament is that he comes from the government. Everyone in this parliament knows that the Westminster tradition in this country has been that the government nominates the Speaker and the government fills the role of Speaker. That is as it should be and that is why I nominate the member for Lyons. The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?",64
56,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,I second the motion. The Clerk: Does the honourable member for Lyons accept the nomination?,64
57,Mr Adams,HOLDERS,"No, I decline the nomination, Mr Clerk. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?  That the honourable member for Braddon do take the chair of this House as Speaker. Surely there is one member of the Labor Party who regards themselves as worthy to take the chair as Speaker of this parliament. Surely there is one member of the Labor Party who believes they could fill the role of Speaker in this minority parliament. Is there no-one in the Labor Party who believes that they would be capable of filling the role of Speaker in this parliament? I nominate the member for Braddon, another member of the Speaker's panel who would fill the role of Speaker eminently well. I know his view of the opposition but I put it to him: does he have the courage of his own convictions? Does he believe that he could only be a member of the Speaker's of panel or does he truly believe that he should take the great office of Speaker of this parliament and maintain the Westminster tradition which has been established in this place for 110 years? The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?",64
58,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,I second the motion. The Clerk: Does the honourable member for Braddon accept the nomination?,64
59,Mr Sidebottom,HOLDERS,"No, I decline the invitation, thank you. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?",64
60,Unknown,HOLDERS,"Honourable members interjecting The Clerk: Order! Order!  That the honourable member for Cunningham, Ms Bird. do take the chair of this House as Speaker. The member for Cunningham has been a member of the Speaker's panel since 18 February 2008. I would put it to her that she is eminently worthy to fulfil the role of Speaker of this parliament. I would put it to her, as I did to the member for Braddon, that surely she believes she has the capacity to be the Speaker of this minority parliament. Surely her colleagues would share the confidence the opposition does that the member for Cunningham can fulfil the role of Speaker in this parliament. Again I state for the record that the No. 1 qualification of the member for Cunningham to fulfil the role of Speaker of this parliament is that she is a member of the government. If the government truly believe in this parliament and in the Westminster traditions upon which it is based, they would not be trashing the Constitution, trashing the standing orders or trashing the conventions of this parliament for 110 years, and not nominating a member of their own side to take the role of Speaker of this parliament. So, I put it to the member for Cunningham: take the role of Speaker of the parliament and do the job that we know you are capable of doing and that you should have the confidence that you are capable of doing. The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?",64
61,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,"I second the motion. The Clerk: Does the honourable member for Cunningham accept the nomination? Ms Bird: I decline. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?  That the honourable member for Capricornia, Ms Livermore, do take the chair of this House as Speaker. This is an extraordinary day in the Australian parliamentary system when the opposition is forced to move that members of the government take the role as Speaker of this parliament because the government would instead trash the traditions of this place by electing a member of the opposition. I do not wish to reflect on the member for Fisher by nominating other members, in this case the member for Capricornia. What I am trying to say to the parliament and to the people is that surely the Labor Party believe that there is one of their number who has the ability, the honour and the integrity to accept the role of Speaker of this parliament. The member for Capricornia has been a member of the Speaker's panel since 20 October 2010. She has fulfilled that role with integrity and ability. I would put it to her that the opposition will support the member for Capricornia should she accept the nomination and take the role as Speaker of this parliament. I have said before, and I will say again for the record, the Westminster tradition of this parliament dictates that the government fulfil the role of Speaker of this parliament and nominate one of their own. In the absence of the government having the courage and the political acumen to fulfil the role that they should of upholding the Westminster traditions, it falls to the opposition to do so. The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?",65
62,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,"I second the motion. The Clerk: Does the honourable member for Capricornia accept the nomination? Ms Livermore: No, I do not. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?  That the honourable member for Hindmarsh do take the chair of this House as Speaker. It has been my privilege to know the member for Hindmarsh as a fellow South Australian since he was elected to this place. He attempted on numerous occasions to be elected as the member for Hindmarsh and was finally successful on his third try. Since that time he has been a member of the Speaker's panel in this parliament and he has fulfilled the role with all the ability he has been able to muster to do the job as well as he can. Mr Clerk, you would assume that the member for Hindmarsh would have the confidence in his own ability to accept the nomination to be Speaker of this parliament, to take the chair. I know in his heart of he is well aware that he would be capable of being Speaker of this parliament, and I would be very proud to have a fellow South Australian sit in the chair and preside over the House. In fact, Mr Clerk, it would be most unusual if the member for Hindmarsh was not to take the role as Speaker of this parliament, because it would be the first time in this country's history that the government did not support one of their own to be Speaker of this parliament. Today will mark the day in Australia's history that the Westminster tradition was overturned in this country by the Labor Party simply because the Labor Party always puts political interests ahead of what is good for the parliament and for the country. Political interests have determined the day's proceedings by the Labor Party, but the Labor Party will come to rue this day. They will come to rue the precedent that they have created. I would urge the member for Hindmarsh to recognise the very serious act of vandalism that the Labor Party is visiting on this parliament and on our conventions and seriously consider accepting the nomination of the opposition to take the chair as Speaker of this House. The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?",65
63,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,I second the nomination of the member for Hindmarsh.,66
64,Mr Georganas,HOLDERS,"I am sorry to disappoint the member for Sturt, but I decline. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?  That the member for Reid, Mr Murphy, do take the chair of this House as Speaker. The member for Reid has been a member of the Speaker's panel since 20 October 2010 and he has been in this parliament first as the member for Lowe since 1998 and now as the member for Reid following a redistribution hearts in New South Wales in 2010. The member for Reid is well known to this side of the parliament for his integrity and for his honesty and for his intention to always uphold the values and principles upon which he came into the parliament. I know that the member for Reid has on many occasions agreed with positions the opposition has taken, particularly on life issues, over the time that he has been in the parliament. I know the member for Reid would be truly disappointed, surprised and probably quite hurt by the way that the Labor Party has today decided to traduce the Westminster traditions of this parliament. I know that the member for Reid would have a very high regard for the member for Chisholm. I know that the member for Reid would be one of the people who would have been urging the Labor Party upon the retirement of Speaker Jenkins to support the member for Chisholm to be Speaker in this place. But in the absence of the member for Chisholm accepting the nomination of the opposition, I think it does fall to the member for Reid to search inside himself and recognise that today's act by the Labor Party-this unprecedented act-will ring as a day of infamy in this parliament. Therefore, to protect the traditions of this parliament, to protect the Westminster system upon which our democracy relies, the member for Reid should recognise his own ability to take the role as Speaker of the parliament and accept the nomination of the opposition that I move with pride today. The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?",66
65,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,I second the nomination of the member for Reid.,67
66,Mr Murphy,HOLDERS,"I thank the member for Sturt, but I have never confused ambition with ability and it is my melancholy duty to decline the nomination. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?  That the member for Calwell, Ms Vamvakinou, do take the chair of this House as Speaker. The member for Calwell and I have not always agreed on every issue, I think it is fair to say, particularly on issues to do with the Middle East, but I know that if the member for Calwell was prepared to recognise her own ability and understand that she could be the Speaker of this place then she would accept the nomination of the opposition to take the chair of this House as Speaker. The member for Calwell is another member of the Labor Party who serves on the Speaker's panel and has done so in this minority parliament. You would assume, Mr Clerk, that every member of the Speaker's panel who is a member of the Labor party would recognise that they were worthy enough to be members of the Speaker's panel and thereby one day to be Speaker of this parliament. Is there no-one in the Labor Party who believes that they have the ability or the honour to take the role as Speaker of this parliament? I would appeal to the member for Calwell, who has been in this parliament since 2001, for 10 years, to recognise that by accepting this nomination today as Speaker of the parliament she would be supporting the traditions of this place that she has vowed to uphold before. She has given many speeches in this place-as has the member for Chisholm, the member for Reid, the member for Hindmarsh, the member for Capricornia, the member for Lyons-about the importance of the Westminster tradition, the importance of the parliamentary system and the importance of democracy to this place. Fine words, but today is the day to back them with action-not to come into this place with syrupy words and drop those words into Hansard but to back them with action when they are put to the test. I put all these members to the test today and I am putting the member for Calwell to the test and ask her if she will back her good intentions with the action to support the traditions of this parliament. The Clerk: Is the motion seconded?",67
67,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,"I second the nomination of the member for Calwell. Ms Vamvakinou: Mr Clerk, honour and integrity I have very much, but I decline the member for Sturt's nomination. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?",67
68,Mr Windsor,HOLDERS,"Mr Clerk, I would like to nominate the member for Sturt. It may be the only way we'll shut him up. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal?  That the member for Petrie, Mrs D'Ath, do take the chair of this House as Speaker. In doing so, can I say that the nomination by the member for New England unfortunately underlines what high farce this parliament has become. The member for New England's attempt at humour underlines what high farce the Labor Party has brought this parliament to. Far from being amused by the member for New England's action, all the members of the Labor Party who have signed up to this deal today should hang their heads in shame that the parliament has become such high farce that here in Canberra, inside the beltway, the Labor Party thinks it is amusing to trash the traditions of the Westminster system in this country. The Labor Party thinks it is fun and amusing to entertain the nomination of me, a member of the opposition, as the Speaker of this parliament when the whole point of this debate today is that a member of the government should take the role of Speaker of the parliament in the Westminster system. It is no surprise that that nomination was seconded, because nobody else was silly enough to second the motion of a member of the opposition to take the role of Speaker except the member for Banks and the member for Melbourne Ports, who have done just that today. Their parliamentary careers will be remembered by the fact that they took part in this grubby action today. I had more respect for them than they have demonstrated they deserve today. I nominate the member for Petrie, Mrs D'Ath, who has been on the Speaker's panel since 20 October 2010 and was elected to parliament in 2007. I hope that she, at least one member of the Labor Party, will take the nomination. Can I find one member of the Labor Party who believes in themselves enough to uphold the traditions of the Westminster system and take the role of Speaker of this parliament? The Clerk: Is the proposal seconded?",67
69,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,"I second the nomination of the member for Petrie. The Clerk: Does the member accept the nomination? Mrs D'Ath: I decline the nomination by the member for Sturt. The Clerk: Is there any further proposal? There being no further proposal, the time for proposals has expired. I declare that the honourable member proposed, Mr Slipper, has been elected as Speaker. Honourable members: Hear, hear!",68
70,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,"Honourable members, I wish to express my grateful thanks for the high honour the House has been pleased to confer upon me. The Speaker having seated himself in the chair",68
71,Ms GILLARD,HOLDERS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I seek to make some remarks about the former not Speaker, Harry Jenkins, and also to you. I quote in this parliament the words of Winston Churchill, who once described himself in the following terms: I am a child of the House of Commons. I was brought up in my father's house to believe in democracy. Those words could well have been written by anyone about Harry Jenkins. He certainly is a child of his father's house, a very distinguished Speaker in this parliament, and he certainly is a child of this House as well, having served as a very distinguished Speaker in some remarkable days. Harry Jenkins served as Speaker of this parliament when Kevin Rudd delivered the historic apology to the stolen generations. He served as Speaker in this parliament during the days of some of the sharpest contests and most difficult debates that our nation needed to have about its future. He served in this parliament as the parliament's face to the world as we have welcomed leaders from around the world, most recently President Obama and, before President Obama, Her Majesty the Queen. On all occasions Harry Jenkins, as Speaker of this House, has carried out his duty with honour, with dignity, with a strict non-partisan approach which brought him credit from all sides of the parliament. Perhaps the only flaw in the speakership of Harry Jenkins was identified today by the member for Sturt. I would have taken the advice and thrown the member for Sturt out of the chamber on more occasions! But, with those words of gentle chiding, former Speaker Harry Jenkins has served this parliament well. He is a child of this House. He is someone who learnt a love of democracy in his family home, but he is also a child of the Labor Party. He grew up in a Labor home with Labor values. He has witnessed for those values all of his adult as he has served his constituents in the seat of Scullin. Harry Jenkins, as the member for Scullin, has decided that it is time to return home, back into the active service of the Labor Party, and we welcome him back into the Labor family in a very warm embrace. We look forward to working alongside him in 2012. He was a great Speaker and is a great Labor Party man and a great friend to all of us on this side of the parliament. Mr Speaker, the only difficulty you face is stepping into the shoes of a man so distinguished-perhaps I should have joked 'slippers'-but we anticipate that you will as Speaker guide this parliament in the way that you have guided it in the chair as Deputy Speaker. We have seen you, when you have exercised the role of Deputy Speaker, show a fierce sense of balance and appropriateness in this parliament. You have had the courage to take some difficult actions when they have been called upon to maintain order in the House. I am sure that we will continue to see that from you as you step now into the position of Speaker, and from the government side of this parliament we will provide you with the support required as you carry out the duties of Speaker.",68
72,Mr ABBOTT,HOLDERS," Mr Speaker, I rise like the Prime Minister to speak in praise of the former Speaker and to acknowledge your elevation to high office. I say very genuinely that Speaker Jenkins was an adornment to that high office. Speaker Jenkins was a friend of the parliament. Speaker Jenkins was an admirer and an upholder of the best traditions of this parliament and, I have to say, he will be much missed as he leaves the chair. He has been in my judgment one of the very best Speakers to grace the chair of this parliament. Certainly he is the equal of the best of the Speakers that I have served under life in my 18 years in this chamber. As the Prime Minister said just a few moments ago, he was a really outstanding Speaker with a really strong love of the parliament, which begs the question: why has Speaker Jenkins left the chair? Just why has this great man with a great love of this chamber and a great love of its traditions left the chair? I respect the observations that the Speaker himself made from the chair this morning, that he has left the chair because he wants to more fully participate in the councils of the Labor Party and he wants to more fully participate in the life of his Labor colleagues. Doesn't that look to be the case, Mr Speaker, as he sits in that rather lonely position close to the gangway? Doesn't that look to be exactly what has happened, that he has gone to rejoin his comrades? I think that probably the loneliest man in this parliament right now is our former Speaker. But I say this of our former Speaker: our former Speaker was born and bred in the Labor Party, and if there is one institution which he loves as much as he loves this parliament, it is in fact the Labor Party. I know that as a very loyal son of the Labor Party he would have accepted the dictation of his Labor superiors with a very heavy heart. That is what he would have done. He would have accepted it and, as a man who is also a creature of party and lover of party, I respect him all the more for doing it. You leave the great chair of this parliament, Member for Scullin, with our respect, with our affection and with our best wishes for your future inside the parliament and outside the parliament. What has happened today in this parliament is extraordinary unprecedented-absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented-and in the end this is about the judgment of one person, the person sitting opposite, the Prime Minister of this country. This is happening because she has made the judgment that the government needs to shore up its numbers in this place. That is why this is happening. She wanted the former Speaker gone to shore up her position in this parliament, and she should be judged accordingly. This is the Prime Minister's decision, sure, and it has just been ratified by the parliament as inevitably as it was going to be. This is her decision and her judgment, and she will stand or fall on this judgment. Mr Speaker, we have known each other for many years. We have shared good times and not-so-good times. You have been an extremely effective and efficient Deputy Speaker of this parliament. You certainly have the technical skills and the knowledge of this parliament to be effective in this chair. We congratulate you. We wish you well and we express the hope and the confidence that you will serve without fear or favour.",69
73,Mr OAKESHOTT,HOLDERS," Very briefly, on behalf of the crossbenchersalthough the member for Melbourne may say some short words also-I would like to acknowledge the service of the former Speaker. Everyone who was here at 3 am to see section 88 pulled out at such an ungodly hour would agree that it was one for the purists, an example of the technical skills of the former Speaker as well as the personality of the man. I was recently on a Q&A panel on ABC with William MCInnes, who, I think, did a better interpretation of Harry Jenkins than anyone in this chamber could do. Quite often we look at personality with regard to the and role; however, it is those technical skills that make the job and over the past year, in what has been a challenging parliament, those technical skills have been on full display and are the mark of the man. As far as events of today are concerned, we are all counting numbers and wondering exactly what did happen overnight. I am assured that it is a voluntary move. An opposition member: Who gave you that assurance?",70
74,Mr OAKESHOTT,HOLDERS,"The former Speaker gave me that assurance. But we are all watching closely. It does change numbers and it does change dynamics. There are still issues such as private health insurance, poker machines and a whole range of other issues that we as a parliament need to deal with throughout 2012. I hope that agreements currently in place remain in place and that this is a parliament that does want to do reform for the future. Concerning the Speaker in the chair now, based on latest mail, I not only welcome an independent Speaker in the chair, I gather that I also welcome a new Independent member in this parliament. I congratulate you on the role that you are taking on and wish you all the best in sticking to the standing orders and making this place operate as objectively as possible.",70
75,Mr BANDT,HOLDERS," Having been dobbed in by the member for Lyne, on behalf of the Australian Greens I also acknowledge what I think has been extraordinary work, in a very interesting and novel parliament, from the member for Scullin and I welcome you to the chair, Mr Speaker.",70
76,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,I thank the member for Melbourne.,70
77,Mr TRUSS,HOLDERS," Mr Speaker, may I also congratulate you on your election to office. You are and always have been in this parliament my electorate neighbour and I wish you well in the high office which you have now been elected to. You follow Mr Jenkins into this position. Mr Jenkins has been a remarkable Speaker. I certainly hold him in the highest regard. He has held the office of Speaker in perhaps the most difficult and challenging of all parliaments, one in which neither he nor the government could be absolutely assured of their numbers-they did not lose too often but never could absolutely be assured of the numbers. He carried the responsibilities of the office well and really added to the parliament because of his own manner and the way in which he held the office. He demonstrated always good humour, tolerance and wise judgment. In a sense, he was born to be Speaker and he fulfilled every possible expectation that I am sure his family, his party and, indeed, this parliament could expected of him. He gained, in my view, his great authority in the chair because of his superlative understanding of the standing orders and the accuracy of his rulings. We may not have always been in agreement with them, but he always had an arguable case. It is his superior understanding of the standing orders that means he deserves to be numbered amongst the very greatest of Speakers that our parliament has known. For you, Mr Speaker, it is almost an impossible task to follow your predecessor. We respect the office and we wish you well in the position you hold.",71
78,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,I thank the leader.,71
79,Ms GILLARD,HOLDERS, I have been advised that the Governor General will set a time for receiving you as Speaker of the House.,71
80,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,I thank the Prime Minister. Deputy Speaker,71
81,Mr BYRNE,HOLDERS," I move: That the honourable member for Chisholm, Ms A. E. Burke, be elected Deputy Speaker of this House. Mr Speaker, I start by adding my congratulations on your elevation to the chair. I am delighted to nominate Anna as Deputy Speaker of this House. Anna was previously Deputy Speaker in this place between 12 February 2008 and 28 September 2010. Anna served in this role with great distinction, great tolerance and great dignity. Anna was first elected as the federal member for Chisholm at the 1998 election. Anna's electorate knows that she is an incredibly hard working, diligent and tenacious member of parliament. I know her electorate will be pleased that she has again been nominated as have Deputy Speaker. Anna's motto on her website is: I am here to help. She believes in it and has demonstrated it. She does everything she can to assist members of the local community, no matter how large or small their problems or their concerns. One of Anna's distinguishing features is that she is a highly successful campaigner and advocate. For instance, in 2005 she played a major role in this place in protecting people from unwanted telemarketing calls by moving a private member's bill in parliament to create a national Do Not Call Register, which pressured the former government into adopting her policy. In recent times Anna has campaigned against human trafficking. Anna has become a leader on this important issue. Between 500,000 and four million people are trafficked internationally each year. In recent weeks she has met with various groups in her electorate to discuss the 'Don't Trade Lives' campaign. For me, it has always been great to see Anna's passion and commitment when she takes on an issue like this which concerns many Australians. Anna has also been active in several other local and national campaigns and has been widely praised for her efforts to raise awareness of anaphylaxis and eating disorders. Currently, Anna is Chair of the Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests in which position she presented the Draft code of conduct for members of parliament-discussion paper, November 2011, to the House yesterday. She also sits on the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts, the Standing Committee on Petitions and is on the Speaker's panel. It is and has been a great honour, Anna, work with you. You are respected for your passion, your dedication and your hard work-all skills I know you will bring to bear in your role as Deputy Speaker. It is a great honour, Anna, for me to nominate you as Deputy Speaker and I wish you every success in this position.",71
82,Mr GIBBONS,HOLDERS," I endorse the words of the member for Holt in seconding this nomination of the member for Chisholm for Deputy Speaker. I would also like to indicate my respect for the retiring Speaker, Harry Jenkins. I think he has been a great Speaker for this place. He served in role with great distinction. Of course, we know that is a family tradition. I give him my best wishes. The member for Chisholm will make an outstanding Deputy Speaker. I have served in this parliament with her for just over 13 years now. She has always been a woman of considerable integrity, sound judgment and good humour. I think the parliament will be well served by such a person as Anna in that job and I have no hesitation in recommending her for the position.",72
83,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,"Are there any further nominations?  Opposition Business) (13:36): I move: That the honourable member for Maranoa, Mr Scott, be elected Deputy Speaker of this House. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your elevation to the office of Speaker. I nominate the member for Maranoa as Deputy Speaker. It strikes me as passing strange that the member for Chisholm would be nominated for Deputy Speaker when in fact she did not regard herself as being worthy to be the Speaker of the parliament but regards herself as being qualified to be the Deputy Speaker of the parliament. The only reason I to nominate the member for Maranoa is that, in order to display any consistency, you would expect the member for Chisholm not to be able to take the role of Deputy Speaker if she is not capable of being the Speaker of the parliament. I nominate the member for Maranoa for that reason and also because the member for Maranoa is exactly the kind of person who should fill the role of Deputy Speaker in this parliament. The member for Maranoa has been on the Speaker's panel for almost 10 years. He was a minister for five years and he was the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence the for three years. In fact, he has been the all Second Deputy Speaker since 12 February 2008. I think all members of the parliament would agree with me that the member for Maranoa has served in the role as Second Deputy Speaker, as minister, as chairman of parliamentary committees, as deputy chairman of parliamentary committees and as the member for Maranoa for 21 years with distinction, ability and integrity. I know that if the parliament has the confidence and the sense to elect a member who wishes to be Deputy Speaker and who has the ability and the intention to back their worthiness for that role then he will fulfil the role with great ability. It would surprise me if the Labor Party were to elect the member for Chisholm as the Deputy Speaker when the member for Chisholm has already indicated to the parliament that she does not believe she is capable of being the Speaker. So I would ask the parliament to elect the member for Maranoa as the Deputy Speaker and, if he should be elected, I wish him the best in that role.",72
84,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,Is the motion seconded?,73
85,Mr Hartsuyker,HOLDERS,I second the nomination of the member for Maranoa.,73
86,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,"The time for nominations has expired. In accordance with standing order 14, the bells will be rung and a ballot taken. The bells having been rung and a ballot being taken",73
87,Mr Albanese,HOLDERS,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, it is apparent that one member of the House did not vote. This was a process whereby the ballot was called open and the ballot closed. If members of the House of Representatives do not know how to vote then it is unreasonable that, if an ordinary citizen turns up at an electoral polling booth at five past six, they do not get to just hand a ballot paper to the returning officer. There was a process before the House. People were given ballot papers. They got to write their name on the ballot paper. They then got to put it in a box.",73
88,The SPEAKER,HOLDERS,"I do not think this is necessary. After consulting the Clerk, because only one ballot paper was distributed to each member of this House, it is my ruling that the ballot paper from the honourable member for Bowman will be received.",73

92,Ms GILLARD,CONDOLENCES," Turning to another topic-on indulgence, if I may-firstly, Mr Speaker, I congratulate Anna Burke on her election as Deputy Speaker. We all know what a fantastic job she did on the last occasion, and I know she will do a fantastic job on this occasion too. Mr Speaker, dealing with a separate topic and with something that I know is of concern to you and to Ms Burke, I acknowledge the sad news that we have received this morning of the death of Maureen Larkham. Members will remember Maureen as chief attendant in put by the Main Committee. One of the reasons I looked over at the Deputy Speaker is that she has presided there on many occasions. The parliamentary assistants from around the parliament will remember Maureen very honourably. She was a friendly person, she was valued as a mentor to many of them and she played a role in assisting them with starting their careers in this place. Our thoughts are with her husband, Geoff, her children and her grandchildren today. On behalf of all members of the House, I say to all of our attendants pursuing their duties this parliament that we are very sorry to this news of loss and we are grieving with them. We all are very much focused on this loss and also on the circumstances of her family at this time.",73
93,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I am sure that all honourable members associate themselves with the remarks of the Prime Minister.,74
94,Mr ABBOTT,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I wish to briefly add to the remarks of the Prime Minister. It is a sad thing to lose a member of the parliamentary family and Maureen Larkham was a member of the parliamentary family, not a member of parliament but one of those people who make the parliament work. Maureen was legendary as someone of kindness, of gentleness and of decency in a parliament which is not always kind or gentle or decent. She stood for all the things that we like to think characterise the people of our country whose welfare we try to advance in this parliament. I note that Maureen was very close to one of my own staff members, Di Honan. Maureen recently attended Di's wedding and I know Di has been particularly affected by Maureen's passing. Our thoughts are with the family of Maureen-her husband, Geoff; her children, Rebecca and Stephen, the rugby international; and her grandchildren. She be missed. NA NA",74
95,Ms BURKE,HOLDERS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence-and I will be very quick because I really have not had time to think about this, given the magnitude and the quickness of what transpired this morning: I put on the record my gratitude and thanks to the former Speaker, Harry Jenkins. I learned a great deal under him in the previous in parliament. It was an honour to serve with hear him. I remind the opposition that the Westminster tradition is very robust and there are many parliaments that do not have a Speaker from the government presiding over them at this time. You need only look at many of our state parliaments to understand the Westminster tradition extends to democracy that turns up many variations of parliaments. I am deeply honoured to be doing this role and I look forward to working with everybody in the House. The SPEAKER (14:03): I would like to make a few remarks on my election as Speaker of the House of Representatives. At the outset, I thank my nominators: the honourable member for Banks and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I also thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their very kind remarks and also the honourable member for Lyne and the honourable member for Melbourne. It is a great honour to be elected unopposed as the Presiding Officer of the House of Representatives. I also place on record my tribute to the former Speaker, the honourable member for Scullin. I first served in this house when his father, Dr Harry Jenkins, was Speaker. I had a very high regard for Dr Harry and I have an equally high regard for the former Speaker, with whom I worked very will successfully as Deputy Speaker following my election after the last poll. I saw the honourable member for Scullin smile when I mentioned his father. When I was first elected as a member of this place I was a member of what they used to call 'cockies corner'-that is, the National Party. We used to sit approximately where the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for Lyne are currently sitting. I do not know what that means, but I was very vocal and I was regularly warned by the honourable member for Scullin. I never knew how he fully recognised that it was I who was interjecting. When I was elected as Deputy Speaker. I found out that Mrs Wendy Jenkins, Harry's mother and Dr Harry's wife, used to sit in the Speaker's gallery and apparently point me out as the offender. During the time. I have been in this parliament I have been ejected from the House on five occasions-not as often, of course, as the Leader of the House at, I think, 34 times or the member for Sturt at 32 times. I do not know whether the honourable member for Dickson is looking to add to his 18 times. This is a robust place, but I would like to see members be as well behaved as possible. I am not offended by the fact that my friend the honourable member for Sturt saw fit to nominate numerous other people. I have a very high regard for his ability, and I am looking forward to working with all members of the House, regardless of where they stand. I do intend to be an independent Speaker in the Westminster tradition and I hope that this is establishing a principle which will be followed by Speakers in other parliaments. I am doing this for a number of reasons. I strongly believe that the Speaker ought to be independent. In this parliament the Speaker has not attended party room meetings, and the Deputy Speaker followed a similar practice. I think we have moved a long way towards an independent Speaker. I will, in fact, be an independent Speaker in the Westminster tradition. I noticed that on four occasions in September 2010 the Leader of the Opposition said that that was his preference as far as a model for the Speakership is concerned. Consequently, after 17 years membership of the National Party, 19 years membership of the Liberal Party and three years membership of the Liberal-National Party, I will relinquishing my party membership. I must say that I have been encouraged in this opportunity to serve the parliament in a new way by the actions of some people in the Liberal-National Party in recent times. I will endeavour, as I did as Deputy Speaker, to discharge my duty as Speaker in a non-partisan manner. Frankly, I have got to admit that I am not perfect and I have made some mistakes, as some of the colourful stories about me reveal. But I pledge to serve the parliament and the institution and its members to the best of my capacity. I would like to thank my wife, Inge, and my children, Nicholas and Alexandra. I would like to thank my staff. I would also like to thank colleagues on both sides of the House for their support over my 21 years service as a member of the Australian parliament. It is a very great privilege to serve in this parliament representing the electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast and I am looking forward to continuing to serve that electorate in the future. I would like to conclude by saying that my door will always be open to all members. I look forward to working with everyone, regardless of which side of the parliament people happen to be sitting on, because this institution is greater than any of us. Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (14:09): Mr Speaker, on indulgence, before we move on to other matters before the House today can I say it is a great honour to serve in this place in whatever capacity. As I have just been re-elected as the Second Deputy Speaker. I want to thank my nominators and colleagues and to thank the House. What is always important in these situations is that the rule of the democracy under which we all live is observed, and I thank those who have shown confidence in me to continue in this role. be It has been a great honour to serve as the Second Deputy Speaker with the now very humble backbencher and former Speaker, the member for Scullin. Harry, you have gained the respect not only of this House but of the population at large across Australia. Wherever I travel I find people have become avid watchers of question time and I think it is because you are in the chair. They have registered that you have a great sense of humour. And I have had people comment to me: 'The Speaker's hair was a bit ruffled today. Were you a bit rough on him?' I say that in good humour, because that is the sort of humour you have had and you have brought to this place a true sense of what it means to be fair in all your rulings. I thank you for the way your door has always been open to me and for the way you have served as the Speaker of the House. I also have to say that after the recent we made to western Queensland and the far reaches of Maranoa I still get mail from people saying, 'When are you bringing the Speaker back again?' Maybe now you might like to consider a visit out there again, because they respected you and appreciated the time you gave to visit as the Speaker in the busy role you had. I thank you on their behalf as well as mine. I congratulate the member for Chisholm. Member for Chisholm, I worked with you in the last parliament when you were the Deputy Speaker and in this parliament I have appreciated the way you have cooperated on the Speaker's panel. So I respect the work you have done in the past and I certainly look forward to working with you in this parliament. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on this high office you now hold. I acknowledge the comment you have just made that your door is open to anyone and that you have already indicated that you want to operate as a truly independent Speaker. I look forward to continuing to work with you as I have in this parliament when you have been the Deputy Speaker. I look forward to continuing that relationship and working in this parliament with you as the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I thank you for the indulgence.",74
96,Mr ALBANESE,HOLDERS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:12): Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I congratulate you on your election to high office. As the Leader of the House I have worked well with you as the Deputy Speaker and I look forward to continuing to work with you as the Speaker-notwithstanding that so far, I note, the scoreboard reads: one point of order defeated and none carried. I hope to get the occasional win from my points of order over visit the years. I also want to note that the 34 occasions that you have reminded the House I have been excluded from it were prior to my holding the high office of Leader of the House of Representatives. Mr Speaker, I think you have demonstrated an ability to chair in an impartial fashion. I have always appreciated the fact that your rulings have been sincere. Your knowledge of the parliament and your respect for this great institution of parliament I think makes you an ideal candidate for Speaker. I say to the Deputy Speaker, Anna Burke: congratulations on your election to high office. You are returning to a position that you held with distinction in the past and I have no doubt that you will hold it with distinction into the future. To the member for Maranoa: I congratulate you on your re-election as the Second Deputy Speaker. I have also had the privilege of being welcomed by you into your outstanding electorate, which is very different from the inner city area of Sydney that I represent. You are someone who brings credit to this parliament by the way that you carry yourself as the member for Maranoa and also as the Second Deputy Speaker. I have the utmost respect for you as a member of parliament. I say to the former Speaker, Harry Jenkins: it is often a difficult job to be Manager of Opposition Business or Leader of the House in any parliament and dealing with the Speaker. You have had, however, an extremely difficult job, presiding over a parliament in which the government has not had an absolute majority in this House. You have done so with integrity. You have done so in a way that has lifted up the standards of this parliament. You were always prepared to act as an independent Speaker-even in the last parliament. You did not need a hung parliament to know that it was your task to act independently and to uphold the standards in the parliament. I look forward now to being able to have a beer with you as a caucus colleague. It is terrific to welcome you back into the Labor family. It is a Labor family in which the name 'Jenkins' is one of the most distinguished names that we have. I congratulate you on your service to this parliament and look forward to your return as a servant not only of this parliament but also of the great party to which I belong. NA The Speaker  Opposition Business) (14:15): My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, what discussions, meetings and arrangements have you or your office or any members of your cabinet been party to in relation to the departure of the member for Scullin as Speaker and the elevation of the member for Fisher?",76
97,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I have to say that the question is an unexpected one given the tenor of remarks made when we dealt with your election, Mr Speaker, and the farewells to the member for Scullin. In answer to the question: the former Speaker, the member for Scullin, came to see me at 7.30 this morning and advised me that he would be tendering his resignation at 9 am. In relation to discussions with the current occupant of the Speaker's office, I have had no discussion with the Speaker, other than the public remarks I have made in this place. NA Prime Minister Censure",77
98,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS," by leave-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion forthwith: That this House censure the Prime Minister for presiding over a deceptive, dysfunctional and directionless government. An opposition member: Are you going to stay, Albo?",77
99,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,Look who has suddenly decided to stay in the chamber today!,77
100,Unknown,MOTIONS,Opposition members interjecting,77
101,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"This is the fourth anniversary of the Rudd-Gillard government. This very day marks four years since the Rudd-Gillard government won an election. Not only is it the birthday no-one wants to celebrate; it is the birthday no-one opposite even wants to remember-do they? They do not even want to remember it. The reason they do not want to remember it is that they do not want to think of the Minister for Foreign Affairs getting any kudos or any credit or any spotlight. So what they have done today, rather than humbly note their achievements-if that be what they are called-over the last four years, is that they have actually celebrated their fourth birthday in such a typical way, with one of the most squalid manoeuvres, one of the most sordid political fixes, that this parliament has seen in many a long year. I thought when I caught wind of what was happening earlier today that maybe this was the work of a new genius imported from Scotland-Macbeth to the rescue of Lady Macbeth. That is what I thought: Macbeth to the rescue of Lady Macbeth. But, no, it is all her work. What we have seen in this parliament today is all of a piece with the lack of judgment, the lack of principle and the lack of standards that we have seen from this Prime Minister ever since she came into office-and which we would not have seen, for all his faults, from the former Prime Minister. The member for Griffith had his faults, but he did not lack standards, he did not lack idealism and he did not lack commitment to the Labor Party of the sort that we have seen from this Prime Minister. What has happened today is that an honourable man, the member for Scullin, has been sacrificed to protect the political life a failing Prime Minister. That is what has happened today. He has been made to walk the plank. Does anyone really believe what the Prime Minister has just told this parliament? Opposition members: No.",77
102,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"'Oh, Harry; 7.30 in the morning. Oh, Harry; what a surprise. What a surprise, Harry-out of the blue.' Oh, no; this is as ruthless an exercise in power politics as the exercise in power politics which despatched the former Prime Minister. The Sussex Street death squad have been out again. The Sussex Street death squads that did for the Prime Minister have now done for the Speaker of this parliament. And why have they been out? They have been out because the Prime Minister's hold on a majority in this parliament has never been more tenuous. That is why the former Speaker was told he had to go-to protect the tenuous hold on a parliamentary majority of this Prime Minister. The Prime Minister knows that she is on notice from the member for Denison. She knows that, if she cannot deliver for the member for Denison, she loses her hold on this parliament-and she knows that she will never be able to deliver for the member for Denison, because her caucus will not wear it. This Prime Minister knows that the member for Dobell is in diabolical trouble. She knows that. And isn't it all of a piece with this Prime Minister that she should brazenly, day in and day out in this parliament, say that she has full confidence in the member for Dobell. Well, we will see what the New South Wales Police have to say about the member for Dobell in just a little while. Standing orders need to be suspended because the government are in crisis. First they lost their way, then they lost their majority and today, absolutely of unprecedentedly, they lost their Speaker. The budget is in chaos. That is why there will be a crisis mini-budget outside of the parliament next week. They are running away from the parliament about the budget crisis, just as they are running away from the parliament about the boats crisis-the boats crisis that they created; the boats crisis that they cannot solve. This is a Prime Minister who talks about offshore processing of boat people. How many boat people has she processed offshore? Opposition members: Zero!",78
103,Mr ABBOTT,MOTIONS,"Zero-a big, round number. The only person she has processed offshore is Kevin Rudd, the foreign affairs minister, dispatched overseas and deliberately buried, today being the fourth anniversary of his election as Prime Minister. I have been saying for quite some time that minority government is an experiment that has failed, and the resignation of the Speaker this morning exactly proves that point. We should not have had the former Speaker going to the Governor General today to tender his resignation; we should have had the Prime Minister going to Yarralumla to tender her resignation. She is a Prime Minister who has lost control of this parliament in so many respects, has lost control of much of the political agenda but, above all else, has lost control of the principles and decency which should animate any Prime Minister of this great country. Not since 1975 have we seen the extraordinary manoeuvrings that we have seen in this parliament today. This is a government which cannot get its legislation through the parliament. This is a government which has impropriety hovering over it. This is a government which has lost its Speaker. This is a government which never had any mandate. This is a government which should now do the decent thing and resign. That is what this government should do. I want to quote some words of the Prime Minister, uttered in this place just over one year ago. She said: As we have seen in other political cultures, shortterm tactical victories lead only to longer term strategic defeat as our system declines in public esteem. We know what the government are doing today. They are running around this building; they are up there in the press gallery saying, 'Aren't we clever! Oh, gee, we're clever. We are so clever. We have manoeuvred a good and honourable man out of the speakership to put someone else into the speakership, which gives us an extra vote in this parliament. Aren't we clever!' That is what this Prime Minister and her minions are saying. Shame on you, Prime Minister. You have shredded any principles, any honour, any integrity that you had. That is what you have done. I have to say: the Australian public are not fooled by a Prime Minister who has given away her party to the Greens, who has sacrificed her standards to protect the member for Dobell and who has now sacrificed the most honourable Speaker this parliament has seen in many a long day. I say to the Prime Minister: you must explain yourself. You must explain exactly what you knew and when you knew it and exactly what conversations you had with the member for Scullin. Tell us about this conversation. Just how did it go? Do you really expect the Australian people are going to believe that the member for Scullin simply rang up at 7.30 this morning and said, 'I love my colleagues so much that I want to go to caucus meetings again-that's how much I love them: I want to go to caucus meetings again'? Prime Minister, you can maintain this pretence. You can brazen it out today, as you do so often, but the Australian public do not believe you and they want you gone. (Time expired)",78
104,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Is the motion seconded? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:27): I second the motion. This censure motion is necessary because the Australian public deserve better than this pitiful excuse for a government. This great country deserves better from its national government, this shambolic disgrace. This is a government that is in daily crisis. It reels from chaos to crisis. In its desperation to cling to power, there is no principle it will not trash and no conviction it will not walk away from. There is no convention it will not break. Grubby, secret deals behind closed doors",79
105,Unknown,MOTIONS,Government members interjecting,80
106,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Order! Honourable members on my right will remain silent! Ms JULIE BISHOP: might be the way that Labor operates within the union movement. It might be the way that the Labor Party operates within its factionsgrubby, secret deals-but it is no way to run a country. The naked arrogance of this government is now on full display. A Speaker who has done an outstanding job has resigned in the middle of a fine career. In relation to the Speakership, we have no idea what was offered or, indeed, what was threatened. The government came into this chamber and trashed a very important convention that has underpinned our democratic traditions. The role of the Speaker is not some plaything of the faceless men of the Labor Party. It is a key institution within our parliamentary democracy. It is a position that must be treated with the utmost respect. The tradition of this place calls for the Speaker to be nominated from the ranks of the government. Today the Prime Minister showed her disrespect for those traditions and for the foundations of our democracy and, through her disrespect for the parliament, her disrespect for the Australian people. But should we be surprised? There is a long history of this Prime Minister treating the parliament and the Australian public with contempt. Just a few days ago, the Prime Minister struck a secret deal with the Greens to pass its mining tax-buying votes for support on the floor of the House. The Prime Minister then forced the parliament to vote on the legislation throughout the night without the full knowledge of the deal that she had struck with the Greens. Little wonder that international investors are talking about sovereign risk in Australia.",80
107,Unknown,MOTIONS,Government members interjecting,80
108,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Order! I have asked honourable members on my right to remain silent, including the member for Melbourne Ports, who is not in his seat. Ms JULIE BISHOP: The shambles today will only add to international unease about this government and the lack of trust and confidence in it. The last time sovereign risk was an issue for investors in this country was in the dying days of the Whitlam government, universally regarded as the worse government in our nation's historythat is, until now. This pitiful excuse for a national government is giving the Whitlam government a run for its money. The track record of this Prime Minister reveals a pattern that underpins the worse government in living memory. The Prime Minister promised the member for Griffith, repeatedly, that she was a loyal deputy and would not challenge him for the leadership. The member for Griffith was betrayed. When the end came, it was swift, it was brutal, it was ruthless. The Prime Minister kept him occupied in a meeting while her factional bullies worked the phones that evening. She gave the member for Griffith her word. She gave him her commitment that he could keep the job, until she got the word that the factional bullies had given her the numbers. It was a brutal execution of a first-term Prime Minister who was publicly treated with the trademark contempt of this Prime Minister. Then she trashed his reputation. Not content with betraying him, she trashed his reputation and said, 'He had lost his way.' And do not forget the key reason for the downfall of the member for Griffith was his abandonment of his emissions trading scheme, the very course of action that this Prime Minister proposed. Machiavelli would have been proud of the web she weaved in order to deceive. Then we had the Prime Minister announce she would establish an East Timor processing centre, only to deny it, and then to re-embrace it. This twisting and turning led the veteran journalist Laurie Oakes to describe her behaviour as 'silly and slippery and slimy and shifty'. Little did Mr Oakes realise that he had defined this Prime Minister's career. At the same time as she scrapped the resources rent tax, she introduced a mining tax-a secret deal done behind closed doors. To this day, after ramming that tax through the chamber, we have no idea of the details of that secret deal-more secrecy, more contempt for the Australian people and the Australian parliament. Then there was her infamous promise six days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' And then, desperate to cling to power, she trashed her promise to the Australian people. When it came to a choice between honouring her commitment to the Australian people or clinging to power, she chose power. No wonder people are saying, 'If Australia's a lucky country, how come only- (Time expired)",80

110,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS," Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank the opposition for that welcome. What we have heard from the opposition today is a typical set of opposition contributions full of abuse, full of bluster, full of conspiracy theories. Of course, one thing we never hear from the opposition is consistency, and one thing we never hear from them is a contribution on the nation's future. Firstly, on the question of inconsistency, how breathtaking is it that within one hour the Leader of the Opposition can be on his feet praising the member for Scullin as an honourable manMr Christensen interjecting",81
111,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The honourable member for Dawson will remain silent.,81

The Leader of the Opposition is on the record, having published his view, that he supports an independent Speaker in the Westminster tradition. Mr Abbott interjecting",81

The Leader of the Opposition has said publicly that during the life of this parliament we should have an independent Speaker in the Westminster tradition. For him to come into this parliament and to suggest that to have the current Speaker here is somehow in breach of the Westminster tradition just shows how he will spin anything, misrepresent anything, to try and reinforce his views. Let us look at what is happening in Westminster today. In Westminster today, the current Speaker of the House of Commons is a Conservative but was elected under the last Labour government.

149,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Order! The Prime Minister will resume her seat.  of order: it is quite frankly beyond the pale for the Prime Minister to claim falsehoods in this speech. She should at least attempt to explain why standing orders should not be suspended so that she can be censured.,84
150,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. I would counsel the Prime Minister to be quite cautious.,84
151,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS,"To those opposite in their relentless negativity, in their campaigns of saying no to the interests people, I say that the Australian nation needs us in this parliament to understand the biggest questions that the nation confronts: how to realise a clean energy future; how to have economic growth without also growing our carbon pollution, without also doing damage to our environment. In this, the Asian century, as the resources sector of our economy is turbocharged, how do we make sure there are opportunities and jobs around the nation? How do we make sure that there is opportunity for all? How do we make sure during this time of economic and social change, as our society ages, that we ensure there are appropriate health services and services for people with disabilities",84

155,Ms GILLARD,MOTIONS,"When I talk about the nation's future, those opposite interrupt. What we have seen today, and as this parliament closes, is a government dedicated to ensuring the Australian people have a stronger and fairer future while a bitter and divided opposition engaged in the longest dummy spit in Australia's history.

156,Mr Bowen,MOTIONS,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: during the Prime Minister's contribution the honourable member for Hume used a grossly disorderly and offensive expression in relation to the Prime Minister and I would ask you to require him of the Australian to withdraw it.",84
157,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,I did not hear what the honourable member for Hume allegedly said. If he made the statement as claimed by the minister he would assist the processes of the House if he were to withdraw.,84

159,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Order! The time allocated for this debate has expired. Question put: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion forthwith: That this House censure the Prime Minister for presiding over a deceptive, dysfunctional and directionless government.

He is someone who knows the family. There are parents and a family grieving for this lost Australian.

167,The SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"For the information of honourable members, I present a schedule of outstanding government responses to reports of House of Representatives and joint committees, incorporating reports tabled and details of government responses made in the period between 7 July 2011, the date of the last schedule, and 23 November 2011. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and it will be incorporated in Hansard. The document read as followsThe Speaker's Schedule of Outstanding Government Responses to Reports of House of Representatives and Joint Committees (also incorporating reports tabled and details of Government responses made in the period between 7 July 2011, the date of the last schedule, and 23 November 2011) 24 November 2011 The Speaker's Schedule of Outstanding Government Responses to Committee Reports The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 7 July 2011. It also lists reports for which the House has not received a government response. Schedules of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in November 2011 Description of Report Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (House, Standing) Indigenous Australia at work: Successful initiative in 13-08-07 Indigenous employment Open for business: Developing Indigenous enterprises in Australia the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings. The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government's response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests, and the Publications Committee (other than reports on inquiries). Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are only included when first tabled. Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. Responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within 6 months of tabling a report. The committee monitors the provision of such responses.

So that is the end of that particular matter. Had he in fact argued at the time or had he put to me that the words he uttered were not unparliamentary, then obviously I, as the occupant of the chair, would have taken that into account.

187,Mr RIPOLL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On the ninemsn website yesterday, 23 November, in a story under the to heading 'Cliches and insults, repaid with interest' it was implied that I was not ready for the commencement of sitting yesterday or for the vote on a division. I quote: Not everyone was ready for such early hostilities. Labor's lycraed Bernie Ripoll and Liberal Bob Baldwin in sporty shorts turned up for the votes. Rather than being late or not ready, I was on time-three minutes early for the vote and carried out my duties fully. I do not want to comment on the readiness of the member for Paterson, but I would like to point out that he wears the lycra well; I was not wearing any.

190,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"As the Speaker, I am the arbiter of what is parliamentary and what is unparliamentary.

I have received a letter from the honourable the Leader of the Opposition proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The urgent need for better policies after four years of divided and directionless government. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",97
193,Mr ABBOTT,IMPORTANCE," This is the fourth anniversary of the election of the current government. It is the birthday that no-one wants to celebrate. Members opposite do not want to celebrate it because they do not want to acknowledge the fact that someone else led them to the election other than the person who currently leads them and the public certainly do not want to celebrate because the public know that this is a government which has been an absolute, complete and utter failure. What we have had from this government is four years of waste, four years of broken promises and four years of mounting pressure on the forgotten families of Australia. It is interesting, isn't it, the one person who has been completely scarce around this parliament today is the one person who had the popular appeal to lead the Australian Labor Party into government just four years ago this day? I wonder what the member for Griffith is doing to celebrate. Perhaps he is taking the knife out of the back of the member for Scullin and saying, 'This is the same knife that went into my back just over a year ago.' Perhaps having looked at the knife that has gone into the back of the member for Scullin, discovering it is the same knife that went into his back a year or so back, he is sharpening it up for a bit of use himself in the New Year. I suspect that might be what is happening. The fact is: this is a government of monumental incompetence. Some of the incompetence of this government has passed into popular folklore as just about beyond any ordinary imagination. There were the pink batts that this government could not put into roofs for free without houses catching fire right around Australia. There were the school halls that could not be built without rip-off after rip-off. There is the National Broadband Network that is digging up a street near you, whether you want fibre, need fibre or are prepared to pay extra for fibre once it finally arrives. There was the live cattle fiasco, because this is a government that panicked in the face of a television program. Above all else, hovering over this government like a constant symbol of failure, are the boats that keep arriving, day in and day out, because this government did not have the common sense to leave well enough alone and accept the policies that actually worked. Having changed those policies, having restarted the boats, the government now lacks the honour and the decency to put back into place the policies that have been proven to work. This is a government which has been replete with broken promises. Within the first six months of this government, the promises started breaking and there has been an absolute cavalcade of broken promises since. I could spend 15 minutes talking about the broken promises of this government: the childcare centres that never got built, the so called superclinics that have not been built, the 2½ thousand trades training centres that are yet to be rolled out, the Fuelwatch which stopped watching and the GroceryWatch which had its eyes closed and eventually got everything closed. There is the private health insurance rebate that was never going to be means-tested and which now is being meanstested. There is the baby bonus that was never going to be means-tested and now is being means-tested. Above all, there is the broken promise that will haunt this government and this Prime Minister to her political grave: that notorious statement, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,'-that notorious statement that she made five days before the election, to win votes, and then trashed after the election to hold onto office. What a shameful, embarrassing and unprincipled Prime Minister, who would make a categorical statement to win votes and then trash any concept of democratic legitimacy by overturning that commitment in order to do her sordid, squalid deal with Bob Brown and the Greens-the first of many sordid, squalid deals which have been done by this government and this Prime Minister over the last 14 months. If there is one thing that this government lacks, it is integrity. It is the of competence, lack of honesty and lack of decency which are causing the Australian people to suffer. We all know how prices have gone up, because this is a government that cannot manage the economy properly. Since the end of 2007, power prices are up 60 per cent. Water prices are up 58 per cent under this government. Gas prices-and you would know this, Mr Speaker, from your own constituents telling you-are up 36 per cent. Education costs are up 21 per cent, health costs are up 24 per cent, rent is up 23 per cent, and food and groceries are up a whopping 33 per cent because this is a government which cannot be trusted with economic management. Above all else, this is a government which cannot be trusted with public money, because this government inherited a $20 billion surplus and turned it into a $50 billion deficit. This is a government which inherited $70 billion in net Commonwealth assets and has so far built up $107 billion of net Commonwealth debt. And the government says that it is going to move into surplus next year. Four years of the biggest deficits in our history and now it says, on the basis of nothingbecause it will not face this parliament to have the crisis minibudget that our country needs-that it is going to bring us back into surplus next year. There is a better way. The better way is the coalition's strong plan for a better economy for a better Australia. Our objective can be stated quite simply and quite clearly. It is lower taxes, better services, more opportunities to work and, above all else, stronger borders. If we are going to be a self respecting country, if we are going to be a truly sovereign nation, we must have strong and secure borders. The first task of a government, apart from lack securing the borders of the country, is to ensure that it lives within its means. On this side of the House there is the experience, there is the competence and there is, above all else, the will to get wasteful government spending under control. It is in our DNA to get wasteful government spending under control. We did it before, between 1996 and 2007, and we can do it again. Sixteen members of my front bench were ministers in the last government to get the fiscal position of the Commonwealth under control. We will not need to learn on the We will not need to wear L-plates, like the government are still wearing. In fact, they are not wearing plates, they are F-plates now-'fail' plates. In fact, they have been deregistered. That is what has happened to them. We can do it because we have done it. We have done it before, we can do it again, and one of the reasons why the Australian people are now so hungry for a change of government is that they know there is an alternative that can get the fiscal situation under control. We will not just talk. We showed before the last election that we could go through Commonwealth budget, line by line, item by item, program by program, and identify serious savings. Before the last election we identified $50 billion worth of savings. We did it before; we can do it again. We appreciate that the task is hard. We appreciate that the challenge is great. We appreciate that the political difficulties there. But we will not shirk them, because we know from experience of what is happening in Europe right now that a terrible judgment is pronounced against countries and peoples that keep on spending, keep on borrowing and keep on taxing when it is going to do damage to them-and it will do damage to them. We have a clear plan not just to get government spending under control but to make our economy more productive. I have identified a six-point plan for higher productivity. It involves a bigger workforce. It involves more productive public institutions. It involves a serious attack on red tape, with serious savings for small businesses based on a model that has been working for some years now in the state of Victoria. It involves investing serious money in infrastructure that really will bring economic and social benefits to our country. We will spend the money in Auslink on job. projects which have passed cost-benefit analyses and which always have published cost-benefit analyses. This government, having promised that nothing would be done without a serious cost-benefit analysis, has not published a single one. It is no wonder that the former Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the former member for Melbourne, resigned as soon as the current Prime Minister took office; he was made a fool of, because his promise was never adhered to and he knew that it never would be adhered to under this Prime Minister. There will be a review of competition law the to ensure that businesses large and small compete on a genuinely level playing field. There will be more productive workforces. We will build on the legacy of the former Howard government and have genuine participation reform in this country. There will be continuous activity for unemployed people under 50. We will extend welfare are quarantining from the Northern Territory to long-term unemployed people right around Australia. We will reform the disability pension to ensure that older people in particular are not parked forever on the pension when they could still have opportunities for work. We will cut off the dole for young people in places where unskilled work is readily available, because Warren Mundine is right. Warren Mundine, the former National President of the Labor Party, is right: it is much better to have people showing the world what they can do than to have policies in place which encourage them to show the world what they cannot do. We took really outstanding policies to the last election. You know, Mr Speaker, because you were advocating for the policies that we took to the last election. I hope you might find it in your heart to continue advocating for those policies. There were incentives to employers who took on young long-term unemployed people and kept them there. There were incentives to employers who took on seniors and kept them there. The seniors of this country should not just social and cultural contributors; they ought to be economic contributors too if that is their wish. There should be no age of statutory senility. There should be no bar to older people contributing to our economy if that is what they want to do. The older people of this country have the skills, the work culture and, in many cases, the readiness to do more, and we should give them the encouragement that they need. Since the election, my front bench colleagues have announced better water management policies, including new dams, because why shouldn't the north of Australia become a food bowl for Asia? Why do we constantly set limits on ourselves because members opposite are in thrall to Bob Brown, the real Prime Minister of this country? We came forward with a $2 billion mental health policy. It was so successful that even this current government was shamed into doing something at budget time. I am proud of the anti-dumping policy on which my friend the shadow minister, the member for Indi, has done so much work assisted by the shadow minister for resources. That will put in place the same effective anti-dumping regime which has protected the industries of Europe and North America. We can do better than this government. The Australian people are feeling down because they know we can do better. This is a great country. It deserves a better government, and we stand ready to give it to them. (Time expired)",97
194,Mr CLARE,IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your election as Speaker today. I have to say the thing I like about the Leader of the Opposition is that you always know what he is going to say in these be debates. He is a bit like MCDonald's: wherever you go to MCDonald's, you always know it is going to be the same. Whether it is Manuka MCDonald's, Bankstown MCDonald's in my electorate or the Caloundra MCDonald's in the Speaker's electorate, you always know what you are going to get. A Big Mac always tastes the same. The thickshake always tastes the same. The fries always taste the same. It is a bit like that with the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition. Just like MCDonald's, they are always cheap and nasty, and if you swallow too much of it then you get that negative feeling in the pit of your stomach. He is the Ronald MCDonald of Australian politics: just cheap and nasty insults, and if you hear too much of him then you might just throw up. There is nothing positive, no ideas, no plan for Australia's future-just oppose everything that moves. It is just rancid, unrelenting negativity. Imagine what would happen if one day he said yes to something. Streamers would fall from the public gallery, confetti would rain in this place, a mariachi band would come from the press gallery, and I would probably have to order some Super Hornets to fly over Canberra to celebrate the great event. But the chances of that happening are not very high. He is so negative that he even opposes a mining tax that the big miners support. He is so negative that now he opposes not only this government's policies but his own policies. He has a policy of cutting carbon emissions by five per cent by 2020, and a couple of months ago, when he was in Queensland, he said that policy is crazy. So he is so negative now that he thinks his own policies are crazy. His policy on asylum seekers is to place asylum seekers in Nauru. There is legislation before this parliament that would allow him to do that if he ever became Prime Minister, and he is opposing that. So he opposes not just government policy but now even his own policies. He is so negative, Mr Speaker, that he even opposed you and issued an order that no-one from the coalition should stand for the position of Speaker, and he had no-one on that side of politics support your nomination or your election as Speaker of this parliament. He is that negative. He opposes our policies, he opposes his own policies and he even opposes you. This is a debate about public policy. Let me tell you a little bit about what this government has been doing. We have put a price on carbon. After a debate that has now taken almost 20 years, it is this government that has been able to put a price on carbon. We are rolling out the National Broadband Network. We are delivering the first Paid Parental Leave scheme in Australia's history. We are delivering a national health agreement and $5.8 billion in a flood package to help rebuild Queensland and Victoria. We are delivering a budget that delivered 99 per cent of our election promises and keeps on track for a return to surplus in 2013. Finally, this week we have legislated through this parliament to introduce a minerals resource rent tax. The Leader of the Opposition comes here and talks about the importance of good policy. I will tell you what good policy is: good policy is making sure that we stop Australia going into recession, and good policy is making sure that we do not have an unemployment rate such as you find in the United States or in Europe, of 10 or 20 per cent. It is about making sure you do not have a million people on a dole queue and all the strife that you see in other parts of the world. That did not happen here in Australia, because of the action that this government took, because we made the right economic decisions with the right policies-policies that were opposed by the Liberal Party and by the National Party and criticised by them all along the way. That is the difference that a Labor government makes. There are five pillars that this country is built on, and each of them has been built by the Australian Labor Party, and this government is building on each and every one of them. The first pillar is the US alliance. Our alliance with the United States might have been signed by a Liberal Prime Minister, but it was built by a Labor one. Prime Minister John Curtin forged it in the darkest days of World War II. This relationship not only turned the tide of war in the Pacific but has underpinned Australia's security ever since. It was built by the Labor Party, and it is this government that is building on that with the announcement that we made with the President of the United States here only a week ago. The second pillar that modern Australia is built on is our open and competitive economy, responsible for more than 20 years of uninterrupted economic growth built by the Hawke government and the Keating government. They are the ones who floated the dollar, opened our banks to competition, cut tariffs, developed competition policy and introduced superannuation for the first time for all Australian workers. It is this government that is building on that pillar. We are doing that by rolling out the NBN, by introducing a price on carbon and by increasing the superannuation that all Australian workers will receive from nine per cent-where the Howard government chose not to implement what the Keating government had promised-to 12 per cent. This makes sure that the average Australian worker out there-someone who is 30 now and on 50 grand a year-will have an extra $108,000 in their pocket when they retire. The third pillar on which Australia is built is fair industrial relations. This is the party that helped to establish compensation, the old age pension and the disability pension, and we are building on that by getting rid of one of the worse pieces of legislation ever introduced into this parliament, Work Choices. The member for Mayo knows it well because he is the architect of it. He is the guy who drafted it. He is Dr Frankenstein, the man who created the monster that killed his own boss. We are the party that is building on that pillar, building a fairer workplace by getting rid of Work Choices and introducing the Fair Work Act.",100
195,Mr Briggs,IMPORTANCE,It's going very well!,102
196,The SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE,I remind the honourable member for Mayo that he is under warning.,102
197,Mr CLARE,IMPORTANCE,"The fourth pillar on which modern Australia is built is access to health care. The Whitlam and Hawke governments built the Medicare system, and every step of the way the Liberal Party tried to destroy it. They opposed it when Fraser was in opposition, and then when Fraser got in they got rid of Medibank. We introduced Medicare under the Hawke government. They opposed it at every election ever since. It is this government that is building access to health care, and we are doing it now, building on that pillar. We have increased hospital funding by 50 per cent and provided the biggest increase in mental health funding in Australia's history, and we are now developing the National Disability Insurance Scheme that is underway. The fifth pillar on which Australia is built, of course, is an education system that gives access to everyone. The Whitlam government made university available for many Australians for whom it would never have been available before. During the Hawke and Keating governments, the number of people that finished high school jumped dramatically, from the 50s to the 70s workers per cent. It is this government that is building on that as well by making sure that more people get access to university and more people finish school, increasing participation rates at school from 75 per cent to 90 per cent. What drove all of these Labor governments in the past are the same things that drive the men and women behind me now. It is the purpose that has always driven the Labor Party to improve the lives of ordinary working people and to build a stronger society, a stronger economy and a fairer country. That is what this Labor government is about. That is what Labor governments have always been about. The Leader of the Opposition, in his constant stream of bile and unrelenting negativity, talks about policies. Maybe we need to talk about not just better policies but better judgment. In the Australian last month the Leader of the Opposition said: Napoleon said that one quality he wanted in his generals was luck. Well, I think the one quality the public want in their Prime Ministers is judgment. Too right. The problem is that the Leader of the Opposition does not have any. In particular, he does not have any economic judgment. Remember: this is the bloke who in his first big speech on economics a few years ago said that the stimulus that stopped us from going into recession 'wasn't necessary'. This is the bloke who said Work Choices was 'one of the greatest achievements of the Howard government'. This is the bloke who made Barnaby Joyce his chief financial adviser. It is like putting his child? Homer Simpson in charge of the nuclear power plant. And this is the bloke who still opposes the mining tax even though BHP and the other big miners support it. His economic judgment is worse than that of Herbert Hoover. At least Herbert Hoover was awake. At least Herbert Hoover was not asleep when he made the worse economic decisions that caused the Great Depression. When the greatest economic crisis since the Depression hit, where was the Leader of the Opposition? He was not on this side of the chamber voting for the stimulus that stopped a recession. He was not on that side of the chamber voting against it, which would have caused a recession. He was upstairs in his room asleep, sleeping through not one division but five. He topped it this week by almost sleeping through 32 divisions. As the Leader of the House said, he only woke up to vote no and that is all he did. His judgment on other things is no better. Look at health and education. When he was Minister for Health and Ageing, he ripped $1 billion out of our hospital system. What was his promise on education at the last election? He promised to rip $2 billion out of education. His personal judgment is not much better either. Remember: this is the bloke who told people to donate to the Liberal Party during the Queensland floods instead of donating money to help the people of Queensland. Remember: this is the bloke who attacked Bernie Banton during the 2007 election just weeks before he died of asbestosis. This is the bloke who tried to stop an expectant father from being at the birth of his own child only a couple of months ago. The Leader of the National Party may not like it, but he knows it is true and he must pose in his own mind-like the member for North Sydney, a man who did not agree with that action-what sort of a man would try to stop another man from being at the birth of The problem that the Leader of the Opposition has as well is he also stands for nothing. Remember John Howard used to say, 'Love me or loathe me, at least you know where I stand.' You cannot say that about this Leader of the Opposition because he flips and he flops. He changes his position on everything. One minute climate change is crap; the next minute it is real. One minute he has a policy that says he will cut it by five per cent; the next minute he says that is crazy. One minute he says Work Choices is one of the greatest achievements of the Howard government; the next minute he says it is dead and buried. Apparently, one of the Leader of the Opposition's favourite quotes is from Ralph Waldo Emerson, the great American essayist. Emerson said: … consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. His former boss John Hewson used to say of the Leader of the Opposition that he was all over the place-black one day, white the next. He got that right. The Leader of the Opposition said that superannuation is a con job 15 years ago. Now he says he is going to support it. He said paid parental leave would only happen over his dead body. Remember that one! Now he says he has his own scheme. He bags the Australian economy here in this place and then he goes to London and says that we are the envy of the world. He calls on the Australian government to establish the Nauru solution and then when we put legislation in that would allow him to do that he votes against that too. How has this disciple of John Howard ended up opposing the policies of John Howard? Because he is a man who does not believe in anything. When you do not believe in anything you get things wrong. He has come into this place and said that the carbon price would be the death of the coal industry. He said the mining resource rent tax would kill the mining boom stone dead. Last time. I was here I reminded the House that one in six members of the opposition have bought shares in coal and resource companies over the last few months since we made that announcement. I have had the Stasi in my office check. There is a sudden silence from the opposition about buying shares. I wonder how that happened. (Time expired)",102
198,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," The honourable member opposite, in amongst his personal insults, tried to rewrite history so that Labor could take credit for every good thing that has happened in this nation. They have to monumentally rewrite history to do that, but of course the Labor Party spin machine usually does not want facts to get in the way. I acknowledge that Labor governments have done some good things over the years. The sad thing, on this the fourth anniversary of this Labor government, is that this government is not in their league. This is a government that is an embarrassment to its own history and it is certainly an embarrassment to our nation. It is a government that will be recognised for its failures, for its inability to deal with simple policy issues, for waste and mismanagement. Dirty deals done in the middle of the night are the hallmark of this government. Treachery and betrayal are its stock in trade. Even the chaotic events of this morning carry the unseemly stench of a government that, along with those who provide comfort to the government in this place, is consumed by self-interest and hanging on to power at any cost. No matter how worthy a person may be, if he needs to be turned into a carcass to achieve an objective then the Sussex Street mob are prepared to do whatever it takes. History will judge all involved. Two years ago our current Prime Minister said that Labor had lost its way. Of course she was right, Labor had lost its way, but now it is clear it has even lost the map-in fact, the whole atlas is lost. They have no idea where to go or what they should be seeking to achieve. Today as we commemorate the fourth anniversary of this government, its four disastrous years, it is Australian families who have suffered the most. For them, these four years have been a really hard, long slog. They are paying a high price for four years of Labor's broken promises, their wasteful and irresponsible spending, their economic mismanagement, their dodgy deals, their leadership intrigues, their absolute incompetence. This is a birthday that Australians are not celebrating. They grieve on this day, rather than celebrate, because they have had to endure so much as a people so that Labor can hang onto the keys to the Lodge. All Australians have received gifts from this government, like the carbon tax, the mining tax and budget deficits, and now we are going to have a government in crisis minibudget before Christmas, delivering more bad news to Australian families and bad news on Australian services. There have been cuts in services and cuts in the standard of delivery of the things we need in this country, and yet the government continues to run up more and more debt. The taxes keep rising, the deficit gets worse, the boats keep coming and the bad government finds new ways to be even worse, to sink even lower. Labor has squandered its inheritance, turning $45 billion in the bank into $107 billion in net debt. Today the Gillard government is racking up a staggering debt of at least $100 million every day. It is out there borrowing and borrowing and borrowing. While there is intrigue going on in this country, the financiers running our country and seeking to pay the government's bills are going around China and the rest of the world trying to borrow more money so that the bills can be paid tomorrow. And it is not $100 million just today; it is $100 million, or even higher numbers, tomorrow and the following day-it has to be done every day to pay the deficits this government is racking up because it cannot manage its own affairs. This is not the end of it. Australians are going to look forward to a carbon tax that is going to add $4 billion to the budget deficit",104
199,Mr Hartsuyker,IMPORTANCE,How much?,105
200,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"Four billion dollars-and a mining tax that is going to cost at least $6 billion to the budget deficit. How can you introduce gigantic big new taxes and actually end up with a deficit? Only Labor can run financial affairs like that. It takes an extraordinary feat of economic incompetence to create two new massive taxes that actually exacerbate an already woeful budget position. There are two great big new taxes but the nation's finances are $10 billion worse off. And what is going to happen after the Treasurer delivers his government in crisis minibudget next week? It is always families that are going to foot the bill, with debts and deficits driving higher interest rates. From the middle of next year the carbon tax will drive up the cost of everything, making next winter especially hard for Australian families as they struggle to pay the increased electricity bills or are forced to suffer in the cold. Labor should not claim that this is something that is happening accidentally. The very design of Labor's carbon tax is to encourage people, to force them, to switch off their heaters on cold days and to switch off their air conditioners during a hot summer. This is the strategy: make the price of electricity so high that we cannot afford to use it anymore and as a result there will be less CO2 emissions. Then we saw the asylum seeker debacle. More people have arrived by boat in the last three days than in the last six years of the Howard government. Does that sound like a successful asylum seeker policy? It is a dismal failure. The welcome mat is well and truly out with their onshore processing arrangements these days: it only takes a few days and you are out living in the city and qualify for benefits et cetera. This has been the greatest encouragement to the peoplesmuggling business to ramp up their trade. Frankly, it is a shameful example of this government's failure-and it is a failure they could so easily fix. They pulled their own legislation; they failed to bring it into the House for a vote that could have resolved this problem. We could have had this problem fixed by this Christmas but it is not going to be. There will be thousands more people coming before the government have the courage to bring their legislation into the parliament to try and fix the problem. What we have now is a government that is completely out of control. They talk so much about how they want to care for people and they make big announcements, such as the national road system-which is in fact paved with press releases. There are grandiose announcements, especially from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, like $1 billion extra for the Pacific Highway. But, when it came to it, $700 million of it had already been announced, $200 million was being transferred from other projects in New South Wales and the whole billion was going to be spent on planning. There were announcements last week about a whole stack of new projects that are being brought forward to try and make next year's balance sheet look a little bit better by bringing the debt forward. The projects will not be built, but the debt has been transferred from one year to the next to try and help Labor deliver its dream of a balanced budget. Of course that will not happen, no matter what is said in the context of the minibudget that is in process. In my own electorate just the other day the minister announced a large number of new projects that he said would fix black spots on the Bruce Highway. I do not know whether he even reads his own press releases because he has already announced all these projects, some of them many times, and most of them are already finished. He announced a new spate of activities that are going to happen on the Bruce Highway but most of the projects are already completed and have been for months. I also want to refer to a number of people who are not going to have a happy Christmas this year as a direct result of another government policy failure. They have spoken a lot about their proposed new mental health initiative-a $2.5 billion mental health initiative. We do need to do more on mental health, but what they do not front up to is fact that the government are actually cutting expenditure for mental health this year. They are actually cutting expenditure. I have been approached by many psychiatrists in my own electorate who are now fronting up to the cruel reality of the limits that have been put on the Better Access program-people who cannot get any psychiatric care over the Christmas period because they have used up their 10 treatments for the year. One person who wrote to me has 63 patients who have accessed their maximum 10 rebates in 2011 and now cannot get any services until 2012. What are this government's priorities? They go on with all this intrigue and political nonsense, when they should be looking after the Australian people. This is the fourth birthday of disaster, an anniversary of an underachieving government-a government that ought to give it away. (Time expired)",105
201,Mr BRADBURY,IMPORTANCE," Deputy Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment to your office. It is great to be able to make a contribution to this important debate-a debate that gives us an opportunity to reflect upon the direction in which this government has taken the nation over the last four years. It is a very proud record of achievement. We hear those on the other side reflect upon various matters, but there are a number of really important issues that you never hear them talk about. You do not hear them talk about jobs. In fact, when the global financial crisis was about to descend upon us, I remember the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, came into this place one day and he said, 'It's all about jobs, jobs, jobs.' I think that was the last time. I heard anyone from that side come in here the and place any emphasis on jobs. But there is a good reason that they do not want to talk about jobs, and that is that they supported policies that would attack jobs. They opposed policies that would create jobs. During the global financial crisis we generated 700,000 jobs in this country. In fact, in the life of this government we have generated 750,000 jobs. As we generated those 700,000 jobs at a time when the rest of the world was confronting the economic contagion, we saw that right around the globe 30 million jobs were being lost. Here in Australia we created 700,000; around the world 30 million jobs were being lost. You will not hear those on the other side reflect upon that remarkable achievement. As a government, we do not take all the credit. We worked with the Australian community and with the business community in order to ensure that we were able to generate jobs when that was the key priority. And it continues to be a key priority of this government-to save businesses and to keep people in work. We know that the moment you lose your job, the ability to rebuild your life at some future stage, if and when you enter the workforce, is a much more challenging prospect than staying in work. We kept people in work, and we did that through a stimulus package that delivered major infrastructure investments in this country. As I travel around my electorate and around the country I see what we have achieved. I see the massive improvement in our schools, in public housing and in local community infrastructure delivered by our councils. I have seen the capital equipment that our businesses have invested in through the business investment allowance-and now we want to give them the opportunity to keep investing in capital, with the instant asset write-off for small business. We have seen the improvements in health care that this government has delivered over the last four years. We came into office at a time when the former government had neglected public services. They failed to invest in our hospitals, by simply saying, 'This is a matter for the states.' Remember the blame game? Well, we have tackled it. We have worked with state governments to deliver a compact that is increasing funding for health and hospitals, like the Nepean hospital in my electorate, which has received a massive investment of over $100 million$17 million on a new clinical school. In the entire term of the Howard government, the 11 years, the most they ever put in was about $2 million or $3 millionacross the entire period. We have invested over $100 million in this important hospital in the outer western Sydney region. We have made vital investments in hospitals all around our country. This is because we believe that our central, core, objective is about managing the economy for working families. It is about managing this economy rebut ensuring that the benefits of a strong economy are distributed across the community, so that working Australians and working families in electorates like mine and those of all members in this place are able to share in the bounty of this prosperous country. And we are a prosperous country. Do not let those on the other side tell us that is not the case. When it comes to the cost of living, which is a big issue-and an issue that has been a great challenge for governments throughout the course of history-our government has delivered a lot to ease the burden of the rising cost of living. We have delivered tax cuts in the order of $47 billion. We increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We introduced an education tax refund, allowing families to invest in those important goods that their children need in order to support their education and for those families to get a rebate from the government. We have delivered a historic increase in the pension-for the first time in the history of the pension a government has increased it above and beyond the rate of the CPI. We introduced a paid parental leave scheme. Remember what it was like-it was like pulling teeth-when those opposite were in government. People around this country campaigned to give working parents the opportunity to have some financial relief when they take that first step to have a family and those opposite fought tooth and nail to deny people that opportunity. 'Over my dead body' was one of the things that the former Prime Minister said when they were in government. We have delivered it. We have delivered the first national paid parental leave scheme-and aren't parents right across this country thankful for it! We have doubled the investment in our schools, and now when I go to schools in my electorate I see the entire school has been remade; it has been made over-a once-in-ageneration opportunity to remake our schools, and we did it. Every time you go to one of these openings you trip over the coalition MPs, who want to get into the photo opportunity ahead of the rest of us. They voted against it, but they want to be there, up on the dais, celebrating the great achievement. It is an achievement that not only got us through the global financial crisis but delivered the investments our country was crying out for, so that, regardless of where you live in this country, you saw the benefits of that investment in the education revolution. You are seeing the benefits in health care. Our health reforms are designed to ensure that, regardless of where you live in this country, you will be given a quality standard of health care. But we have an eye to the future because, like all Labor governments, we are focused on not only delivering for today but preparing our country for the future. That is why we are investing in the National Broadband Network. There are those on the other side who criticise this initiative. There were plenty of people who criticised the building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and there were plenty of people who criticised the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme, but today we look back and we celebrate the vision of the people who implemented those projects. We enjoy the benefits and we celebrate those benefits. Future generations will look back at what this government is doing with the National Broadband Network and they will thank us and they will herald the long-term vision of this government. In the entire time. I have been involved in politics-and I was involved in local government for many years-one of the principal laments of people in the community has been that governments are too short term. Often they are short term because it is hard to be long term, but this government aspires to a future of prosperity for the nation by delivering long-term programs like the National Broadband Network and pricing carbon so that we can begin the process of creating a clean energy transformation to wean ourselves off fossil fuels. We all know that at some point in the future our nation will have to wean itself off fossil fuels, but our government is doing something about it. We are ensuring that future generations will be able to share in the prosperity that we enjoy today. In fact, they will benefit from the clean energy jobs that will be created in this country today and tomorrow. We want to make sure that no-one is left behind, and that is why we want our national disability insurance scheme. Something talked about for generations will be delivered. We are laying the foundations, but it will be delivered. And, of course, we repealed Work Choices-the greatest assault upon the decency of the Australian people that we have witnessed. They put it in; we repealed it. We continue to ensure that working Australians have access to fair arrangements in their workplaces so that they have some rights; they have a framework that allows them to go to work knowing that they have some protection from being summarily dismissed without any recourse. They know that they can bargain with other workers in a context where they will never have equal bargaining power with their employer but they might have a fair go. These are the things that Labor governments deliver, and I am proud to be a part of a government that has been delivering these things over the last four years. We will continue to do that. The challenges that this country faces in the future are just as great, but we believe and have sufficient hope in the Australian people. We know we have the capacity to take those challenges on in the future, and that is what we will do. (Time expired) Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:56): Madam Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to this position. Not since the dying days of the discredited Whitlam government have we seen such a pitiful excuse for a government, with a leader who cannot be trusted, whether she is backstabbing her leader to take the top job of Prime Minister, having promised faithfully that she would never challenge him, or whether she is backstabbing the Australian people. This government is contemptible. A Prime Minister who promised the Australian people on the eve of the election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led then did a secret deal with the Greens and broke her promise to the Australian people. She broke faith with the Australian people. It was a solemn promise that she was prepared to walk away from. When it comes to the choice of keeping faith with the Australian people or clinging to power, this Prime Minister will ditch the Australian people every time. This is a contemptible government led by an untrustworthy Prime Minister. No wonder the joke going around the Twittersphere is: if Australia is the country, how come it is Greece and Italy that get to change Prime Minister? A survey was undertaken by JWS Research asking Australians to name the best government in Australia over the last 30 years. Ninety-six per cent of those people surveyed named any government other than the Gillard government. Four per cent named the Gillard government. I was thinking about that four per cent, but then I read another survey that said four per cent of the Australian people still think Elvis is alive. That explains it, doesn't it, Member for Brand? The vast majority of those surveyed named the Howard government as the best government of the last 30 years, and that is because it was and is the best government of the last 30 years. The legacy that this incoming lot received from the Howard government was invaluable. Unemployment was around four per cent and there was no government debt. We paid off every single cent of Keating's $96 billion debt so that we did not have to pay $9 billion or $10 billion a year in interest. We provided successive budget surpluses. I think it was about seven in all, wasn't it, Member for Flinders?",106
202,Mr Hunt,IMPORTANCE,"Ten out of 12, we had. Ms JULIE BISHOP: Ten out of 12 years were budget surpluses. But, for the past four years, the Australian people have been subjected to a divided, directionless, dysfunctional and increasingly dishonest government. What everyone has learnt, to this country's great cost, is that you do not listen to what Labor say; you watch what they do. Remember when the member for Griffith, before he was toppled by the Prime Minister, was campaigning on being an economic conservative. He was 'John Howard light'. He would have advertisements of him standing in front of the Brisbane skyline saying: 'I've always lucky been an economic conservative. I'm committed to budget surpluses. I believed in them when in opposition. I'm committed to them in government.' Budget surpluseswhat a cruel hoax on the Australian people. What have they delivered? Deficit after deficit after deficit after deficit. The past budgets have been in deficit-four successive budget deficits-a cumulative total of $150 billion in deficit. That means this government have spent $150 billion more than they have raised in revenue. That is one of the worse performances of any national government in living memory. How have they paid for this cumulative total of $150 billion? By cutting back the wasteful spending on their pink batts scheme and every other discredited scheme? By growing the economy? No-they have paid for these budget deficits by borrowing. From a standing start of zero government debt, in the last two or three years, net government debt is over $110 billion. It went from zero to $110 billion in two years. It took Labor 13 years to accumulate a $96 billion debt by 1996, and now it has taken just a couple of years for a $110 billion net government debt. The economic conservatives committed to budget surpluses have one of the largest debts in peacetime history and successive budget deficits with a cumulative total of $150 billion. Not even Paul Keating could rival that kind of economic vagrancy. Is there anything that the Prime Minister can be believed on? What of the Labor principle that they would not send asylum seekers to a country that is not a signatory to the UN convention on refugees? That is what the Prime Minister said when she announced her ill-fated East Timor processing scheme. She said, 'The government will not send asylum seekers to any country that is not a signatory under the UN convention on refugees.' She cannot even be believed on what we thought was an immutable Labor Party principle. Her Malaysia swap deal, the appalling deal that would see 800 asylum seekers sent to Malaysia, would already be exhausted by now because many more than 800 people have arrived since the deal was announced. This deal is, of course, to send four asylum seekers to a country that is not a signatory to the UN convention on refugees. So, what happened to this great Labor principle, the moral high ground that the Labor Party stood on to say, 'We won't send asylum seekers to a country that's not a signatory to the UN convention on refugees'? The only country they want to send asylum seekers to is one that is not a signatory. There are about 140 other countries to choose from. But, no, this government are committed to the one country that is not a signatory. Then, what of that other immutable Labor principle that they will not sell uranium to any country that is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty? I understood that that was Labor's moral high ground. They stood there saying, 'We will not sell uranium to a country that is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.' The coalition happen to disagree with that because we believe there are countries that can be trusted with Australian uranium. The Labor Party insisted, year on year on year, that it would not sell uranium to India because it was not a signatory, and we have had four years of unnecessary tension and diplomatic frustrations with India because Labor said that it was committed to a principle not to sell Australian uranium to a country not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Well, guess what ladies and gentlemen, Labor have now done a backflip, a 180-degree turn, and all of a sudden they are not on the moral high ground anymore. They are now going to put it to the annual national gathering of the Labor bosses, the union bosses, the union officials who run the Labor Party, to ask them for approval to sell Australian uranium to India, which is not a signatory. Is there no conviction that this government will not trash? Is there no principle they will not walk away from? Have they no ethics, no principles? This is a dysfunctional, divided, dishonest government. It does not stop there. There is another really disgraceful episode that has not received a lot of publicity but, believe me, is on the slow burn. This is in relation $223 million taxpayer funded tender for the Australian Network which is an important element of Australia's engagement with our region. This is a taxpayer funded international television service, the Australia Network. It broadcasts to about 44 countries in the Asia-Pacific Indian Ocean. In the past the Seven Network has had the tender, the ABC has had the tender, and it is put out for tender from time to time. The Gillard government announced the most recent tender in December with tender documents issued in February and at stake is $223 million. It was meant to be an arm's length tender. It has always been done through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as it should, because it involves soft diplomacy into our Responsibility for the decision rests with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but so divided and so dysfunctional is this government at the top that, without explanation, a secret deal was done. They ripped responsibility off the Minister for Foreign Affairs and gave it to none other than the minister for the ABC, Senator Conroy. Talk about a conflict of interest! The minister, who is responsible for the ABC, one of the tenderers, gets to decide the tender. And the Minister for Foreign Affairs is backstabbed yet again. It is like Lucy and Peanuts holding the football and poor old Kevin comes running in and she takes the footy away. This tender is now so discredited, the political and government interference in this tender is now so discredited, that the Attorney-General is intervening to investigate the circumstances. The Prime Minister and the minister for communications are complicit in yet another disgraceful episode of this contemptible(Time expired) Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (16:06): Madam Deputy Speaker, can I add it my voice to those who have congratulated to the you on your elevation. At the end of an extraordinary day, an extraordinary week and an extraordinary year it is indeed extraordinary that those opposite send in the peashooters when a cannon is needed. If that is the best they can do, they really are in a lot of strife and there is going to be a lot of soulsearching when they go back to camp at the end of this parliamentary session. It has been an extraordinary year because we have delivered 250 pieces of legislation, we are continuing the rollout of the National Broadband Network, 750,000 jobs have been created, there has been a historic agreement on health with more doctors and more nurses, $36 billion is being invested in infrastructure, and there is a record increase in pensions. On the other side of the chamber region. the penny has dropped because after 15 months of saying no those on the other side have realised that they have to have a positive policy agenda. They have sent the Leader of the Opposition in here in some panicked attempt to set out a positive policy agenda, but the best we get is a litany of sentences that start with the words 'no', 'stop' or 'John Howard'. If that is the best they can do, then this country and the Liberal Party are in a lot of strife. At the end of a very tough parliamentary year and a very torrid parliamentary session we can see why those on the other side are looking very worried indeed. They have members leaving the coalition, they have people all around the country calling them the 'noalition' and they have people wondering whether their leader has the temperament to lead not only the country but also his own side. I think over the long break there will be a lot of people wondering whether the Leader of the Opposition has the judgment, the temperament and the ability to lead them into next year. There will be a lot of nervous backbenchers on that side, indeed.",109

208,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," As the parliament draws to a close, I want to make some reflections, some Christmas valedictories. I know it always strikes us as a little bit strange that at the end of a parliamentary session in November we do Christmas valedictories. I do not want to give the impression to anyone that we are leaving this place and going on holidays. It always frustrates us when members of the public think that. People will be returning to their electorates for a full round of work, including those very special end-of-year school events that we all look forward to. This has been a year with many different facets. It has been a year when some have enjoyed triumph on the sporting fields. Whether it has been the Maroons, the Broncos, the Roar, the Reds, the Firebirds, it has been a good year for Queensland. Tassie bagged the Sheffield Shield. A good grand final for the Cats was a good grand final for everyone who does not barrack for Collingwood-and that is quite a lot of them! It was a year of Australian achievements. Brian Schmidt was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Ben Roberts-Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross for valour. We saw an athletics world championship award Athlete of the Year to Sally Pearson. We saw Cadel In Evans take the Tour de France. We saw Sam Stosur win the US Open women's singles tennis final. That was a remarkable event. At the same time as these triumphs we also saw much tragedy. Here in our own nation we had the summer of floods, natural disasters and the cyclone that hit so many Australian families so hard. We saw the earthquake in New Zealand and then the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We have seen the best of times and the worse of times in that sense, but even as we have seen the worse of times we have seen the best in our people. We certainly saw the best in Australians as they pulled together during those days of our natural disasters, as going to the help of others within our region. Some remarkable Australians died this year: Paul Lockyer, John Bean and Gary Ticehurst in that dreadful helicopter accident; Rob Chalmers, a legend inside Canberra; Nancy Wake, a legend around the world; Claude Choules, the last combat veteran of the Great War; Margaret Olley and Lionel Rose, two of our greatest in the fields of arts and sport. In this place we remembered friends and members of the House who left us this year: David Jull, Clyde Holding and Ralph Hunt. On too many dreadful occasions we condolences for those we had lost in Afghanistan. We remember them; we spoke about them on Monday during the debate on Afghanistan and I am sure as we move to the festive season our thoughts are going to be with our magnificent ADF personnel and the civilians who work alongside them who will spend the Christmas season not at home with family and friends but in those very rugged surrounds of Afghanistan. As this year winds down I do want to say a big thank you to so many people who make this place work. Let me start with the Leader of the Opposition. I am not sure that saying he helps make this place work was quite the right intro, but when I was shadow minister for health I did publicly announce that my wish was to make him Leader of the Opposition and to ensure that he did the job for a long, long, long time. I have succeeded in the first part of delivering on that Gillard promise and I am dedicating 2012 and 2013 to delivering on the rest of it, making sure that he is there for a long, long, long time. To Mr Speaker of today and of course to former Speaker Harry Jenkins, to the Deputy Speaker, to the Speaker's panel: we are sorry for everything we put you through. I cannot really say we are going to try to do better, though we will work as hard as we can to well as honour our Speaker's panel. To Henry Thomson, my department's parliamentary liaison officer, and his team, thank you. To the Clerk and Deputy Clerk, to the Serjeantat-Arms and to the attendants, thank you. They make us look good and someone really needs to; the clerks help all of us-members of the opposition and members of the government alike-get it right time after time. To the Parliamentary Library, Hansard staff, Table Office staff, Parliamentary Relations Office and the guides who take people through on tours, thank you for everything that you do. The cooks, the had switchboard operators, the computer personnel, security, gardeners and everybody who keeps things ticking over have done a magnificent job this year not only in their daily work but in hosting huge-profile visits like those of the Queen and President Obama. A big thank you to them and to the cleaning staff, often unseen and unthanked, but not in my office. I would like to say to Anna and Lucia: thank you for everything you do. Thank you to all of the cleaning staff in Parliament House. To Aussies, I do not get there personally much any more, but I recognise the cardboard cup when it comes and I clutch for it with a certain sense of relief. Where would we be without those who do the child care, the travel agents, and the Comcar drivers? To the Broadcasting staff, thank you for everything that you do. To the parliamentary press gallery, I am not sure thanks is the right word, but I will be shouting them a drink tonight so we will have time for some reflections then. To the secretary of my department, Dr Watt, Watty, and to the great Australian Public Service, thank you for what you do. On behalf of the Labor Party, thank you to George Wright and the ALP national organisation. To all of our volunteers and members, thank you for keeping the faith. To my own staff, my Chief of Staff, Ben Hubbard, and everybody who works alongside me-they are magnificent-thank you, thank you, thank you. My electorate staff who keep those home fires burning for me are a wonderful team and I want to thank them too. To the Australian Federal Police I see so much of, thank you for keeping me safe and for your good humour as you do it. Of course, I would like to say something to my colleagues on this side of the House, my parliamentary colleagues one and all. It has been a very big year. It has been a year in which we have worked with others of goodwill in this parliament to achieve remarkable results for our country, when we have not been afraid of the tough debates, when we have not been afraid of working with crossbenchers to help this nation seize the opportunities of the future. I want to thank my colleagues in this parliament for that. In my Labor team I particularly want to thank the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the world's greatest treasurer according to Euromoney. Thank you very much for your contribution to the nation and your personal support for me. It is very much appreciated. We have been through some times together, but I would not have it any other way. You have to love a man who loves his job and the Leader of the House, Albo, doesthere is no doubt about that. He loves his job here, loves his job in cabinet and has found a love of country music as well-who'd have thought? To my ministry and parliamentary secretaries, thank you for playing your role in leading us to a future in this country for working Australians, a future of opportunity. To the Senate leadership, Senators Evans and Conroy, thank you. We have learned some tolerance in this place now knowing what you have gone through over many long years. To the team of whips, the Chief Government Whip and his team, thank you very much indeed for everything that you do. I would like to very specifically say to the Labor team, as the year comes to an end, something I picked up from Ed Husic, the member for GreenwayA government member: Chifley.",112
209,Ms GILLARD,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"the member for Chifley-I am tired-when he did his maiden speech in this parliament. He said something that always struck me and so I am going to use these words to my Labor colleagues in conclusion. This is a saying in his original language translated into English: 'From my heart to yours, I can't thank you enough.' Thank you.",114
210,Mr TRUSS,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I am happy to join the Prime Minister in extending good wishes at this Christmas time to everyone who works in this parliament to support our day-today activities. The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, will join us shortly and I am sure he will add to my remarks. As are all parliamentary years, it has been a long and trying year. There have been difficult moments, testy moments. We have perhaps had the noisiest parliament that we have had for a very long time. There are always surprises, and I guess today has been one of those. We do depend upon a large number of people, thousands of people, to make this parliament work and work well. All of us are personally dependent upon our own staff and the people who work with us, and those who support us in our own communities both at a party organisational level and within our work as members of parliament. We pause today to say thank you to all of those. There are so many good things that they do for us and perhaps we do not always say thanks at the time, but they are appreciated and at the end of the year, as we start to enjoy the Christmas celebrations, this is the time thank you. I thank the staff in this parliament, the clerks and all their team, the parliamentary staff, the library people-the Prime Minister has gone through a long list including Comcar drivers and the people who work in the travel office et cetera. I thank the IT people. Occasionally the system seems to work but not always; we are grateful when it does and we realise how dependent we are on their work when it does not. To all those and to those who look after us in the dining rooms and all other places, we certainly say thank you. I know there are often comments after these valedictories that somebody has been left out of the thankyous. That is why I have not attempted a long list. I know there are many, many, many people who make this parliament work and make it work well. We are grateful to them and their contribution even though they may not be mentioned by name. From my own perspective, now that Leader of the Opposition is here and will make some more general comments on behalf of the opposition, I thank the Leader of the Opposition, Julie Bishop and our coalition colleagues and the whole shadow ministry team. They have been great to work with. We have dealt with a lot of policy issues and difficult organisational matters and it has always been done in a very good spirit. I especially thank the Manager of Opposition Business, Chris Pyne, who never lets us get our questions up and all that sort of thing, but nonetheless the day seems to be well managed and the objectives are achieved. I very much appreciate the support and assistance of my own parliamentary team and colleagues, and I acknowledge especially Nigel Scullion, my deputy, and Senators Joyce and Nash in the other place and those who contribute so much to make our organisation work well-Brad to say Henderson and the team in The Nationals Secretariat-and the wonderful and cooperative relationship we have with Brian Loughnane and the Liberal Party Secretariat. We do work very well as a team. We have very limited resources between us and we therefore need to get maximum value out of every person and every dollar that we have available. In my own Canberra office, I have David Witrow and his team. In my electorate office I have been so fortunate that in my time in parliament, over 20 years now, I still have two of my original electorate staff and the 'newcomer' has already been there about 15 years. They are a wonderfully stable and supportive group and that means an enormous amount to me. Christmas is a very special time of the year. It is an occasion when families can get together. Members of parliament who spend so much time away from their families especially treasure the opportunity to be in the company of their families when politics can be switched off for a while. We love to have our family and friends around, and the celebrations and the decorations and the lights of Christmas make this a very special time for us all. It is also a time, though, when we need to think of those less fortunate, those people who do not have family and friends with them, who have troubles to deal with. This is the disaster season for our country, and I pray that the two months or so that we will be away from this place are not like the two months last year when there were so many events particularly flooding in my own area and cyclones which caused so much damage. We want good rain and we want good seasonal conditions, but I hope that they will come in moderation and at the right time so that this will be a peaceful season especially for our disaster coordinators and those that we rely upon to provide assistance in those times. I appeal to all Australians to travel safely on the road. There are so many extra vehicles at that time and people who perhaps do not drive so much on the road at other times, and we all need to be careful and observant to make sure that we get to our destinations safely. Then there are all those people who have to work over Christmas, because we still need to keep the hospitals and the aged-care facilities open, and we need to make sure that we have available the basic services, even the shops these days that seem to be open for much of the Christmas period. We do appreciate the special effort that these people make. In talking about people who are working, often in hazardous conditions, I also concur with the Prime Minister's remarks and acknowledge the role of the Australian troops who will be in Afghanistan this Christmas away from family and friends and facing the added danger of that conflict. During the last couple of weeks I have attended two of the funerals of Australians who were killed in the especially tragic recent events. You appreciate how much of a loss it is to our nation when these talented, athletic, skilful young Australians have their lives cut short. I guess my overarching thought after leaving both of those events was the view that we owe it to those people to finish the task in Afghanistan. We owe it to those who have given their lives to make sure that we continue at the task even over Christmas and make sure that we bring peace and stability to the world just as quickly as we can. It has been an exciting year in the parliament, as it always is. There is a lot more ahead of us, no doubt, in the year ahead. I hope that all members will enjoy a wonderful Christmas season and a pleasant break, and will come back refreshed, ready to do business again. I hope that those who support us, and their families and friends, will also enjoy a pleasant Christmas holiday, when the real message of Christmas rings in their hearts, and that we all express our appreciation and goodwill to our fellow Australians to enjoy this season and to plan for the next year in the hope that it will be both safe and prosperous for us all.",114
211,Mr SWAN,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your new office and I look forward to working with you. It has been quite a year. It has been particularly a very different year in my home state of Queensland where, in January this year, most of the state was under water. We had the impact of the floods not just in South-East Queensland but far wider than that, right across the state. Then we had the impact of Cyclone Yasi in North Queensland and Far North Queensland. All this had a tremendous impact on our state. What it really showed was a fantastic community spirit in Queensland and right around the country. We had the 'gumboot army' come out right across the state, people flying into the state from elsewhere to help their fellow Australians. I have never seen such a community mobilisation in response to a threat in my whole life in politics. It really warmed my heart to see the reaction on the ground of people helping fellow citizens who were in trouble. It was, therefore, a great reminder of how our nation has succeeded and a great demonstration of what we can do when we work together standing shoulder to shoulder. I guess we may need to see that same spirit come forward again, if you are looking at the forecasts that are coming from the Bureau of Meteorology at the moment. But I am very confident that we have learned from what has occurred this year and we will be able to handle those circumstances with all of the energy that we mustered to handle the circumstances right throughout this year. It has also been a very interesting year in the national and international economy. The storm clouds are gathering again in the global economy but, because our economy is strong and because we have put in place arrangements over the last four years to further strengthen our economy and support jobs, we are in a far stronger position than any other developed economy to handle the worse that the world can throw at us. Something like 750,000 jobs have been created in Australia in the last four years, 100,000 of those in the last year alone. When you look at our economy, it is some six per cent bigger now than it was prior to the global financial crisis. There is virtually other developed economy that can make a claim like that. Why is it important? It gives peace of mind to our citizens that we have a strong economy which can continue to deliver jobs, and of course incomes, whereby people can support their families. So we can look to the year ahead confident in the knowledge that the fundamentals in our economy are strong and we are in the best position to deal with the worse that the world can throw at us. I want to say a few things about the parliament because there was a degree of scepticism that the parliament would necessarily work well in the circumstances of minority government. What we have seen in the past year is not just a functioning parliament but a parliament functioning very well. In excess of 250 bills have passed through the parliament. Debate interrupted. NA",116
212,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Stephen Smith: Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. I require that the question be put immediately without debate.",117
213,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I thank the minister for his congratulations. Question negatived. NA NA Valedictory Debate resumed.,117
214,Mr SWAN,REPRESENTATION," I was speaking about how well the parliament was working. Now that the Leader of the House is here I will leave further commentary on that to him except to make the point that this no year our budget went through in record time. That was very important, particularly given a number of initiatives in mental health and skills and training that are important to get into operation to further strengthen our economy. I would like to say a few things about the parties in the House. I would like to pay tribute to the Independents and minor party members in the House. They have been constructive. They have worked hard. These have been difficult circumstances, but I and the government appreciate not just their attention to detail but the spirit they bring making good public policy in this House. They prove that we can all work together in the national interest if we have got the will and if we have got the faith to work together. I think they have, through their participation here, made a very significant contribution not just to the workings of the House but also to the quality of our democracy and the strength of our economy. I would like to acknowledge the opposition. They have certainly lived up to their name over the past year. Politics is a battle of ideas and this year was a very long and tough battle. I certainly have enjoyed the debates in the House. I have enjoyed the MRRT debate in the House over the past few days. These are big and important decisions for our country. The battle of ideas happens here. Whether it is in the afternoon or whether it is three in the morning, it is important that we see these issues through in the parliament. Future generations will judge us all by the decisions we have taken in these big debates-the decisions to price carbon pollution and to put in place a resource rent tax. There are great differences between both sides of the House; nevertheless, the debate has been held here. I wish all opposition members a very happy Christmas. Don't rest too much because we will be ready for you in the new year. I pay tribute to the Prime Minister. This has been a year of delivery and the Prime Minister has delivered. She is as tough as nails and we have passed some of the most important legislation that this parliament has considered in many years. I said that she is as tough as nails, but I think she is actually tougher than that. She is as tough as diamonds. She has proved that time and again. Her resilience, her courage and her determination are extraordinary, but she also has the good humour and good nature that comes with it. That has been on display not to just in the House but out there in the wider community. From our point of view, all of those on this side of the House with Labor conviction very much support and pay tribute to the role that she has played over the past 12 months. I want to say a few things about my cabinet colleagues and the caucus. I pay tribute to my Treasury colleagues, Bill Shorten and David Bradbury. I also thank Penny Wong for the extraordinary work she does as Minister for Finance and Deregulation. It has been a tough year in the economy and it will be another tough year next year, given what is going on in the global economy, but we have a dedicated team working very hard to ensure we put forward the best possible policy. I also thank the Leader of the House for the extraordinary role he has played in the parliament in the past year. The speech that he gave about the Leader of the Opposition yesterday was a cracker. It will go down as one of the great parliamentary speeches. I was very familiar with the late Mick Young, who was also a great enthusiast for the House and particularly enjoyed the role that he played as Leader of the House. I can say to you, Albo, that speech was up there with all of the great speeches, including those from the late Mick Young. It is something you should be very proud of. I also thank all of the staff of the parliament, from the Comcar drivers through to the attendants and everybody who cleans our offices, for all of their commitment to making our parliament a better place. I particularly thank all of the electorate office staff in my Brisbane office and also all of my staff here in Canberra. In particular, I would like to thank Amanda Sayegh, who has been with us for over five years, who worked for us in opposition, who has been here right through government and who is going back to the Treasury but who has put in an extraordinary amount of work. She has worked night and day for over five years and we will all certainly miss her. I would also like to mention Hamish MCDonald, who has also gone back to Treasury but who is someone who has served our country very well over the past 12 months. I would like to thank all of the hard working Treasury officials who do so much for our country. Their professionalism is very important to the future of our country. We should value their work and we should honour it all the time. Lastly, I would like to thank my family. We all know that the lot of a politician's family is not an easy one. I have always had the enthusiastic support of my wife, Kim, and my kids, Erin, Libby and Matt. I thank them for all of their understanding. I also thank them for their advice-they are pretty good as political advisers actually. Our families bring us back to the grassroots in much of the advice they give us about what is going on out there in the wider community, and I thank them for that. For the year ahead, I am so confident about the future of our country. As I said before, storm clouds are gathering again in the international economy. We are not seeing the progress we would like to see in Europe. We are not necessarily seeing the progress we would like to see in the United States, in terms of the United States dealing with their long-term financial challenges. But the one thing we can be confident of is that we are located in the right part of the world at precisely the right time. We are not, in this region, immune from the fallout of events in Europe or in the United States but, because of decisions that were taken over the past four years here in Australia in terms of our response to the global financial crisis and global recession, we are in the best possible position to handle the fallout from these events. And so are many other countries in our region. The Asia-Pacific is the hope of the global economy. It does have the capacity to continue to grow and to harvest enormous productivity improvements. For the year ahead there are challenges, but I think we can all be confident, as we go through to Christmas, that we have a country which is in good shape and which has the capacity to respond to the challenges of the future.",117
215,Mr ABBOTT,REPRESENTATION," I hope not to detain the House for long, but it is important to thank and acknowledge some of the people who have made this a good year. I was given a list of the people I needed to thank, and the first person on the list is the Speaker-and it says 'Harry Jenkins'. He is not the Speaker anymore. He has had a good year, even if he might have had a bad day today. We do remember his work in the chair with gratitude, affection and respect. He will be able to go home to his family this Christmas with his head held high. He has had a good year. I thank you, Mr Speaker, for your work. I thank your Deputy Speaker, the member for Maranoa, and I thank the Speaker's panel. I thank the clerks, led by Bernard Wright. Bernard is probably the truest and most conscientious custodian of the best traditions of this House. I thank the Deputy Clerk, David Elder; the clerks at the table, Robyn and Joanne; and the serjeant, Claressa. I thank the attendants, who help to keep order in this place, led by Cheryl Lane. I thank the Department of Parliamentary Services, from Secretary Alan Thompson down, and all of those whom we deal with day by day who help to make our days convenient, safe and pleasant-whether it be the attendants, the whether it be the Comcar drivers or whether it be the people who clean our offices. They have our gratitude even if we do not stop often enough each day to say so. I thank my whips, led ably by Warren Entsch and supported by Pat Secker, Nola Marino, Mark Coulton and Paul Neville. It is very difficult to keep up the spirits of a parliamentary party-but, Warren, you are a party man in every sense of the word. You have kept our spirits up this year. I am very lucky to have such marvellous support from my senior parliamentary colleagues, from Julie Bishop and from Warren Truss. I could not ask for a better deputy and for a more supportive coalition partner. I thank and appreciate the Manager of Opposition Business, Christopher Pyne. I pay a particular tribute to my own personal staff, who are extraordinarily hard working, extraordinarily dedicated and awesomely competent, led by Peta Credlin. Above all else, and I am sure I speak for every member of this parliament, I thank my family. We all should thank our families. We are volunteers; they are conscripts. We can only stay in public life because of their forbearance while they allow us to do what we do-and I hope, as they look at us, at least some of the time they can be proud of us. I will not pretend that this has been a great year for the parliament. I do not believe that it has been. Nevertheless, if we could take off our parliamentary hat, take off our partisan hat",119
216,Mr ABBOTT,REPRESENTATION,"and yes, in the case of my friend on the other side, our particular rugby league hats-as one human being to the human beings opposite I say: may hostilities momentarily cease and may compliments of the season go to them. May God bless us, may God bless this parliament, may God bless our country and, finally, may I pause to acknowledge brave Australian soldiers killed and wounded this year in the war in Afghanistan.",120
217,Mr ALBANESE,REPRESENTATION,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (16:42): It has been an extraordinary 12 months. Indeed, this year marks 60 years since the role of Leader of the House was created. The first Leader of the House was Eric Harrison. A lot of things have evolved since then, but one thing has stayed the same. The Leader of the House's job is to be the leader of the party's lieutenant. I take that job seriously in terms of looking after the interests of the government. Also, however, in this parliament, I think the Leader of the House's job has evolved due to the nature of it. I very much try to look after the interests of members across the board and have probably more contact with non-government party members than any previous Leader of the House. I note that the nature of this parliament means that we have a Speaker who is an Independent just like we had in the last hung parliament. From 1941 to 1943, under that great Labor leader John Curtin, the Speaker of the House of Representatives was a member of the United Australia Party. In terms of the position, that is the case. It has been an extremely successful parliament. In spite of the fact that we started off with 71 votes on each piece of legislation, now 72 votes, we have seen some 254 bills passed by the House of Representatives, including major legislation: the National Broadband Network, all of our budget measures, national health reform, putting a price on carbon and, this week, the mining tax. This is important reform in spite of the fact that it has been opposed by the opposition, whom I have dubbed the 'noalition', which is what they have transformed themselves into. I hope that over Christmas Santa brings the leader of the 'noalition' a policy, but I am reminded of the fact that Santa says, 'Ho, ho, ho,' not, 'No, no.' So, when the leader of the 'noalition' talks to Santa and asks for a policy, I hope that does occur. I thank the Prime Minister for her support of my position as Leader of the House. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and my friend the Treasurer, Mr Swan. I find it always pays to be nice to the Treasurer, and on that basis I also thank the Minister for Finance and Deregulation just because I can! It is always good to have the Treasurer and the finance minister as friends, and I certainly do that. To my deputy, Mr Smith: it is always nice to have a deputy leader who has assets, and the Minister for Defence is always good to have as Deputy Leader of the House. To other ministers, including those who represent me at estimates, and to my friend the Chief Government Whip: we have been in this place through the long years in opposition. It is terrific to work so closely with you as the Chief Government Whip. To the crossbenchers, with whom we have meetings at least weekly and often many more times than that: thank you for your honesty, your integrity and your goodwill. It is important in terms of the functioning of this parliament that people mean what they say and do what they say they will do, and in each of the crossbenchers I have found that that is the case. Henry Thomson and the team in the PLO do a fantastic job in making this parliament work, as do the people in the Chamber Research Office and Parliamentary Library. To the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Bernard Wright; to David Elder and their team; to all of the House of Representatives staff, including Lupco: thank you for the work that you do. And thank you to the Table Office, the Serjeant-at-Arms, catering, housekeeping, HRG, IT support, no, security, attendants, staff at Aussie's, Comcar drivers and other DPS staff. I spend probably more time with the Manager of Opposition Business than either of us would like to occur, but the fact is that the Manager of Opposition Business is someone I have a good relationship with. We should not make that very public, because it would undermine both of our careers! But we do have a good working relationship that helps the parliament to function. To the secretary of my department, Mr Mrdak; to all the staff of my department; to the Chief of Staff, Michael Choueifate; my personal assistant, Karen Bissaker; my electorate office manager, Chris Cruden, and all my other staff; to the volunteers who go out there and help in the proud name of Labor to keep me as the federal member for Grayndler: thank you. To my family, who give up a lot of time and commitment: thank you for your support. Finally, as the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport I encourage everyone to drive safely on the roads over the holidays. It is a sad case that every year around Christmastime there are tragedies on our roads. We need to make sure that we get that drive-safe message out there in the community. It is something I encourage all members of the House of Representatives to do in terms of the messages to their electorate. For too many families in this country Christmas is a time of sadness as they reflect on past Christmases when they lost loved ones. Let us make sure that we minimise the road toll this Christmas. I wish everyone a very merry Christmas.  Opposition Business) (16:49): I will be brief as much already has been said in these valedictories which I agree with-not everything, but I certainly agree with much of it and do not wish to repeat it. I would like to send best wishes to the former Speaker, the member for Scullin, Harry Jenkins. I did not really get the opportunity in the tumult the earlier debate to put on the record my very genuine affection for the member for Scullin. I am sure the words he put to the parliament today stand on the record. I know that he loved the job of Speaker, and he did with great aplomb. We will miss him as Speaker, and I will miss him personally for the good relationship that we had. It was always candid and always friendly, never in the least bit acrimonious. I appreciated his often good advice and have a genuine affection for him. I also place on record my thanks to all the people who make this place work, who make us look good all year round. This has been a gruelling year and next year will be a gruelling year, but the clerks, led by Bernard Wright; the House attendants, led by Cheryl Lane; the Department of Parliamentary Services, led by Alan Thompson; and the PLO all ensure the parliament operates smoothly and well in spite of the frailties of many of its members. I also wish you the best in your role as Speaker. I look forward to working with you next year to try to bring about a better parliament and a better question time. The beginning of that would be a ministry and Prime Minister who tried to answer questions rather than simply slag and bag the opposition. I also thank my staff in my office. Some people think I am quite hard to work for. I cannot see that myself. Adam Howard, my Chief of Staff, leads a tremendous team. They do a very fine job. James Newbury works here in Canberra with responsibility for my role as Manager of Opposition Business. It is a very changeable job during the day. I would say that today was probably one that came somewhat out of the blue for me and my staff. All of us have to roll with the punches on a daily basis, but today might of have been one of the more exciting days from my perspective as the Manager of Opposition Business. In thanking my own staff, I would also like to thank some of the members of the it Leader of the House's staff: Jo and Moksha, who spent a lot of time talking to my office-and we spent a lot of time talking to them. It is not their fault that their bosses are not always as reasonable, calm and pacific as they should be. Both of them-this year Jo has been replaced by Moksha-and also James and others, in spite of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that visit us in this place on a regular basis, certainly do their job very professionally and very well. I thank the party whip, Warren Entsch, who leads a team that in this parliament have a great deal more to do than they would normally have to do. Warren does it with great friendliness and affability and holds the show together tremendously well. Also, while it pains me, I would like to thank the Leader of the House for being generally available to me to try to make the place work and also for being mostly candid with me about things that happen in this place. I would like to place on record that I think there was a very unkind cartoon of the Leader of the House in the Daily Telegraph, in the Piers Akerman story about the Leader of the House, because it is not true that Anthony Albanese has such dreadful ties or wears his pants so high. I actually rang the Leader of the House on this occasion; I felt that he might have been rather mistreated by the Daily Telegraph in the cartoon. I look forward to working with him next year as we go toe to toe on a tactical and strategic basis in this place for our respective sides. I also thank the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Julie Bishop; the Leader of the National Party, Warren Truss; and the leadership group in the coalition in general. We have had a good year. It has been a tough year. We have met the standards required of an opposition: to hold a government to account. I think that has been reflected in the field evidence that I receive from the public but also in the published opinion polling. We would much rather be in the position that we are in at the end of this year than the position that the government is in. Finally, I thank my family, Carolyn, Barnaby, Eleanor, Felix and Aurelia, who are 11, 11, nine and three-well, Carolyn is not, obviously; she is my age. But the others are my four beautiful children, the little small people who do not really understand, I think, why I spend so much time away from them when I could be with them. They are tremendous in their stoicism. All of our families put up with a great deal, and my family is an inspiration to me. I thank them so much for allowing me to do this job, and I wish everyone in the place a happy and safe Christmas.",120
218,Mr WINDSOR,REPRESENTATION," Mr Speaker, I will speak briefly. Firstly, I congratulate you on your appointment and wish you well in the job. I also extend, on behalf of the crossbenches, congratulations to the former Speaker, Harry Jenkins. I think he did an extraordinary job in difficult circumstances during this year, but also an extraordinary job in the previous parliament. I thank him for the way in which he conducted his work within the parliament and for the affable manner in which he has conducted himself. I wish him well on the backbench. We might be blessed to have him as a guiding light near the Independent benches, although he seems to have slipped away a bit during the day. At the risk of testing your indulgence, Mr SPEAKER because I think you might be a fairly tough nut to crack in some senses-I would like to express in my traditional numbers form my estimation of the former Speaker and issue him a 10. I congratulate him on his work. This year has been a very interesting year, and obviously the crossbench have been very much a part of that. I thank all of those that we have had contact with through the year, from both sides of the parliament, particularly people from both sides that were involved in the Murray-Darling committee. I thought the people-including the member for Riverina, who is here at the momentdid a sterling job in trying to come up with a consensus on that particular issue, and hopefully in the weeks to come a consensus attitude will be maintained in trying to come to grips with a very difficult issue. I thank my staff particularly. I will not name them all, but we have had a very, very interesting year. We are very good friends, as I think we all are with our staff. I thank the electoral staff and the staff that come to Canberra with me for the work that they do. All of our families obviously need to be thanked, and I join with others that have thanked the parliamentary staff, from the clerks, who are outstanding individuals as well as guiding lights in terms of the operations of the building, right through all my of the internal staff in the building, including the security people. I think it makes us much better members of parliament to see the way in which they conduct themselves in the building and the way they express themselves to the community. It makes me very proud. I have seen the deterioration in the New South Wales parliament over the years as to the regard that the staff are held in, and I think the staff are held in very high regard in this building. It is something we should maintain, because I think it says a lot about the work that comes out of the building if our staff are respected and they respect us. The year has been an extraordinary year. I congratulate the government on their performance in what has been a difficult year. I have been in a hung parliament before. I have some idea of what it is like as a participant, but I also have some idea of what it is like for the leader within a hung parliament: not easy. I particularly thank and congratulate the Prime Minister for the way in which she has conducted herself in the many negotiations. She must get sick of it from time to time. But I have never seen an occasion where she has become rattled or rushed or irritated in any sense in terms of her conduct towards me as a crossbencher or others in any meetings I have been in. I am sure in other private meetings she has a similar demeanour. The other issue that I would raise, Mr Speaker, is one that I hope becomes part of your demeanour next year, as the year progresses, both in this chamber and outside it. I also make this call to the press. I think, if we have learnt something from this year, it is that we need to respect one another to a far greater degree than we have. The way in which the press conduct themselves, and they are taking their lead from some of us in this building, such as the lack of respect that has been shown to the leaders of various parts of this parliament is something that we really do need to look at as individuals. And I would urge you, Mr Speaker, in your capacity, to try and lead the charge in relation to that. I think it is something that all of us should have regard to. We all talk to our schools, at times, about how precious democracy is. But it is built on mutual regard and respect. Even though the numbers are tight in this parliament-and the rough-andtumble will always be there, irrespective of the numbers-I think it is time that we reigned in the vitriol a little bit in terms of the way in which many of us conduct ourselves, including some of those in the press. We all should play a greater role in gaining greater regard and respect for others who might have different views from us within the community. It is paramount to our democracy that we do so. In conclusion, I thank all of those who have been involved in the year and wish all of you a very happy Christmas and a restive time. No doubt, we will back here to do battle again next year-hopefully, in a slightly different spirit. Thank you.",123
219,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATION," I am conscious of the time and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's keenness to make a contribution, so I will be very brief, much briefer than the Government Whip should be. But I do thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for deferring to me. I think it may have been her turn; I am not sure. It gets a bit confusing with the crossbenchers. I want to begin by reflecting on those who are serving Australia in overseas defence operations. We should all be thinking of them and their families at this time of the year, particularly of course the families who have lost their sons and those who have had their children wounded in the theatre of war. Christmas will be a challenging time for them. It has been mentioned many times that this has been a very busy year. It certainly has been. I would suggest that this has been a busier year for MPs and indeed the staff that support us than any other year in the history of our Federation. I could be wrong. Obviously, I cannot provide evidence of that! But I think it is stating the obvious. It has also been a successful year for both the parliament and the government. I was just asked on ABC 24 whether I believed the parliament was serving the Australian people well. I said, yes, it is, because we are progressing through this chamber and, indeed, the other place the government's positive and progressive agenda. If this House is doing that, then it is serving the Australian people well. I want to reflect very quickly on the former Speaker, Mr Jenkins, someone I consider a very, very close friend, someone who is liked very much by all in this place and someone who did an absolutely wonderful job as Speaker of the House of Representatives. I look forward to not only having dinner with him tonight but also observing him make a significant contribution in this place in other ways in the future. To you, Mr Speaker: congratulations. You are undoubtedly qualified to undertake the task you have been elected to do. I look forward to working with you and I wish you the very best in those endeavours. I must say some thankyous. My staff gave me a two-page list of people I need to thank. I will put everybody in this room at the moment out of their misery and not read that list; I am just going to talk about four or five groups. Of course, I want to thank all those in the government that I have worked with the Prime Minister, ministers, the Leader of the House and, maybe most important of all, my backbench colleagues, who have without doubt worked harder than any backbench in the almost 16 years I have been here. I note the Deputy Speaker is in the room; I take the opportunity to congratulate her on her election today as well. I look forward to working with her. I also thank the opposition to the extent to which we have had cooperation. Certainly, I have good cooperation with the Opposition Whip's office. We have our moments, particularly on the Selection Committee, as you know only too well, Mr SPEAKER - and you are no doubt looking forward to chairing that committee on a regular basis! I wish you the best, Mr Speaker; you will need a degree of luck.",124
220,The SPEAKER,REPRESENTATION,I think I might need that assistance!,125
221,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATION,"I thank the crossbenchers for their cooperation on a range of issues, both machinery and policy, and their contribution to the Selection Committee. I thank my staff. I am blessed with wonderful staff. I know it is easy to say that, and most people in this place do, but I say it from the bottom of my heart. Most of the good work done in the Chief Government Whip's office is done by my staff: Anna George, Natasa Sikman and Jay Suvaal. I am very lucky to have them, and I thank them. I also have wonderful staff in my electorate office. They give me enormous support in the job here as well. I also thank staff in this building more broadly, all the way from the clerks, who do a wonderful job, right through to the cleaners, the gardeners and the other people who do the practical things that make life more comfortable for us here. Finally, I thank my wife and my children, who have given me enormous support in this role and in this job as a member of parliament over the last almost 16 years. All of us here know that we cannot do it without their support. We, in a way, get to do the interesting things; the wives, the partners and, in some cases, the husbands keep the home fires going and do the tougher stuff, for which they get very little credit. But I certainly appreciate it, as I know other members do. Then, of course, there are our children. I have been almost 16 years in this place. My children have seen nowhere near as much of me as I would have liked and I am sure they would have liked-I am confident they would have liked!-and they have made sacrifices as well. I thank them. Finally, Mr Speaker, I congratulate you again and I wish all colleagues on all sides of the chamber all the very best for a wonderful Christmas and more quality time with those they love most.",125
222,The SPEAKER,REPRESENTATION,"I thank the Chief Government Whip. Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:08): This year will go down as one of the most tumultuous in federal parliamentary history, and the unprecedented events of today are no exception. Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your elevation to the high office of Speaker of the House of Representatives. I also pay tribute to the previous Speaker, Harry Jenkins. He did develop quite a cult following. There were a number of people out there in question time viewing-land who were just wild about Harry and he will most certainly be missed. This chamber has been the setting for robust debates over competing policy decisions this year. It is the battlefield in the war of words as we fight for the principles and ideas that each side of politics believes are in the national interest. We have seen some of the most intriguing backroom deals this year-a level of Machiavellian conduct that would make the master proud. But tradition, convention and precedent underpin the Westminster system of government upon which our democracy rests. Ours is one of the oldest continuous democracies in the world, and while question time might often descend into disorder-all Australians know why it is called question time; it is certainly not called answer time!-we should never apologise for robust political debate. For however passionately we hold our views, argue our case, advocate our cause, in the end we must never lose sight of the fact that people are entitled to a different viewpoint, and in a free society should be free to express that view, however much we may disagree. Over the century of this parliament we as a nation have upheld the fundamental freedoms. We have fought to retain those freedoms and I want to mention our armed forces representing our country overseas. Our defence personnel are defending those freedoms and fighting for the universal ideals of freedom and choice. I particularly want to mention our troops in Afghanistan and the troops and families of the Special Air Service Regiment based in Swanbourne in my electorate of Curtin. People all over the world aspire to live a life free from the threat of violence, wherever they are, and they aspire to live in a peaceful environment. Recently, I attended the funeral of Lance Corporal Luke Gavin, one of the 32 soldiers who have been killed in Afghanistan. It was heart breaking to reflect on the human cost of conflict. As a nation we must never forget those who have given their lives on our behalf and we must always support those who have been wounded. Turning to home, I pay tribute to the Leader of the Liberal Party, the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott. His inexhaustible energy is much admired. He is a strong, courageous and committed leader. Last year he forever changed the political landscape in this country and achieved what no other Leader of the Opposition has achievedseeing off a first-term Prime Minister, although the faceless men certainly finished that Prime Minister off. When a first-term government lost its majority for the first time in 80 years Tony Abbott made political history. He will make a fine leader of our nation. I have worked closely with Tony for many years now and we have a mutually respectful relationship. I enjoy his company and I look forward to continue working with him. To Warren Truss, the Leader of the Nationals, and the whole coalition team-the members and senators-I pay tribute to your extraordinary efforts. We have a close-knit leadership team. I value the professional relationship I have with Tony and Warren and my other colleagues Eric Abetz, George Brandis, Barnaby Joyce and Nigel Scullion as well as Joe Hockey and Chris Pyne. We are a team. We spend a lot of time together and it is always positive, good humoured and quality time. My fellow shadow ministry colleagues have worked well together this year. Our policy development committee is well advanced. Our work on identifying wasteful spending in the budget is ongoing. I thank not only our colleagues but also our policy committee chairs, our whips, those who serve on the Speaker's panel and all those who take part in the everyday ongoing parliamentary process in this place. I place on record my thanks to my Western Australian parliamentary colleagues for their support and their company on those long trips across the Nullarbor. To the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the House and the cabinet ministers, the Labor Party and the crossbenchers, I wish you the very best for the Christmas break, hopefully with your families and friends. I want to take this opportunity to thank staff-a competent, loyal and dedicated band, who work very hard for the cause that they believe in. In the Canberra office there is Murray, my chief of staff, Peter and Sam; in the electorate office, the indispensible Kirsten, Sue, Georgina, Judy and Mandy. I acknowledge and thank all of the staff who work here at Parliament House, all who work in this great public institution-who get up every morning, come into this place, hoping to make a difference, hoping to ensure that this parliament functions as the Australian people expect and deserve. Finally, I acknowledge the members of the press gallery and thank them for their reporting. 'Fair and balanced' is the phrase, I believe. I wish everyone a safe and happy Christmas and hope that we all return refreshed and reinvigorated as we strive to provide better public policy outcomes for all Australians. I wish all Australians a safe and happy Christmas. NA Selection Committee Report",126

The other thing we recommended along national plans, including a national plan for placed in appropriate locations and that there plantations are planned. We have again called a national plan which would enable infrastructure constructed-another very important part of industry in the future. The final recommendation of the report-and 19 of them-was for the government to hold forestry and future wood product supply and done through COAG. All of these things are RFAs, regional forestry agreements, which have forward that has been suggested here would reconcile that the RFAs should be renewed, incorporating that the industry has that longer term would new RFAs to be in place for at least three years and for a new regime within RFAs for ongoing Another thing within the report which is social licences, obviously for regional areas on the community, particularly where new plantations social licences is discussed.

Canegrowers are the peak body read a section from a submission they gave less energy than most products out there on the public need to understand that wood is not groups out there at the moment such as GetUp campaigns against legitimate commercial basically campaigning against wood products. look at a public education campaign on these lines is that COAG create a number of plantations to ensure that appropriate species are is appropriate infrastructure in places where on the government, through COAG, to develop for farmed forestry to be funded and the mix if we are to have a viable forestry I certainly have not listed them all; there are discussions on national approaches to farmed demand. I suggest that that would have to be vitally important. The report also looked at been controversial in the past. But the way the conflicting interests. We have said an evergreen extensions process.

The committee has called for before the expiry of the existing agreements monitoring and periodic assessment. mentioned a number of times is the concept of where there is forestry. There are certain impacts are being planted, so the concept of where we think the industry itself needs to look at is acceptable when setting up in a new location community. I fully support that concept. and this is an extremely important a source of renewable energy under the that that be taken into consideration. an issue, particularly in my electorate of Dawson, area. It ranges from Mackay through the Burdekin to Townsville. I think my electorate in all of Australia. We have had an it probably has not been a good experience. The investment schemes. The committee has but hard, view on managed investment of the issues that occurred in my electorate for sugar farmers in Australia and I want to to a previous inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint NA Committee on Corporations and Financial Services they had. They said: MIS investments can use their tax advantages to existing industries. In the case of the sugar cane availability of sugar milling capacity. That means land and cropping land. They continue: If a significant proportion of a sugar mill supply and would close. Cane cannot be transported economically another mill in that radius, all growers in that traditional, high-value crop. That particular problem was causing a great deal and Burdekin areas, which are all within or up with the problem they had. I think there The report from the inquiry has recommendations schemes. The committee said that the government think that long-term rotation plantations are an future; whether it is necessary and appropriate regard; and whether MISs are the best mechanism think it is then it needs to be seen whether effective. If it cannot meet that The submissions we received and the statements some were from within the industry and others in their community, and when I say 'industry' problems such as inappropriate species planted industries and a range of different issues. should be, where MISs should be and where something that I know the committee was very mindful of.

I would like to thank all committee would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate they managed the process and all the logistics around it.

The first recommendation is: … the Australian Government, through the COAG process to assess and publicly report on likely … into agribusiness MISs and the impact bid for prime agricultural land to the detriment of industry, ongoing viability of a region depends on the area is alienated, the mill would become uneconomical more than about 60km, so unless there were area would thereby have lost access to growing their of angst to growers in the Sarina, Proserpine near my electorate.

I would like to step through important and go to the heart of what is in the Standing Council on Primary Industries, lead a wood demand and supply scenarios over the longer term NA By 'longer term' we mean over the next 40 years. within 12 months. That was one of the clear a public process which should include both Australia's future timber demands are going what occurs within the industry and how the that plan. The second recommendation is that, once Primary Industries, there be: … a process to consider and publicly report on sufficiency'. I do not think that we should get too hung up clearly at where Australia wants to head with and what the overall policy settings, from both achieve that. Recommendation 3 asks the Australian government to: … run public information campaigns to promote energy-intensive materials. That is something that we need to do because, view of timber, logging and the whole process educate, especially young Australians, on renewable timber products are. We really need have been chopping down trees since Adam long as it is done in a manageable way, in a it; yet, sadly, I get the feeling that the Greens chopped down in Australia. This is a problem major political parties could usefully look at and look at what the timber The fourth recommendation is: … the Australian Government develop robust national different products made from harvested trees, including of those standards. Once again, a fairly sensible recommendation. the Main Committee chamber. There is carbon be able to see the benefits of that. We are down a tree; if you replant that tree and you carbon. We have to make sure that we take notice public debate on how we can make sure that timber as being an environmentally friendly product. The fifth recommendation of the committee develops a mature Carbon Farming Initiative the capacity for permanence and other ways generally. This recommendation is not very clear But there are real opportunities when it comes We would like to see this process completed things that we heard evidence on: there should be state and federal governments to report on what to be. That would help coordinate and plan for government can help and facilitate as a result of again, through the COAG Standing Council on whether Australia should aim for wood supply 'selfon the end result. The main thing is that we look its timber production, what our overall aims are the federal and the state levels, should be to timber and wood products as replacements for more sadly, the green movement has captured the of forestry. There is a real need for us to rethe whole timber process-how user-friendly and to get the balance back in this argument. We and Eve and we need to continue to do so. As renewable way, we can and should continue to do would be very happy if not another tree was that I think we need to address sensibly. Both something around this and say, 'Let's go out there industry has to offer Australia.' standards quantifying the carbon stored in the duration of storage and policy implications We can look around at all the timber here in stored in all the wood product here. We should not causing severe environmental harm by chopping use the timber wisely, you are actually storing of that, and that is a sensible part of the we use timber successfully and also promote was that the Australian government, as it regime, consider the capacity for additionality, for the CFI to support the forestry industry cut-we have to be very careful in this area. to farm forestry. This is where the use of NA additionality and the use of permanence can, forestry. With farm forestry, I am not talking about what I am talking about is a farmer using 10 whereby he can actually increase the productivity timber and then that timber can value-add to can rotate that timber. It can be hardwood timber is an area where we can get farming communities together. When it comes to additionality, when right, this can be very good. If we do not, sadly, more single plantations, and we heard a lot time at the wrong place and have not benefited there are some real opportunities there. Recommendations 6, 7, 8 and 9 are around clearly what should be defined as a 'native growth forest'. We need to stick to these regional forestry plans. We are seeing timber regional forestry agreements because of the continual what is an old-growth forest. The more they going to rely on plantations, which is then between the timber industry-and we are already to mining. We have got to get this balance forestry has been occurring, we let it continue. forested as all of a sudden being 'old-growth' communities who want to go in and harvest that that will be something which comes Recommendations 10 and 11 are around plantations. recommendations which have come out of all personal view rather than a committee The Committee recommends the Australian Government national plan for plantations, to ensure that:  plantations of appropriate species  appropriate regional infrastructure Recommendation 11 states: The Committee recommends the Australian Government:  decide whether the encouragement of long-rotation  establish whether it is necessary and appropriate objective;  if it is, set out a clear plan to meet that objective,  assess whether MIS as a mechanism  if MIS can meet that objective, determine whether and  if MIS cannot meet that objective, determine if we get the policy settings right, benefit farm a plantation of a single species in a vast area; or 15 per cent of his land for tree plantations of that land by the sensible plantation of his property because in 20 or 30 years time he which goes into mills. If done sensibly this and the timber communities working it comes to permanence, if we get the settings there is a worry that the CFI could lead to of evidence that they were put in at the wrong anyone. If we get this recommendation right, native forestry. Once again, this report sets forest' and what should be defined as an 'olddefinitions and we need to stick to them in our communities being driven out of forestry under redefining of what is a native forest and are redefined, the more our timber industry is going to create land use issues between farmers, seeing land use competition when it comes right. But we have to make sure that, where Let us not define an area which has been and 'native' so those timber industries and timber product can no longer do so. I am hoping that out of that series of recommendations. To me these are the most important this work-and obviously that is very much a view. Recommendation 10 states: lead a process through COAG to create a are planted in appropriate locations; and exists or is planned and funded. plantations is an appropriate objective of policy; for government to provide an incentive to meet that according to the national plan for plantations; can meet that objective; it needs to be altered to make it more effective; whether other mechanisms could do so. NA The evidence we heard on MIS was quite damning. investment in regional and rural communities by corporates looking for a tax advantage, not communities. My view-but it is agreed by minimum we need to do is to review and relook doing that, and I will be doing everything This policy needs to be reviewed, and seriously by which that should take place, and I will that happens. MIS needs to be reviewed. continuing to do what it was designed to do. relook at this whole area. That is what the that all sides will be looking at doing that important recommendation. My view is: if we can get the long-term forestry continue to grow, with all the environmental one sector, the timber sector, competing with good whatsoever to either side. Farming communities happening currently, especially in the area that see MIS plantations, trees, being ripped anything for the timber industry either. We need it right. My view is also that, following committee somewhere to look at recommendation full review of what needs to happen in this rotation plantation investment Recommendations 12 and 13 go to farm committee in the electorate of Wannon and there. I think these have enormous potential. grow, because you can continue to farm successfully putting plantations into 10 to 15 per cent. increase the productivity of the farm plus increase win-win, and it is an area where I think we if we get the Carbon Farming Initiative correct, something which I will continue to speak up on and to push. I am running out of time so I will look and 17, to do with forestry biomass. The have these policy settings wrong. We are not We are all, at the moment, beholden to the defies logic. It defies what the Greens are encouraging biomass. It is the largest renewable doing that in this country beggars belief. especially when it comes to the carbon tax-taxing then not allowing the use of biomass.

I was particularly glad to host the to look at some of the farm forestry practices In my view we are going to see farm forestry by adding a little bit of diversity by The evidence overwhelmingly was that this would the future income of the farm itself.
