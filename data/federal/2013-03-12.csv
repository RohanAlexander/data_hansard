What happened There was a program in Queensland that was helping the training of young people particularly-8½ Deloitte Access Economics report in July last people who never would have got a job but put in by the previous Labor government. thousand people got jobs as a result of that before the evaluation report came out-this is partnership agreement here in April last year-decided of a program a week before the report came out.

It said gross product and gross domestic product to in Queensland and Australia to 2020; an additional Queensland by 2020. That is for $90 million people. That is why we provide FEE-HELP and VET not providing the services, we should clamp about. But why would you close down good people, particularly disadvantaged young getting about $154,000; the Salvation Army who are getting $395,000 and $120,000 for for another program; or Riverview Employment Neighbourhood House Association, $147,000; got $45,500 for its community literacy program; got $95,000 for its community literacy program? from those opposite about those sorts of programs. would never, ever get compliance notices by chamber, but the coalition in Queensland took good providers, taking away billions of dollars million.

Much of the area where the fire was burning was able to mount a huge effort to ensure The major damage it did do was to get into a pine into millions of dollars, which shows you the types of fires under control quickly. occur in the electorate of Wannon. This was a The fire occurred at a rapid rate of knots. It sadly, were destroyed and it left farms and seen once again, to great community spirit. Once the fire was finished, once it was over, the needed to do to help those who were impacted. It was a telling reminder for me as I drove driving by in over 30-degree heat in the members fixing the charred fences which holiday Monday putting those fences back together, farmer who had had all the fences destroyed. it was just very, very humbling to see these their local community. The other fire-and this is a more recent which occurred in the Grampians. Again, this extensive damage. It very nearly led to houses that we saw large portions of farmland destroyed. a wonderful job in bringing this fire under control. Some of the stories of how they did that sweeping down hills faster than the fire trucks fires travel quicker uphill than down hills, country and the ferocity of the wind, this was a rapid rate down the hills. This gave a The fire has been contained and, once important in doing this. I must commend everyone crews to throw at fires as well as ground crews. There is one important point would like something that, as lawmakers, we will have occurred in areas which are mobile black spots-that members could not be informed of what was could not communicate to the outside world great technology uses we now have is the through text to those areas which are potentially these areas was there was no ability to do that If we are to get serious about warning communities, our emergency response services have all the have to look at mobile phone coverage.

There they were on a public all volunteering their time to do it for a It is what country communities are all about and people going about their work, chipping in for fire that we have had in Wannon-is the one was a significant bushfire. It could have caused being burnt to the ground. It very nearly meant Once again, the CFA, DSE and the SES did are quite remarkable. At some stage the fire was could go. Usually, CFA members will tell you, but in this case, given the steepness of some the not the case and the fire was actually moving at new challenge to those that were fighting it. again, the use of fixed-wing aircraft was very involved in making sure that we had air to make about all these three fires. This is to look at seriously. All of these three fires is, when the fires occurred, community going on quickly by mobile phone and they what was occurring by mobile phone. One of the ability for CFA and DSE to alert communities being threatened by bushfires. The trouble in because they were in mobile phone black spots. if we are to get serious about making sure tools available to them then we are going to a real issue.

I also would like to make a statement on been the land of drought and flooding rains. If a holiday you will understand this. Add fires, and we do have more than our fair share of in the form of our volunteering we also have an disasters. We do not just expect the government those who have been inundated or burnt. We pull literally help ourselves, with the support sooner to help. I think it is one of the amazing very often unsung heroes come out again and as was the case with the floods in Queensland. areas were inundated for sometimes the third or come out to help them to mop up and start a broad set of flat plains. Given our average expect that we would be inundated with floods. but over the past two years we have had extraordinary flooding rains. Before our flooding not celebrated, but commemorated-as they to the day, in the first weeks of March, we of heartbreak, when we saw more than 50 per cent in order to survive financially. You can imagine on irrigated agriculture, once you have sold dairy farmer enterprise.

The cows stayed there literally for into action. We had some loss of life later on clean up. In one very tragic circumstance debris on his farm fences. But, in the far west of the electorate extraordinary. I want to reflect on the small River. That town was completely inundated, park was washed away and their shops were the distress in the town, given it is a very old, and it was like a phoenix risen from the ashes-or, celebrating a new bakery. It has had a huge bowling club and celebrating the beauty of the commend the spirit of that community, who course, the Loddon Shire has supported them all the way. Just 12 months ago we had the flood to the Goulburn and Murray valleys. These floods occurred 70 per cent of the entire shire area was devastated. dairy production in Australia, so you can imagine moving across the country but then settling places on what was highly productive land. Twelve months after this devastating flood 2013, 70 per cent of the repair of roads, bridges The March 2012 floodwaters destroyed, for on, that hospital has only just moved out of rains, which we have just commemoratedoccurred one year ago and two years ago almost had the worse drought on record, some seven years of our dairy farms forced to sell their water that in an area like ours, which is dependent your water you are no longer productive as a off our dairy farming are our jobs in food activities that make food manufacturing as a natural disaster. It was a slow insidious and emotional strength of our families. Then, on record in those same formerly drought swept across what we call our northern plains. south to the north pushing before it the fodder of over $2 billion in both private and public in tiny communities-the biggest often had only and not towns at all-pulled together, saved to recover by sharing farm equipment.

They now have other generations, about the amazing saves that that was built in Nathalia, behind hundreds the SES, the CFA, the Red Cross and other flood wall day after day, daring it to overtop. Murray electorate had its experience of the flood it was one year ago-all following that I want to talk about how we can help in for example, the flood loans that were offered. available from the federal government via the their very best. But, if you have already had your small businesses have had their equity eroded, when a government offer loans of up to $200,000 attractive, but unfortunately they are unavailable they have had their equity eroded too far. Yet, being viable dairy farms, orchards or small businesses. So I think we have to understand a bit more the federal government, that we are going people and farmers whose equity is going to given a break, will be quite substantial-given properties, the quality of their soils, the climate, skills and expertise. In my area there was only shire of Moira, the city of Greater Shepparton ago. For nearly 12 months this community, of more farm families in the surrounding area, had operating out of tents. I am not talking about only three hours drive from Melbourne. sick, its elderly and its children, using tents, million to rebuild their hospital, which was the chief executive of the hospital, Jacqui she has been so patient.

All of the or farms were flooded, bore the brunt of this stoic about this situation, who spent their time road to go to work helping their neighbourstrying to make safe animals that were I want to commend those communities, whose legends which I am sure will be passed on to occurred; the extraordinary metal flood barrier of thousands of sandbags; and the young children, community groups who manned and patrolled that As I said, tragically the western region of the two years before; in the east of the electorate seven years of the worse drought on record. the longer term, because we have a problem with, These natural disaster loans were made Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria, who did seven years of drought, obviously your farms and they have been going deeper into debt; so, at some 3.2 per cent interest, they are very to many of the people who wish to borrowwith a break, these properties could be back about the context in which loans are offered by to be looking at a community of smallbusiness be very low but whose capacity to fight back, the demand for food, the quality of their what remains of their infrastructure, and their $5.78 million lent to some 44 individuals in the and parts of Indigo.

It, of during the seven years of drought with food for their children to have even basic things excursions-and they could certainly not take support, which gave them the equivalent of subsidy, was an essential part of keeping economies of scale could be maintained, which place, with all of the employment consequences. Once we started to hear of a new regime proposing, you can imagine a lot of people proposed. I am not convinced that the new response the table is adequate to deal with the situation prospective climate change but at when a natural or flood, and you have a devastating situation infrastructure or even lives, you do need low-interest loan which you cannot apply for asking for this government to understand that Australia, with low-interest loans not necessarily longer term. Rather, we need to be looking at can better build our infrastructure-our Goulburn-Murray Water Authority's infrastructure manage these floods. In fact, we know that the led to the inundation of the Shepparton East channels seem to still be a problem in relation infrastructure and how it can be better managed when we are told the new legislation related another 420 gigalitres down the Murray and deliberate intention of further flooding.

It was encouraging to hear the Prime Minister employment from 42.4 per cent in 2006 to 44.7 to back this up, I think I can see small communities, in places like Port Lincoln, Port growth in Aboriginal families with mum or dad, driving better cars and getting their children instances, but I sense that progress is being made. Employment is simply one of the most important, because long-term productive employment is poor education, poor language skills and dysfunctional household. This is no truer population at large. Not having a stable and reasonable education does not mean an individual productive, fully integrated member of our society, many times. So while the apparent rise in employment far the majority of Indigenous jobs are in the Aboriginal industry. That sector should play equality in Australia until the workforce is perceived as black or white, prejudices are reinforced for the general advancement of Indigenous Australians of mainstream Australia, and to do so they workforce at similar levels to the mainstream and congratulate those in the resources sector Indigenous employment. Overall, I am more encouraged than discouraged regional centres. However, it is in the remote stagnant.

It is worth noting as this parliament is presented the APY lands are owned freehold by the communities. not traditional ownership and not pastoral leases freehold.

While I support Indigenous I send a strong word of caution to those who communities closer to the mainstream because largest and, despite the very best efforts and an $150 million and $250 million-it seems that to see progress.
