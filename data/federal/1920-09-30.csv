2,Mr TUDOR,HIGH COMMISSIONER,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has observed a paragraph in today'a issue of the Age, reporting that at a meeting held in SydneyMajor-General Sir Charles Rosenthal said that Australia must have population l>8foio she could develop or defend herself. If we doubled our population by bringing out able immigrants we would have our The High Commissioner in London was a nonentity in MB position. Mr Fisher had never taken any interest In Australia since he had been in England - . . . Major-General Rosenthal is mentioned as likely to be appointed Military Commandant for the State of New South Wales. Is it not possible for the Government to take action to prevent persons occupying high official positions from making assertions of the kind? My knowledge of Mr Fisher satisfies me that his standing in the community, and his reputation as a reliable man, are equal to those of any man in Australia.",19
3,Mr HUGHES,HIGH COMMISSIONER,"I have not seen the paragraph, and, therefore, cannot express an opinion in regard to it. I see it is stated that the speech to which the '.honourable member refers was made at a meeting held under the auspices of the Church Social Campaign. Most remarkable statements are made from time to time by different people, and if I took notice of one of them. I should have to take notice of all. I fear that I am not the man to carry on such a business. I am not my brother's keeper. This is a free country, where every one apparently is inclined to say just what he thinks. I haye noticed statements made by different people-includin g Mr Garden, for example-wit h which I do not agree. I agree with Major-General Rosenthal that we must have a larger population. As to the statement made by him concerning Mr Fisher, I can only say that I have had the honour of Mr Fisher's intimate acquaintance and friendship for many years, and am sure that he takes the very keenest interest in Australia. I certainly do not propose to stop people, merely because I do not agree with their views, from saying anything that occurs to them. If any statement calculated to create disorder is made, ho wever, I must take notice of it. I read in the newspapers that, the other evening, during my absence from the House, the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) made a statement in regard to subsidizing dances, or something of the sort. I have also read what Mrs Stein, the Acting Lady Mayoress of Melbourne, has said about dances, andputting two and two together I am bound to Bay that the remark made suitby the honourable member for Grampians war debt. was not a very proper one.",20
4,Mr TUDOR,HIGH COMMISSIONER,But the honourable member for Grampians did not reflect upon a public official. Mr Fisher is not here to defend himself.,20
5,Mr HUGHES,HIGH COMMISSIONER,"The honourable member for Grampians did not reflect upon a public official, but he suggested a course which, if followed by honourable member* of this House, would be most immoral. I do not go about embracing women. Mr MoWILLIAMS - Since reference has been made to the High Commissioner's office, may I ask the Prime Minister whether he is in a position to make a statement to the House as to the appointment of a successor to Mr Fisher as High Commissioner?",20
6,Mr HUGHES,HIGH COMMISSIONER,"Yes . I have a statement to make, and it is that at the proper time. I shall make a statement. NA EXCHANGES . IMPOBTB FBOM ITALY AND FBANCE.",20
7,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,"Has the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs been called to a paragraph in the press stating that large quantities of goods imported from Italy and France are in boud in Australia, and are likely to be returned to those countries owing to the dilatoriness of the Government in coming to a determination on the question of foreign exchanges in relation to the valuation of goods for Customs purposes?",20
8,Mr MASSYGREENE,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,Yes. The Government are awaiting an opportunity to introduce the necessary legislation. SELLING PRICE OF COAL. ' APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSION.,20
9,Mr WATKINS,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,"In reply to a question addressed to him yesterday by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton), the Prime Minister said that a Board had not yet been appointed to fix the selling price of coal in Sydney, having regard to the increase in hewing rates granted to coal miners. According to today's newspapers a Commission, consisting of Messrs. C. Hibble, H . Ling, and A. Jobson, has been appointed, and held a preliminary meeting in Sydney yesterday. I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he misunderstood the question put to him, and whether the Commission to which I have referred has been appointed for the purpose?",20
10,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,"Messrs . Hibhle, Jobson, and Ling are the members of the Commission. . Their functions are to determine what increase, if any, in the price of coal is justified by the increased wages paid to the miners. I do not know whether they have held a meeting, but their appointment has been approved, and they constitute the Commission which will settle the matter if official sanction be given - If this increase be premature, the honourable member may accept the assurance that it is premature only in so far that it anticipates the fact by, say, a few hours. The functions of the Commission are quite limited; they have to determine how much the increased wages justify an increase in the price of '-coal. .1I have no doubt that by the next miners' pay-day we shall be able to declare, at any rate, an interim price of coal. While on my feet, I might say that, in anticipation of the Commission's . decision, I have taken it on myself to accept Mr Hibble's recommendation that the prices for oversea coal shall be those he considered fair until the Commission has otherwise determined. course, the coal has to be sold on the ship, and when - the ship takes it away the transaction is completed, and cannot he undone. I think I have covered the whole ground.",21
11,Mr FENTON,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,"Will the decision of the Commission be final as to the price the people of Australia will pay for coal, or will this House have an opportunity to review it?",21
12,Mr HUGHES,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,"'The House can have an opportunity to review any decision, but the gentlemen engaged in this work are expert accountants, and their function is very simple. It is to determine how much the existing price of coal shall be added to as the result of the increased wages paid to miners. The House cannot, by any review, no matter how prolonged or meticulous, escape the fact that if more wages are paid for hewing coal the product must cost more. But the House can h'ave an opportunity to review the decision, and if the House says coal shall be free, I shall be perfectly satisfied, because I am a consumer. COMMONWEALTH BANK. ISALARI.ES OF CLERKS.",21
13,Dr MALONEY,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,"Has the attention of the Treasurer been called to the fact that a log has 'been declared on behalf of the Bank Clerks' Association of New South Wales? I wish to know whether any decision of the Arbitration or other Court, fixing the wages of bank clerks, will apply to the clerks employed in the Commonwealth Bank? i Sir JOSEPH COOK - I am quite una'hle to say what the effect will be in the Commonwealth Bank. I should imagine, however, that the clerks of that bank will be in, at least, as good a position as the clerks of any other bank. In any case, I do not control the Commonwealth Bank clerks; I have nothing whatever to do with them. MAIL CONTRACTORS: DROUGHT ALLOWANCE.",21

16,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,Can the Treasurer say whether he proposes to take steps to .accede to the request made on behalf of primary producers that their income tax assessments shall be averaged?,21
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CUSTOMS DUTIES AN D FOREIGN,"I shall, shortly, have something to say on that inatter, when speaking on the Income Tax Bill. CONSTITUTIO N CONVENTION . SUBJECTS FOR DISCUSSION-METHO D OF ELECTION.",21

In view of the conflicting decisions regarding the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the States, and in view of the present serious overlaps ping of their, respective powers and functions, will the matters to be discussed at the Convention include the delimitation of the overlapping powers of the Commonwealth and of the . States, and. thus deal with the diminished efficiency and unjustifiable expenditure which are alleged to be due to both the Commonwealth and the State Governments claiming and exercising conflicting authority in - matters of legislation, administration, and taxation, to the grave disadvantage of the citizens of Australia? 2.

Debate resumed from 2S£h September (vide page 5046), on motion by Sir JOSEPH COOKThat this Bill be now read a .second time.",23
27,Mr WEST,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"East Sydney) [2.50] When I was granted leave to continue my remarks on Tuesday evening there good one. seemed to bs a tendency on the part of the Government to rush through the House this taxation proposal. No more important matter than taxation can come before the Legislature. Parliament may be likened to a dentist ahout. to draw the them at all. people's financial teeth, but no person would engage an ordinary dentist unless he was a man who thoroughly understood his profession. Yet there are members in this Chamber who give no thought the question of taxation, and are ignorant of the principles upon which the raising of revenue from the people is based. late honourable member for Hume (Mr . SAW - MILL S. Falkiner) first brought before this House the suggestion that farmers should pay taxation on their average income over a period of three years. If honourable members will analyze that proposal they will find that there is really nothing in it . I do not think the farmers are anxious to evade their just share of the burden of taxation. I shall show the fallacy of the averaging proposal by an illustration. - Suppose that a farmer had prosperous 1 (for Mr seasons in the years 1917 and 1918, and that his income in those years was £500 and £400 respectively. In the third year he might he affected by drought, and he would have no taxable income. Under the present system the farmer would pay taxation on au income of £500 in 1917, on an income of £400 in 191S, and nothing at all in 1919. The proposal that has been made on behalf of the farmer is that the income of the three years shall be averaged, and that he should pay on an income of £300 per annum. The total taxable income for the three years is the same under both systems. It must be PAPER. borne in mind that nobody pays income tax until he has earned an income. In of H. that regard the farmer is in a vastly E. A. better position than is the city business of Trade man or manufacturer, who has to pay Customs and Excise duty on his raw material before he can get the goods with which to earn an income. The farmer's trouble is that he is often called upon to pay in a bad year taxation on the income he earned in the preceding two prosperous years, and in that respect is no different to other taxpayers.",23
28,Mr GIBSON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Ver y often the farmer experiences two bad seasons, and then one",23
29,Mr WEST,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"H is trouble is that in the bad year he has to pay the tax on his income for the good year. The farmers are being deluged by the averaging proposal, which will not be of any benefit to Anybody who is attending to the interests of the farmer will admit that the exemption affects him as much as anybody else. The citizens today are reto quired to pay a much larger amount in Customs and Excise duties than they did in 1911, when the amount of the present The general exemption was fixed. Tn some instances Customs and Excise duties havs increased from 40 to 50 .per cent. 11 is an old axiom that everybody should be taxed according to his means and ability to pay. If the averaging proposal is adopted, and the farmers do derive any benefit from it, the rest of the community will be required to make good the loss of revenue. In other countries the exemptions are higher than that allowed under the Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment' Act. I see no reason why that should be so. The people of Australia claim a higher standard of living than do the people of other parts of the world, and we should exempt from taxation the amount of income necessary to maintain that standard. All taxation is passed on to the working or industrial classes, but none so easily as Customs and Excise duties, which are an indirect impost that everybody must pay. The standard of living is fixed at the absolute minimum upon which a human being can exist. The exemption in nexion with income taxation was fixed at the low amount of £156 by a Labour Government which I had the honour to support in this House. But the Government did not realise at that time what was about to 'befall the world, although the war clouds were gathering on the horizon. The then Treasurer, in his wisdom, decided upon the lowest basis of exemption considered practicable under the conditions then existing. Honourable members are very familiar with the cost of living today, and with the tremendous increase since prior to the war. The proposal which I ask the Treasurer to accept is based upon the series of exemptions recommended by the British Commission dealing with this subject, and my figures are exactly the same as those adopted in Great Britain. They are virtually the same also as the exemptions existing in Canada and South Africa. In fact, in almost every civilized country today the taxation exemptions have been raised in keeping with the enormous increase in the cost of living. I am quite sure that the large majority of thinking people will endorse my request. Even those fortunate folk who are receiving more than an average income will agree that the industrial section of the community is having a particularly hard time, and that there Mr fVest. should be a considerable increase in income tax exemption in order that they may be permitted to retain sufficient of their inadequate wages to maintain life in these difficult days. If the Government continue to extract a large sum from eaoh working man in the community the injury will not fall upon the individual and his family alone, but will he felt throughout Australia. The matter of exchange has been referred to. There is only one practical way in which this factor in keeping up costs can be dealt with, and that is 'to drastically cut down the importation of unnecessary commodities. Despite the fact that the people generally are poorer than ever today, there is a vast amount of extravagance, particularly, of course, among those who are making huge business profits, and have plenty of money to spend. Why should a man want a velvet collar on his overcoat nowadays? If people were satisfied with good, plain con- materials, and were to "" cut out"" the purchase of luxuries, the time would be much nearer when Australians would find themselves hack again in that happier state which existed before the war. I ask the Treasurer to accept the following scale of exemptions-which , I again remind him, are not my own figures, but are those which were accepted in Great 'Britain, upon the recommendation of the Commission:For bachelors, £150 exemption. For married persons without children, £200 exemption. For married persons with three or more children, £350 exemption. These proposed exemptions are based upon equity, and represent an honest endeavour to make the burden of taxation bearable.  [3.10] - There will be widespread dissatisfaction at the Government's failure to increase the income tax exemption beyond £156, and also the deduction of £26 for. each child. Personally, I think the exemption should he as high as £300, but, at any rate, I hope that before the Bill passes the Government will see their way clear to meet the very widely expressed feeling among the community that the existing exemption is altogether too low. In my opinion, the amount should be nearly double what it was five years ago, because, since the income tax was first imposed, with an exemption of £156, the cost of living has gone up by leaps and bounds; and since the Government have not done anything in the direction of fulfilling their vague election promises to reduce the cost of living, which so seriously affects the great mass of the people who are living today on the bread-and-butter line, the least they can do is to increase the income tax exemption. ""When I was speaking recently on the Public Service Arbitration Bill, I mentioned that about 14,000 public servants in this country were compelled to accept a wage below what is really the basic wage in relation to the present cost of living; and I venture to say that, outside the Public Service, the numberd are still more startling. In fact, it is quite safe to say that at sent a bare living allowance is not less than £220 per annum. Yet the income tax exemption is still maintained at what it was five years ago. Some time ago, this House unanimously agreed to a motion submitted by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) that, for income taxation purposes, the incomes of primary producers should be based upon an average of five years' earnings. I could imagine no one cavilling at sueh a proposal, and I am sure nothing has transpired since that motion was agreed to unanimously which would cause any honourable member to change his views upon the matter. But it is surprising to find that in this Bill the Government have made no provision whatever to meet the expressed will of the House in this regard. When the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) was announcing the appointment of the Taxation Commission, and the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Byan) interjected, "" That is a sop to prevent further action by the primary producers,"" implying that it was a means the Goveniment had adopted to get out of their difficulty in regard to giving effect to the unanimous wish of the House as expressed on the motion moved by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay), the right honourable gentleman replied, "" The honourable member always suggests something sinister in connection with any proposal by the Government."" He threw cold water on the suggestion of the honourable mem- . ber for West Sydney that there was a motive behind the appointment of this Commission, or that it was really a move on the part of the Government to shirk their responsibility in regard to the matter of assessing primary producers' incomes on five years' earnings. The impression he conveyed, to my mind, was that-this question of assessing primary producers' incomes-was not to be intrusted to this Commission, but was to be treated as a separate matter altogether. However, seeing that there is no provision in the Bill to give effect to the wish of the House in this direction, one is led to conclude that the honourable member for West Sydney had ample reason for suggesting that the real object of the Government in appointing the Commission was to avoid prethe difficulty created by the unanimous decision of the House.",23
30,Mr MACKAY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Does the honourable member believe that this Bill affords .x suitable opportunity for dealing with that matter?  We ought to take the first opportunity afforded us to carry out the unanimous wish of the House. I do not think that the honourable member for Lilley is of the opinion that it is a matter that ought to be thrown uoon the shoulders of the Royal Commission. I could quite understand that matters upon which honourable members were not in agreement, or upon which the House required some light or leading, should be intrusted to the Royal Commission for investigation; but this was something upon which our minds had been already made up, and upon which no difference of opinion existed among us; and this Bill affords us the very best opportunity for carrying it into effect. Since the debate took place here upon the honourable member's motion, I have received numerous letters from primary producers in my electorate and elsewhere, expressing the desire that Parliament should take the earliest opportunity of giving effect to the decision of the House. A farmer in New South Wales-which , owing to two years of most disastrous drought, is in a different position from that of the other States-ha s written to me stating that for the twelve months ending June, 1918, he made a profit of - £2,000, whereas for the twelve montlis ending June, 1919, he went to the bad to the extent of £1,500-, and for the twelve months ended June last showed a further loss of £1,000. Thus, during, the two drought years, instead of making a profit out of his operations, he suffered an actual loss of £2,500. He points out rightly, but quite unnecessarily, since we are all aware of the position, that if the coming season isa good one, as he expects it to bej no allowance will be made in assessing his income tax in respect of the twelve months ending June, 1921, for the losses suffered by him during the disastrous yearsof drought.",25
31,Mr JOWETT,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,It is grossly unjust.  no doubt as to that. This farmer is carrying on operations in a small way,26
32,Mr JOWETT,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Hi s position is practically that of the primary producers all over Australia.  plaint applies more particularly to New South Wales, where the farmers have had to contend for two years with a most disastrous drought. Another primary producer in New South Wales writes to meMy position is this: I am assessed on income for 1919-20, £1,113. Tax payable, £54 14s. lid. This year I have to borrow £500, and I even have to borrow what is necessary to pay this tax-the amount of £54 14s. l i d . The system is so inequitable and unjust that we should avail ourselves of the opportunity which now presents itself to remedy it . Sir, JOSEPH COOK - There is an opportunity existing under the law as it stands for that man to obtain relief if he likes to apply for it - He can have his case reviewed - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I do not like this",26
33,Mr GIBSON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Unde r section 64 of the Act.  who make such applications are put to a very great deal of inconvenience and trouble, and in the end do not obtain much satisfaction. Our object should be to make the law so clear and straightforward that the people will know exactly where they stand. A debate which took place in this House a few weeks ago revealed - the fact that honourable members were .practically unanimously in favour of so amending the Income' Tax Act as to provide that in the case of primary producers assessments should be based, on a, five years' average. We have an opportunity to amend the law in that direc- tion today. We should insert such, a provision in this Bill.",26
34,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Not in this Bill.  objection can there be to such a clause? Sir JOSEPH COOK. - I can give the honourable member quite a number of reasons.,26

When the right honourable gentleman was announcing the appointment of theTaxation Commission, the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) interjected that that would be a means of giving effect to the proposal for a five years' average basis in the ease of .primary .producers, and was told, in reply, that he had some sinister object in view.",26
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"This is tedious repetition.

40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"That "" quibble"" happens to be .the simple truth.

With that decision I am entirely in accord. Various statements have been made during this debate to the effect that we have - all ""the information necessary to .enable us to 'place our - income-tax .laws 'in order; that there is 'no need to hesitate, but that we can go ahead now and so recast our income-tax legislation that it will operate justly and equitably. I entirely differ from that view. I would remind honourable members that this is probably the most difficult question that we have to consider, and involves more detailed and technical knowledge than the majority of subjects with which we have to deal. I have a good deal to do with income assessments in both Australia and Great Britain, and in respect of certain types of assessments I rather imagine I can pose as an expert. ""When I go outside my own line, however, I am as helpless as a child in considering how the assessments should be dealt with, and the basis upon which the returns should be made. That being so, .1 most certainly consider that we can only hope to have the whole of our income-tax' legislation placed on a just and equitable basis as the result of careful inquiry by the Taxation Commission. The Commission, having regard to its personnel, has an intimate knowledge of these matters, and can .gain any further knowledge it requires by the examination of witnesses. In this way we shall be able to secure a decision that will result in the burden of taxation that has to be carried being placed equitably on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. We have had several references to the uselessness of Royal Commissions, but I am inclined to think we may have the same experience as in Great Britain. The British Income Tax Commission has issued its report, and any one who has read it must agree that it is truly a mine of information. Its recommendations are based on sane and sound principles, and, a'bove all, they are directed to placing the burden upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it.",27
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,It is a monumental report.,28
46,Mr BRUCE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in introducing the Budget in Great Britain, gave a special meed of praise to the work done by the Chairman and the Commission is a good augury for the results we may hope to obtain from a similar inquiry in Australia. In Great Britain the problem is a very difficult one; but here, strange as it may appear, it is almost more difficult. Here questions have to be considered in view of Great Britain's decision regarding double taxation and similar matters. I defy any one who has not considerable knowledge of these questions to express an opinion as to what is a fair and equitable arrangement to come to. As to double income tax, .we have a certain obligation; and I would like to ask the Treasurer whether the question has been considered, and whether we propose to take our share of the burden, the major portion of which has already been shouldered by Great Britain. Great Britain has undertaken to have the burden of taxation, provided that elsewhere within the Empire a higher rate is being paid, or a rate which brings the amount paid by the taxpayer up to the maximum amount. But Great Britain will not go further than give relief to the extent of half the tax. The Chancellor has stated that Great Britain will do this; and the report of the Royal Comniission recommends that the double income taxpayer shall be placed on equitable terms with the maximum payer in any part of the Empire, and that any further burden shall be borne by the Dominion concerned. But he made it clear that whether the Dominions are prepared to take any share of the burden or not, Great Britain is prepared to take her share.",28
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,I thought you were going to say the Chancellor had made the whole thing very clear.,28
48,Mr BRUCE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,It is a very difficult subject.,28
49,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,It is as complex as can be.,28
50,Mr BRUCE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"It is a complex subject, but T ask the Treasurer whether he has considered this point, and whether anything is going to be done. A simple example may, perhaps, make the matter clear. The rate of income tax in Great Britain is Ga. in the £3 for a company trading in Australia as a British registered company, though the profits are all earned in Australia; and it also pays income tax in Australia. The British authorities gay that if such a company is paying an amount equal to 6s., they will relieve it to the extent of 3s., or one-half of the tax; and in Great Britain it will pay 3s. instead of 6s., provided it pays at least 3a. in Australia. But it might be that the company is paying here not 3s., but 3s. 6d. Great Britain , however, will only relieve the company to the extent of 3s., so the company will pay 6s. 6d -3s . in Great Britain , and 3s. 6d. in Australia. Great Britain suggests that as she has relieved the taxpayer of 3s., Australia shall relieve him of the 6d., and thus bring him into line; and, personally, I think that is a very equitable suggestion.",28
51,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"If the corollary goes with it ; that is to say, that we collect tax on incomes derived outside, in the same way as Great Britain does.",29
52,Mr BRUCE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I do not think that point arises at the moment. All they are attempting to do now is to see that, within the Empire, the taxpayer does not pay any more than I have indicated. Now, take the case of a British registered oompany, which does the whole of its trade in Australia. Supposing Australia gives relief to the extent of 6d., such a company will pay 6s. in the £ 1 inside the Empire, while the Australian registered company would be paying only 3s. 6d. in Commonwealth and State taxation. The position is that the British registered company, with all this relief, will still pay 6s., as against the smaller amiount paid by the Australian company.",29
53,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"But if the British company registered in Australia, instead Great Britain , it would pay the same as the Australian company.",29
54,Mr BRUCE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Companie s may regisinterested, ter in Australia, with the result that are called u,pon to pay only one tax ; that, indeed, is what companies are being driven more and more to do. So far as Australia is concerned, that appears, first sight, to be a great advantage, but, as a matter of fact, it is really a disadThat vantage. While a company remains regisdecided tered in Great Britain , it is simple enough, if it is a company of good standquestion ing, to raise capital for the development of Australian enterprises in Australia. But when a company registers in Ausportant tralia it cannot raise capital in Britain unless in very exceptional cases; it is practically impossible to do so. The result is that such a company is driven to our own local money market. It is deproportion, sirable, if we can, to create as many new enterprises as possible in - Australia. to that end we need a great deal money. It is taken pretty well as an axiom that in the future we must nuance our own Government expenditure, loan or otherwise; and with the demands for money for War Service Homes, repatriation generally, and in other directions, it will be very difficult to raise capital for commercial enterprises. It seems, therefore, a pitv to do anything by our income tax law which may have the effect of making it almost impossible to obtain money from outside sources for those ordinary trading ventures. The point raised by the Treasurer is, of course, a very material one.' He says we are in a different position from Great Britain , inasmuch as Great Britain taxes all incomes, wherever derived, whereas Australia taxes only incomes derived in Australia. The principle that Great Britain operates on is that we have the protection of the British nation and the British Meet-that the British nation is behind us in our foreign enterprises-and for this we ought to pay. In Australia we take a different view, and this shows the necessity for a Commission to consider every phase of income tax assessment.",29
55,Mr STEWART,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Roya l Commissions in the past have been the cause of much delay and of the shelving of projects, and, therefore, we are suspicious of them.",29
56,Mr BRUCE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"That may be; but we of have an exanr.ple in the British Royal rate Commission, which did invaluable work. This is a question .in which we are keenly and we are going to see to it they that the report of the proposed Commisand sion is in our hands within a reasonable time. If , as I anticipate, the report contains information that is valuable to at us, we shall be better equipped to deal with this complex and difficult subject. there are inumerable questions to be must be apparent to everybody. Reference has already been made to the of the collection of income tax at the source instead' of from the individual taxpayer. That is an extremely i m question; and it is very difnotilt Great to say which is the better system.",29
57,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Whil e there is a progressive tax, each income should pay its and not be taxed at the source.",29
58,Mr BRUCE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"That interjection shows and how great are the difficulties to be faced, of and how we must consider the whole position before we take any action. The honourable member says that, with a graduated income tax, the taxation should be obtained from the taxpayer, and not at - the source. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - And that is the interjection of a man who thinks that all the big men should pay more, and not less'. 3Ir. TUDOR - Hear , hear! You do me no injustice in saying that. Mr BRU'CE - There are several considerations which make it very doubtful whether this taxation should be obtained from the individual. I have'referred to a hardship suffered by British registered companies; but with that hardship they have some slight privileges,' one of which arises from the fact that we in Australia .do not collect income tax at the source. All companies in Australia pay only on the undivided profit. This means that a British registered company trading in Australia, with, perhaps, the whole of the - shareholders in Great Britain, pays 2s. 6d. income tax on its undivided profit, and on the balance, which possibly goes to people with large incomes, who should pay 3s. 6d. or 4s. 6d., or even higher, instead of 2s. 6d., we receive only Sd. by way of absentee tax. This ease seems to. show that there may be something in the - proposal to collect the taxation at the source; the only trouble is that such collection may be beyond our constitutional powers, the persons concerned being outside our jurisdiction. To-day in Great Britain, where the tax is collected at the source, super tax is collected from the individual. A man with an income of over £2,500 a year pays 6s. in the £1 collected at the source for any shares he holds in a company, and then he has to put in his own return, and, in addition, pay the balance due for super tax. The same thing should operate perfectly well here. Tf the whole basic amount were collected at the source, it would facilitate the collection to a certain extent, the balance being collected from the indivi- dual taxpayer. I do not want to be understood as advocating the collection df the income tax at the source; I am merely putting it that the question is arguable. For that reason, it is imperative that the matter should be very 'fully considered, ancl we should have the greatest possible volume of evidence before we plunge into what might prove to be hast;/ and, possibly, ill-conceived legislation. We should realise how complicated the subject is. There is, for instance, the question of the assessment of husbands and wives. Thai was attacked by many people in Great Britain, where a husband and a wife are assessed upon their joint income. If the joint income is £6,000-£4,00 0 for the husband and £2,000 for the wifethey each pay tax at the higher rates applying to £6,000 as if the two incomes were one. It has been argued that the joining of the two incomes is an infringement of the rights of the individual woman citizen by merely making her an appendage to her husband. On the other hand, it has been contended that the process is fair and just, because the basis of income taxation is the ability to pay, and if there is an income of £6,000 in the home enjoyed by two people living together they are well able to pay taxation at the higher rates. I have indicated some of the questions that must be considered very carefully by the Commission. I ask the Treasurer whether he will give attention to the matter of the relief which has - been suggested by the Commission in the case of double income - payments. If that is his intention, I appeal to him to do it within the next few years. My request may sound humorous, but it is not so; it is based on hard facts. The war profits taxation legislation in Great Britain and Australia contemplated an arrangement between the two Governments whereby whichever tax, British or Australian, was the higher should be collected and then apportioned between the two Governments. That was to have been brought into force by an Imperial Order in Council, and by whatever is the corresponding procedure in Australia. So far as I have been able to ascertain, nothing of the sort has been done, although the arrangement is three years old. The inevitable result of the delay will be a heavy and serious loss in revenue to Australia. It - is well within the knowledge of honourable members that .the Commonwealth was very late in imposing taxation on war-time profits, nnd that when the -.first collection took place in respect of the excess profits made during the first year of the war Britain 'had already made three collections of the wartime profits tax. I know, for a fact, that the agreement between the two Governments has been drawn up, but, so far as I know, it has not yet been proclaimed. Mr Collins, the secretary to the Treasury, is now in London, and I suggest that the Government should instruct him to finalize this arrangement. I am"" of opinion that Australia will be the loser in the long run by the delay that has taken place, because Great B r it a in has collected the tax for a number of years, and it will be difficult to readjust the accounts and ascertain how much was collected from companies that trade-in Great B r it a in and Australia, in order that Australia may get her fairproportion. unfortunate taxpayer might be asked to pay to both Governments in full . I do not think anybody will suggest that such an iniquity should take place; and that does not appear to be the intention of the taxation authorities here, because in all cases they have asked companies, when making up their figures for Australia, to state the amount paid in war-time profits taxation in Great Britain . I point out, however, what would happen if such an iniquitous thing were done. B r it a in has collected a tax of SO per on all profits in excess of the pre-war standard. There is only 20 per cent, left for taxation. If Australia, so late in the day, is to come in and collect 75 per cent, of the 20 per cent., it will mean that the taxpayer will pay in taxation 95 per cent, of his excess profits to one Government or the other. But whilst the Treasurer might, with utter disregard to the unfortunate taxpayers, be prepared to commit that iniquity, I think he will not do it when he realizes that he must lose his fair share of the taxation collected by Great Britain , which has been taking SO per cent, of excess profits for years, aud there remains only 20 per cent, on which Australia can possibly levy its tax of 75 per cent. The only reason why I speak on this measure at all is to emphasize the extreme complexity of the taxation problem. I think I have probably had as much experience as have had most honourable members on questions relating to income tax, but I am not prepared to make a serious attempt to put income taxation on a proper and equitable basis until I have had the opportunity of considering the evidence to be obtained, and the report to be made by the Royal Commission. Meanwhile, revenue must be obtained, and as we are not in a position to deal with the whole question of taxation as it should be dealt with , I am prepared to support the. Bill as merely a stopgap arrangement.",29
59,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Hunter ) [8.56] Thousands of people throughout Australia will be disappointed by the failure of the Government to increase the amount of the general exemption. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) has argued that in view of the fact that a Royal Commission has been appointed to The inquire into taxation matters, this Bill should be supported as a stopgap measure. He pointed out that there are many complex questions involved which make it necessary that a thorough in quiry should be made into the whole subject. Whilst that is true, there are certain facts whioh stand out so clearly that no Commission is required to report upon them. I refer particularly to the amount of income on which the Government can commence to impose taxation. I remember that when Parliament passed Great the measure in 1914 for the purpose of cent, raising revenue to defray portion of the cost of the war, the basis of exemption was the income necessary for a person to live and maintain a family in reasonable comfort. ' Parliament fixed the amount at £ 1 5 6 , although even then T thought it was too small - But whatever justification may have existed for fixing the amount of exemption at £15 6 in 1914, has disappeared. The cost of living has increased considerably; including clothing, food, and other necessaries, it has probably doubled. That being so, and if Parliament accepts the principle of not taxing the minimum living income, we should at least double the exemption. An incomeof £300 is little enough on which to maintain a home under present conditions. Unfortunately, during the. war, when the cost of living was increasing, the Act was amended in order to further tax the poorer people. Parliament provided that the exemption of a single man should be only £ 1 0 0 , and that for every £ 4 earned by him in excess of the £ 1 0 0 , £ 1 should be deducted from his exemption. Thus a man with an in come of £140 would be entitled to an exemption of only £90. In the case of the married man Parliament provided that for every £3 in excess of £156, £ 1 should be deducted from the exemption. Thus, a married man who earned £200 would have his exemption reduced by £14. Yet we have evidence on every hand of the increase in the living wage, due to the fact that the purchasing power of a sovereign today is no greater than that of half a sovereign when the income tax was first imposed. In view of these facts can we - shelter ourselves behind a Commission, and take no action pending the receipt of a report from that body? It is absolutely necessary that the Act should be amended immediately in order to increase the exemption. Almost every industrial organization throughout Australia has, by resolution, instructed its representatives in Parliament to take steps to have the exemption increased, but, in spite of that fact, the Government are doing nothing. Reference has been made to the Royal Commission whioh inquired iuto taxation matters in Great Britain, and the Treasurer remarked by interjection that the voluminous report of the Commission contained a vast amount of valuable information. Exemptions in the Old Country are generally below those in Australia, but the Imperial Commission recommended that the exemption for a bachelor should be £150, or £50 more"" than we allow in Australia; for a married couple with no children £250; and for a married couple with three children £350.",31
60,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Mak e it £600.,32
61,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"A few moments ago the Treasurer was commending the Imperial Commission's report; hut when I quote one of its recommendations, he ridicules it. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - I remind the honourable member that the British workman pays 30s. per head more in Customs taxation than does the Australian workman.",32
62,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The Treasurer is trying to raise a side issue. I am very concerned as to what OUT people will be paying in the way of indirect taxation in the near future, because we do not yet know the effect of the new Tariff. We do know, however, that the poor people will have to pay very much more than they do today.",32
63,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,I thought protecphasize tive duties cheapened goods.,32
64,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The right honourable gentleman knows from his Customs receipts what the effect of the new Tariff has been. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member is an old Protectionist, and he used to argue that protective duties would mean reduced prices.",32
65,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,I am an old Protectionist; but I am pointing out that the indirect taxation on the poor people will increase until we get our own industries established.,32
66,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,I suggest that our indirect taxation is not nearly as heavy as that which the British people pay.,32
67,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,The facts I have quoted speak for themselves. Nothing the Treasurer has said controverts them. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - I am merely setting against them another set of facts.,32
68,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The Imperial Commission reportedThe reasons which have been given to ns Ior raising the exemption limit are(a) That the cost of living has greatly increased since the present limit was fixed; The same argument applies to Australia, where the cost of living has doubled since the exemption limit was fixed(6) that there should be no taxation on an income so small that it is only sufficient to satisfy ordinary human needs; That is the argument I have just adduced - 1 (c) that existing indirect taxation lays upon the person with a small income the full share of the State burden which he ought to be called upon to bear.",32
69,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Hear , hear! That is the point I have just been citing.",32
70,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I am pointing out to the House that the very thing which that Commission condemns is being practised in Australia, and for that the Treasurer is responsible through his Budget proposals. This is a matter of vital importance. It is not fair to increase the amount of a person's taxation when there is every reason why it should be reduced. Pnt it is now intended to impose 5 per cent, upon income assessments. I emthat this new imposition, in a period of stress, when everybody is hoping for a decrease in the amount of in come tax, will prove a shock to the community. I have realized all along, of course, that the war was bound to create a huge burden for us to carry, and that enormous sums would have to be specially raised and ear-marked to meet our liabilities arising from it - It was inevitable that fresh taxation s'hould be i m posed to permit of the payment of in terest on borrowed money, and to provide a sinking fund to wipe out the debt in a reasonable number of years. stress the point that the money should be derived from those in the community who are best able to pay. The Treasurer once told honourable members that the difference between the number of those who received £ 1 56 per annum and those who earned £20 0 per annum amounted to only about 4 per cent. If the exemption were to be made £25 0 the percentage of difference would not represent more than about 8 or 9 per cent. sary money could still be secured if the Government would agree to raise the exemption.",32
71,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Y o u agreed to take away money from the Treasury when the tax upon picture shows was reduced the other day.,33
72,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Howeve r that may be, the amount required could be collected by increasing the rate of taxation in respect of persons with incomes above the proposed exemption.",33
73,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Hear , hear ! it on to the other fellow.",33
74,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The Treasurer is sticking it on to people who should not be asked to pay. We borrowed a huge sum of money to pay our soldiers for their services. Our men have returned, and the majority of them today are earning salaries ranging around £200 per annum; many of them, too, are supporting families. We say to those men, "" You went away to fight for us, and we were compelled to borrow money to pay you for your services Now that you are back home we are going to ask you to pay us something out of your wages so that we may repay what we borrowed on your behalf."" That is not fair . We should not ask such a thing. Most of the Labour organizations throughout the country have carried resolutions urging that the exemption in connection with income taxation should be raised to an amount varying between £25 0 and £300. I think , ' personallyand am only consistent in expressing the view-that the exemption should not be less than £300. I have never, even prior to the war, favoured the exemption being fixed below £200. And , remembering the high cost of living today, I would still be no more than consistent if I were to advocate that the exemption should be nearer £400. We cannot lose sight of the fact that, generally speaking, there But I are very many people in the community who made huge fortunes during the war, and who now 'have larger incomes than they dreamed of prior to 1914. There is no reason why they should not be made to pay taxes on such a basis as will very materially assist the Government to discharge their liabilities arising from the war. As for the formula, its alteration may be a matter for consideration by the ComThe necesmission; but I strongly .urge that it should be simplified. There are very few people who understand the formula. Why should not the Government simplif y it? Why should they not say that, in connection with incomes between £300 and £500, taxpayers should be required to furnish a fixed sum in the £ 1 ; and similarly upon incomes above £500, and so on? Thus, everybody would know just how much he was required to pay. I have no complaint to make of the actual assessments issued by the Department. The officers do good work, and I have Stick not known them to be at f a u l t ; but because people do not understand the system, they believe that mistakes are made. Even explanations are very difficult to furnish which are convincing in the eyes of aggrieved parties. In New South Wales we have no such formula as in the case of the Commonwealth Department. The State authorities require a fixed amount in every £ 1 , and taxpayers know, or are in a position to know, just how much they should pay. - I have a complaint to make which chiefly concerns tenant farmers. There are large numbers of these folk scattered throughout .Australia, and I represent some who are established in my own district. A tenant farmer takes a far m , and pays so much per annum by way of rent. There is a house on the property, in which he resides; and he pays rent for that. Under the present method of assessment, the tenant farmer is charged in come tax on the capitalization of the house. I do not think it was ever so in tended by Parliament. Honourable members never realized that a man placed in such circumstances would be taxed for something which did not belong to him. i Sir JOSEPH COOK - Oh , yes; I remember the debate very well.",33
75,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I am not too certain about that. - Sir JOSEPH COOK - Any member who was in Parliament at that time must have been full y aware of the position. - Mr Charlton - I w i l structions which are sent out to fanners and graziers by the DepartmentIncome earned in .pastoral and agricultural industries, such as farming, dairying, vinegrowing, fruit-growing, or market gardening, should be returned in Part D of the form or' return. If you own the land and reside thereon, you should show 5 per cent, of the fair capital value of your residence iinder item 21. That is a fair proposition, and is what I had understood all along. The instructions proceedI f your land is leasehold, not in course of purchase from the Crown, you should not return ,5 per cent, of the value of the residence thereon. Is that not plain enough ? the instructions despatched from the Taxation Office to the man on the land, telling him that it is not necessary that he should include in his return the item of 5 per cent, as the equivalent of the capital value of his residence; that is, if he is holding his land on leasehold. But, if it is necessary for him to do so, then it is tantamount to double taxation. If I own a certain property, and lease it to some one else at a rental of £100 per annum, that amount, being part of my income, must be shown as such in my return; but if my tenant is also to 'De charged a capital value percentage, the practice amounts to double taxation.",34
76,Mr JAMES PAGE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,But a tenant pays for the leasehold; he does not pay for the house.,34
77,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I have read the instructions sent out from the Department, and there is no getting away from them.",34
78,Mr JAMES PAGE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Then , seeing that the Commissioner tells a tenant' that he is not required to show 5 per cent, of the capital value of His residence, if the tenant does show the amount, he is a. fool.",34
79,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"My complaint is that the Taxation Department makes these leaseholders show the amount. clearly. And-wha t ie more-if the taxpayers concerned have not done so in their returns for previous years they are called upon to furnish reasons why, and are compelled to pay up. I will now read honourable a letter, bearing upon this matter, from the Acting Deputy Commissioner in Sydney to a reputable citizen for whom I oan vouch, but whose name it is not l read the i nnecessary to give : Adverting to your letter of the 20th June, 1920, protesting against the addition to your income in the assessment issued in respect of the above-mentioned return, of £20 as representing 5 per cent, of the capital value of your residence, on the ground that you do not own any property, and pay rent for your farm, I have to invite your attention to section 20 (/) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which provides"" A deduction shall not in any case be made in respect of rent of any premises or part of premises not occupied for the purpose of producing income."" Would any - one say that a man who was paying rent for premises, in the case of his leasing a farm, was not occupying those premises for the purpose of proHere are ducing income? Such a person would be living in the house because.he was compelled to do so, it being part of the bargain into which he had entered when taking over the leasehold. Yet the authorities say that they will make this man pay income tax in respect of a house upon .which some one else is already paying taxation. Since I held the view that the Deputy Commissioner in Sydney was wrong, I personally submitted the matter to the Federal Commissioner in Melbourne, and received the following reply With reference to your letter and attached correspondence, the assessment as made is correct. The action taken is really not to include the £20 as income, but to disallow as a deduction that portion of the annual rent which was paid for the residence. Section 20 (/) quoted in the letter of the Deputy Commissioner to Mr. , clearly requires this to be done. Instead of allowing a net deduction of £80 for rent paid, the full amount of £100 paid is allowed, and £20 is included as income. The ultimate result is the same. The Act forbids deduction of rent paid for a private residence, but it permits a deduction of so much of the rent as is attributable to any part of a residence which is set apart and used for income 'producing business purposes. There is no double taxation in - this case any more tlian there is double taxation in the case of .money which the taxpayer pays to his tailor for clothes. The'tailor pays'tax on the money so paid, but the 'person paying it is not allowed to deduct the expenditure in his income tax assessment. In the present case the taxpayer is merely debarred from deducting the rent from his income, however derived, whether from wages, dividends, .business, or 'farming proiits, or other sources. There is uo relation .between my paying a bill 'to a tailor and this matter which I have taken up on behalf of a tenant farmer. If I pay my tailor hie bill .he must show the amount received as part of his general income when furnishing his annual r e turn ; and upon 'that ret u r n 'he is taxed. In the case of a leaseholding tenant-farmer, rent is paid to another party, and the latter individual shows it in his return .as part of his in come, upon which he is accordingly taxed. But the authorities then say to the tenant-farmer that 'he must pay tax upon the capitalized value of the residence for which he is paying rent. repeat that I do not think that was evercontemplated by Parliament, and that expression of opinion is supported by the very language of the instructions - sent out by the Taxation Department to guide farmers and graziers in furnishing their returns. I realise, of course, that it is the duty of 'the Department .to secure the largest amount legitimately .possible; but here, I think, there is - the straining of a point to get money to which the authorities are not properly entitled. At any rate, it is a palpable injustice, and is particularly hard on a type of primary - producer - who goes on improving and f u r ther improving a property year by year, and who, perhaps, at the end of his .period of leasehold, has to .get out without reaping the benefit of any of his i m provements.",34
80,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Will the honourable member furnish me with the particulars of the case which he has mentioned ?,35
81,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I will gladly do so, <and I hope the Treasurer will - reconsider 'the decision of ihe Department. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - My officers puzzled with this case; 'they say that it should not be - so at all.",35

84,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I reiterate that the - exemption should be raised ""to £300 at least; and"" I hope that, if the Government will not agree to the "".suggestion, honourable members will clearly bring home to the Treasurer their' unanimous desire for an amendment of the law in that direction. Mr - FENTON (Maribyrnong) [4.20] - . Honourable members have already advanced views with which I am in agreement, so that I need not say much upon the second reading of this Bill , but I urge the Treasurer to endeavour to make some arrangement in regard to t i e exemption. No doubt he will reply that every penny of the money proposed to' be raised is badly needed, and that in these times of emergency every one in the community : should be called upon to contribute. Mr . Knibbs informs us that there are 282j000 persons in Australia whose taxable in come is under £200, and that t i e income tax paid by ' f l e m amounts to £489,000. I These people pay about £ 1 15s. per head, or 4'i per cent, of the whole of the income tax collected by the - Commonwealth. No doubt the Treasurer will say that, although he is aware of t i e struggles of this section of the community to make ends meet owing to the l i g l cost of living, he cannot afford to relinquish the revenue he derives from them; but the majorit y of these people are not in the position if the rich - man, who can pass on any taxation he is - called upon to pay. They cannot pass it on. The taxation of this country is passed on by all taxpayers, except landholders and people on fixed salaries. Sir .JOSEPH GOOK - If we remit this £1 los., will not some one else l i g l e r up in t i e scale be obliged to )pay it , and pass it on, as t i e lonorable member will contend, w it l something .added to it? What relief, therefore, would be afforded to - the person whom t i e lonorable member wisles to - exempt ?",35
85,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"As a rule, t i e man whom I'wish to exempt las a fixed salary, are with 'no 'means of passing on the tax.",35
86,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"And he cannot ,pass it on "" ' with - something 'added to it . """,35
87,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Evidentl y the Treasurer means that if we relieve these 282,000 taxpayers from the obligation to pay income tax, the other man higher up the scale, who would be called upon to pay more, would still pass it on with an addition.",36
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"It is the honourable .member who says so, and I am inclined to think that he is not far wrong.",36
89,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,What the right honourable gentleman says only serves to indicate how iniquitous this form of taxation may be. Honourable members on all sides confess that the poorer section Community and those who work on the land cannot pass on any form of taxation unless some of the latter happen to be a position in which they can fix the price of their produce.,36
90,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,The honourable member is a great reformer. Can he suggest any scheme by which taxation may not be passed on?,36
91,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Not for the moment, the goods. but the time is coming when relief must be granted to the strugglers in the community by'preventing the steady increase from day to day in the prices of clothing, foodstuffs, boots, and all the requisites the maintenance of human beings in our midst, by which merchants and others pass on this form of taxation. Even under our Constitution as it stands tomerchants day, the Commonwealth Parliament pass could grant some measure of relief to poorer sections of the community.",36
92,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,But the honourable member cannot prevent taxation from being passed on.,36
93,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I maintain^ that can prevent a great many of the injustices that are now being imposed on the comfor munity. We cannot always fall back a faulty Constitution as an excuse for helping people in distress. Without commenting upon the composition of the Taxation Commission recently appointed, I wish to say that I expect very little lief from the result of its investigations. According to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce), it will follow the example of a similar body in Great Brimet tain, and go into all the pros and cons the incidence of taxation, and formulate a scheme for submission to this House which taxation will be more equitably distributed; but, in my opinion, taxation can never be equitably distributed by any Parliament or any Commission unless at the same time steps are taken to relieve people from being overcharged for the goods they need. That is the method by which the rich man avoids paying taxation. He merely laughs at any tax we may impose upon him. If he is called upon to pay a tax of £15,000 in one year he promptly adjusts the matter by increasing the price of his goods, making sure at the same time, as the Treasurer has hinted, that he has added a little of the more than may be actually required.",36
94,Mr BELL,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The honourable member is in evidently supposing that there is no competition in business, that everything is a monopoly, and that all prices are regulated as by a Price-fixing Commission.",36
95,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,The honourable member will admit that prices are fixed today. By whom? By the vendors of,36
96,Mr BELL,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Not in every case.,36
97,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"No ; I am not speaking of primary production in this confor nexion. The primary producer can only pass on the tax when he can fix the price of his products. In most instances he cannot do so. On the other hand, big frequently, if not always, combine to fix prices among themselves, and on this form of taxation to the perthe sons who buy their goods. I was disappointed by some of the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Bruce). I contend that we ought to be able to tax to the ful l the profits of any company registered in Britain which wemakes profits in Australia. The honourable member pointed out that it is easier a company with a registered office in on London to approach the British money not lenders for the purpose of raising funds by debentures or otherwise whenever it is necessary to do so than for a company registered in Australia to raise money in reBritain, and I am quite aware that we have obtained a fair amount of capital in that way, but the interest bill which is payable to British investors has to be by the Australian consumers, and it of is better that any interest payable on money invested in Australian enterprises by should be distributed among Australians.",36
98,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,It is handy to have a little capital coming in at the present time.,37
99,Mr FENTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"If the honourable member perused the commercial columns of the newspapers he would see that during the past few months quite a number of companies have been registered in Australia or have increased their capital, and the money involved amounts to millions, which' has all beeu raised in Australia. As a matter of fact, Australians are now becoming accustomed to finance themselves, not only in a public, but also in a private sense. It is better for all concerned. At any rate, it means that we are not paying so much interest to investors in other parts of the world, I hope that the Treasurer's brightest anticipations with regard to the labours of the Taxation Commission will be realized, and that it will submit to this House some .scientific scheme for the application of taxation which will overcome the possibility of the rich man passing it on to the poor man. The Treasurer has promised me privately that he will take steps to have a leaflet issued from the Taxation Department that will explain by a number of examples - how the income tax is imposed, thus enabling any taxpayer to compute ihe tax that may be levied upon a certain income. The system now employed would puzzle the wise6t and cleverest mathematicians in our community. I trust that in this Bill or in another measure the exemption will be increased. I hope that the Commission will bring down a report speedily, and that this Parliament may soon get to work to devise a more equitable system of taxation.",37
100,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Franklin) [4.31]. - I have no intention of dealing with general financial questions on this Bill . The Treasurer will need every penny he proposes to raise by this tax to meet the expenditure which he has proposed, and I regret that I was not here to try to pre'vent a certain tax being taken off which provided a fair amount of revenue. I wish I could look with the f a it h that some honourable members have on the appointment of the Taxation Commission. There are not many phases of income taxation which have not already been tried in Australia. The method of collecting the tax at the source has been tried under the Companies Act ; the system of collecting from the individual is to be found in our own Act , and there is hardly any State in which one or other of the methods referred to by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) has not been tried. I . candidly confess, therefore, that I am not looking forward with very much hope to the result of the labours of this Commission because the t ground they will cover has already been covered in one State or another. How- ever, there are some matters which this Parliament ought to face immediately. There are some features of our income tax which are manifestly unfair, and should not be allowed to continue a day longer. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has given notice of his intention to test the feeling of the House in regard to one of them.",37
101,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,I hope that he will not try to test it on this Bill . It would be unusual to do so. This is not an Assessment Bill .,37
102,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"This Bill incorporates the Income Tax Assessment Act , and it is proposed to ask for a ruling fro m the Chair as to whether the matter cannot be tested upon it . I venture to express the opinion that it may be. As to the fairness of the honourable member's proposal there can be no question. During the last two years many primary producers throughout Australia who have been absolutely ruined by the drought, have yet been called upon to pay income tax on stock which has died in several States. There are two features of the In come Tax Act which, so far. as the landowner is concerned, are so pronouncedly unjust that I hope we shall be able to deal with them, if not in connection with this Bill , at least during the present session. We ought to provide that primary producers shall be assessed in respect of their average income over a period of years, and we should eliminate entirely the provision which calls upon pastoralists to pay income tax upon the value of the natural increases in their stock. These natural increases do not represent income u n t i l they have been realized. When they have been sold and the owner has received payment for them, then that payment represents income on which he should be taxed. Under the law as it stands, stock-owners are compelled to include in their return and pay income upon the value of the natural increase in their stock. often, as a result o i drought, the whole of that increase is swept away. Tasmania has just passed through the worse year in its experience, and I am sure that the Treasurer is aware that .a very considerable part of New South Wales has also suffered for two years from a most disastrous drought. , mark - will apply to portions of Queensland. ""When a man is compelled to pay income tax on the value of the natural increase in his stock, and the whole of that increase is swept .away as the result of drought, he is doubly in jured. He not only.loses the .value of that increase, - but has to .pay income tax upon something on which he has never realized.",37
103,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"A f t e r all, there are men who do not Jose the natural increase - in their stock by reason of drought.",38
104,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"In that case, what happens? In the case of sheep the owner shears them, and pays income tax on the returns from his wool. If they are cattle he has to sell them, and pays income - tax .upon the returns so secured. Sir JOSEPH COOK,-He Jieed not necessarily sell them. He may keep them to build up his herds.",38
105,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Does the Treasurer think .that a man keeps cattle on his run for f u n ?,38
106,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,No .,38
107,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Does the surer think that a man keeps stock ou his run until they die? As a rule, he sells his stock from time to time, and the - that he does so 'he obtains a return - which he may 'fairly be called upou pay income tax. I hope the House will recognise tice of my contention-tha - members will iusist upon the adoption of .the average basis in respect of the of primary producers, and that stock-owners, like every other man in the community, shall be required tax only when they realise on their stock. A warehouseman is not called upon to pay income tax in respect of .goods passes through the - Customs House, and r puts into .his warehouse. It is not u n he sells those goods that he pays income tax upon .the income so derived. I that the Treasurer will agree to deal Very stock on the hoof exactly as he deals with stock in a 'Warehouse, so far as income tax is concerned.",38
108,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,There is no similarit y between them.,38
109,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The only dif ference between - them of which I can conThe same re- ceive is .that when a man gets ihis stock into a warehouse he is sure - of realizing upon it and obtaining ,a profit, whereas .a primury producer never knows when he will be able to realise upon his stock. The whole of it may be swept away by a drought. Why should we compel the farmer and grazier to .pay .income tax .on something which he may never realise upon-.?",38
110,Mr CORSER,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The honourable member vvill admit that on account of a drought a merchant may have bad debts, and very large ones.",38
111,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,But he does .not pay income tax upon them.,38
112,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,-He ipays income tax on his undistributed profits.,38
113,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,The Treasurer does not appear to realise that the average trader is careful to protect himself from bad debts. He will agree with me t h at such a man's bad debts are fairly well distributed amongst his good debts.,38
114,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"- I merely desired to suggest that a grazier's natural in crease in stock, if 'he realizes it and turns Trea- - it into capital, is anuch tihe same as the undistributed profits of a .warehouseman.",38
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The pastoralist moment who sells his natural increase in stock on should pay income tax upon income so to - derived, - but it is unjust to compel him 'to pay income tax on something - which is the jusnot income and may never 'reach the in t honourable come producing - stage. .

120,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I invite the Treasurer to consult the representative of any pastoral district in Australia as to whether or not I am overstating my case. That is a fair proposition. know that stock-owners are compelled to return as income the natural increases in their flocks. On that they pay income tax., although those increases, may be swept away by drought, and. not a. shilling may be realized in respect of them. That is not fair.",39
121,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Is that the end of it?,39
122,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"It is, so far as the stock-owner is concerned.",39

125,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"In the case of sheep the valuation is £ 1 per head in the State, and 10s. in the Federal, returns. If they were sold for more he would have to pay income tax on the difference. My point is that under the present system stock-owners are called upon to pay the tax in respect of stock which they may never sell.",39
126,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,And that the' honourable member would not compel a man who is able to dispose .of the natural increase in his flocks to pay income tax upon the money so obtained.,39
127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,He has to do so at the present time. The Treasurer does not understand the position.,39
128,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Perhaps bow to the honourable member's superior intelligence.,39
129,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I do not think the Treasurer has taken the trouble to ascertain the actual position. By introducing the system' of averaging the in come of farmers and pastoralists over a ;period of years, we should get r i d of at least a certain percentage of the gamble that now goes on,",39
130,Mr BELL,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Would not that also overcome the difficulty in regard to the taxation of the value of the natural in stock 1,39
131,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"It would, to some extent. There is one other point in respect of which the farmers have a right to claim consideration. At the present time we allow a deduction'of £ 1 per week for the maintenance of far m hands. That deduction was reasonable seven or eight We years ago",39
132,Mr GREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"A deduction of only 12s. 6d. a week per farm, hand was allowed until quite recently, when the amount was increased to £ 1 per week.",39
133,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,It is quite i mpossible to keep a man on £ 1 a week.,39
134,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"May I ask the honourable member what is the difference between lambs, for instance, and the apples which fal l off a tree?",39

137,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,And the position is exactly the same in the case of the stockowner who loses his lambs.,39
138,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Not at all. He is taxed on the natural increase, although he may never realise a penny therefrom. To return to the point I was making, when not. I the Treasurer interrupted me, I contend that it is quite impossible to maintain a . far m hand on £ 1 a week, and that the deduction should, therefore, be increased to at least 30s. per week. I know of no part of Australia where far m hands can be kept, as they are kept today, and as we are glad to see itheni kept, for a less amount. I have not dealt with the principles of income taxation nor with the question of the necessity for raising additional revenue; these matters can be discussed on increase the Budget. So far as I can see, the whole of the revenue expected from this taxation will be required, but I do ask that the manifest injustices I have pointed out shall be removed.",39
139,Mr RILEY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"South Sydney) [4.51] I urge on the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) the necessity for increasing the exemption. I do not know how this taxation affects farmers and cattle dealers, but I know how it affects the working people in receipt of small salaries. A working man, who earns £2 14s. per week, has to pay £1 in income tax each year; and I question very much whether it is worthwhile collecting such sums. I suppose that this man will have to pay more income tax under this Bill.",40
140,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,No .,40
141,Mr RILEY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I am sure that munity generally do not wish this Parliament to tax people who cannot afford the money; and I suggest £250 as emption.

There ought to be a re-adjustment in justice to the poorer rate of the tax. classes of the community.",40

Honourable mem5s. bers' opposite are now very keen about having proper representation, but when they had an opportunity to secure it they turned the suggestion down, and would have nothing to do with it. Then, apof parently, the question of the exemption had no interest for them; at any rate, no interest was shown in it by the Trades Hall. Even now, my honourable friends opposite ought to make an effort to place a representative taxpayer on this CommisSuch sion. If they will give me the name of Roughly, a man to represent them, I shall put on the Commission tomorrow. It is calamity that there is not such representabers tion. If there is any class in the munity which should be represented on Commission of this sort- a Commission inquire into the whole incidence of taxaplaced tion, as it affects their homes, their work and life, surely it is that class with minimum income.",40

Sir JOSEPH' COOK - I remind the honourable member that on the Royal Commission already there are_one or two men who will look after the interests of the wage-earners very well; but I would like, in addition, a direct representative of the working classes. It is not the fault of the Government that there is not such a representative now, and it is not too late.

If I remain where I am, I am a going to have the whole question of taxato tion revised as far as possible, and on a sound footing. I know that taxation is a very difficult problem-the the problem of the ages-and it is always complicated, I am afraid, by the temperament, psychology, and differences in the positions generally of the taxpayers. We always think a system is wrong if it happens to hurt us. We have to keep those facts in mind when discussing taxation. I do not propose to deal at any length with the points raised during the debate. I should, however, like to refer to the question of averaging this tax. May I suggest to my corner friends that, although they have made up their minds definitely, they have entered on a path which is thorny and full of trouble; the question is not half so simple as they appear to imagine.

208,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Several honourable members have intimated their desire to move amendments. The raising of the exemption has been advocated on all sides. I take it that there can be no objection to the insertion of a provision to the eifect that the exemption shall be raised. Figures supplied by the Treasurer, in the course of his Budget a speech, showed that the amount collected from people with small incomes is comparatively small. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) remarked, some months ago, that a tremendous amount of money was spent by at the public in the preparation of returns. It is not long since the Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation in this State resigned in order to open an office in this city as an expert taxation adviser. He obviously considered it would pay him better to launch out in private practice rather than remain in the Department to draw the comparatively high salary of Deputy Commissioner. In the Budget papers presented by the Treasurer, it was pointed out that of the sum of £10,800,000 collected last year about £9,000,000 was received from persons in possession of incomes of more than £1,000 per annum. It was shown that 44 per cent, of the grand total was paid, by people having incomes ranging from £1,000 to £10,000 per annum; 34.4 per cent, was received from those whose incomes ranged between £10,000 and £100,000; and 4.3 per cent, was received from persons or companies having incomes of more than £100,000 per annum. From these people and companies the Treasurer could secure his requirements by increasing the rate of taxation; and he could, at the same time, raise the exemption. In a pamphlet recently distributed by the Ministei for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), containing the annual report of the Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, there is an interesting statement having to do with companies. The following Teturn shows the total issues authorized by the Commonwealth Treasurer in respect of new and existing companies, from the 26th January, 191.6, Manufacture and J Existing Companies Production Trade and Finance . .

A few days ago I suggested by that, at the taking of the next census, cash-this another wealth census should also be the taken to enable a comparison to be made at the with 'the figures furnished some years to note ago. According to Mr Knibbs, Govermnent 2,191,945 persons filled in and returned £111,716,478, wealth census cards, and, out of this were number, the returns show that 1,285,190 public to persons, about 60 per cent, of those who to war filled in the cards, had practically no assets, while the other 40 per are cent, owned £1,188,137,013 out of £1,216,231,662, which was estimated to be the total wealth of Australia. That Au is to say, the other 40 per cent, own 97 per cent, of the total assets of Australia. The population of the CommonIncome Tax wealth is 5,247,019, therefore 906,775 persons, the difference between 2,191,945 and the 1,285,190, or 17 per cent, of the whole of the population, held 98 per cent, of the assets of Australia, and 83 per cent, not more than 2 per cent. The figures applying to assets apply equally to incomes. Out of 1,380,208 males in the Commonwealth 345,575, about 25 per cent., received £156 per .annum .aud upwards, and out of Sll,737 females only 35,9S3, about 5 per cent., received £156 per. annum and upwards. More than 50 per cent, of the income of Australia was being paid to 18 per cent, of the population. These are the persons who should be h it the hardest by taxation. How can any man keep a wife and bring up a family on £ 3 per week ? Can any honourable member contend that 10s. a week, representing the deduction of £ 2 6 per annum for each child, is sufficient to maintain a child at the present time ? The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) has told me that he is in favour of increasing the deduction for each child wholly dependent on the taxpayer.",45
209,Mr GREGORY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The trouble is that there is no opportunity of doing it on this Bill , but the Treasurer has promised, if possible, to bring down an Income Tax Assessment Bill in which the amendment can be made.",47
210,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"It may be out of order to attempt to amend this Bill for that purpose, but an effort will certainly be made to do so. We ought also to take into consideration the case of widowers, whose exemption is only £100. Many widowers have been penalized for not having furnished returns for several years past. Unfortunately, they have not noticed the fact that in their case the exemption is so limited. However, when we find from the figures furnished by the wealth census card that IS per cent, of the people who filled in returns enjoy more than half the income of Aiistralia, that 82 per cent, get less 'than 50 per cent, of the income of Australia, that only 13£ per cent, of the population own freehold estates, that 8 per cent, own 7 per cent, - of the value of the land of the Commonwealth, and that 2 per cent, own 75 per - cent, of it , we cannot remain silent simply because this .Bill may net present the the opportunity for us to move an amendment to increase the exemption. The Treasurer says that he has invited, representatives of the workers to take part in the Taxation Commission, I advise the workers to be represented on that Commission by one or more persons-, who may be able to put forward their views as to the amount of the exemption and as to the unequal distribution of wealth which justifies the demand that the persons with large incomes should be hi t harder. I do not agree with the principle that income should be taxed at its source. I do not know any of the shareholders of the Metropolitan Gas Company of Melbourne, and I merely cite the case of this company because I know that it is a big concern, whioh, presumably, has among its shareholders men who are at present paying income tax at the rate of Ss. 1-^d. in the £1.",47
211,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Unde r this Bill , they will be paving Ss. 6d. in the . £ l .",47
212,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"If the dividends of the Metropolitan Gas Company are taxed at the source, the tax will be spread equally over the large body of the shareholders of the company, the deduction fi'om the dividend of the wealthy shareholder being the same as that deducted from the dividend of the shareholder who may not have sufficient income to j u s t if y the payment of any income tax*. I contend that each taxpayer should pay income tax according to his own personal schedule. The honocable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton) has intimated that he intends to move an amendment to increase the exemption, and I shall vote for it, because I believe that we can attach to this Bill a proviso that the exemption shall not be less than any amount which the Committee decides upon. Under the graded scale of the tax, it is not likely that honourable members' salaries will be affected. We are all anxious to afford relief to a large body of the community, not only from the payment of the tax, but also from the necessity to furnish returns, when they are earning under, say, £250 a year. Even with such an exemption, the position of these people would not be as good as it was in 1915, when we decided that an exemption of £156 should be allowed. Clause agreed 'to. Clause 4(1) The rate of the income tax in respect of income from personal exertion shall be as set out in the First Schedule to this Act. . . . (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the last three sub-sections, the tax payable by any person who(a) is 'not married, has no dependants, and is not an absentee; and (6) has a gross income of not less than One hundred pounds, or, in the case of a person carrying on business in Australia, has an income from the business which . . '. amounts together with his income from all other sources in Australia to not than One hundred pounds; and (c) would, apart from this sub-section, not - be liable to pay an income tax of One pound or upwards, shall be One pound.",47
213,Mr CHARITON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Hunter) [5.51] - I move That after the word ""Act,"" sub-clause (1), the following words be inserted:-""provided that the exemption shall be not less than £250."" I submit this amendment believing that it must be apparent to every honourable member that the time has arrived wnen the exemption should be raised. present exemptions of £156 in the case of married men and of £100 in the case of single men are altogether too small, having regard to the fact that since 1914, when they were determined upon by the Parliament, the cost of living has practically doubled. ""We fixed these exemptions in 1914, believing that they would afford a fair living margin, and since the cost of living is double what it was at that time, we ought really to double the exemption. This matter has been dealt with in Great Britain, where Commissioners have reported that a 'bachelor should be allowed an exemption of £200; a married man, without children, £250; and a man with a wife and three children, £300. If those exemptions are considered reasonable in Great Britain, should we have a lower exemption here? Apart.from the finding of the British Commissioners, it must he obvious that the time has arrived when the exemptions should be raised. A single man cannot keep himself decently on £100 a year. I know young fellows who, in connection with the railway service, have had to leave their parents' homes, and some of whom have to pay 27s. 6d. for their board, in addition to paying for their washing. In other cases they pay 35s. per week for board alone. Then, again, a man has to pay about £11 for a tailored suit for which he paid only £ 5 prior to the war. Taking all these facts into consideration, it must be recognised that we shall do a serious injustice to the great working population of Australia if we do not raise the exemption. On the motion for the second reading of the Bill I gave reasons why the exemption should be inless creased, and I shall not delay the Committee by enlarging upon the subject. I hope the Treasurer will agree to this amendment. The Government cannot shelter themselves behind the plea that the Taxation Commission is going into the whole question, since that Commission cannot possibly report in time to enable effect to be given to its recommendations in respect of income taxation for the current financial year.",48
214,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,What is the good of having a Taxation Commission if we are to ignore it?,48
215,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I do not suggest The anything of the kind. The returns in respect of income from personal exertion had to be furnished at the end of July last. The departmental officers will base their assessments on 'those returns, and will have to observe the provisions of this measure. We cannot hope to obtain from the Commission a report in time to enable the passing of the legislative machinery necessary to give effect to its recommendations, in respect of the current financial year. That being so, the Committee should amend the Bill in the direction proposed by me. I hope the Treasurer will accept my amendment..",48
216,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Would the honourable member be prepared to allow working men here to be taxed to the extent that they are taxed in Great Britain?,48
217,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Wheneve r an honourable member brings before the House a case possessing some merits-and this amendment has a lot of merit in it-the right honourable gentleman raises a side issue. He tries to side-track honourable members by bringing up an entirely different question.,48
218,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Not at all. The honourable member is dealing with the general question of capacity to pay the tax.,48
219,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The indirect taxation which the people are called upon to pay will probably be higher than it is. We do not know what it may be by the end of the financial year. We certainly know that it will be increased; and surely if the cost of administering this country is less than the cost of administering the affairs of-Great Britain , we should not burden our people by imposing taxation to the same extent as in the Old Country. We do not want to impose unnecessary taxation. We must deal with every question on its merits, and on its merits no one can say anything against the amendment. A single man cannot live on £100 a year, nor can a married man 'live on £15 6 a year.",49
220,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Who says that they must live on such a wage ?,49
221,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,They must pay their way on what they get unless they are dishonest.,49
222,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"But we are not requiring men to live on such a wage, and I hope that they are not being compelled to do so.",49
223,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"When the original Bill was before this Parliament, the idea was that we should fix an exemption representing a sum sufficient for the maintenance of a man and his family. That was in 1914, when it was thought that an exemption equal to £ 3 per week was a fair thing. Having adopted that basis, we should now increase the exemption in accordance with the increase in the cost of living.",49
224,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"If the cost of has increased 100 per cent., and if wages way. have increased to the same extent since 1914, is not a man as well able to pa, this tax as he was at that time ?",49
225,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"If , owing to the increase in the cost of living, it has been necessary to increase wages to the extent of 100 per cent., and those wages are still only sufficient to enable a man support his wife and family, then the exemption of £ 1 5 6 which was fixed in 1.914 should also be increased by 100 cent. On the right honourable man's own showing, therefore, the exemption should be raised to £ 3 1 ? There is no escape from that point, I hope that the Treasurer will accept my amendment. [214]",49
226,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,I do not thin k that the amendment is in order.,49
227,The CHAIRMAN,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN," During the course of the honourable member's speech, I was able to give this question some consideration. I have to refer honourable members to the ruling which I gave a little earlier in the proceedings. The honourable member proposes to insert in the clause words providing that the exemption shail be not less than £250. He seeks, in effect, not to amend the Bill before the Committee, but to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act, in which the exemption is fixed. It would not be in order to insert such an amendment in this Bill since it. dees not contain any provision which has been before the Committee of Wa)'s and Means in respect of the fixing of an exemption. Sections 18 and 19 of the Income Tax Assessment Act deil with the question of exemptions, and the proper course for the honourable member to pursue would be to endeavour to secure such an amendment in a Bill to amend the Income Tax Assessment Aot.

A man ought to be able to support himself before he is called upon to contribute to the support of other people; and an income of £100 a year ought to be exempt from income tax.

There is an innovation in the Bill, [214]- 2 to be found in the last clause. In previous Bills of the kind, the Treasurer has always asked for power to impose taxation for the preceding year in which the incomes are taxable. That was so in the income tax measure of .1914-15, but the Bill before us, according to the clause, applies not only to last year's assessment, but also to next year's assessment. If we have no power to deal with a provision of that kind, our work here is thrown or away. I do not think that when members realise the meaning of the clause to I refer, they will agree to it.

273,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I do, and I am ing to ameliorate it ; but for that I get no credit. I have indicated my proposal, which will achieve what the honourable member desires better than anything he can do. What is the use of wasting time?",52

275,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,It is not with in my power to give that opportunity.,52
276,Mr MAHONY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Will the Treasurer take steps to have the amount of exemption increased ?,52
277,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,I have taken steps already by asking the Royal Commission to report upon the. whole question.,52

The Commission may not report for twelve months, but the Bill with which we are now dealing fixes for the current financial We carried year the amount of tax to be collected and the amount of exemption to be allowed. Although the Commission has been appointed for a month it has not yet held one meeting. What is the use of this humbug and twaddle about the We can Commission dealing with the matter ? The responsibility of handling this question rests upon the Government, who, if they are sincere, will introduce an amend not ing Bill to grant relief to people who are suffering an injustice. Everybody will admit that the taxation of a man who has an income of only £100 is ridiculous. Men in the working-class district which I represent are asked to submit income returns, although they kuow nothing about the preparation of tliem. If they fail to make a return they are haled before the Court and fined. Yet some of them hardly earn enough money to keep uody and soul together.",52

280,Mr MAHONY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,I am willing to in troduce the Treasurer to a number of men in my electorate who would have a could great deal to say to him about the in adequacy of the present exemption.,52
281,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,They are not the down-trodden poverty serfs that the honourable member describes. They are men tryearning a very good wage.,52
282,Mr MAHONY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"M e n in my electorate who are earning £ 1 0 0 and £ 2 0 0 per annum are called upon to pay income tax, and they resent it .",52
283,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Of course ! Even the honourable member does not like paying taxation.,52
284,Mr MAHONY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I am always pleased to .pay my share. 'My only regret is that my income is not such as to require me to pay more. This question of exemp-. tion vitally affects the workers, and the Government should give it their consideration. The exemption was originally fixed when the cost of living was considerably lower than it is today, and when the purchasing power of money was much greater. Statistics prove that the purchasing power of money has decreased, by nearly 50 per cent, since 1914. To ask a man earning £200 per annum to pay income tax is as unjust as would have been a demand in 1914 that a sing e man earning £ 5 0 per annum and a married man earning £ 1 0 0 should pay taxation. Had such a proposal been made when the original Bill was before the House it would have been justly resented. Sitting suspended, from 6.30 to 8 p.m.",52
285,Mr MAHONY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I have no desire to prolong the discussion, but it must be apparent to every honourable member that there is a great deal of hardship throughout Australia on account of the low margin of the exemptions. Single men, and women too, who are in receipt of salaries of £100 per annum must find it almost impossible to live. It should be remembered, alsa, that even of that slender wage, a cons derable sum is disbursed in : ind rect taxation. And it is iniquitous that married men in receipt of £15 6 per annum have to part with portion of that inadequate ainouut by way of income taxation. A man who is trying to suppert himself and his wife and children on £156 must find himself degrees below the bread line. A judicial in quiry in New South ""Wales recently determined that £ 3 12s. 6d. shou.d be regarded as the basic wage. It was agreed that that was the lowest sum on which a man could maintain himself and family. Yet the Government are taxing family men whose incomes are actually less than the basic wage. Has the Government any intention of relieving the position ? I ask the Treasurer to introduce an amending Bill in that direction.",53
286,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,F o r every shilling pa d in income tax one pays £ 1 through : the Customs.,53
287,Mr MAHONY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"That is true, I dare say. When the present exemptions were fixed, in the early stages of the war, the value of money was far different from today. Comparing those times with these, the amounts of the exemptions should now be doubled. It is of no use for the Treasurer to say that the Royal Commission will inquire into this and all other l'ke matters, and that, upon its recommendations, the Government will probably act. We are dealing with taxation proposals for the current financial year, and the Commission may not present its report for six months or twelve months. Meanwhile, hard pressed people are be ng compelled to pay income tax : when they are in receipt, in some cases, of less than a living wage. I suggest that the Treasurer give instructions to his officials that the tax be not collected this year from those who are placed as i have just described, pending the receipt of the report of the Royal Commission. Such action would grant a welcome measure of relief.",53
288,Mr ATKINSON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Will m o t ) [S.T] The Treasurer has already stated that it is h..s intention to refer the whole system of taxation to the Royal Commissioq. I suggest that he call particular attention to the taxation of those who are in receipt of ouly £100 per annum. Incidentally, 1 doubt if it is worthwhile, collecting individual amounts of £ 1 from these persons. True, £ 1 may appear to some to be ouly a smail item, but it looms very large in the eyes of single men and women who are trying to live, in these times, on £ 1 0 0 a year. It is, relatively, a heavier tax upon them than is a tax of £ 5 or £6 upon a person in receipt of., double the amount of income. I do not want to vote against the clause, but I 1 would have supported an amendment to exempt people whose income is £ 1 0 0 . It is unfortunate that the proper opportu-. nity for proposing such an amendment, was not seized. In the circumstances, I . ask the Treasurer to recognise the strong and very apparent feeling of the Committee; and I trust that, when the report of the Commission shall have been presented,- we will learn that its views coincide with our own.",53
289,Dr MALONEY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Melbourne) [8.12] - _ - I endorse the remarks of the honourable' member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson). I "" make a special appeal to the Treasurer"" in the matter of deductions of charitable' gifts of £ 2 0 and over. There are many people who, in the course of a year, give far more than £ 2 0 to charitable institu- : tions, but who disburse their offerings in small amounts. The fact is that philanthropic gifts, spread, over small sums,' rather than provided in totals of £ 2 0 or more, often do the greater good. I ask the Treasurer to permit deductions of charitable gifts in respect of aggregates, which could be supported by statutory declaration, as well as in the matter of specific sums.",53

There are probably ten or a dozen different points involved generally, and to deal with auy one of them in"" a general measure would mean reopening the whole question of taxation. The plain fact is that I must raise money, and that any money which I may knock off in one direction must be provided for in another. That would involve revision of the whole of the rates of - taxation. As I have said more than once today, the entire system of taxation is to be revised.

It is clear - that I cannot bring down a Bill to provide for this matter of exemption alone, particularly after the wonderfully industrious way in which almost every section of the Committee to-night has endeavoured to get something else into the little proposal I am making. I am sympathetic with the suggestion that the exemption should be raised, and I am inclined to think that it should be done. It is a hardship to impose the minimum tax of £1 on people whose income is £100 a year. Therefore, I will have the whole matter inquired into with a view to seeing whether there is not some way out of the difficulty, and if I can nnd a - way I will honestly follow it , but I cannot promise to come down to the House with a Bill to relieve every little difficulty that arises, particua larly after my experience to-night.

I do uot propose, however, that the relief which will flow from this averaging system shall be confined to the primary producers. My in tention is that all income tax payers shall reap the benefit of it. Another point which I wish to make clear is that all we ask is that a man whose income, from the very nature of the occupation followed by him, is precarious, should not be callerl upon to pay a heavier tax than a man or woman whose income, is fixed. Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that a man follows a certain occupation from which in respect of a period of five years his net income is £5,000. That represents an average of £1,000 per annum. In justice to all, we ask that a man whose income, while precarious, is on the average £1,0.00 per annum, should pay no more by way of tax than a man whose income £250 per quarter and i.= paid regularly, as in many cases it is, into his banking account.

307,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Then why should we be tied up in this way in view of the fact that the Commission may be able, according to the Treasurer, to bring in recommendations in time to allow of their application to assessments in respect of the present year? We want to know exactly where we are. In order to assist the Treasurer to pass this measure we have given way to him to a considerable crrtcnt, because of his promise that he will do his very best to give effect to the wishes expressed by the Committee; but I point out that, under this clause, we are legislating in respect of incomes earned during the financial year 1920, and also the year 1921. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) hopes to secure the support of some of our party for his amendment. I am sorry to say that he has not made out a case that I can follow. His amendment income is altogether different from that moved is earlier in the proceedings, and which I would have, supported.",56

309,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"U n d e r the original amendment it was proposed that the income tax of primary producers should be based upon an average return covering a period of five year?. That I should have supported, because, in common with others, I know what the primary producers have suifered from drought, especially in my own State. I wish to ffive them a fair deal, and to that end it would be a proper thing to permit them to average their income; but, with a general provision to permit anybody and everybody to average their incomes over two vears, the Treasurer would be confronted with a considerable difficulty, because he would never know where he stood in regard to the revenue. If we provide that all taxpayers may average their incomes",56
310,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The increase in the tax wo^ld have to be made 10 per cent, instead of 5 per cent.",56

313,Mr JOWETT,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The amendment would not affect the revenue for the present financial .year by one penny, because it would not applv to this year.",57
314,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Exactly , because all the returns - are in : but it would affect the following year very considerably, because, in clause 9, we make provision for the assessment of next year's taxation in accordance with the present assessment. Then there is a proviso which gives the ontion to certain individuals-it may be all of us, or only a section-if it suits them, to average their incomes over two years. If that were' permissible, a man with a small income this year and a large income next year would take advantage of such a provision to his own benefit, while the man with a large income this year and a small one next year would not do so.",57
315,Mr JOWETT,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,There is no suggestion whatever in my amendment that the taxpayer himself shall have any option: it merely mean? that the Treasurer or Commissioner will not be precluded from adopting the averaging system when making the assessments twelve months hence.,57
316,Mr CHARLTON,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,The amendme.ni provides that nothing shall prevent the assessment being computed on the average of income for two years.,57
317,Mr JOWETT,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,That is computed by the Income Tax Commissioner.,57

We apply exactly of the Queensland coast. the same ratio of increases that we did when the tax was much lighter than i is now; and, as a result, we place a tively much heavier burden on the small incomes than on the higher. W it h such a great demand as there is now for revenue we should take more notice of the in equality of incomes, and derive a larger proportion from the higher, relieving those on the border line.

337,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Y a r r a ) [ 9 . 7 ] - I intend to move, later, to insert a new clause to prevent Asiatic or coloured labour engaging solely in the Australian coastal trade. Generally speaking, the rates of pay and conditions of employment on Australian owned vessels are about 100 per cent. better than those on vessels employing coloured labour. If Australian-owned ships engaged in the coastal trade are obliged to comply with certain conditions regarding wages, accommodation for crew and passengers, and hospital accommodation, we should give both the owners and the employees a reasonable amount of protection. As we are allowing a number of clauses to ,pass without discussion, i u order to facilitate business, 1 hope that the Minister will allow us every opportunity to discuss those other portions of the Bill which we consider vital, and also such amendments as we think necessary for the better working of the Act. Clause agreed to. Clauses 92 to 95 agreed to. Clause 96Section 286 of the principal Act is repealed and the following section . inserted in its stead :"" 28(i. (1) Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Minister, in regard to the coasting trade with any port or between any ports in the Commonwealth or in the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth(a) that no licensed ship is available for the service; or (b) that the service as carried out by a licensed ship or ships is inadequate to the needs of such port or ports, and the Minister is satisfied that it is able in the public interest that unlicensed' ships be allowed to engage in that trade, he may grant permits to unlicensed British ships to do so, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as he thinks fit lo impose. "" (2) The carriage, by the ship named in any such permit, of passengers or cargo to or from any port, or between any ports, specified in the permit shall not be deemed engaging in the coasting trade.

"" (5) The Minister shall, within fourteen days of the granting of any permit under this section, notify in the Gazette the issue of the permit, with particulars thereof.""",58
338,Mr GREGORY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Dampier) [9.10] This clause permits the Minister to grant permits for vessels to ply on the north-western and north-eastern coasts without complying with the coastal trading provisions of the Act. - Committee must recognise the .necessity' for such permits under the existing abnormal conditions. But for the - Singapore line of steamers the whole of the north-west coast and the hinterland would have been completely paralyzed aud its people ruined. Even at the present time the conditions are almost unbearable. I have received complaints from Port Hedland and other ports further north that the people had been for six weeks without a mail from Perth owing to the paucity of shipping on the coast. I think honourable members will agree with this clause giving the Minister power to grant permits for vessels owned outside of Australia to engage in this trade while existing conditions continue. When shipping is normal and the - Minister is satisfied that there is sufficient shipping on the coast to meet the requirements of the people, the permits can be withdrawn. But' if any steps were taken by the Government now to prevent the running of the Singapore boats on the north-western coast, the few people who are there would be ruined. If there is. one thing to which Parliament should direct its attention, it is the populating and developing of the northern parts of Australia. We shall be living in a fool's paradise so long as we allow that vast Territory to remain unpopulated, as at present. I move That paragraph {a) be left out. desirI t is undesirable that any Minister should assume that, because one licensed ship was available for the service, the granting of permits to other vessels was unnecessary. He should be able to grant a permit so long as he is satisfied that the licensed shipping is inadequate for the needs of the people. Later, I shall move a further amendment to sub-clause 4 so that twelve months' notice, instead of six months', must be given of the cancellation of any continuing permit. Shipping people have to make their arrangements well in advance-possibl y they may have to charter vessels for . a period and to give merely six months' notice of the cancellation of a permit would be absurd. If the Minister will agree to these amendments, I believe they will help to obtain shipping for services that mean very much - to the future development .of the outlying portions of the Commonwealth.",59
339,Mr BURCHELL,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Fremantle) [9.14]. . The - I support, generally, the remarks of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory). Again I am requested to do so by the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce, which points out that the licensing of ships to trade on sections of the coast that .are not provided for by Austheir tralia n-owned and controlled steamers of vital importance to the north-west tion of Australia. While the Minister is down in our legislation. empowered to grant monthly, ancl even up to six-monthly, permits, there is provision for the granting of continuing permits. I agree that continuing mits should cover a period of at least, twelve months. That would enable those directly' interested in the trade to necessary arrangements in the matter of cargo, passenger, and mail service and accommodation. I do not agree with the honourable member for Dampier (M : \ Gregory), however, that paragraphs '(and b are contradictory. I think his purpose 'would not be achieved if paragraph a were left out. On the northOrient west coast-apar t from those of the Steam-ship Service-tlier e are no vessels carrying on the trade except dicated, which are registered and controlled oversea. I ' repeat that the mantle Chamber of Commerce is very anxious that the period for which may be granted shall be twelve months.",59

The purport of that clause is embraced in our existing navigation laws. It was inserted, before the construction of the east-west railway, to provide that the and P. and 0 . liners which called State at Fremantle and brought passengers east, should not be deemed to be engaged the ships inin the coastal trade.",60
342,Mr GKEGOEY,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,We are not worrying Freabout the southern coast; but the difficulty is that Ave cannot make any dislicences tinction in the Act.,60
343,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"The men employed on coastal traders fear that if a licence is e given to an unlicensed ship, which does by uot comply with Australian conditions, either in the matter of accommodation or It wages, they will be treated unfairly .

The Sea Carriage Select Comhas dealt wibh this matter, and it has learned very definitely that there is disposition on the part of Australian ship-owners to cater for this trade.

At the same time, one two other points on our in mind, which it may be found the necessary, at different periods, deal with. It is difficult to - with certainty what conditions arise-from time to time with regard to the further parts of the Australian coastthus line. The honourable member for Dam pier (Mr Gregory) suggests the deletion done. of paragraph a. I have no objection to that, but it-was inserted with the express intention of strengthening the very tion which the honourable member desires to maintain. Where it can be shown to the satisfaction - of the Minister, that a posedservice, as carried out by a licensed ship, is inadequate to the needs of any port or ports in the Commonwealth, or in the Territories under the author'tv of Commonwealth, and that it is desirable the public interest that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in that trade, lie grant a permit to an unlicensed British ship to do so. He-can also take this action if no licensed ship is available for the service. If , for iustance, there is a new port, to which none of the licensed ships trading on that particular part of the coast cau be sent, the Minister will be in a position to meet the new condition thus arising. The proposed new section really affords a double-barrelled protection for the object which the honourable membsr aud the .Government have in view. If the Committee desire the elimination of the Minister's power to take this action when no licensed ship is available for the service, I bave no objection; but I am prepared to accept the other amendment which the honourable member has forecasted, and, if necessary, to proi n vide that a continuing permit may be cani3 celled upon "" not less than "" six months' notice.

If a Minister chose to close his eyes there is no possible way in which an inquiry can be brought about, and it should be possible for somebody to move the Court in defiance the of political considerations. N otwithstanding the fact that in the great majorit y of cases there are few departures from correct principles, it happens now aud again that a Minister has to be compelled to do his duty, if there is no power to compel a hearing, it is a serious defect in the law.",63
377,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.5] - The honourable member is really referring to clause 113, to which the Committee have agreed. Experience has shown that in no single case has any one but the responsible Minister moved the Court.",63
378,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,To have an ordinary marine inquiry? I am astounded.,63
379,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I cannot, of course, speak of my own knowledge, but that is the information supplied.",63
380,Mr TCPOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Supposin g that two vessels collided in the River Yarra, as has happened on more than one occasion, could only the Minister order an inquiry ?",63
381,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,That has been the in variable practice.,63
382,Mr HECTOR LAMOJTD,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Is it the custom to order an inquiry in every case?,63
383,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I believe that is so; it is done as a simple matter of routine. The Committee having agreed to clause 113, it follows that nothing is to be gained by retaining this section we propose to repeal.",63
384,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"If an aggrieved person has not the right to compel an inquiry by the Court, we can give hi m the right to compel an inquiry by the M in ister.",63
385,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"In actual administration, it is a matter of ordinary routine business, the Minister having nothing to gain by refusing an inquiry. I do not think that any of the dangers that honprable members have in their minds are very likely to arise.",63
386,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Y a r r a ) [ 1 0 . 7 ] a preliminary objection on clause 113, to what I conceive to be a weakness in the Bill. I ask the Minister whether he would have any objection to the recommittal of that clause after he has consulted his officers and others, if it is shown that I am correct in regarding the amendment as likely to prove a weakness. I have had no actual experience of Marine Boards, but I know that in Victoria it is the practice for the Marine Board, on its own initiative, to hold in quiries, and the same, no doubt, applies in every other State. At present I wish the matter left open, because it would be difficult, in the case of anything happening in Western Australia or Queensland, for those concerned to come to Melbourne to get the authority of the Minister to hold an inquiry.",64
387,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"In such a case as that, I imagine there would be the ordinary delegation of authority. If a Minister had to perform all the duties thrown on him by the Acts he administers, he would never get to bed.",64
388,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"That , in effect, would amount to what is permitted by the original Act, and it would, be better to permit the section to remain.",64
389,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"I shall make further inquiry, and if I find that tnere is any good reason to recommit the clause, I shall do so. Clause agreed to. Clause 115 agreed to. Clause 116 (Amendment of Section 377).",64
390,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Y a r r a ) .[10.11] - I notice that this clause substitutes the word "" u n safe "" for the word "" unseaworthy."" I submit that a vessel may be unsafe, and yet be seawortthy, as in the case of a boiler trouble, or anything of that kind, inasmuch that she could still keep afloat. I am not sure whether the section is strengthened by the change. I think the word "" unsafe "" is taken from the New South Wales Act and the Merchant Shipping Act . It will all depend on the definition of ""unseaworthy.""",64
391,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.12] - This is a verbal amendment to bring this part into line with other parts of the Act . The original section was taken from the Merchant Shipping Act. from which the New South Wales Parliament also took - I raised it , but we have used the word "" unseaw o r t h y "" in the Navigation Aet, and, as I say, this clause merely makes a verbal amendment. Clause agreed to. Clauses 117 to 120 agreed to. Clause 121 (Powers of Minister).",64
392,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Y a r r a ) [10.14] - This clause amends section 413 of the Act, which provides that, the Minister, or any person authorized by him, may go on board any ship, and inspect the "" equipments, life-saving appliances, boats, compasses, and signals."" The amendment is to strike out those words, aud substitute "" equipment (including the apparatus for wireless communication, if a n y ) . "" Does "" equipment "" cover what it is proposed to strike out?",64
393,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,""" Equipment "" covers all.",64
394,Mr TUDOR,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,Is the definition section amended to that effect?,64
395,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"""Equipment "" is definedin the principal Act. Clause agreed to. Clause 122 agreed to. Clause 123 (Seal of Minister).",64
396,Mr BURCHELL,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Fremantle) [10.18].. - This clause makes an ""alteration in the design of the seal of the Minister. What is the reason for the change?",64
397,Mr MASSYGREENE,PURCHASE OF VICTORIAN,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.19] - Sec ^ tion 419 of the principal Act provided that the seal of the Minister should consist of the Commonwealth coat of arms in a circle surrounded by the words "" Minister for Trade, and Customs, Commonwealth of Australia..'' We found it practically impossible to design such a seal, except of an unwieldly size, the Commonwealth coat of arms being much broader - than it is long. Therefore another seal was designed, from which this clause has been drafted. The wording provided for in the original Act was too lengthy, and as the word "" Australia "" already appeared in the Commonw ealth coat of arms, and : it did not seem necessary to insert it a second time, merelv the words "" M in is t er for Trade and Customs"" have been placed in the surrounding garter. Clause agreed to. Clauses 124 to 126 agreed to. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.23 p.m.",64
