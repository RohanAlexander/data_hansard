0,NA,Unknown,"Thursday, 17 August 2017 The SPEAKER (Hon. Tony Smith) took the chair at 09:30, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Australian Parliamentary Delegation to China The SPEAKER (09:31): For the information of honourable members. I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to China from 26 June to 1 July. It was my privilege to lead this delegation, which comprised the member for Banks, Mr David Coleman MP; the member for Solomon, Mr Luke Gosling MP; the member for Fadden, the Hon. Stuart Robert MP; and Senators Dean Smith and Murray Watt. A biennial visit to the People's Republic of China, hosted by the Chinese government, has been included as part of the Australian parliamentary delegations outgoing program for a number of years now. Its purpose is to undertake the annual dialogue that forms part of our parliament's memorandum of understanding with the National People's Congress. This was a productive and successful delegation in which all members played an active role in a series of high-level meetings and official business visits. On the day of arrival, Tuesday 27 June, the delegation visited the Beijing headquarters of JD.com, the largest business-to-consumer online direct sales company in China, and met the company's corporate vice-president, Mr Jerome Ma. The visit provided an opportunity for the delegation to understand the scale of ecommerce in China and to become informed about opportunities for Australian companies in this rapidly developing area. The delegation particularly benefited from a reception that evening, which was organised by the ChinaAustralia Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. AustCham Beijing aims to advance Australia China business relationships through building connections between its members and other business stakeholders. This was a valuable opportunity for the delegation to speak with Australian and Chinese business interests and to understand more clearly the challenges and opportunities for the many Australian businesses operating in China. I thank AustCham for its efforts in organising our meeting. On the Wednesday, the delegation participated in three high-level meetings. The sixth meeting of the China-Australia bilateral parliamentary exchange mechanism was led from the Australian side by the member for Banks, David Coleman. Four topics for discussion had been agreed prior to the dialogue: bilateral relations between the two countries, the development of parliamentary and legal systems, economic and trade cooperation between China and Australia, and people-to-people exchanges. Each delegation member had an opportunity to outline the delegation's position in relation to each of the topics. The second exchange, led by me, took place in the Great Hall of the People and was conducted with Mr Zhang Dejiang, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee and chairman of the National People's Congress. The delegation travelled to Shanghai on the Thursday and visited the Bright Dairy and Food Company, which is the second largest China based food manufacturing company. This visit gave the delegation an insight into the supply chain process, especially as it related to the  Australian dairy industry. On Friday, the delegation visited the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall and met with the Chair of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress, Madam Yin. All of the meetings, some of which I have not outlined here but details of which are contained in the report, gave members of the delegation an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the foreign policy context in which both countries are operating and continue the valuable building of closer parliament-to-parliament links. On behalf of the travelling party, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this successful delegation, in particular Mr Gerald Thomson, charge d'affaires, and his officers, at the Australian embassy in Beijing and Mr Graeme Meehan, the Consul-General in Shanghai. Thanks also to Raymond Knight and the International and Parliamentary Relations Office, who arranged travel and other details for the delegation, and the delegation's secretary, Tim Bryant, who assisted the committee with proficiency and diligence. Finally, I thank my colleagues for their participation in the meetings and their commitment to our program of work. I commend the report to the House. NA Law Enforcement Committee Membership The SPEAKER (09:36): I have received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that Senator O'Sullivan was discharged from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement on 16 August 2017 and is to be reappointed to the committee on 3 October 2017, and that Senator Bushby is to be appointed a member of the committee on 17 August 2017 and discharged on 2 October 2017.

3,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. In moving that this bill be read a second time, I would like to dedicate this bill and its associated bills to my brother-in-law, Gary Warren, who-as I remarked at the National Press Club earlier this year, when I referred to him and his wife, Michelle-has been suffering from multiple sclerosis for many years, and a finer man I don't know, here in this country or anywhere else. He is an extraordinary individual, and his wife and family are everything I think Australian families would aspire to be. It was with him particularly in mind that these measures were brought forward by me as Treasurer in this year's budget and that these bills now find their way into this House. With this bill, this government is instituting landmark reform to protect Australians in need through fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). This government does not just talk big when it comes to protecting our most vulnerable, but delivers decisively for the benefit of future and current Australian generations. Sustainably funding our most important programs-such as the National Disability Insurance Scheme-is real, tangible change, not just an empty promise or hot air. It's real, and it will be real to the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians who will be impacted by this scheme in a positive way. We also know that Australians support this change because they believe in looking after their mates, no matter what their own individual means or circumstances are. When we look after each other as a country, we don't look to our own means to see how much we can do; we look to the need of the person we are trying to help. That is an intrinsic Australian character, and it is that character upon which this bill is based. It is that character that I have seen demonstrated around the country in response to our call for Australians to support their mates who live with a disability and the families who live with them and care for them, along with their workmates, their friends, their associates and those they randomly come in contact with on the street and in public transport. It is about the empathy and the care and the passion that Australians feel for their mates, particularly those who suffer with a disability. It was my brother-in-law Gary who said, 'It's not flash being disabled, but, if there's anything good about  it, it's that you're disabled in Australia.' That says a lot about the character of Australians. As I said, it is that character which is called upon in this bill. Australians place great faith in our government's range of essential services. However, the burden is still too great on those living with a disability or caring for a family member. Noone can truly prepare for the hardship or cost of these responsibilities-which they bear through no fault of their own, through the cruel circumstances of life's fate. By funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme, we are working to lighten their load, to ease their burden and provide a quality of care that they deserve; to give Australians living with a disability the absolute certainty that high-quality care will be provided for them, both now and into the future. It is not just about easing their physical burden but easing the strain, the anxiety and the uncertainty that they also carry. This bill is about alleviating that pain, that burden, by delivering that certainty and by ensuring we focus on nothing else but them. This bill is about them. It's not about any other debate, it's not about any other issue, as meaningful or relevant as any of all those other issues might be that others may wish to raise, and indeed have sought to raise, in the course of this debate. But nothing is more important than those Australians to whom this bill is addressed. If this parliament cannot put them first, above every other issue in considering this bill, then members of this parliament who fail to do that will have failed the Australian people. This is about properly caring for people with disabilities. It has nothing to do with the politics of envy or debates about inequality. Such debates should not be an excuse to do the wrong thing here, which is what Labor-as the opposition-have sadly committed themselves to. I pray that they will change their view and reconsider the position that they are taking. It has been reported that in their own internal discussions they have harboured great doubts about the path they have embarked upon. I hope that the better angels of the opposition prevail when it comes to considering this bill, and that they put Australians living with a disability, and their families, first. That would simply mean that they would follow the same practice that they followed-as the government rightly acknowledges-when the Labor Party were in power under Prime Minister Julia Gillard and they brought this scheme into being. They brought this measure into the parliament, and they brought it in with an increase in the Medicare levy to help pay for it. Sadly, it didn't pay for all of it. But they gained the full support of the entire parliament. When this went through as an increase in the Medicare levy last time, no-one opposed it. Everyone supported it. I can't understand what has changed. Are Australians living with a disability finding it easier to do so than they were when this was first considered? Are their strains and pressures and anxieties any less? They're not. Will that be different 10 years from now, or 20 years from now? They will have to be dealing with it in the same way. Those of us who haven't been so unkindly touched by the hand of fate will go on with our lives, but they will have to labour under the burden that they will have to labour under. So, I can't understand: what has changed? These measures are not put in place for just the next two years or four years. In fact, the measures in the bill don't come into effect until 2019-20. They are put in place to ensure that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is funded to its full capacity, full-time, over decades and decades.  So, I urge the parliament to lift themselves out of the day-today morass of political debate and think about the long term. How many times have this chamber and the other, and politicians in general, been accused of focusing only on short-term political interests? I'm not a fan of increasing levies. This does not come naturally to me or those on this side of the House. But I am a fan of sticking up for your mates and I am a fan of supporting Australians living with disability, not just today but three decades from now. So I urge this parliament to rise above the ruck, to consider the long-term benefit and change that this bill provides, and give people who have had a pretty difficult lot in life the encouragement of this parliament by saying: 'We get it. We're going to put all of our other fights and all of our other nonsense aside. We're going to focus on you today and make sure, at the very least, that we do this.' With this bill, the government is protecting essential disability support that Australians rely upon. With this bill, the government is providing certainty. Certainty for people with a disability. Certainty for their families and carers. And certainty to all Australians who may find themselves in a situation that requires these services. Certainty that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will be fully funded for the long term. Today, we can give that assurance to all Australians with permanent and significant disability and those who care for them that this vital service will be there for them into the future. Let me now turn to the detail of the bill. The Medicare Levy Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme Funding) Bill 2017 is part of a package of measures to secure the Commonwealth's contribution to funding the NDIS. This bill will increase the Medicare levy rate by half a percentage point, from two per cent to 2.5 per cent, from 1 July 2019. Following this increase in the Medicare levy rate, one-fifth of the revenue raised by the Medicare levy will be credited to the NDIS Savings Fund Special Account. The NDIS Savings Fund Special Account will also hold NDIS underspends, selected saves across the government, and uncommitted funds from the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund, putting all that money into a lockbox for people with disabilities so never again can there be any questions that the NDIS is not fully funded. Along with the Commonwealth's share of the Disability Care Australia Fund and the repurposing of existing Commonwealth disability-related expenditure, all this meets the Commonwealth's contribution to the NDIS. Low-income earners will continue to receive relief from the Medicare levy through the low-income thresholds for singles, families, seniors and pensioners. People who are exempt from the Medicare levy, such as blind pensioners and people who are entitled to full free medical treatment for all conditions under Defence Force arrangements or Veterans' Affairs repatriations health card (gold card), will continue to be exempt. A number of other tax rates that are linked to the top marginal rate and the Medicare levy will also increase in line with this change, and these include increases in the rate of fringe benefits tax and superannuation excess non-concessional contributions tax.  In these bills, the same exemptions, the same carve-outs, the same protections for vulnerable Australians that exist for the Medicare levy exist for the increase in the Medicare levy to fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Now, if there are those who believe that those carve-outs, those protections for vulnerable Australians, are not strong enough, then I don't understand how that applies to a half a per cent increase in the Medicare levy but doesn't apply to the whole Medicare levy at all. It does puzzle me, the lack of consistency in that argument. The Medicare guarantee levy provides the carve-outs existing for vulnerable Australians-the same carve-outs that were endorsed and approved as being sufficient when the Medicare levy was last increased to support the National Disability Insurance Scheme. They were good enough then. They're apparently not good enough now. And you've got to wonder what's changed, other than the politics? Bills to give effect to these amendments will also be introduced today and further details of these consequential increases are set out in the explanatory memorandum. With the decision to increase the Medicare levy rate from 1 July 2019, this government is asking Australians to contribute-according to their capacity-to funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme and ensure it is guaranteed and secure for current and future generations. The more people earn, the more people will pay under this levy. This is an insurance levy. Everyone who is putting in is also someone who may rely on taking it out. And those millions of Australians who are not affected by this levy will also benefit from this competitive scheme. A few years ago, the Leader of the Opposition asked Australians, as I referred to earlier, to do the same that we're asking this parliament to do now and contribute to the NDIS through a half a per cent increase in the Medicare levy. The opposition leader voted yes then, and now he wants to vote no, pitting Australians against Australians over something that we should all be united on. When this government was in opposition, we understood and we came to the table. We met in the middle and we all voted on the same side. When Labor left office in 2013, it is true that they left a $55.7 billion funding shortfall for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Now is the time to finally rectify that shortfall. This is why I now appeal to all in this parliament to put aside these squabbles on politics about funding, and do the right thing by our most vulnerable fellow Australians now. By fully funding the NDIS, Australians with permanent and significant disability can be assured of access to vital care and support. Let us not forget that the NDIS has had bipartisan support from the very beginning. Together, the Commonwealth and the states and territories are committed to delivering the NDIS across the country and the NDIS is on track to be fully rolled out from 2020. But it is a big job, and the government needs to focus on delivering the NDIS, not squabbling with the opposition about how it's funded. We need to get past this debate and allow the efforts in this chamber and the other chamber to focus on delivering the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There can be no turning back from that commitment. There must be no more playing politics with disability. Now is the time to fully fund the NDIS once and for all, and, with this bill, we will finally achieve that objective.  There will be an ensuing debate on this and the related bills. There will. And we will hear the arguments, we will hear the excuses from the opposition as to why they will not support people with disabilities now. They will only confirm in the minds of Australians, in making that point, that the Labor Party that had the courage to bring forward the National Disability Insurance Scheme and, more importantly, had the heart to do it, and to put the politics aside, is not the Labor Party that sits opposite us now. That's what's changed. The politics of cynicism, the politics of division, the politics of negativity have overtaken their commitment to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and that is a disappointing thing to have to say in this House. This is one of the few things where I thought we would have agreement. I had hoped for agreement. I had hoped for the support to be forthcoming from the opposition, given their authorship of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and our acknowledgement of that authorship, of which Prime Minister Gillard should be truly proud. Her successors who sit on the opposition benches are letting her down, as well as all of those she worked with to bring this scheme into being. And I would ask them to reconsider their position, as clearly many in their number are urging their cynical leadership to do. Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Keenan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
14,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time.  The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2017 implements a first phase of reforms from a comprehensive review of Australia's anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regime. The report on the review was tabled in parliament in 2016. It made 84 recommendations to strengthen, streamline and simplify Australia's AML/CTF regime. Australia's regime must keep pace with international trends and developments in order to combat and disrupt money laundering and terrorism financing. Money laundering and terrorism financing methods-by their very nature-continue to evolve and criminals will look for new ways that they can exploit opportunities and avoid detection. Technological advances, market developments and the emergence of new products and services can create new and emerging risks that currently fall outside the scope of Australia's AML/CTF regime. Technological advances can also generate opportunities for more efficient and effective regulation. The bill implements a number of priority measures that will modernise our AML/CTF regime. It will:  regulate digital currency providers for the first time  reduce red tape and provide efficiencies and relief to industry  strengthen AUSTRAC's role as the financial intelligence unit and AML/CTF regulator  enhance Australia's ability to enforce the reporting of cross-border movements of physical currency and bearer negotiable instruments such as travellers' cheques  improve compliance with the international standards for combating money laundering and terrorism financing set by the Financial Action Task Force, and  make a number of minor administrative and definitional changes. Closing a regulatory gap Australia's AML/CTF regime was developed at a time that did not contemplate the use of digital currencies such as bitcoin. Bitcoin now represents more than half of the total market capitalisation of all digital currencies, which is currently close to a staggering $112 billion Australian dollars. Digital currencies largely operate outside of the regulated financial system. They are becoming an increasingly popular method of payment for goods and services, and transferring value, in the Australian economy. It is recognised globally that convertible digital currencies, such as bitcoin, pose significant money laundering and terrorism financing risks because they allow people to move money around the world on a peer-to-peer basis without revealing their identity. In view of these risks, the report on the review recommended that the AML/CTF Act should be amended to regulate activities relating to convertible digital currencies. The bill regulates digital currency exchanges, as this is the point where digital currencies intersect with the regulated financial system.  Businesses that trade digital currencies for money, and vice versa, will be required to:  enrol and register with AUSTRAC  establish, implement and maintain an AML/CTF program, which sets the framework for businesses to comply with their obligations, including customer due diligence requirements  report threshold transactions and suspicious matters to AUSTRAC, and  keep appropriate records. Closing this regulatory gap will have a number of important benefits. It will:  deter criminals from using convertible digital currencies to move illicit funds and avoid detection  facilitate the collection of transactional information about exchanges in digital currency for use by law enforcement, intelligence and national security agencies, and  align Australia with comparable countries such as the USA, Canada and the member states of the European Union. The Attorney-General's Department has consulted extensively with the digital currency sector about regulating it under the AML/CTF regime. Most businesses in the digital currency exchange sector welcome the introduction of AML/CTF regulation, as they are already mindful of the risks posed by the services they provide. Many digital currency exchange providers already comply with a voluntary code of conduct that includes guidance on measures for protecting their services from illicit exploitation for money laundering and terrorism financing purposes. Industry representatives have noted that AML/CTF regulation of activities relating to convertible digital currencies will bolster public and consumer confidence in the sector. Regulation under the AML/CTF regime will formalise these measures and reinforce the legitimacy of digital currency exchanges. An appropriate transition period will also ensure the burden of complying with the new regulatory regime is limited. Providing regulatory relief to industry The report on the review made a number of recommendations to provide industry with regulatory relief by simplifying and streamlining these requirements. These recommendations are consistent with the government's agenda to cut red tape and reduce the costs of complying with Commonwealth regulation. The bill deregulates two sectors:  cash-in-transit operators, and  some insurance intermediaries and general insurance providers. The money laundering and terrorism financing risks posed by the services provided by these two sectors is considered low. The report on the AML/CTF regime considered the risk and recommended deregulation by repealing these designated services. The deregulation of the cash-in-transit sector will deliver savings of approximately $326 million over the next 10 years. Deregulating some insurance intermediaries and general insurance providers will also deliver savings of over half a million dollars over the same period.  The bill also makes a number of changes to improve the operation of the correspondent banking provisions under the AML/CTF Act and better align them with current international banking practice. This includes:  clarifying the types of accounts that the correspondent banking obligations apply to, and  broadening the scope of correspondent-banking relationships to capture relationships with 'nonbanks' that provide banking services. The latter change will remove a competitive disadvantage currently faced by Australian banks when engaging in correspondent-banking relationships with 'nonbanks'. The bill also enhances the ability of related corporate bodies to share information within their group about the money-laundering and terrorism risks associated with a shared customer. The AML/CTF Act allows some associated businesses or persons to join together as a 'group' and share certain obligations to minimise their compliance burden. The existing definition of a 'group' does not reflect the way businesses actually structure themselves into 'corporate groups', particularly multinational corporate groups. This prevents businesses from sharing information about shared customers and impedes the ability of the group to manage risks associated with that customer. The bill will insert a new definition of a 'group' to better reflect the reality of business structures and allow these related corporate bodies to better manage risks across the group. Enhance enforcement of cross-border reporting obligations The AML/CTF Act establishes a reporting regime for the cross-border movement of physical currency and bearer negotiable instruments, such as travellers cheques. The bill will strengthen the ability of police and Customs officers to enforce these reporting obligations, establishing search and seize powers for cash, travellers cheques and other items. The search and seizure powers will be available for the police and Customs officers to use where:  there are reasonable grounds for suspecting money laundering, terrorism financing or other serious criminal offences, or  there has been a breach of the cross-border reporting requirements under the AML/CTF Act. The bill will also establish civil penalty orders for the offences under sections 199 and 200 of the AML/CTF Act, which are currently only subject to criminal penalties. A civil penalty option would provide law enforcement greater flexibility in responding in a proportionate manner to such breaches. Strengthening AUSTRAC's role: Expanded powers and functions AUSTRAC has a dual role as Australia's financial intelligence unit and AML/CTF regulator. Over the past seven years, the role played by AUSTRAC has evolved. AUSTRAC now plays a greater role in supporting international and collaborative efforts to combat and disrupt  money laundering, terrorism financing, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other serious crimes. The bill will update the powers and functions of the AUSTRAC CEO to better reflect and support the full range of work performed by AUSTRAC, giving a legislative basis to this work. This includes:  a broader power to retain, compile, analyse and disseminate AUSTRAC information  a general power to do all things necessary or conducive to the proper performance of any of the AUSTRAC CEO's functions  a new function of providing access to, and the sharing of, AUSTRAC information to support domestic and international efforts to combat and disrupt money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crimes, and  a new function to ensure that the AUSTRAC CEO can access on a timely basis the financial, administrative, and law enforcement information required to properly undertake his or her financial intelligence functions. Strengthening AUSTRAC's role: Retrospective remedial directions The report on the AML/CTF review recommended that the AUSTRAC CEO be given a power to issue remedial directions to require regulated businesses to retrospectively rectify contraventions of a civil penalty provision. Where a regulated business has failed to submit certain financial transaction reports, the ability to retrospectively secure compliance may enable a financial intelligence gap to be addressed. The bill establishes checks and balances for the exercise of this power. In particular, it will not apply to any conduct that occurred before this bill enters into law. Strengthening AUSTRAC's role: Registration of remitters The bill will implement a number of review recommendations to clarify and strengthen the ability of the AUSTRAC CEO to deal with the registration of remitters. The remittance sector is diverse, ranging from large organisations that oversee international remittance networks to smaller, informal money-transfer systems that often operate outside the regulated financial system. The services provided by remitters are considered to pose a high risk of money laundering and terrorism financing because they operate outside of the conventional banking system and often involve sending money to places that do not have established, modern banking networks. Remitters operating in Australia are regulated under the AML/CTF Act. They must register with AUSTRAC and apply for renewal of registration every three years and are subject to AML/CTF compliance and reporting obligations. The bill will give the AUSTRAC CEO stronger powers to effectively supervise the registration of remitters and assist in addressing some of the risks posed by the sector.  The bill will enable the AUSTRAC CEO to cancel the registration of a person if the AUSTRAC CEO is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person is no longer conducting remittance activities. A power to suspend or cancel a remitter's registration once the registered remitter ceases to carry on a remittance business would ensure that dormant registration certificates are not used by third parties to avoid AUSTRAC scrutiny. If a registered remitter appears to have an inactive registration, the AUSTRAC CEO would be required to issue a notice setting out the CEO's decision to cancel registration and the date from which registration will be cancelled. A decision to cancel registration would be reviewable. The bill will also clarify that the AUSTRAC CEO has the power to renew registrations with conditions and that a decision to refuse an application for renewal of registration is reviewable. Strengthening AUSTRAC's role: expanded infringement notice provisions The use of infringement notices under the AML/CTF Act is currently restricted to six minor regulatory offences. For contraventions of other minor regulatory offences under the AML/CTF Act, the AUSTRAC CEO must conduct civil proceedings through the Federal Court. This process is costly and time-consuming and does not always allow AUSTRAC to respond in a timely and proportionate manner to secure compliance. The report on the review recommended extending the use of infringement notices under the AML/CTF Act. The bill implements this recommendation and extends the use of infringement notices to an additional 11 minor regulatory offences. This will give the AUSTRAC CEO additional, more expedient and efficient means for promoting and encouraging compliance as an alternative to applying for a civil penalty order through the Federal Court. Administrative and definitional changes The bill will also implement a number of minor amendments to the AML/CTF Act. This includes:  requiring the AUSTRAC CEO to only grant exemptions which could reasonably be expected to impact on money laundering or terrorism financing risk to be satisfied that the risk associated with that exemption is low, and  expanding the objects of the AML/CTF Act to reflect the domestic objectives of the legislation. Conclusion This bill is the first legislative instrument to implement recommendations of the review of the AML/CTF regime. The statutory review provided an opportunity to shape a modern AML/CTF regime that positions Australia to address current and future challenges. The Attorney-General's Department and AUSTRAC consulted extensively with industry during the review of the regime to ensure that any reforms are relevant, efficient and effective.  The department and AUSTRAC also consulted with industry during the development of the reforms in this bill. This genuine dialogue between government and industry will continue during the other implementation phase of this bill. I commend this first phase of these very important reforms to ensure that Australia has a world-leading anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing regime to the House. Debate adjourned. Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Tudge. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
15,Mr TUDGE,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill provides the underpinning legislative authority to enable the expansion of the cashless debit card into new regions. The government is committed to addressing the serious harm which is caused by alcohol, gambling and drug abuse paid for by welfare payments. Welfare payments are provided to people in need to help with essential living costs, in particular food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. They are not provided to fuel significant drug, alcohol and gambling problems. Alcohol is a contributing factor to an estimated 65 per cent of all domestic violence incidents and 47 per cent of child abuse cases in some jurisdictions. Alcohol related harm and illicit drug use costs the Australian economy over $22 billion each year. The cashless debit card aims to reduce the devastating effects of welfare fuelled alcohol, drug and gambling abuse. The card operates like an ordinary debit card, with the primary difference being that it does not work at liquor stores or gambling houses and cash cannot be withdrawn from it. Consequently, illicit products cannot be purchased with it. The welfare payments are placed into an individual's account which is only accessible by this card. The card has been in operation since March of 2016 when the first of two 12-month trials began. The first trial was in Ceduna in South Australia. The second trial, in Kununurra and Wyndham in the East Kimberley, began soon afterwards. In each of these trial locations, 80 per cent of an individual's welfare payments are placed into their cashless debit card account, with the remaining 20 per cent being placed into their ordinary savings account. The results of the trials are encouraging. There is less public drunkenness, less gambling, fewer alcohol related hospital admissions, and people are engaging with the support services and working to improve their lives. The wave 1 report of the independent evaluation being undertaken by ORIMA Research concluded that the trial: Overall … has been effective to date … In particular, the Trial has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling-establishing a clear 'proof-of-concept'  The evaluation found that about a third of surveyed participants reported a reduction in alcohol consumption, gambling or illegal drug use. In addition, over 30 per cent of people reported being able to look after their children better, and being able to save more money. The draft of the final evaluation indicates that these results have improved even further. The bill itself amends the existing legislation to enable the cashless debit card to operate in further locations. It removes section 124PF of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, which limits the number of locations, participants and end date of the cashless debit card trial. Removing this section will support the extension of arrangements in current sites, and enable the expansion of the cashless debit card to further sites, which were announced as part of the 2017 budget. Many communities have expressed interest in having the card introduced into their regions, and we have been communicating and consulting with them. Under the legislation, the locations, cohorts covered and timing of the operation of the cashless debit card will still be determined by a disallowable instrument. These instruments can also specify other parameters, including sunset dates and participant criteria. What this means is that the government can work with individual communities to co-design the particular parameters, and tailor the program to suit that particular community's needs. It also ensures that the parliament itself retains the right to consider each proposed new cashless debit card site on a case-by-case basis. The cashless debit card is a world first in how it operates. The trials have been completed, an evaluation has been conducted, and it's been shown to work and now there's an opportunity to expand the cashless debit card to new locations. This bill will allow this to occur. Debate adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",32
16,Mr MCCORMACK,COMMITTEES," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: HMAS Moreton Unit Relocation Project, HMAS Moreton, Bulimba, Queensland. The Department of Defence is proposing to construct new facilities and provide new services on HMAS Moreton, Bulimba, Queensland. The proposed works to be delivered from this project include the provision of facilities to support Moreton's operations and to re-establish the base infrastructure with the reduced site. The project aims to provide a fully functioning, work-health-and-safety compliant and secure Defence site for Moreton to conduct operations and support functions for all current and future planned Royal Australian Navy activities. The scope of works includes a new multi-purpose building for office accommodation, classrooms and living-in accommodation. The engineering requirements include the extension of a council road, a new entry gate, a new boat ramp, internal road network, security fencing and connection to potable water, sewerage, stormwater and electrical services.  The Public Works Committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for, once again, undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in November 2017 and be completed by February 2019. With that, I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

The Department of Defence is proposing to build new and upgraded facilities to support the sustainment and maintenance of and training in the enhanced gap crossing capability at four locations across Australia. The project will deliver facilities and infrastructure at Wallangarra, Townsville in Queensland-I note the presence of the member for Herbert in the chamber-Darwin in the Northern Territory and Sydney in New South Wales. It will include permanent facilities for the storage of critical bridging equipment and an open storage hardstand to sustain and maintain the new capacity. The new and upgraded facilities will give the Australian Army a bridging capacity through the acquisition of operationally deployable solutions for use in a broad range of military and humanitarian activities. The proposed works will support an important Defence capability and allow more efficient and effective training to prepare the Australian Defence Force for deployment on operations to enhance Australia's security. The Public Works Committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would, again, like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry.

Publications Committee Report",34
18,Mr CHRISTENSEN,COMMITTEES," I present the report from the Publications Committee, sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of that report will be placed on the table. Report-by leave-agreed to. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report",34
19,Mr CREWTHER,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Modern slavery  and global supply chains: interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).",34
20,Mr CREWTHER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, it is my pleasure to present today the committee's interim report for the inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act in Australia. I am honoured to chair the Foreign Affairs and Aid Subcommittee, which initiated and is undertaking this inquiry and which produced this report. Modern slavery is a heinous crime that devastates millions of people around the world. Slavery is not a crime of the past but is all around us today. 'Modern slavery' is an umbrella term describing a range of crimes including human trafficking, forced labour, bonded labour, child labour, forced marriage, orphanage trafficking, sexual slavery and other slavery-like practices. An estimated 46 million people are victims of modern slavery around the world, including over 30 million victims in our Asia-Pacific region. The committee's inquiry is investigating how Australia's laws, policies and practices can be improved to better combat modern slavery here and around the world. The inquiry is in particular looking at whether measures similar to or improving upon the United Kingdom's Modern Slavery Act 2015 could be introduced here. This interim report outlines recommendations, statements of in-principle support and considerations focusing on combating modern slavery in the global supply chains of companies, businesses, organisations and governments operating in Australia. The committee resolved to prepare this report to help inform the Australian government's contribution to the Bali Process forum in Perth on 24 and 25 August next week, with the full content of a modern slavery act and other recommended changes to be considered in our final report. The committee has heard about the devastating impact of these appalling crimes around the world. At its recent hearing in Melbourne, it heard the shocking experiences of Ms Sophea Touch, who became a domestic slave in Cambodia when she was just four years old. Throughout her childhood, Ms Touch was forced to work in appalling conditions as she was passed from one family to another, each more abusive and violent than the next. She was starved, beaten and abused. She could not escape. She was a modern day slave. This human example highlights the importance of this inquiry to ensuring Australia is doing all it can to eradicate modern slavery. To date, the committee has received and published over 200 submissions and held public hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne, with further hearings planned in regional Australia. Submitters and witnesses have made many recommendations to improve Australia's response to modern slavery, including prevention measures, support for victims, improvements to Australia's visa regime, and prevention of orphanage tourism. The committee thanks all submitters and witnesses who have contributed so far. As noted, this interim report focuses on supply chains. Under the UK Modern Slavery Act, businesses and organisations operating in the UK with a turnover of 36 million poundsabout A$60 million-must report annually on measures taken to ensure that their global supply chains are free of modern slavery. Similar reporting requirements have also been introduced in the United States and elsewhere in Europe. This interim report summarises the  evidence heard by the committee so far. Overwhelmingly, there has been strong support for the introduction of a modern slavery act, including global supply chain reporting requirements and an independent anti-slavery commissioner. Businesses, unions and NGOs are all largely supportive of introducing supply chain reporting requirements here in Australia to raise awareness of modern slavery risk, to eradicate these crimes where found, to reduce corporate risk, to provide investor confidence and to ensure a fair market where businesses using modern slavery do not have a competitive advantage over those doing the right thing. This interim report highlights a number of key principles, raised by submitters and witnesses, that an Australian supply chain reporting requirement should include. These include support for consistency with international jurisdictions and best practice, mandated supply chain reporting and the establishment of a central repository of modern slavery statements. The report makes three recommendations. The first is: … that the Australian Government consider supporting in-principle the development of a Modern Slavery Act in Australia, including supply chain reporting requirements for companies, businesses, organisations and governments in Australia, as well as an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner … This reflects the strong support the committee heard for these measures. The second recommendation is that the government consider this recommendation as part of Australia's contribution to the Bali process forum next week. The final recommendation is that the government consider this interim report as part of its current review of corporate reporting in the UK and around the world, with a view to developing legislation in Australia. I'm very pleased to note on this point that in the last week the Australian government has come out in support of legislation to introduce mandated business supply chain reporting, with a proposed $100 million threshold at this stage, and has agreed to a central repository and opened up consultation on these proposals in conjunction with our inquiry. Importantly, the report also offers in principle support for and consideration of several key principles suggested by submitters and witnesses, including the introduction of a threshold above which businesses and organisations have to report; an optional opt-in for those companies and organisations below the threshold to submit an optional modern slavery statement; a central repository; an independent anti-slavery commissioner; applying reporting requirements to government procurement, which is a key criticism of the UK act; publishing a list of companies who need to report, as well as those who don't report; penalties for companies that don't report; looking at prescribing and reporting requirements in due diligence; and providing guidance for businesses. The report also identifies a number of areas for further consideration, including what possible penalties could be, the role of an independent anti-slavery commissioner, and other measures to combat modern slavery. The committee will continue to investigate these issues in its final report in accordance with our terms of reference, providing further direction to the government on modern slavery legislation. We have a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take the lead on stamping out modern slavery for good, particularly with over 30 million victims in our region. I'm proud of the Turnbull coalition government, who initiated this inquiry, who took the proverbial bull by the horns, as well as the bipartisan support this issue has now generated. In particular, I would like to thank the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General, the deputy chair of the inquiry, Senator Alex Gallacher, and colleagues on the  committee. Let us not miss the opportunity to continue to take action on this issue. I look forward to working with the committee for the reminder of this inquiry to recommend, and then see implemented, strong action to eradicate this appalling crime. Modern slavery must stop. I commend the interim report to the House. I move: That the House take note of the report.",35

22,Mr CREWTHER,COMMITTEES, I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Federation Chamber for debate. Question agreed to. NA Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. to which the following amendment was moved: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House declines to give this bill a second reading as it places the Government's political interests ahead of the interests of Australia's farmers',37
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The question now is that the amendment be agreed to.,37
24,Ms KEAY,BILLS," It is a great pleasure that, as a member of an electorate in regional Australia, I get to speak on the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017. What we heard this week in relation to this bill is those opposite trying to praise the Deputy Prime Minister-the minister who brought this bill into the parliament, the minister whose legitimacy to stand in this place, to sit on the front bench, is in question. And those opposite are saying, 'We're the party of regional Australia; we're the party that now has to bring forward this election commitment, this corporation.' But the history of this government is continued backflipping on these policy commitments that they make. The backpacker tax was a real corker of a one that really had a huge impact on regional Australia. Having these commitments doesn't actually make these commitments good policy. This bill hasn't got a lot going for it, really. Those opposite are saying that the Deputy Prime Minister is out there, getting out of his electorate of New England, across regional Australia. Sure, he might go out to regional New South Wales, regional Queensland or a little bit of regional Victoria, where the National Party holds seats, but I can tell you now: this Deputy Prime Minister, this Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, very rarely comes to my regional state of Tasmania. In fact, last year, I wrote to the minister when I was newly elected, because my farmers said to me-those dairy farmers who were hit hard by the dairy crisis-that they were not hearing anything from the  government or any support for them. So I wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister and I said, 'Please come to my state, to my electorate, to my farmers and talk to those farmers.' And he didn't say a word. Now, this is around the household assistance package for those farmers. That package took the farmers forever to actually apply for; it took them so much time and even a lot of money to actually get their application ready. The reply from the Deputy Prime Minister was a bit of, 'Too bad, so sad. That's the process you have to go through. But I'm not even willing to come to Tasmania to talk to you.' But he's willing to go to National Party seats. That's perfectly fine, but if you're going to be a minister for agriculture-maybe a legitimate minister for agriculture, and we'll see how that pans out-then you need to go through the whole regional area and all the farming areas of this great country of ours. When we talk about this bill, it talks about the farm concessional loans, which this corporation will look over. There's $4 billion sitting there that farmers aren't even taking up. You have to ask the question of why. I think that's something that the corporation will probably do some work into. I'm the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources, and we're doing an inquiry into irrigation at the moment. Farmers and irrigation bodies are saying to us that one real concern for those farmers, who are looking at water efficiency, is energy prices. That is something that this government is in a policy paralysis on. They're not offering any hope to these farmers that they can then switch to more efficient ways of delivering water when there's this high cost of energy associated with that. So a lot of farmers are now probably going back to diesel generation for their pumps. They're not getting the water efficiencies that we so desperately need, particularly in areas like the Murray-Darling, which has been the topic of conversation quite a lot. What this minister talks a lot about is water development. Since the election of last year, in this current parliament, he has been to Tasmania just once. Just once, for a little fleeting visit to the Southern Midlands irrigation scheme. This is one of those things that is quite quirky about all this: this corporation is going to talk about how we can fast-track the construction of dams and priority water infrastructure, but not one irrigation scheme in Tasmania and not one dam project in Tasmania was ever thought of, funded and committed to by the coalition or the Liberal party at a state level. We have had significant amounts of federal and state money invested into water infrastructure in Tasmania. Every project has been delivered by Labor or planned by Labor. But it's fine for the Deputy Prime Minister to come to my state and claim credit for at least one scheme. There's one that's being built in my electorate in Smithton. The Deputy Prime Minister may very well claim credit for that one as well, but it has all been planned by Labor and I doubt he will pass that credit onto us. But there's another part of this legislation that is quite concerning, and that's around where this corporation is going to be located. When you have, before the corporation has even started, said, 'Right, we're going to put this corporation in Orange,' then I have to ask: what is the process? You have to ask yourself what the actual process is. They are putting this corporation, with a number of employees to be employed by it, in a location without a process. The funny thing is that this process that the government has actually looked at to put it here is not even a process. It's a determination that they used when the Deputy Prime Minister decided that he would put the APVMA in his home town of Armidale. If that's not pork barrelling, then I don't know what is. I say that because that was an absolute disaster, and we all know that. We had our public servants working out of MCDonald's, for goodness sake, because the Deputy Prime Minister was adamant that that's where it had to go. Now we've got the corporation going to Orange, which is fine. That's great for Orange. I think there are 30 jobs, and its operation costs will be $20-odd million a year that this corporation will have. But even those who have consulted on this bill are asking, 'Why is it going to be here?' The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia are asking, 'Why has there been a unilateral decision made on this question?' But no-one can tell us why, and I think this is fine if you look at who's actually in the seat of Orange-the member for Calare! It's great for him. He's already talking this up. I think you have to look at whether this is a little bit of a nudge and a wink from the Deputy Prime Minister for the member for Calare where he's saying: 'I'll look after you, mate. I'll look after you.' Why couldn't this corporation be in a place like Burnie in my electorate, Bairnsdale, Ballina, Bowen, Devonport in my electorate, Deniliquin or Derby? Why weren't they considered? Has the Deputy Prime Minister just spun the wheel and gone: 'We'll put it in Orange because that's where one of my colleagues is. I think the history of that electorate is it was one that was held by Labor for a number of years, then it went independent and now the Nationals have picked it up. We'll bring some jobs there.' That's fine. We're very supportive of decentralisation on this side of the House-absolutely. It has its place, but you have to look at where these people go and what functions they're going to be providing in the service that they're in. The APVMA was totally one that doesn't work, and I've spoken to people like the CPSU around how we can get decentralisation and bring some of the public sector jobs to Tasmania. We're very cautious about looking at what the functions are that we can support in a state like Tasmania, which is quite removed from Canberra-absolutely. You have to be smart about this. You have to actually think about where these jobs should go. You can't bring a group of highly skilled specialised scientists from Canberra to Armidale and expect it to work without actually doing some consultation. But, no, the Deputy Prime Minister wanted the APVMA right there in Armidale. What about this corporation? The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia are suggesting it should be in Canberra. That's fairly reasonable. Was that considered? Who knows? This is quite an amazing bill! This went through the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and there was a dissenting report. I'm just trying to find it amongst all my papers here because it's quite interesting what they have actually come up with. The dissenting report states: … that the Government: Has failed to provide any coherent policy rationale for the establishment of this corporation. That's because the functions of this corporation actually exist. The water development projects that happened in Tasmania happened, and they happened well. The future of water development in Tasmania is very, very unknown. We don't know what's going to happen with further opportunities that might arise or that have been identified by Tasmania Irrigation because the government's not really focused on it. Will the corporation focus on the future irrigation needs of Tasmania or dam construction? Who knows? The government has offered mixed messages when enunciating the policy objectives for the establishment of this  corporation and has failed to undertake a cost-benefit analysis to give confidence that the $28 million cost of establishing and operating the corporation delivers good value for the Australian taxpayer. That's absolutely quite extraordinary, really. It goes on and on. Thank you to those senators who have provided that dissenting report. But there's one other issue that others who have looked at this bill and provided some commentary on it have raised, and that is the governance structure. The government has made a really slight amendment to this and they have now established that the board of this corporation will consist of a chair and two people. That's to look after $4 billion of taxpayers' money-two people. Now I think they have extended it in their amendment-because they thought, 'Oh, maybe that's a bit low'-to three. I know that the National Farmers' Federation in their submission stated, 'Oh, gosh, if you're going to be looking after $4 billion, we need a better governance structure here,' and they've suggested at least six. But the government hasn't listened. Of course, they haven't listened. This is $4 billion of taxpayers' funds that is going to be held under a board of three people. There's no accountability around this. If you actually look at the bill, the accountability structure particularly for this parliament is pretty non-existent. When you're dealing with $4 billion of taxpayers' money and you've got a Deputy Prime Minister that said, 'Oh, we're going to place it in Orange, in a National Party-held seat, and we've got a board of a couple of people that are going to dish out this money for water infrastructure development and support for farmers,' where's the scrutiny in it? It's not in this bill. This parliament has limited say as to what is going to happen under this corporation. A lot of these functions happen now, with our states and territories looking after concessional loans. That's been happening with water development. This goes back to the government having a lack of policy for water development into the future. And I'm sure my colleague the member for Herbert can talk a lot about the lack of water development policy that this government has undertaken, particularly in Northern Australia. The future in irrigation development in my state of Tasmania is really at a standstill. But, thanks to Labor, it has been continuing for the last 10 years with the construction of the Meander Dam in 2007. This government in the previous parliament and this parliament has really done nothing about water development for Tasmania or Northern Australia for that matter. The policy paralysis around energy is quite staggering. What farmers talk to us quite a lot about, particularly in the agriculture and water community, is: what is going to happen with energy and energy costs and the impost that has on my farming operation? They really do not know. The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development in Western Australia stated in their submission that anything less than the four members on the board may be perceived as government leaving the decision-making for the $4 billion portfolio in the hands of two people. Two ministers will be overseeing this corporation-the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, but the parliament will not necessarily get a say on it. The government has made four tiny, tiny amendments to this bill after it went through the scrutiny process, with submissions from the National Farmers' Federation, bodies in WA, the DPI, and pastoralists and graziers. The government came up with four teeny, tiny amendments that do not get to the heart of what some of these issues are. I say to the parliament: you just can't support this bill. This needs far more work from a Deputy Prime Minister whose legitimacy in this place is under question and whose record is clearly around  pork-barrelling and looking after his mates but not regional Australia-certainly not my regional state of Tasmania, which he's been to once. I've invited him to come to my state-no strings attached. I know that the state Liberal Party don't want him there, because I've had members of the Tasmanian Liberal Party tell me that. And that is sad. That is really sad. I hope we can get over this and I hope this government can start looking at the issues that matter to our farmers the most.  to the House. What we're looking at here is delivering the Commonwealth's farm business concessional loans through a system which is nationally consistent. Why? Because the current system, where the concessional loans are allocated through the states, is simply not feasible in the long term. It significantly limits the Commonwealth's ability to respond to the changing needs of the farming sector. With each state delivering the program, loan decisions are not being made in a consistent way across the country. How do I know that? I know that because I come from South Australia. In my time in this House, my electorate, sadly, has had to deal with drought and the dairy crisis. During the drought, in much of the upper south-east there were farmers across the districts pleading with government for access to drought concessional loans. Of course, funding was made available by the federal government, but applications needed to be made to Primary Industries and Regions, South Australia-the South Australian state department-under the leadership of the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries in South Australia, Labor's Leon Bignell. Despite there being incredible need and hardship, despite me sitting at the breakfast table with farmer after farmer pouring their hearts out to me about the circumstances they found themselves in, the financial stress that was transposing itself into personal stress in their family lives, with stories of marital break-ups and difficulty with children and their education, what did we see? We saw a few paltry crumbs off the table arriving to the odd-and I say 'odd'-farmer in South Australia. You don't need to take my word for it. You perhaps wouldn't want to. But a recent National Audit Office report found that, because of the very low number of successful applications in South Australia, processing costs for each successful application in South Australia for the concessional loans program amounted to-wait for it-$416,000. These loans were available up to $1 million. So, in going through the process of assessing these loans, the South Australian department effectively rendered an invoice to the Commonwealth for each successful application for $416,000. When I calculated the net benefit to the small number of farmers that got access to the concessional loans, it was a small fraction of what the state government had charged the Commonwealth for administering the program. This just can't go on. Those opposite seem to be railing against it. But do you know who's not railing against it? It's the minister for agriculture in South Australia. Even Leon Bignell gets that the gig's up. Agriculture minister Leon Bignell said he welcomed a nationally administered scheme. Maybe those opposite-the member for Hunter, in particular-haven't got the memo. We have the state Labor agriculture minister saying: 'Please, take this burden away from me. I'm incapable of administering this program consistently or at least consistent with other jurisdictions.'  I have spoken about the drought, but let me speak about dairy farmers and dairy farming. It is a significant industry in my electorate. They are farmers who, probably more than most, are heavily indebted and highly geared because of the nature of the farm work they undertake. I take my lead from serious advocates in this space, particularly those in South Australia. I refer to Andrew Curtis, who is the chief executive of the South Australian Dairyfarmers' Association. What did he say on this front? He said-and it's not too much to ask: We want clarity (around the scheme) and we're not getting it from the State Government, so from that point of view it would be good if the Federal Government took it over. If those opposite are not prepared to accept that the National Audit Office was gobsmacked at the cost of administering the scheme in South Australia, if they're not prepared to accept the plea from the Labor minister for agriculture in South Australia, could they please listen to the South Australian dairy sector? They said: … from that point of view it would be good if the Federal Government took it over. I'm not particularly disturbed by the attitude of those opposite-I understand that, invariably, if I come into this place and say, 'White is white,' those opposite will say, 'No, white is black,' and we'll go on this never-ending carousel ride of yes/no blame politics. What I was most disturbed by yesterday was the contribution from the member for Hunter. The shadow minister with responsibility for this sector indicated to the House yesterday that this bill did not have the support of the Senate crossbench. It takes a bit to shock me. My staff entered my office and asked if something serious had happened. I had gone white, because I thought, 'I get that those opposite are just going to play politics, but not the Senate crossbench, not Senator Xenophon.' I remember Senator Xenophon leading a Friesian heifer in support of the dairy industry. Indeed, Senator Xenophon ran a candidate against me who, by the way, didn't live in my electorate, but was previously associated with the dairy sector. I thought that, of all the crossbenchers, he would be the one rushing to support a bill which has been called for by the South Australian Dairyfarmers Association and Primary Producers SA and supported by the National Farmers' Federation. Hence I had gone white-this could not be true; this could not be right. So I made inquiries. At this stage, the only person we have on the record is the member for Hunter. He is speaking on behalf of the coalition of Labor and minor parties, but the good news is I see from the speaking list that after my contribution there will be a contribution from the member for Mayo. The member for Mayo is the only person in this House who represents the Nick Xenophon SA Best party. She represents an electorate that has a significant proportion of dairy farmers and dairy farming industries. She has an opportunity, when she makes her contribution in this place, to give unconditional support to this bill-not conditional support, not in-principle support, not any other series of words that seek to enable Senator Xenophon's flexibility in the other place; the member for Mayo has to walk into this place and say, 'Madam Deputy Speaker, colleagues, anyone listening around the nation, we in the NXT unconditionally support this bill, because we unconditionally support dairy farmers and unconditionally support farmers around Australia.' If she is unable to do that then, in effect, she and the Nick Xenophon Team are saying that they're perfectly comfortable with Minister Leon Bignell in South Australia and his department continuing to administer these loans. They might be perfectly comfortable with that, but I've spoken to a number of dairy farmers and I'm yet to find a farmer, let alone a  dairy farmer, who's comfortable with that position. If it is the case that we end up in a situation where the member for Mayo is incapable of confirming in this place that her Senate colleagues will unconditionally support this bill in the other place, she is going to have to deal with some seriously angry farmers. It wouldn't be my approach, if I could offer them some free advice. Why are the dairy men and women of South Australia angry? Well, in dairy recovery concessional loans alone, the federal government made available $15 million to South Australian dairy farmers. Bear in mind that these are dairy farmers who are dealing with a crisis the likes of which we haven't seen in this sector. The commodity price hasn't so much fallen as taken a nosedive off a cliff. Of course, this is a sector which is particularly input hungry-that is, the cost of churning out milk involves significant inputs. Those inputs are expensive and, at this point, there are a number of dairy farmers who are operating below the cost of production or at least achieving prices below the cost of production. So you would have thought that every single dollar allocated by the federal government to this program for the benefit of South Australian dairy farmers would have been allocated to them-every single dollar-and every application would have been accepted, or at least every application within the funding envelope that the federal government gave to the South Australian government to administer. But you will be surprised to learn that wasn't the case. Of the $15 million that was allocated by the federal government to the South Australian state Labor government to allocate to their farmers-very many of whom live, work and employ people in my electorate-only $8 million was allocated. Of the $15 million, only $8 million was allocated. Now, you might say: 'Well, look, you're being cute. That's probably all the applications there were.' No, there were 14 applications received and eight applications granted. So, there are six dairy farmers-I happen to know a large percentage of them in my electorate-who went to the considerable trouble of making an application for a dairy concessional loan. For those, perhaps those in the gallery, who are not as au fait with what a dairy concessional loan is: it's a loan, not a grant. It's effectively a mortgage from the federal government, just like you get a mortgage from a bank, but it's at a significantly reduced interest rate. It basically means you can go to your bank and say: 'Of that $5 million I owe you, I will transpose that to $4 million for you and $1 million for the federal government. The nine per cent interest I'm paying to you is on the $4 million and I will pay the much lower interest rate on the $1 million loan from the federal government.' It has to be repaid. These aren't grants. Nobody in the sector is after that. But there are six farming families who went to the considerable trouble of making an application, and they were rejected. They were told: 'No, we've got the money sitting here, but you're not having it. Keep getting up every morning, keep milking your cows and keep seeing the equity in your farm whittle away day by day, because we're not going to allocate that to you.' That's what has happened. The member for Mayo will contribute to this bill later today; she's on the speaking list. I would hate for her to take the opportunity to delete her name from the list. If she is incapable of coming in and saying that not only she but the senators of the Nick Xenophon Team give unconditional support to this bill, then she's saying to those families and the swathe of other families who didn't make an application, because they knew PIRSA would knock them back and they were waiting for the federal government to take charge, 'I don't care.' That's what  she's saying: 'I don't care. I'm particularly and personally happy with the work of the minister in South Australia, Leon Bignell, and his department.' Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (11:14): I give thanks to the member for Braddon for her fantastic comments about what it's like to live in the regional part of Australia in Tasmania. I too am pleased to stand, as a regional member in North Queensland, to speak against the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017. I have Magnetic Island and also the remote location of Palm Island in my electorate, so issues that are raised in this bill are particularly pertinent to my community. I have just one question for the Turnbull government: how well is the last concessional loan scheme you set up-that is, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund-going? The answer is: not very well. More than two years on, not one project has commenced; there is not one shovel in the ground; there is no economic boost for North Queensland; and the only jobs the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund has created are for board members, the CEO and staff. More money has been spent on paying the board and organisational wages than on funding for actual delivery of projects. Instead of the Turnbull government learning from their mistakes, they have created another concessional loan fund. So how long will the regions have to wait for this one? How long will you be paying the board's wages on this before delivering anything? After the Turnbull government's budget announcement, I met with local business leaders who work across sectors including the agricultural industries, regarding this fund. I was genuinely interested to know how they thought this fund would benefit them and our region, and what it meant for North Queensland in general. Every single one of them said they were taking this announcement with a grain of salt and had no high expectations at all. All business leaders commented they expected it to be like the NAIF: a nice announcement by the Turnbull government but unlikely to actually do or deliver anything. This goes to show just how out of touch this government really is when it comes to regional Queensland. They can't even sell the first concessional loan scheme, and, instead of trying to fix the issues with the NAIF mess, they set up another loan scheme and then another and then another before they manage to get the first one right. The Turnbull government have created more concessional loan schemes than they have created projects to fund. Let's talk about the slap in the face that the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund has been for the north-another loan scheme where a community is drought declared, on level 3 water restrictions, with less than 20 per cent in our Ross River dam, and Townsville does not qualify to access funds from the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. How does the fund deny drought-declared communities, including the largest city in north Australia that has a desperate need to secure long-term water security? Why would the minister for resources, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, create such ridiculous red-tape rules? What's even worse is that the Queensland state government has to make funds available because the Turnbull government could not get its own announcement right. The Palaszczuk Labor government had to find $15 million for interim funding to support the Deputy Prime Minister's National Water Infrastructure Development Fund to ensure that feasibility studies could go ahead in Queensland. The Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, made such a mess of his own fund that he forgot to advise the proponents that they would receive their funds in arrears. Let's not forget the new drought concessional loan, which has also experienced a very  poor take-up rate. And why has it had a poor take-up? Because once again the Turnbull government did not consult. The Regional Investment Corporation will face the same difficulties as the drought concessional loan. Its role is to provide loans to farm businesses, subject to the applicant meeting specified criteria. The 'subject to the applicant meeting specified criteria' will be centred on the viability of the farm business. It is important to understand that the RIC will be the bank of last resort, as farm businesses will need to be assessed as being viable. Determining whether a farm business is viable has been a major issue for the states when developing the guidelines for concessional loans, and this will continue under the RIC. Furthermore, the concessional loans are only for a period of 10 years. Post 10 years, the farm business will need to re-engage with their bank to secure finance if necessary. Why can't the Turnbull government get just one of their concessional loan funds right before they start another? This new fund will be like all of the other Turnbull government loans, because the fact is that this government has done no cost-benefit analysis at all. The concept of the RIC has been developed with no cost-benefit analysis as to whether or not the corporation will actually deliver any of the claims put forward by the Turnbull government. In particular, there are no costings on whether the RIC will help fast-track the construction of dams and the priority water infrastructure projects needed to stimulate investment, economic growth and increased agricultural productivity in rural and regional communities. The location of the RIC in Orange makes sense, building on the existing base of agricultural investment institutions in the city, including the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority and Macquarie Bank's Paraway Pastoral livestock enterprise. The Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme and the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility are intended to be budget neutral over their life, with the establishment and operating costs of the corporation recovered by the interest charged on loans to farm businesses and state and territory governments. The Turnbull government has not done any cost analysis on any of the issues I just raised-more proof that the Turnbull government are great at making announcements but totally lacking in their ability to deliver actual projects. You cannot do this to the people of North Queensland, because they have very long memories. Our communities are facing tough times, and we need real answers, not pie-in-the-sky ideas from the Deputy Prime Minister. The true cost of establishing the Regional Investment Corporation is $81 million over the forwards, with the potential to be higher if the uptake on the loans is low. The existing loans administered by the states and territories will remain the responsibility of the states and territories. Establishing a new body to administer new loans is a waste of taxpayers' money, is inefficient and is costly; $81 million would be better off spent on delivering real projects and real jobs, and I could give the government a list that Townsville would certainly benefit from. If the Turnbull government really wants to deliver for regional Australia, in particular North Queensland, they should invest in delivering infrastructure projects and not concessional loans. As I said, if this government is short on ideas regarding regional investments they could take a moment to go to my Facebook page and view the dozens of speeches I have made in this place outlining my demands for North Queensland: water security for Townsville, energy security for Townsville-and no, the answer is not a pamphlet plan-reinstate the 200 jobs that the LNP government have cut from the Australian Taxation  Office in Townsville, reinstate the jobs in the Department of Veterans' Affairs that have been relocated to Brisbane, and reinstate all regional job losses and relocations, including the five jobs lost from CASA in Townsville. The bare minimum the Turnbull government could do for regional Queensland and this concessional loans scheme would be to at least locate the RIC office in North Queensland. There has been no transparency in this process; it's just been decided to locate the Regional Investment Corporation in Orange. Why Orange? Why not the Burdekin? The Burdekin has a strong agricultural economy, and their diversification and business models are absolutely amazing. Mayor Lyn MCLaughlin has been a great driving force, together with many agricultural organisations in the Burdekin region. North Queensland will become an agricultural hub with growing connections to India and other Asian markets for agriculture, so why would the government not locate the RIC in the Burdekin? Where is the member for Dawson? I ask again: where is the member for Dawson, George Christensen? Why did he not stand up for the Burdekin, which is actually in his electorate? I am here standing in this place, fighting for the Burdekin community, which isn't even in my electorate, and I note that he is not even on the speaking list. Allow me to reiterate the facts on this bill so far. The Regional Investment Corporation has not been costed. It costs $81 million-possibly more-to administer. No transparent or fair process has been undertaken by the government to determine where to locate the RIC. It is highly likely to be similar to the other useless Turnbull government concessional loan schemes that do nothing. And any funds from the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, as and when they cross over with this fund, are potentially going to be in arrears, with the Queensland government likely to be forced to pick up the federal government's bill again. How could any reasonable person support this bill, especially knowing these facts? The Turnbull government has to stop making useless announcements and get on with the job of actually delivering projects. I am opposing this bill, because it is a complete and utter waste of taxpayers' money. It will do nothing to deliver projects for North Queensland that could and will create jobs, beyond what the state and federal governments are already doing. I do not support the location in Orange, and I am not supporting any harebrained loan scheme that won't do anything for North Queenslanders, who are desperately in need of jobs. My advice to the government would be: go back to the drawing board. The north is not fooled by this announcement. It is not going to help us in the north. If this bill passes, we will expect the same results as are evident with all of the other announcements from the Turnbull government-all fluff and no guts.",37
25,Mr RAMSEY,BILLS," Drought, floods and fires are, of course, constant companions of Australian agriculture. As a farmer, I know that it's in my DNA, if you like. As farmers, we do need to have resilience. We do need to be able to cope on a day-today basis with most of those challenges. But there are times when we are tested beyond our limits: when a drought enters a second year, a third year, or a fourth year. There is no realistic way for any business to be able to budget and allow for that type of catastrophic failure. It's a repeated story in Australia. We could just let the market rip, and there would be some agriculturalists-those who are in a stronger position-who would get bigger on the back of those types of rationalisations. But what we also need to consider is the fabric of our rural communities.  By and large, governments, over a long period of time, have tried to reach some middle ground when it comes to drought and disaster relief. While we accept that we need farmers to be competitive and to be up to the challenges of both the market and the environment, there come times when we just cannot allow a large number of them to fail, and we need some kind of mechanisms to back them up. A lot of these policies, despite the best intentions of both sides of parliament, are made in an ad hoc manner-'Yeah, we've got a policy'-but then they get tested. The weather tests us beyond the limits of the policy, and then governments have to make another move. Upon coming to government in 2013, the drought policy cupboard was bare. We'd had the previous exceptional circumstances arrangements, which accompanied the millennium drought, under the Howard government. Then it began to rain right across Australia, and it got to the point where there was nowhere in drought-in fact, we were dealing with floods, to be quite honest-and so those policies were wound up. But there was nothing put back in their place. Upon coming to government, the droughts have returned-certainly not the Australia wide droughts of the millennium drought, but there have been some very difficult patches. Some of my electorate of Grey has been significantly affected. The Regional Investment Corporation Bill is progressive policy. We are trying to cement into place policies that are developed not under the pressure of the minute but have a long term prospect for underwriting Australian agricultural production in the nation's interest. The bill establishes the Regional Investment Corporation as a corporate Commonwealth entity and delivers on the coalition government's election commitment of $2 billion farm business concessional loans, and $2 billion for water infrastructure loan programs in the Agriculture and Water Resources portfolio. I said that essentially we came into this area having very little policy on the shelf. Since 2013-14 the Commonwealth has been offering concessional loans to farm businesses to help them through these times of difficulty. Concessional loans are a very important part of the government's drought policy framework. One of the main reasons is that the enthusiasm of the banks-who are the major financiers of agriculture and many other things in Australia-for agriculture and other things waxes and wanes. It's not a consistent source of money that farmers can rely on. Sometimes, as farmers, we feel as though the banks are throwing money at us. At other times, you can't get two and six out of the banks to get you through to the end of the week. So having the Commonwealth concessional loans in place actually presents a sort of stability in the market. It's the lender of last resort, but it does help stabilise the market and it helps stabilise the commercial market as well. To come to the detail of the Regional Investment Corporation, the concessional loans that we've had in place since 2013 have been delivered through the states. In my state of South Australia, that means Primary Industries and Regions, SA-or PIRSA. That is what we call it. I'll come back to that in a moment. This is a very important point to do with why I am so strongly supportive of this legislation. As well as administering the farm business loans, the Regional Investment Corporation will administer the government's National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility. In the past, delivering through the states has proven unwieldy, with a lack of consistency across the country. Currently the Commonwealth has to negotiate separately with each state government to change existing arrangements or roll out a new program for farmers.  I said I'd come back to PIRSA and their role in the concessional loans that have gone out to South Australian farmers. The Commonwealth has delivered $724.4 million of loans throughout Australia since this program was instigated in 2013. In South Australia, despite vast regions being in drought, there has been $17 million. It doesn't matter how you slice up the pie, there is something intrinsically wrong with this. I and the member for Barker, who spoke previously on this bill, have tried and tried to get to the bottom of why that discrepancy exists. Why is it possible for farmers interstate to access these concessional loans but it seems all but impossible for farmers in South Australia to do so? We keep coming back to the door of PIRSA and the South Australian government. I am bereft of an explanation as to why they have made it so difficult. It is not as if we asked the South Australian government for a cocontribution. All we asked them to do is run the concessional loans program, and yet they seem to be so reluctant to support our South Australian farmers. I don't know why that is. If I were a state government, I would be out there backing my farmers all the way. But, for whatever reason, these blokes-and I use 'blokes' as a generic Australian term-don't seem to have any enthusiasm for our South Australian agriculture at all. In fact, that is across a wide range of programs. We have seen state governments in Queensland and New South Wales putting in state contributions around drought relief-like freight subsidies, for instance. We've never been able to entice the South Australian Labor government down that path. They just do not seem to want to back agriculture. They will refrain, in fact, from declaring an area drought-declared in case there is a financial implication for them. But, in the case of these Commonwealth concessional loans, they don't have to put any money in and yet they still won't back it. We got $17 million out of $724 million. It's a disgrace. So I am absolutely in favour of us at the Commonwealth level taking over this entire capacity so we can get consistency across the nation. We are, after all, a national government. We are a national government and we should have nationally consistent programs. The trouble is that, when we filter things down through the state governments, they get corrupted at that level. I think we can probably say that across a wide range of programs, but on this particular day we are focusing on agriculture. Those figures that I have quoted to the House so graphically demonstrate exactly what is wrong with the current system. So the loans under the new regional investment strategy will not be exactly the same as those currently offered. The system will be broader, with the loans drawing on constitutional authority that includes the Commonwealth's trade, commerce and external powers. The restrictive approach to assessing loan applications, which has had very low approvals, will be upgraded. We will reduce some of those restrictions. There's not much point putting money on the table for people who are struggling to stay on their properties and then making it too difficult to access, so we are here to help, as I think this government have been since we were elected in 2013. I get to talk to a lot of farmers. I have been very proud of this government's engagement with agriculture. I think over that period of time we have done very well. We certainly now are making the 10-year commitment on farm business concessional loans, but we have upgraded the access for farm household allowance during times of financial hardship. One of the things that I argued for very strongly-and I approached the agriculture minister over it repeatedly, let me say-was the lifting of the thresholds, the limits, in the farm management deposits scheme. This is something that I used as a farmer before I entered politics. I found it one of the most enabling pieces of policy to allow farmers  to plan for the inevitable droughts-and the inevitable floods, but generally the droughtsand it became quite apparent to me that many of my farming friends continued to expand their properties. As I have said in this House on many occasions, that's good for the farmers, it's good for the state and it's good for Australia. They farm the land in a very good environmental fashion, but it does tend to claw at the intestines of regional communities, unfortunately. Some of these farmers are spending up to $4 million putting in a crop. The idea that they had $400,000 set aside to cover a drought-it was simply not enough in this environment. Farming is a very big business. It's a very expensive business. It doesn't have big margins, so it is high investment for moderate returns. So the lifting of the farm management deposits to $800,000 per person was a great step forward. We have delivered on that. We have accelerated depreciation on water reticulation, fencing and fodder storage. There is a 100 per cent write-off on water reticulation, one of my favourite schemes. I keep telling farmers on Eyre Peninsula, 'You need to put in plastic-lined dams and plastic water runs.' I can give you some figures, but I haven't got the time now. But the water run-off, when you get 100 per cent, is enormous. It is absolutely enormous. It is a great opportunity for farmers at the moment to take advantage of the accelerated write-offs that this government has put in place for them. We've also guaranteed the future, if you like, and put in a better funding line for the Rural Financial Counselling Service. It's a vital service to so many farmers when they're under pressure. We've had the $20,000 instant tax write-off for capital equipment-not just for farmers, of course, but for businesses right across Australia. We have extended that time frame. I personally hope that we make it permanent, but let's see what future budgets bring us. We have lowered the tax rates for small and medium businesses. I think something that's probably not been well advertised out there to our businesses, many of which operate as partnerships, is that there are commensurate reductions in taxation for partnerships as well that are running those same and similar businesses. We put an extra $100 million into agriculture research. One of the things that I say brought me into parliament in an indirect way was access to good levels of education, particularly to tertiary education for our kids from the country. I am a great supporter and very appreciative of the government's moves to eliminate farm assets from the assets test for independent youth allowance and just rate that on an income assessment, because we know well the old story about farmers being asset rich and income poor. This has addressed an anomaly that has sat in the system for some time. Sometimes our assets are worth more than others, but with the vagaries of agriculture that I addressed right at the start-drought, fire and flood-these are variable assets which sometimes are locked up very tightly and in times of drought are producing no income. All across a wide front, across a wide range of areas, this government has delivered for farmers. It's not surprising that we do deliver for our regional areas, because the coalition are largely, almost exclusively, the federal political representatives of rural and regional Australia. Thank you.",46
26,Ms SHARKIE,BILLS," I rise to support the passage of the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017. As many of you know, from my previous speeches in this place, my passion and commitment to regional Australia knows no bounds. My electorate of Mayo  contains some of the best agricultural produce in the world. In fact, the Adelaide Hills just won the nation's most outstanding region award at the 2017 delicious. Produce Awards. We have a myriad of apples, pears, cherries, strawberries, beef, sheep and crops. There are 93 separate dairy farms within my electorate borders, along with seven separate wine regions. The future of agriculture in Australia directly impacts on the future economy of my electorate, and I see a very bright future for Australian agriculture. I have previously discussed in this House that, by 2050, the world's population is expected to increase to 10 billion people. A large majority of this increase will be on our doorstep in Asia. This creates an enormous opportunity for Australia's agricultural sector. I have long advocated for putting the right measures in place now to ensure that Australia benefits from the incoming great dining boom. The growing Asian middle class demands high-quality produce, and who better to provide that produce than Australia? We are perfectly placed to reap the rewards of increased demand. I'm a very strong supporter of the measure in this bill to give control of the Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme to the Regional Investment Corporation. I stood in this House earlier this year and discussed how, by leaving it to each state and territory to administer the scheme, perverse outcomes were being created. There is inconsistency in application. In my state, the dairy recovery loans have been under-utilised, due in part to the state government refusing to consider water allocations and livestock as part of the land value when assessing eligibility. This is different to other states and territories, particularly Tasmania, which assess both water rights and livestock. Since the dairy recovery loans were introduced, there have been 228 farm businesses approved for funding. Of this 228, only eight South Australian dairy farmers have had their loans approved. The total value of loans approved in South Australia is $7.5 millioncompared to $109 million in Victoria. For all concessional loans programs from 2013 onwards, South Australian farm businesses have been paid $17.2 million out of a national total of $724 million. That is just two per cent of the total value of loans approved going to farm businesses in South Australia. A move to a nationally consistent application of the loan scheme is fair for all farmers. It means some farmers will no longer be denied federal assistance just because their land is on one side of the border. Similarly, a $2 billion investment in water security and infrastructure is very welcome. I'm privileged to have the Lower Lakes in my electorate. I think I can speak for all South Australians when I say we know about the importance of water security, and thankfully my state is no longer in drought. But I am not so naive as to think drought won't return in the near future. Investments in water infrastructure will help to protect our regions in the future. While I'm on water security, I want to again address the allegations of theft aired in the ABC's Four Corners program on 24 July. These allegations are shocking, but perhaps what's worse is the seeming lack of concern from members of the coalition. It is hypocritical and condescending for the government to introduce measures designed to boost water security while also turning what I see as a blind eye to serious allegations of water theft in the Murray-Darling Basin. I have previously called on the Deputy Prime Minister to step aside from the water resources portfolio, and I reiterate that statement here today. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan is not perfect, but it is a strong plan. It's a national plan and it's a shared plan. It's born out of compromise and it's is endorsed by this parliament.  While I applaud the federal government for its $4 billion commitment to the Regional Investment Corporation to Australian farmers, I want to make a point I have previously made in this House: Australian farmers are not looking for a handout. I speak to farmers every week in my electorate. They pride themselves on not having to lean on government for subsidies like farmers do in other countries. But, as farmers have supported this country in the past, the country must also lend its support to farmers at times when needs arise. These measures secure that assistance, and I commend the government for introducing them. I would like to speak briefly on the controversy that has come up with the announcement of the Regional Investment Corporation to be located in Orange in New South Wales. Critics will point to the Deputy Prime Minister seeking to shore up a marginal New South Wales electorate. I want to say here that I am a supporter of decentralisation. However, decentralisation needs to be a policy beyond placement of jobs in northern New South Wales. I want to make special mention of the member for Indi, Ms Cathy MCGowan, who has pushed hard for a House select committee inquiry on regional development and decentralisation, and I look forward to this committee examining the benefits of decentralisation and the positive impact it can have on regional communities. I note the Labor Party have raised some concerns with this bill, including the lack of accountability and parliamentary oversight. While I understand that the Regional Investment Corporation will be able to be called before the Senate estimates process, I would like to see more parliamentary oversight for a corporation that will be handling billions of dollars of taxpayer money. I'm supporting the passage of this bill so that my Nick Xenophon Team colleagues can review the Senate committee report and examine the bill in further detail. Like me, my NXT colleagues are committed to ensuring that regional Australia continues to prosper. Deputy Speaker, I was just in my office listening to the debate on this bill and I would like to raise with the House what appears to be something that I am finding quite awkward, and that is the member for Barker's fixation with me. It's becoming quite weird. Instead of talking about farmers, the member for Barker, who spoke just moments ago, spent a considerable amount of his time talking personally about me. I know that the Nick Xenophon Team candidate, James Stacey, who is a former dairy farmer and a true grassroots representative of his community, only had six weeks to campaign in Barker and during that time reduced the member for Barker's margin from 16 to 4.7 per cent-the closest margin in Barker since 1943. Perhaps the member for Barker has received some new polling that he is finding deeply concerning. I'm not sure, but I must say that I am finding this rather perplexing and certainly awkward and weird. I don't presume to give the member for Barker advice in this place, but I will say that his constituents, judging by those who ring me to pledge their support, want a member who cares and connects with their community and who is not distracted by petty party games. In closing, regional Australia is the lifeblood of this country. Over 314,000 people are employed in Australian agriculture, which is fast becoming the major driver of the Australian economy, with the end of the mining boom. Too often the federal parliament and state parliaments focus on the metropolitan areas at the expense of the regions. If we want Australia to grow and to succeed over the next 50 years, investment in our regions is of paramount importance. For that reason, I support the passage of this bill. ",49
27,Mr COULTON,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 and to speak against the amendment moved by the member for Hunter. Just for those who might be listening to this broadcast, I will read the member for Hunter's amendment. It states: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House declines to give this bill a second reading as it places the Government's political interests ahead of the interests of Australia's farmers'. That is the member for Hunter, the agriculture spokesman for the Labor Party. The reason I quote that is that I have been listening to the contributions of the members of the Labor Party in this House and they're speaking, supposedly, in support of the amendment that says that they don't want to give this bill a second reading, but they spend most of their time saying how the Regional Investment Corporation should be in their electorates. Either they are opposed to this bill or they are for it. I think it is a little strange. I am in strong support of this bill. I think it fulfils a promise that was indicated in the ag white paper that Minister Joyce introduced several years ago. What this bill will do is streamline the concessional loans to farmers, those who are struggling with issues around drought, dairy deregulation, decline and other such things. I do believe it has the potential to grow into much more over a period of time. I was listening to the member for Hunter's contribution to this debate. He was talking about the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, Minister Joyce, and his contribution to his portfolio. I might say I believe that the ag white paper and the policies that have grown from it have been, possibly in my lifetime, some of the most influential changes to agriculture. I might remind the member for Hunter, who is sitting at the table, that the farmers in Australia in my electorate are a resilient lot, but there is one thing that the farmers in my electorate fear more than a hailstorm at harvest time, and that's a Labor ag minister. A Labor ag minister is about as welcome as lousy weather at shearing time. For the member for Hunter to move this scurrilous amendment to discredit what is an essential piece of legislation, I think, is indeed very short-sighted. That is because agriculture has now regained its rightful place as one of the leading drivers of the Australian economy and certainly one of our largest income-earning exports. The policies that have been put in place by this government are having a real effect, not just for the farmers in Australia but for entire communities that are economically intertwined with the farmers. I will give you a great example: the instant write-off for water and fencing has put a huge boom into the ag supply business for contractors right across Australia and particularly in my electorate. If you drive around my electorate, you'll see there is a shining new tank on the top of nearly every hill and a water supply that will enable those farmers to much better manage their property and pasture the next time a drought hits. There is the ability to re-fence their properties and get an instant tax deduction for that so that they can manage their assets in a more efficient and sustainable way. There is the ability to have accelerated depreciation on fodder and grain storage. If you once again drive around my electorate you will see shining new silos and sheds all over the place because of the taxation advantages that these farmers can take to prepare themselves for the next time there is a dry period of time. I was here in 2008-from memory, I think the member for Watson might have been the agriculture minister at the time-when the agriculture minister removed the word 'drought'  and replaced it with 'dryness'. He said, 'This is climate change, and we've just got to get used to it.' In contrast to that mindset, this is a policy where farmers take control of their own future and invest in their own sustainability, a policy that has faith in the rural community because they are the ones who know how to best manage what is happening. The other thing is recognising the fluctuation in income. For instance, in the north-western part of my electorate, around Walgett, they've had four drought years in the last five years. Last year was an exceptionally good year. Farm management deposits being increased up to $8,000 gives those farmers the opportunity to level out their income and control their cashflow to a degree so that they can manage these times better and they are not coming to the government in a dire circumstance like we've seen in the past. The other change from this government that has been a real boost to the economies of rural Australia, and particularly my electorate, has been the $20,000 instant asset write-off. Suppliers of small equipment-bikes, quad bikes, side-by-sides and cattle yards-and a whole range of people have had a real economic boost because of policies that have been put in place by this government, in this parliament, driven by the agriculture minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, that are having an effect day after day in regional Australia. We can combine that with some of the larger projects. The one that is of particular interest to me is the Inland Rail. About 700 kilometres of the Inland Rail will come through the Parkes electorate. Already, we're starting to see businesses and farmers looking at how they can take advantage of the efficiencies that that will bring in their freight, and we're starting to see councils align their planning for roads and infrastructure to tie in with this rail network so that we will have not only the cities of Melbourne and Brisbane connected but also every capital city in Australia connected for the first time. The farmers, the agribusinesses and the manufacturers that are in western New South Wales will have access to cheap and efficient freight all over Australia and to numerous ports around the country. This is a red-letter day for regional Australia-to have another piece of legislation coming through to back up the economy of that region. I might comment on the member for Mayo's contribution and some of the contributions from the other side over the last couple of weeks about the Four Corners program. There are four investigations under way at the moment about the accusations that have been raised, and they are accusations. My electorate is particularly affected by this because not only do I have the downstream people who are affected by the water management in Broken Hill-Broken Hill is the canary in the coalmine when it comes to the health of the Murray-Darling system, more so than Adelaide, even-but also the irrigation industry that I represent is also important to my community, so I've got both sides of the argument. Members have come in here and spoken like an accusation on a television show is somehow a fact. The people that have been caught up in that television show have been denigrated without any form of redress. I think we should wait and see what these inquiries come up with. If they indeed show that there has been illegal behaviour, corruption or any misdemeanour of any sort, then action should be taken. But, until then, I think people should be very, very careful about what they say. The Labor Party has form on this. We saw the Four Corners program on live-cattle trade. The federal government now has a lawsuit running from the northern cattlemen because of that program. An entire industry and an entire region was decimated by a knee-jerk reaction. I need to remind the people of Australia that, if the Labor  Party were on the government benches last week, we would've had the same knee-jerk reaction. Where was the former minister for agriculture then instead of sticking up and defending the farmers that were supposedly the responsibility of his portfolio? Where was he then? He was lock, stock and barrel with the rest of them-chanting across the table baying for blood. I just think everyone needs to be very, very careful. The people of Broken Hill are very concerned about what's going on upstream, and so they should be. But we just need to wait and see what comes out of this. So, I strongly support this bill. I'm strongly opposed to the amendment by the member for Hunter, and I would encourage everyone who's involved with regional Australia, everyone who's involved in the agriculture industry, to have a look at the amendment from the member for Hunter and see where his energies are being placed in his role as the Labor Party spokesperson for agriculture.",52
28,Mr ZAPPIA,BILLS," The Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 claims to achieve two outcomes, and both of them are intended to support the agricultural sector. The first outcome is to establish a national water funding program. Secondly, it's intended that this legislation will provide funds by way of loans to farmers during times of need and events that are beyond their control. Governments, particularly the federal government, have an important leadership role in building the nation's infrastructure. Governments also have responsibility in building industry sectors, and in times of need to ensure that those industry sectors remain viable. It is in the national interest to do that. Good governments have always done that and should continue to do so. During the economic downturn of 2008 the Rudd government's economic stimulus measures ensured that Australia did not go into recession. Coalition members are all too quick to criticise the Rudd government's initiatives at the time, which saved Australia's economy, but they are just as ready to boast that the Australian economy has continued to grow every year for the past quarter of a century. That would not have happened were it not for the Rudd government's economic stimulus measures during a time of need. Despite that growth, there have been industry sectors that have gone through difficult times and for which government intervention could have made a substantial difference. The farming sector is one of those industry sectors. Agriculture contributes significantly to both national employment and national economic productivity. It is and always has been a major economic driver of the Australian economy and contributes around $60 billion a year right now. A third of Australia's population live in regional or remote Australia, where those communities rely predominantly on the agricultural sector for their livelihood, as do many urban businesses and residents. The farming sector is also vulnerable to both fluctuating markets and variable weather conditions. This was no more evident than between 1998 and 2008, when the decadelong drought brought many farmers, including cattle farmers, to their knees. Coalition members conveniently forget that the long drought did more harm to most of the cattle growers than did the suspension of trade with Indonesia. They seem to have a memory lapse with respect to that, but I can say to coalition members: at the time, I spoke to many cattle farmers, who came to Canberra from around Australia. The drought was hurting them just as it was hurting farmers across the nation, and quite substantially. In the same way, coalition members pretend that the global economic downturn never really happened-until, of course, it suits their argument to say otherwise.  The Regional Investment Corporation Bill sets out the framework for establishing a government corporation-a quasi government bank-that will provide up to $4 billion in concessional loans to farmers or repayable grants to fund national water infrastructure. In keeping with the corporation's bank role, the skill set required of the three board members who will oversee the corporation include banking and finance, economics, financial accounting, and auditing. As the name of this legislation clearly implies, this proposal is focused on supporting regional communities. Yet, when the Rudd government proposed a similar initiative, in partnership with the four major banks, to support the construction industry during the global financial recession years, coalition members ridiculed and opposed that proposal. How different is this proposal to that in terms of its objective? Indeed, that proposal was a partnership with the four major banks, who would have had a direct say in how the loans were made. Again, the double standards and hypocrisy of government members are evident. Likewise, when Australian manufacturing industries were struggling, largely because of a very high Australian dollar, the Abbott-Turnbull government failed to intervene. In fact, the coalition government did the opposite, by taunting GMH to leave Australia, knowing that Toyota would follow suit and, in turn, end Australia's auto manufacturing industry. It was the most callous decision of the coalition government. It left Australia as one of the only advanced countries without a car-making industry, it left tens of thousands of Australians out of work and it left whole communities reeling. More Australians will lose their jobs over the coming months as the car makers finally close down their operations in Australia. The stupidity of that decision is that the loss of tax revenue to the government and the welfare payments it now has to make far exceed the assistance car makers were asking for at the time. Just as regrettable, the Australian dollar subsequently fell, as expected-which, once again, makes Australian car makers very competitive. Had the Australian dollar at the time been what it is today, perhaps the decision would have been different. Members opposite, who know nothing about the car industry, should think carefully about their comments with respect to what provoked GMH into leaving Australia. I note that the member for Calare, in his contribution, lamented the loss of jobs from the closure of Electrolux. He, understandably, alluded to the devastating impact on the local community. I can relate to that impact, because it's happening in my own community. Yet there was no such compassion or care shown by members on his side of politics for the jobs of the auto workers in Adelaide and in Melbourne. They too have families and they were also working in factory jobs, just as the Electrolux workers were. I don't criticise the member for Calare, because he was not in this place at the time. But he makes the very same argument that members on this side of politics made in respect of the auto industry, which fell on deaf ears when it came to coalition members. The double standards are breathtaking. My concern is not with the intent of this legislation but with the framework under which the corporation is being established and the influence of the minister in the role of the corporation. I note that both the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources and the Minister for Finance have joint responsibility for the corporation. The reality is that this legislation is being driven by the agriculture and water resources minister, who will use the corporation for political pork-barrelling and to shore up seats in parliament for his side of the House.  I note that the corporation's headquarters will be in Orange, in the National Party seat of Calare. We're not told why Calare was chosen as the seat where the headquarters would be based, or why Orange was chosen. While I make no criticism of that choice, it would have been good for the minister to have come in and said, 'Yes, we looked at a range of sites, and for these reasons the headquarters will be based in Orange.' But we were not told. It was a decision made by the minister, who, under this legislation, has the power to do so. I have no problem with decentralising government operations from capital cities. But, again, I have no doubt from my travels around the country that there are many regional centres that would dearly love government operations to be established within them. If we're going to do that, at least let's look at it in a balanced way and then come back with justification for the decisions made by the government such as this one. But, yet again in this case, we are not told why Orange was chosen. The more serious concern, however, is section 11 of the bill, which identifies the operating mandate for which the minister has responsibility. It is a mandate which includes, firstly, the eligibility criteria for loans and financial assistance. I will just repeat that: the eligibility criteria for loans and financial assistance rest with the minister. It includes 'directions on other matters'. It doesn't tell us what the other matters might be; it just leaves it open-ended. It is whatever the minister wants to give directions to the board about. And it includes the performance of the corporation, which effectively says to me that, if the minister doesn't like the direction that the corporation is headed, he can simply do away with the board and replace it. The mandate will be-and this is even more concerning-by way of a non-disallowable instrument. In other words, parliament doesn't get to see the mandate and cannot reject it if the mandate does not appear to be reasonable. These powers give extraordinary control over the corporation to a minister who has shown his preparedness to pork-barrel and, even worse, his bias towards farmers in his part of Australia. We saw that with his handling of the water portfolio, which includes the Murray-Darling Basin. Firstly, the minister abandoned the return of the additional 450 gigalitres of water to the environment. We had a debate about this only the other day. But, even worse, when allegations of theft of one billion litres of basin water were made, he downplayed the seriousness of that. He refused to support a judicial inquiry into the claims, knowing full well that only a judicial inquiry would get to the bottom of the facts in respect to the claims being made because none of the other government departments or bodies that have been asked to look into the matter have the powers to do a full investigation and ensure that all the matters are addressed. Simultaneously, the minister says he wants a $4 billion bucket of money to build water infrastructure, while he shows little concern for alleged water rustling, as I call it, or water theft taking place under his very watch. He shows little concern for delivering on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. He wants money because he argues that the nation needs to do more about storing water and having water available for our farmers when they need it. Yet, under his very nose, there are allegations that water has been taken away and he shows very little concern about that. In closing, I support the amendment moved by the member for Hunter, and I do so because, as the member for Hunter quite rightly points out, this proposal comes at an $81.4 million cost to Australian taxpayers. There is no new money, as far as I can ascertain, in respect of the $4 billion. It is just a collection of money that will then be put into the hands of the Minister for  Agriculture and Water Resources so that he can use it as he sees fit. It gives extraordinary control to a minister of government who has shown not only his preparedness to politicise his portfolio but his incompetence in managing the water portfolio. Yes, we need to support our farmers. The money that is being proposed under this legislation is already there. It's just a question of who decides which farmers get the support.",54
29,Mr BURKE,BILLS," I join Labor members in this House in opposing the bill that's before us and in supporting the second reading amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted to insert the words 'the House declines to give this bill a second reading as it places the government's political interests ahead of the interests of Australia's farmers'. We have a bill before us where we don't know if the person who has moved it is allowed to be a member of this place. We are currently debating a bill which, because it's opposed, will come to a division, and, therefore, the House-now with its eyes wide open, having carried a resolution on Monday-will be voting on legislation where we don't know whether it has been lawfully moved, and the person whom we don't know is lawfully here will turn up when the bells ring to vote on it. This is unprecedented in Australia, completely unprecedented. We have continued to ask the government with respect to bills like this, with respect to who is the sponsor of the bill and with respect to divisions, to follow the practice that has been adopted in the Senate. The practice that has been adopted in the Senate for Senator Canavan is that he has stood aside from his role. He may end up being cleared by the court, and then I expect he will come back. But, in the meantime, he has stood aside and has decided to not participate in votes until the High Court has concluded deliberating on that. We have asked for nothing less in this House. There is nothing that we can do that will stop the government from persisting with what they do today. But I would advise the House that, if we are still in this extraordinary situation in two weeks time, when we come back on 4 September, there will be a motion on the Notice Paper at that point.",57
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The member for Corangamite, on a point of order? Ms Henderson: Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, I would ask that you ask the member to return to the substance of the bill. He's straying too far from the substance of the bill.",57
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,The member for Watson has the call.,57
32,Mr BURKE,BILLS,"If we are still in this situation when we return, there will be a motion on the Notice Paper that would deal with the problem we're facing with the legislation that's in front of us right now. It would simply have the House resolving that, on anything where a division is called, where there is not agreement on both sides of the House-on national security issues, for example, we usually don't have divisions; we get agreement so the House is able to do its business-the decision on how that division is resolved would be deferred until after the Court of Disputed Returns had returned its decision, following its meetings, based on the resolution that we had on 14 August. That would be a way of avoiding what's in front of us right now with this bill. I would rather the government simply did in the House what they would do on this bill in the Senate. The minister there who has been referred to the High Court has stood aside from his ministerial role and won't participate in the vote. The same should be happening here. If that  has not been resolved by the time the House returns in September, then we will have before us a question on the Notice Paper simply asking that all divisions be deferred until the High Court has resolved this matter. I accept and appreciate that there is government business that needs to be done, and I support that. But I don't believe we can be in a situation where bills are being sponsored by somebody where we don't know if he's legally allowed to even be a member of parliament, and, when they come up for resolution, he's turning up for the vote.",57
33,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017, as this bill delivers on our commitment to establish the Regional Investment Corporation. We're establishing the corporation because we recognise the enormous contribution that regional and rural communities make to this nation. Agriculture is playing a more crucial role than ever in this nation's prosperity. The value of Australia's farm production and farm exports is estimated to be breaking records in 2016-17. This is why I believe an investment in our farmers is an investment in our nation's future. For our agricultural sector to reach its full potential, we need strong, resilient farm businesses that can seize opportunities in a competitive and ever-changing environment. We also need to have the right water infrastructure in place, so that agriculture can expand and further increase its productivity. The corporation will support both these goals. The corporation will improve the delivery of the Commonwealth's farm business loans. It will remove the states as the middleman, allowing us to be more responsive in providing loans to farm businesses. We will also be able to deliver a nationally consistent program focused on the needs of Australian farmers. The corporation will be offering a new, expanded farm business loan program. Its loans will give viable farm businesses in hardship a hand-up to take advantage of the opportunities available to diversify and strengthen the markets that they supply. They will also boost farm productivity and cash flow, and provide positive economic and social flow-on effects for regional Australia. The corporation will also administer the government's National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility. Water and water infrastructure are critical to our future prosperity, particularly for agricultural industries and regional areas of Australia. The corporation will provide independent expert advice to the government on water infrastructure projects. The projects funded through the facility will help our agricultural sector achieve its full potential. To conclude, the corporation will make a significant contribution to building stronger and more prosperous rural and regional communities. Its loans will help farm businesses build and maintain diversity in markets they supply and take advantage of new and emerging opportunities across Australia and overseas. It will also help fast-track the construction of priority water infrastructure needed to stimulate investment, economic growth and increased agricultural productivity in rural and regional Australia. Time and time again, this government has proven its commitment to backing our farmers, because we know that agriculture has been and will always be an integral part of our nation's prosperity. I will be introducing amendments shortly, but I certainly commend the bill to the House.",58

35,Mr HARTSUYKER,NOES, I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and I seek leave of the House to move government amendments (1) to (4) together. Leave granted.,62
36,Mr HARTSUYKER,NOES,"I move government amendments (1) to (4) together: (1) Clause 4, page 5 (after line 3), after the definition of start day, insert: vacancy, in relation to the office of a Board member, has a meaning affected by subsection 20(3). (2) Clause 16, page 14 (lines 2 and 3), omit the clause, substitute: 16 Membership The Board consists of: (a) the Chair; and (b) at least 2, and no more than 4, other members. (3) Clause 20, page 15 (after line 23), at the end of the clause, add: (3) For the purposes of a reference in: (a) this Act to a vacancy in the office of a Board member; or (b) the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to a vacancy in the membership of a body; there are taken to be 4 Board member offices in addition to the Chair. (4) Clause 29, page 18 (lines 15 to 17), omit the clause, substitute: 29 Quorum At a meeting of the Board, a quorum is constituted by: (a) at any time when the Board consists of 3 Board members-2 Board members; or (b) in any other case-3 Board members. The government amendments to the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 will increase the corporation's board to between three and five members. The government has considered a range of views, which were raised following the introduction of the bill, on the proposed governance arrangements. This included submissions to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill. For example, in its submission, the National Farmers' Federation discussed the size of the board, suggesting it be  increased to five members. Other submissions also queried the proposed size of the board. These are valid concerns, and we thank interested stakeholders for sharing their views. The bill currently provides for a board of three. This reflects our aim to keep the size of the board modest, given the operating costs of the entity are intended to be offset by the interest charged on its loans. However, we agree that including scope for a slightly larger board will further ensure the government can configure a board with the breadth of skills and experience needed to oversee what are significant Commonwealth investments in farm businesses and water infrastructure. The amendments therefore provide for a range in the board size of between three and five members. This also requires flow-on amendments to clarify the number of board members that constitute a quorum, as well as the circumstances that constitute a vacancy in the office of a board member. The Regional Investment Corporation will make a significant contribution to building stronger and more prosperous rural and regional communities. I commend the amendments to the House.",62
37,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES," I note that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture is not here closing debate on this bill, as one would expect. The opposition makes no complaint about that, because it's consistent with the demands we made on him earlier in the week about removing himself from participation in this House while this dark cloud hangs over the validity of his place here. The opposition will not be opposing these amendments. We still believe this to be very bad policy, designed only to curry favour on a pork-barrelling basis. We see no policy merit in this corporation whatsoever. It's shifting the administration of existing loans-there is no new funding-to a new body, which is going to be created at great expense to the Australian taxpayer. Existing loans will continue to be administered by the states. There is no policy merit in this proposal. The same can be said for the water infrastructure loans, a scheme which I believe is designed to fail. This reflects other schemes like the NAIF, which have 'money on the table', as the Deputy Prime Minister likes to say, but are designed to fail. I don't expect too much of that money to be expended. I'm sure the Treasurer and the finance minister will be more than pleased about that. The amendments being proposed by those opposite are to expand the board. As the assistant minister points out, this is something the NFF picked up in their consideration of the bill. It's certainly something that was also picked up by other submitters to the Senate inquiry into this bill. It's certainly something that was picked up by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The problem, of course, is that this is just one of many flaws in this bill which were picked up by other contributors, including the NFF. I think the NFF raised at least three issues in the Senate inquiry, and the assistant minister went to great lengths to make the point that the NFF had raised this, giving it weight. Well, if he's giving weight to the NFF's concerns on this particular issue-that is, the constitutional size of the board-he should give equal weight to the NFF's concerns about other flaws in this hopeless bill. The flaws in the bill are wide-ranging, but, to keep my contribution as short as I can, they certainly go to the extent to which the minister has designed this bill to avoid parliamentary scrutiny and veto. We have seen this before with respect to the relocation of the APVMA, where he went to extraordinary lengths to make sure that the process for putting that forced relocation in place avoided the scrutiny of this parliament and, therefore, the veto opportunities of this party. That is what's happening with this bill as well. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee went to great lengths to express concern about the extent to which delegation  powers were going to be exercised under the policy proposal in this bill. The assistant minister chooses to express no concern and not to address any of these concerns. Indeed, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee even went on to talk about the constitutionality of this bill and the extent to which the government has gone to validate the constitutionality of this bill, even going to the external affairs power. Think about that. We are going to get a different organisation, at great taxpayers' expense, to administer these loans, and it's so important we've had to invoke the external affairs power to do so, such is the weight of this issue. So, if the assistant minister is going to rely on the NFF's submission and the expression of concerns over the constitution of the board, he should give equal weight to the other concerns raised by the NFF and he should certainly give weight to the concerns of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I have been around this place for a long time, and I have not seen a Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee report that has been so critical of a bill before this parliament. It is very extensive. This is a flawed bill. While we don't oppose the amendments that have been put forward, because they do no harm and they are a minor improvement, the assistant minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have failed to address the very serious flaws in this bill, let alone the fact it is a very bad policy proposal.

42,Mr MARLES,BILLS," I rise to speak about the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2016. As members may be aware, as it stands, pensions, compensation, rehabilitation, treatment and other benefits for veterans, members of the Defence Force and their families are provided for under three separate legislative acts. These are the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. The VEA primarily provides benefits and entitlements for those who undertook service in wartime, certain operational deployment and certain peacetime service between 7 December 1972 and 30 June 2004. For peacetime service eligibility, a member who had not completed a qualifying period of three years service prior to 7 April 1994 is not covered unless they were medically discharged. British nuclear test defence service during the 1950s and 1960s in Australia is also covered when relevant criteria are met. If a veteran suffers an injury or disease arising out of or aggravated by a period of full-time service while covered under the VEA, they may be entitled to a disability pension and medical treatment. They may also be eligible for compensation under the SRCA for the same disability, with offsetting against the pension. The second piece of legislation, the SRCA 1988, provides coverage for illness, injury or death suffered as a result of peacetime and peacekeeping service from 3 January 1949 to 30 June 2004 and for certain periods of operational service between 7 April 1994 and 30 June 2004. Coverage under the SRCA is essentially linked to peacetime ADF service between 3 January 1949 and 30 January 2004, with no coverage of ADF service prior to 3 January 1949 or any period of operational service prior to 7 April 1994. The final piece of legislation, the MRCA, covers members who served on or after 1 July 2004. The MRCA provides rehabilitation and compensation coverage for warlike, non-warlike and peacetime service. The SRCA and the MRCA are more like modern workers compensation legislation, providing rehabilitation and compensation coverage for military service related injuries, illness or death. This legislation proposes to remove all the Defence Force elements from the SRCA and create an exact replica called the DRCA, which applies only to Defence Force members. The creation of this act will also bring all legislation relating to Veterans' Affairs under the responsibility of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs-as it stands, both the VEA and MRCA. However, the SRCA, as it applies to the ADF, is part of a larger act which covers all employees of the Australian government. Consequently, this means that the act sits with the Minister for Employment. When the MRCA took effect, responsibility for determining and managing defence related claims under the SRCA was given to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission by virtue of the addition of part XI of the SRCA. Essentially, while decisions about compensation and rehabilitation fall within the responsibility of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the legislation itself sits with a different minister. The new legislation is designed to fix this.  In addition, the bill makes a number of minor language amendments to the DRCA and amends the SRCA to remove cover for members of the Defence Force and their dependants. The implementation of the DRCA will provide for a complete separation of the legislative framework for defence related claims from the Comcare scheme under the SRCA and will provide the Minister for Veterans' Affairs with responsibility for all three of the separate compensation acts that cover Defence Force members. Given the complexity of the bill, Labor supported the referral of this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to consider the detail of it. The committee received a number of submissions and held a public hearing to work through the concerns of interested parties. The DRCA should be viewed as a snapshot in time, an exact replica of the Defence Force elements of the SRCA as of the day the DRCA is enacted. Given the complexity of the SRCA, which has been amended 68 times since its inception, a considerable amount of effort was concentrated on ensuring that the DRCA was an exact replica of the legislation and that nothing had been inadvertently omitted. An example of this work relates to the functions of Comcare in relation to rehabilitation and acting quickly to minimise the duration and severity of injuries. This was also raised by Senator Lambie during the committee process. On reading the explanatory memorandum and the bill, it would appear that section 69, which deals with Comcare and claims, has not come across to the new bill. While this is correct, section 69 of the SRCA has not applied to veterans since the insertion of section 142 when the Military, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission was created, which then became responsible for compensation claims and rehabilitation. Section 142 has been duplicated in the DRCA and, through a number of other sections in both the DRCA and the MRCA, the commitment to determining claims which include rehabilitation quickly and accurately remains. We are satisfied that the element that currently applies to veterans is maintained under the DRCA. However, Labor encourages the government to consider making the pathway that leads to this conclusion clearer in the future. A number of other technical concerns were raised during this process, and I would like to acknowledge the diligent work of parties to identify areas where the legislation appeared not to have been duplicated across its entirety. Labor has worked through each of these concerns with stakeholders and the government and is confident that the issues raised have been addressed. However, due to the complexity of the legislation, under advice by the Australian Government Solicitor a Henry VIII clause was added to provide a remedy for any unforeseen adverse consequences that may arise from the unique manner in which the DRCA was enacted. The government has been clear that the intention is for the clause not to be utilised; it is there only as a fail-safe, in case something has been overlooked in the process that would have left a veteran worse off. Henry VIII clauses essentially enable the government to make regulations with the power to modify the act, which are then introduced to the parliament as a disallowable instrument. In the DRCA a condition has been added to the Henry VIII clause which requires any regulations made under this provision to act in a way purely beneficial for the veteran in dealing with any anomalies that may arise where there is a retrospective application of the DRCA. This condition states:  (2) Before the Governor General makes regulations under subsection (1), the Minister must be satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to make the regulations to ensure that no person (except the Commonwealth) is disadvantaged by the enactment of this Act. As such, it is clear that in the unlikely event of this clause being utilised it can be only when someone has been made worse off by the creation of the DRCA and only to the benefit of an individual and not the government. This is a very important condition, and it is the reason Labor is in a position to support the inclusion of this clause in the bill. In addition, it is important to note that any regulations brought in under this provision would be a disallowable instrument and be brought before both houses of parliament and sit for 15 days of parliament before coming into operation. While this gives some assurances, concerns have been raised about notification of these instruments. Although they are disallowable instruments, this rests on interested parties becoming aware of the tabling of these documents. Consequently, Labor senators recommended that proposed section 121B be amended to include a consultative element. This amendment would essentially require the minister to be satisfied that appropriate consultation had been undertaken with relevant parties and include disclosure of the proposed regulations. The government has declined to accept this proposal, stating that the intention of the clause is to quickly provide relief to an individual who has been made worse off by the creation of the DRCA. The government argues that the inclusion of a requirement to consult would result in delaying the provision of relief to the individual. It is worth remembering that, in the unlikely event the clause is utilised, there would be an individual veteran who has been made worse off by the creation of this bill, who has had to have this acknowledged by the department and regulations drafted, approved and tabled. To delay them the provision of relief is unfair, particularly given the circumstances that if the DRCA had not been created there would have been no delay and they would have received this assistance immediately. In the event that this clause is utilised, we call on the department to exhaust all avenues to ensure that anyone else who would benefit from the changes is made aware of the regulations. The government has agreed to this at Labor's request and committed to ensuring that everything possible will be done by the department to locate and contact any person who would be affected by a DRCA Henry VIII clause. Labor supports the inclusion of this clause without the requirement to consult prior to making the regulations for one reason only: to ensure there is no delay correcting the issue which has come about due to the creation of the bill and is impacting the veteran. Significant concerns were also raised in relation to the consultation conducted by the department on this and other legislation during the committee process. While the government stated that the development of a standalone act for ADF members and veterans was announced two years ago-with consultation continuing during this period, predominantly with Ex-Service Organisation Round Table members-they conceded that the ex-service round table members were not able to view the bill until it was introduced into parliament last year. However, the president of the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Service Men and Women stated: … the bill was not really brought to ESORT's notice as being a piece of legislation that was due to be passed.  In addition, members of the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations highlighted the lack of resources available to ex-service organisations to assess and analyse proposed legislation in general. Their representative noted that their organisation and its partners are voluntary associations and, as such, have limited access to personal and financial resources. As members may be aware, there have been a number of Senate inquiries into veterans affairs in recent months, along with a high-profile Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel. This has stretched voluntary organisations' capacity to respond to and critically examine new legislation. This was an issue raised by a number of submitters, who were concerned about the speed with which this legislation appeared to be tabled and required feedback. While this legislation may have been broadly discussed some time ago, the evidence provided indicated that consultation was not thorough enough or wide enough to capture ex-service organisations and other interested parties. The issue of widespread consultation was also raised by Mr Brian Briggs of Slater and Gordon, who highlighted that lawyers representing claimants were generally unrepresented in DVA consultation processes on legislative changes. Mr Briggs raised concerns that by: … restricting of consultation to organisations that are higher up in the chain of command such as ESORT and Defence does not paint a holistic picture of the effects of these reforms [and] excludes the opinions of those who are at the heart of the system and those who will be most deeply affected. As such, the committee concluded that there is room for improvement in the way in which DVA consults on changes to legislation and engages with the veteran community. The committee raised concerns about DVA's current consultation and engagement practices in relation to proposed legislative changes, noting that, while this is partly due to the limited resources of ex-service organisations to examine legislation, ultimately it is for the Department of Veterans' Affairs to improve this relationship. This is an issue which is regularly raised by veterans and an area of deep concern. Consultation on these issues is vital not only to capture the lived experiences of those working through the system but also to prevent unnecessary angst or concern. Effective engagement is fundamental and is an area which the department needs to address as soon as possible. The committee also highlighted another issue, which has been raised with me a number of times, which is the adversarial relationship of the Department of Veterans' Affairs with some veterans advocates, veterans advocacy groups and lawyers acting on behalf of veterans. This adversarial culture in the department was something Labor sought to resolve by committing prior to the election to undertaking a first principles review of veterans affairs. This review would be based on a set of agreed upon first principles and would examine the department and seek to rectify administrative governance and process failings to ensure the department is able to meet existing and future challenges in a clear and efficient manner. Most importantly, this review would help to re-establish the veterans and their representative organisations' trust in DVA. It would ensure that we have a system in place which works for the people who need it the most and puts our veterans first. The committee also stated that the Department of Veterans' Affairs should be seeking out and actively engaging with those persons who are best informed and capable of providing analysis of proposed legislation, noting that critical feedback on proposed legislative reforms should be encouraged at an early stage and utilised to identify areas where communications strategies may be required to answer questions in the veteran community.  In addition, the committee noted that, if DVA does not adequately consult and respond to issues raised, it can create environments where misinformation or unwarranted fears regarding legislative reform can flourish. As such, the committee recommended that the Department of Veterans' Affairs conduct a review of its consultation and engagement practices in order to receive informed critical feedback on proposed legislative amendments, rapidly respond to concerns raised in the veteran community and increase the understanding of proposed legislative changes in the veteran community. We understand that the government accepted this recommendation and undertook to review the Department of Veterans' Affairs consultation processes. Labor urges the department to ensure the review is thorough and considers all potential avenues of communication to engage with the ex-service community. While there is benefit in placing information on the website, this cannot be with the width and breadth of consultation. Consideration must be given to both traditional and non-traditional avenues of communication. Labor calls on this review to be completed in a timely fashion and urges the government to take any recommendations seriously and implement changes as soon as practical. This inquiry, along with the recently completed inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel, has clearly highlighted that there is a disconnect between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the ex-service community. The Senate committee process also highlighted the anxiety veterans, interested parties and the ex-service community feel about future changes to the SRCA, particularly with regard to alignment to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. In his second reading speech, the minister described the changes as: … a foundational step towards … reform being undertaken by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to significantly improve services for veterans and their families by re-engineering DVA business processes. This was reiterated by the department in the hearing process, by a representative who stated that bringing the policy control over the three acts under the one minister will: … give him opportunities to start examining streamlining, simplification and alignment of legislation. While it was made clear these areas for alignment are at an embryonic stage, significant concern has been raised by respondents. It is generally acknowledged that legislation in this space is complex, with each act operating slightly differently. There is a desire in the ex-service community to see this process made easier for veterans and their advocates to navigate. This desire is equally measured by concern that, with the harmonisation of the provisions, the lowest common denominator will become the standard. DVA did indicate: … there will be appropriate consultation with the veteran and Defence communities on any areas of potential alignment between the DRCA and the MRCA. While this assurance is certainly welcomed, how this consultation is undertaken continues to raise questions. Broad consultation is important to ensure that veterans and their advocates are aware of proposed changes and are able to provide detailed feedback. Feedback by those who work within the system or benefit from the system is vital to ensure that changes are necessary and worthwhile. Labor senators continue to hold concerns about future alignment of legislation and urge the minister to clarify the details of the proposed reforms to provide certainty to ADF members and veterans. We concur with this request. Labor is supportive of changes that make it easier  for veterans to navigate the system; however, not at the expense of entitlements and support structures. Labor will continue to watch this space to ensure veterans are not made worse off for the changes. The purpose of the DRCA is to create a Defence-specific bill which applies only to members of the Defence Force and their dependants. In addition, it will place all current veterans legislation with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It is reasonable that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs should be responsible for matters regarding veterans. As the DRCA is an exact replica of the elements of the SRCA, we have been assured no veterans or Defence Force members will be worse off for the creation of this bill. Labor would like to thank the committee for its diligent examination of this legislation and acknowledge the feedback provided by the ex-service community and other interested parties, in particular the Hervey Bay Veterans Advice and Social Centre, the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations and Brian Briggs from Slater and Gordon, as well as the representations made by members of the public. Labor would also like to thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Veterans' Affairs for their assistance with this legislation and their willingness to work through any issues. Given their assurances that no veterans will be worse off for these changes, Labor offer our support to this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.",65
43,Ms SWANSON,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2016. I'm pleased that the government has committed to improving services for veterans and their families by providing a military-specific compensation scheme. I accept and applaud the government's statement that eligibility and benefits under the standalone Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2016 will be the same as those under the current act available to serving and former members of the Australian Defence Force. In general terms, the new bill strips all Defence-Force-specific legislation from the existing SRCA to create the DRCA. The DRCA will cover only Defence Force members and their families and will apply specifically in relation to injury, death, disease, loss or damage that relates to certain employment in the Defence Force-in other words, military-specific compensation and rehabilitation schemes. This is entirely appropriate and affords our service people the tailored service and respect they deserve. Labor does have some concerns with the bill, as pointed out by the shadow minister for defence, the member for Corio. One of them is the proposed Henry VIII clause. The government argues that this is being inserted into the act as a safeguard to ensure no-one is worse off. That may well be, but I believe that any regulations introduced in this manner should be subject to rigorous scrutiny. If the normal parliamentary process is removed, we must ensure that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs consults with relevant ex-service organisations and the veteran community before introducing changes, and releases the full text of any proposed regulations subject to the clause for public scrutiny. But, overall, I'm greatly heartened to see the welfare of our Defence personnel, both active and non-active, brought front and centre. In my electorate of Paterson, we've heard many concerns from veteran communities regarding their experiences engaging with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This organisation should exist specifically to support those who have served our country at home  and abroad, at war and at peace; those who have spent time separated from their loved ones and support networks, who have missed the birth of children or who have been absent during significant family milestones; those who have been unable to be part of their families' lives to the degree that you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, take for granted. In addition to the separation from their support network, many of our Defence personnel will experience and witness things that injure them mentally and, in some cases, affect them for the rest of their lives. The DVA exists to support these people and their families, yet time and time again my office hears from veterans who, once they leave active service, feel the gate is shut behind them. Their dealings with DVA leave them feeling broken, unwanted, unimportant. We must ensure we consider the way interactions with DVA can impact on our veterans, making them question the value that our nation places on their service and enormous contributions. Even with the government's new legislation in place, I fear that the reform of the Department of Veterans' Affairs does not go far enough. The government has chosen to allocate 85 per cent of the funding in the budget for the next financial year. A great portion of this will, no doubt, be devoted to the department's ageing and inefficient computer systems. In Labor's opinion this is simply not a whole or holistic solution to a complex and pervading issue. Prior to the last election Labor threw its support behind a first principles review of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I truly believe it is still desperately needed. This review was intended, first and foremost, to help re-establish veterans' trust in DVA. It is that trust that is so critical-knowing that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is truly working and advocating for veterans. This, I believe, is the best response to grave concerns-concerns that veterans feel the need to fight to have their claims recognised, are being made to feel like malingerers, believe that they're being perceived as broken or terminally damaged, or are finding that the process of seeking compensation is inherently humiliating and that this dehumanising process greatly exacerbates existing mental health issues. In the business world it's widely accepted that the greatest cause of lost-time injuries is depression, caused by a loss of routine, a breakdown of social networks or a loss of the sense of self and of self-esteem. This can be a by-product of the isolation caused by injury or illness. To borrow from the civilian workforce: it's not a broken leg that sends Bob the Builder into a spiral of depression or makes him anxious and unable to engage with friends and colleagues; it's being unable to operate as he once did, disenfranchised from that which defines his professional competence, and feeling disconnected from workmates. By the time the leg heals, the heart and mind are injured. Our veterans experience this, amplified, and for those with an existing mental health issue it is so much more fraught-because being part of the ADF is not a job; it's a vocation, a life choice and, very importantly, a creed. I had a glimpse into the microcosm that is the world of Australian Defence Force personnel when I recently took part in the week-long ADF Parliamentary Program at the RAAF Base Williamtown. I was the on-base residential guest of base commander Air Commodore Craig Heap. I ate and slept on base, wore the uniform and was given access to the people, experiences and technologies that keep Australia safe. While this in itself was fascinating and inspiring-and I did get to fly a Hornet-I found there was a whole culture within the base: a whole family, if you will. I found a lot of good people, many of whom are quite young, cooperating to work as a team on very complex ideas and on solving problems. I found a  cohort that carried with them an overwhelming sense of service to their country that went far deeper than the uniform they donned every morning. I found a community that supported one another through the migratory nature of the role and its impact on their families. I found a place where many felt they were home, even though they'd inhabited many different addresses. Choosing to serve in the ADF is, for many, the only constant in a world of change and sometimes stress, fear and threat. When that world disappears, particularly when the separation is involuntary, through injury or incapacity, it is a huge shock. The one gateway back into this world is, for many, the DVA, but sadly, when they knock on the door, many of our veterans find that they are no longer part of that Defence family. Somehow, they've become the enemy. They're no longer part of the Defence community, no longer part of the team. In many cases, they are forced to relinquish their homes and stripped of their jobstheir means of financial independence and, for many, a defining factor in having a sense of competence, achievement and contribution. This can be incredibly traumatic, even for those lucky enough to have escaped physical or mental injury during service. I've been contacted by veterans in the electorate of Paterson asking for help navigating the transition to civilian life which is neither seamless nor well supported. The issues they raise are varied, but they all boil down, really, to the same theme. When personnel leave the Defence Force, the gate to the base shuts behind them and it stays shut, never to be opened again. We must find a way to help our personnel transition from the ADF to civilian life, especially if it was not their choice to leave. So, while I believe that the government's DRCA safety, rehabilitation and compensation legislation bill is a positive step in the right direction, there is, we all know, a great deal more to be done for those who have served our nation so valiantly.",70
44,Mr HAMMOND,BILLS," I'm delighted to rise to speak in support of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2016. It is one of those areas that doesn't often get a lot of headline attention, and it is often overshadowed by a lot of other things, both in this place and the community more generally. But I say as someone who, over many years-16 years before coming to this place-has worked in this area of compensation for those who have been injured through no fault of their own, that we are dealing with really, really important legislation here. The mechanisms proposed in this bill separate the Defence Force compensation from the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which is a pragmatic, sensible and effective move that one hopes will have the ultimate aim of making it easier for injured veterans and injured workers to navigate what can be a very complicated system in relation to seeking compensation simply to put them back in the position they were in before they suffered their injury. Safety, rehabilitation and compensation legislation has some history, and it is a history worth touching on, albeit only briefly, because it demonstrates how important it is to get the balance right: to make sure that workers spend their time having appropriate treatment and rehabilitation and receive compensation whilst they are injured, and to make sure that, whether it is an injury through no fault of their own or the injury has occurred as a result of the negligence of an employer, there is an appropriate level of recourse available through the act insofar as that remedy is concerned.  The reason why a no-fault scheme is fundamentally important-and the reason why this legislation is fundamentally important-is that, if one is injured in the course of one's employment or in the course of one's service to our nation, what we don't want from our community and what we don't want from our governments is a situation where, in navigating the path just to try to be in the position you were in before the incident or injury occurred, that path adds stress and complication to what is already a very stressful time and circumstance. The introduction of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 1988 achieved that goal. It gave injured workers and injured service people-and injured sailors, for that matter; merchant seamen and the like, through an equivalent piece of legislation, the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act-the ability to make a claim once they had been injured and to be paid compensation and offered rehabilitation upon proof of causal connection to the injury, not necessarily upon proof of negligence. That's important, because we do want to keep these cases out of the courts and we do want to focus on a return to work for these injured workers and a return to service for these injured service personnel as quickly and as practicably possible. That is what this act does, and it is important to make sure that we keep amending this legislation so as to properly reflect the concerns of the community. There were holes in the legislation, going all the way back to 1988. For me, one of those seminal moments in one's career before coming to this place involved this legislation and this terrific fellow whose name was Stephen Smith, funnily enough. An honourable member: Great name!",72
45,Mr HAMMOND,BILLS,"Not my predecessor who walked the halls of this place for some 20 years but another Stephen Smith, a merchant seaman. He was trying to move an electric generator across the deck of a ship just off the Port of Sakai in Japan and horribly injured his back in a circumstance in which one could not necessarily say that there was negligence but there was a failure of a safe system of work, as it ultimately transpired. It was a circumstance in which that Stephen Smith could have otherwise made a claim of negligence against his employer for a lump sum of compensation. But the act was changed back in those times in order to implement the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and replace those common law rights. So, all of a sudden Stephen Smith couldn't go down that track of a common law claim and had to access compensation under this act. The problem was that the act did not transfer upon him the same rights he would have had if he'd brought a common law claim of negligence against his employer. That was an acquisition of property on other than just terms. I don't know whether many of my colleagues here remember that fantastic Australian movie The Castle. One can't forget The Castle. You'll be pleased to know that Mr Smith came to see me and my firm at that time and said, 'I'd like to make a claim, because the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act is denying me my right to bring a common law claim', and I said, 'Tell 'em they're dreamin'!' And we sued the Commonwealth and the Australian National Line under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution-the precise same provision through which the Kerrigans sought compensation in the famous movie. Mr Husic interjecting",73
46,Mr HAMMOND,BILLS,"Well, that's another story; I'd need an extension of time to talk about that! But I'll tell you what we did. The claim was lodged in the Supreme Court, and Mr Smith lost. It was appealed to the Court of Appeal in Western Australia, and Mr Smith lost, 2-1. We then made an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court, and Mr Smith was successful in that appeal. So there we were, just down the road, in court No. 1, and I tell you what: you've never in your entire life met a junior lawyer looking and feeling more like Dennis Denuto than I did! There I was, shivering and quaking, looking up at the seven Supreme Court justices. Peter Hanks QC, as he then was, was eloquently making submissions as to why, under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, Mr Smith had his common law claim taken away on other than just terms. Well, I tell you what: I passed a few notes, I asked Mr Hanks if he wanted a glass of water, it all went swimmingly and three months later a judgement was handed down from the High Court in which Mr Smith was successful, 5-2. Mr Smith had his day in court. We argued a couple of fairly technical arguments. We didn't argue Mabo, but what we argued got Mr Smith a historic common law claim in a circumstance in which-just as for the Kerriganswithout pushing all the way through he would not have managed to receive the compensation to which he was entitled. That really was a great moment in time. You'll note in this legislation that there is a clause commonly known as a Henry VIII clause. The reason these clauses can be important, provided that they are drafted in the right way, is that in circumstances like Mr Smith's, where property is taken away on other than just terms, we can ensure that no-one will be worse off. Sometimes there are unintended consequences, and sometimes there are people who don't have the tenacity of Mr Smith to spend eight years of his life in litigation just to have his day in court and make sure that they are properly compensated. That is also why I'm pleased to speak in support of this legislation to make sure that there are mechanisms in play to ensure that there are no unintended consequences of the bill. I'd like to use the time. I have remaining, before we move on to other matters, to pay tribute to all those hard working service men and women who commit so much of their lives to keeping us safe. It's only appropriate that we bend over backwards to make sure they are compensated in the unfortunate circumstance of being injured. We're very grateful for their service.",74
47,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour-the member for Perth may continue the sequel of his fascinating tale at that time! NA Eid al-Adha,74
48,Mr BURKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In the coming weeks between the House rising but before we return, Muslims in Australia and around the world will celebrate Eid al-Adha. Eid al-Adha commemorates the sacrifices and triumphs of the prophet Abraham. Eid al-Adha also marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage for millions of Muslims who make that pilgrimage to Mecca each year. Celebrations begin with morning prayers at the mosque, followed by a traditional sermon by the imam. Families, friends and communities gather to share greetings, gifts and meals and reflect on the lessons of sacrifice,  compassion and unity that are at the centre of the story of Abraham's life and shared by all of the word's Abrahamic faiths. The feast of sacrifice serves as a reminder of how communities, nations and countries can unite in forgiveness, compassion and peace under one shared value: the willingness to make a sacrifice. We are grateful for the contributions that Australian Muslims have made to the social, economic and political fabric of our nation and to this House. Modern multicultural Australia thrives when we, as a nation, celebrate diverse cultures, faiths and backgrounds. On behalf of Labor, I would like to wish Australian Muslims a wonderful and prosperous feast of celebration, and to those on the annual Hajj pilgrimage, we wish you a safe journey, a fulfilling experience and a safe return. Eid Mubarak. Mackellar Electorate: Fight on the Beaches",74
49,Mr FALINSKI,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," If I were to say to you that we shall fight them on the beaches, most people would think of Churchill exhorting his fellow countrymen to push back against the darkness and, in some ways, I would be talking about something similar. Only the beach I refer to is on the northern part of Sydney, a community which I am privileged to represent, and the fight which I speak of is against the darkness of cancer. Not more than a month ago, I had the honour of attending the Fight on the Beaches ball, dedicated to raising funds for critical research into a cure for breast cancer. The health minister, Greg Hunt, has said in this House, over and over again, that Australia is one of the world's leading medical researchers and that this activity is set to double in the next five years. But, as the 2017 executive committee of Fight on the Beaches, Michelle Heaton-Armstrong, Meghann Parker, Rebecca Coulson, Ali Warman, Rachel Sadler, Kelly Evans and Danielle Hobbs, can all tell you, these things do not just happen. We have to make them happen. In three short years, this committee has raised over $800,000 for research into cancer. On behalf of the grateful community, we thank all of you for giving up your time and money to make this happen. You have touched so many lives, some of whom you will never know or hear from. The research you have funded is and will make a difference to those people who suffer a cancer diagnosis and their friends and families. No matter what others may claim, none of that would have happened without you. (Time expired) Lyons Electorate: Old Mates Day Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (13:33): In late July, I had the pleasure of attending Old Mates Day at the Bream Creek Showgrounds in the southern part of my electorate. Old Mates Day is the brainchild of Sorrel farmer Terry White-no relation to the chemist chain, unfortunately for Terry-and it came about because, in 2014, the Bridgewater saleyards closed after serving the farmers of southern Tasmania for almost 40 years. Saleyards are a vital place of rural commerce, but they also offer a place for regional people to catch up and have a chat. What people realised after the closure of the saleyards was that that wasn't happening any more. People were going back home, and they were having social isolation. They weren't staying in touch. Terry is not a psychologist. He is not a social worker. He's just a local bloke who figured he could make a difference. Last year, he organised the first Old Mates Day in a shed on his property. And there was a magnificent turnout. People have been asking all year when the  next one is. Well, that was a few weeks ago. And it was fantastic. So many people turned out to help-the Lions and rotary clubs of the region, the Bream Creek Show Committee, local butchers, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, Bendigo Bank, Tasmanian Fire Service, Roberts, Rural Alive and Well and so many individuals who I won't name for fear of leaving somebody out. This was Terry White's brainchild. It would not have happened without him. He reckons he's done now, and he reckons he's not going to do it next year. Time will tell. I think people like him don't know when to give up. Boothby Electorate: Roads to Recovery Program",75
50,Ms FLINT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I am delighted that my community in my electorate of Boothby will benefit from almost $2 million in Roads to Recovery funding to build and maintain local roads to create better access for residents. Roads to Recovery is a common sense program that takes the bureaucracy out of road funding, putting decision making in the hands of local government so resources are directed to where they're needed the most. The City of Holdfast Bay, which takes in some of Adelaide's best coastline, will receive $226,000 for two projects in Seacliff and Seacliff Park to reconstruct kerbs and reseal asphalt. The City of Marion, in the heart of Boothby, will receive $312,000 for three resurfacing and rehabilitation works in Warradale, Seacombe Gardens and Mitchell Park. The leafy City of Mitcham, nestled at the base of the Mitcham hills, is receiving $1.3 million for roadworks in Clapham, Lower Mitcham and Daw Park. This funding is so important to us in South Australia because the dysfunctional Weatherill Labor government has a road maintenance backlog of $1 billion. That is right: $1 billion. State Labor can't balance a budget. They have destroyed our state's finances. Therefore, it is once again the responsibility of the federal Liberal government to fix local problems. The Roads to Recovery funding will assist the cities of Holdfast Bay, Marion and Mitcham to do just that. Calwell Electorate: Coolaroo South Primary School and Kindergarten Writers' Festival",76
51,Ms VAMVAKINOU,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to talk about a wonderful event that was held in my electorate on Tuesday. It was the launch of the 2017 Writers' Festival held at Coolaroo South Primary School and Kindergarten. The theme for this year's festival was: memoirs and snapshots of life. As always, our local students didn't fail to deliver some glorious and creative stories of their favourite memories. Now in its ninth year, the Writers' Festival is an inspiring way to encourage our young students to use their imagination to create and to tell their story whilst exploring the craft of writing. The stories currently displayed on the corridor walls of the school are as varied as the students themselves. Coolaroo South Primary School and Kindergarten Principal, Karen Nicholls, and staff do an exemplary job in engaging students and their families to come together to share, learn and grow. They have created a place of social inclusion, supporting the school's families through their children's education. Author Caroline van de Pol, who launched her book Back to Broady last week, was the guest speaker at the Writers' Festival launch. She spoke to the children about growing up in  Broadmeadows and the surrounding suburbs. At the launch, she encouraged the children to always follow their passions and their dreams. I want to congratulate Coolaroo South Primary School and Kindergarten and all the award winners on that day. I also want to give my apologies for not being able to attend this year's Writers' Festival. I was in Canberra here in parliament, but I have attended in the past, and I am so hopeful when I read those stories. Murray Darling Medical School",76
52,Mr GEE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Everyone in country Australia knows that there is a chronic shortage of doctors in the bush. Despite well-intentioned efforts and a king's ransom in taxpayer funding, the current system of medical training has not been able to solve this inequity that country communities have been highlighting for many years now. Presently, less than 10 per cent of medical students trained in the big city universities go on to practise medicine in the country. The Murray Darling Medical School aims to fix this problem by training doctors in the bush for practice in the bush. Planning for the Murray Darling Medical School continues at a rapid pace. Next week, the Murray Darling Medical School will be calling for expressions of interest from students, staff and suppliers for this game-changing new medical school. This will be welcome news for the communities of the Murray-Darling region. A recently released report prepared by PPB Advisory showed that the Murray Darling Medical School would bring around $2 billion in additional economic benefits to the Murray-Darling region. PPB Advisory has also found that Murray Darling Medical School graduates would be four times more likely to practise medicine in the regions and that the doctor shortage in country Australia would be alleviated by the Murray Darling Medical School producing 90 new doctors a year. The Murray Darling Medical School continues to gain huge support. I have here a letter from Fiona Simpson, President of the National Farmers' Federation, who supports the Murray Darling Medical School. I have a drawer full of testimonials just like that. The time for the Murray Darling Medical School has come. The communities of the bush are united in the push for this game-changing new medical school. Melbourne Accelerator Program",77
53,Mr HUSIC,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In this place, it's great to recognise the great work of others, especially next generation trailblazers like Rohan Workman. Roh, who's been an ambassador and supporter of Australia's start-up scene, is moving onto new things from his post as a Director of the Melbourne Accelerator Program at the University of Melbourne. When he started MAP in 2012, it was the first university based accelerator program in the country providing support to new and emerging firms. In a short time, it did amazing things. In 2015, UBI Global ranked MAP as the eighth best program of its kind in the world. Huge. By last year, it had already entered into a strategic partnership with Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Centre-a great reflection on them. Also, about 11,000 people are going through MAP programs and activities. A lot of promising new firms have gone through the program, and it will be exciting to see them grow. A few weeks ago, I went to their MAP entrepreneurs gala-800 people. I have been to every single one of these dinners. Every year it grows. Eight hundred people turning up is a huge reflection of their belief in MAP.  While Rohan's beard game is not as strong as mine, his contribution to Australia's start-up scene is very, very strong. I might have been sad to hear he was leaving, but I am excited to see where he is going to turn up. I want to say: 'Congratulations. Well done. You are doing great things for the new firms and new jobs of the future.' Moore Electorate: Tourism",77
54,Mr GOODENOUGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I thank the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment for recently visiting Hillarys Boat Harbour, where he attended a forum of leading tourism representatives, including from Sightseeing Pass Australia, AQWA, Willie Creek Pearls, Quality Resort Sorrento Beach and the City of Joondalup. Tourism is a key economic driver, generating 109,000 jobs and injecting $11.9 billion into the Western Australian economy by gross state product. We discussed ways to promote the greater city of Joondalup as a tourist attraction with its two marinas, golf course, shopping centres and beaches. High on the agenda were the cost of airline flights, the availability of accommodation, ease of obtaining inward tourist visas, and destination marketing campaigns. There was discussion around the new direct flights between Perth and London, ways to attract eastern states visitors to utilise Perth as a stopover hub on their way to Europe and Asia, ways to capitalise on the growth of the cruise ship sector and how to promote Hillarys as the gateway to Rottnest Island. The federal government has invested heavily in upgrading the Reid and Tonkin highways to provide an efficient, direct route between Perth Airport and the Moore electorate for inward-bound tourists. Turnbull Government",78
55,Mr HILL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This morning I had that rarest of gifts in this place. The shortest commodity we have of course is time, and I had a spare hour. So I spent that hour catching up on constituent matters. There is a pile of committee work I could have done, but I thought it was important to remember this place is not the real world and to connect with it. So I made about a dozen calls to constituents that had built up over the last couple of weeks. As someone who does respect and love this institution and its role, it was embarrassing to hear what people in my electorate thought of us after a fortnight of nonsense. If you had asked me last Friday, 'Could the government have had a worse week after the nonsense of last week, with the $122 million household postal opinion survey?', I would have said, 'Nah, it's impossible.' But, sure enough, we have the Deputy Prime Minister, who turns out to be a foreign citizen-but that's not a problem in Turnbull-land-and then the conspiracy that this somehow is our fault. I am still waiting to see if the Hansard does in fact minute the Foreign Minister's look as magnum or blue steel. It was a delightful, conservative older woman who summed it up best for me when she said, 'Look, I'd probably prefer there was a different word to 'marriage', but, for goodness sake, would you just get on and resolve it. Vote for it. Spend $122 million on something. Fix the energy prices. Invest something in domestic violence. Invest something in fixing Centrelink wait times, because I'm recovering from cancer and can't spend all day on the phone.' What a joke! (Time expired) Murray Electorate",78
56,Mr DRUM,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to start off by congratulating one of my staff on the safe arrival of her new son, Luca. Luca was born last Monday. He arrived about one month early and both Luca and Alison Foscholo, my chief of  staff, are doing well. Alison has been instrumental in setting up my office since my election last year. While she's on maternity leave, the office is obviously missing her, but we are also very excited for her and her husband, Andrew, on the arrival of their new son. I would also like to congratulate the City of Greater Shepparton, who last month launched the Shepparton Sports Hall of Fame. There are 27 inaugural inductees into the hall of fame. One of them is in fact Mr Michael Dobbie, who works for the office of Darren Chester in the Infrastructure and Transport portfolio. Michael competed as a professional wheelchair athlete, and the highlight of his career was representing Australia at the 2008 Paralympics in the wheelchair tennis event. Another inductee into the hall of fame was Mooroopna bowler, lawn bowler Clarice Power. Clarice competed in the 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games in lawn bowls, where she narrowly missed out on a gold medal, with the event being pushed back due to serious rain delays. They were beaten by the Welsh team. Also this week the Loddon Murray Community Leadership Program met with parliamentarians, learning what it takes to be a community leader. I want to acknowledge the member for Mallee, Andrew Broad, for the work he did with his leadership group. I wish all those taking leadership programs all the best. (Time expired) Greenwood College: Year 8 Debating Team",78
57,Dr ALY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Congratulations to Greenwood College year 8 debating teamCyrene Almodovar, Asmaa Hameed, Konrad Dumpleton, Jacquie Walters, Ann Cao and their teacher Ela Amor Robertson-for making the grand finals of Western Australia's school debating competition. The debating team is a true reflection of our multicultural society. Around 40 per cent of students at Greenwood College have a language background other than English and the school has an EALD program. It was the students who came up with the idea of setting up a debating team to improve their language skills. An ABC report featured Asmaa Hameed, who only knew a few words of English when her family arrived in Perth from Iraq. In just over two years, she is now part of a team that is winning debates against some of Perth's most elite teams. Cyrene Almodovar, the team's lead speaker, said, 'There is a lot that we bring to the table in terms of how we view the world and different views.' I spoke to their teacher on Tuesday morning, and the team had a debate on Tuesday night against PLC, debating a very topical issue: whether or not employees should hire or fire people based on their social media posts. I was so happy this morning to learn that the team won, achieving their ninth consecutive win, which puts them into the grand finals. I am really looking forward to meeting them on Tuesday, and I'm sure I will be as inspired by them as their teachers and their classmates are. Congratulations Asmaa, Cyrene, Jacquie, Ann and Konrad. Energy",79
58,Ms HENDERSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Energy security is one of the top priorities of the Turnbull government. That's why we're taking such strong action to drive down the cost of electricity and gas. This includes tough new regulations to give domestic gas customers priority access to supply before it's exported; stopping energy companies gaming the system, restricting their right of appeal; and encouraging innovation and new technology, including the development of the game-changing Snowy Hydro 2.0. Forty-nine of the 50 recommendations of the Finkel report have been accepted, including ensuring that intermittent  renewable energy installations must have backup base load power and ensuring that power stations give at least three years notice before closing down. The sudden closure of Hazelwood in Victoria, forced by Premier Daniel Andrews, has robbed Victoria of 20 per cent of its power supply and dramatically forced up prices. Our government has now announced more measures to hold energy retailers to account to stop them ripping off Australian consumers. This includes contacting all customers who are on expired discounts so that customers will be told of a better deal and developing proper plainEnglish fact sheets. What do we see from Labor in contrast? A dangerous mix of policies that will hit energy affordability and security, including an emissions intensity scheme and no energy security plan. (Time expired) Marsden State High School",79
59,Dr CHALMERS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Cameron Smith, Tautau Moga, Chris Sandow and Antonio Winterstein all have one thing in common: they are all graduates of Marsden State High School in my electorate. I wanted to give a parliamentary shout-out to that great school today, because on Wednesday I will be going along to Redcliffe Dolphins to watch them play in the grand final of the Queensland schoolboys competition against Keebra Park. I want to congratulate my mate Andrew Peach, the principal of that school, and also the coach Joe O'Callaghan and the players and all the students, who have been doing such a terrific job. I also wanted to alert the House to something even more special which is happening at Marsden State High School, and that is a program called MTC, which stands for Mates Talk Change. It is a mental health program that the Rugby League guys started but all the students participate in. It is led by Megan Mulcahy, a really inspirational teacher. The kids get together and they talk about their mental health and they raise awareness. They have a slogan, which is, 'It ain't weak to speak.' It ain't weak to speak about your mental health. It is fantastic. It's a great thing that they do. On Wednesday they will win the Queensland schoolboys comp. I am prepared to say here that they will win. But, even if they don't, even if by a freak of nature this amazing open boys team does not win on Wednesday against Keebra Park, the Mates Talk Change program will stand as a real tribute to a great school in the best local rugby league community on the planet. Stillhard, Mr Marc",80
60,Mr HOGAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Marc Stillhard is 16 years old. Marc lives in Yamba. Marc was born with Down syndrome. Marc likes to play team sport. He plays soccer, or football, for Yamba. He plays as a 12th man on the field. All teams in the competition are asked if they are okay that Marc play as an extra man. Someone recently complained about this-an individual, not a team. Football North Coast have been placed in a difficult situation because Marc playing as a 12th man is technically against the rules. I acknowledge the Westlawn Tigers, who have said they would be happy if Marc took the field this weekend. Sport is more than about winning and losing. Sport is more than the skills you learn, the friendships you make or the teamwork that you experience. Sport teaches us lessons about life. Yamba are lucky to have Marc Stillhard in their club. The competition is blessed to have him compete. I acknowledge Marc's mum, Enid, who like all mums has encouraged her child since the day he was born. I acknowledge all Marc's family and every parent, every player and every coach who has made it possible for Marc to play football up to now. Marc, I hope you  are allowed by Football North Coast to take the field this weekend to celebrate more than football-to celebrate life. Turnbull Government Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) (13:51): I don't think I'm going to give anything away or break any confidences if I say that this has not been a good week for the government! It's not been a good week for the government. We've got a Deputy Prime Minister who normally has a lot to say who's gone missing. He's become more than a little bit sheepish because he's discovered that he's one part Silver Fern and one part Wallaby. If that wasn't bad enough, we have the foreign minister. Anybody watching question time over the last couple of days will have seen that the foreign minister is just one step away from seeing Martians in her kitchen! We've got a former small business minister who appears to have been on the payroll as a lobbyist to lobby himself. Is it any wonder we have backbenchers who are falling over themselves to brief journalists about the woeful tactics that are on display? So my plea to the government is this: can you please spend the next two weeks getting your house in order. I say to the Prime Minister in particular: can I ask you to get the NBN mess that you have created sorted out. Get the NBN mess sorted out, because back home there are people who are sick of taking a day off from work to get a technician into turn on the NBN who doesn't turn up. They are sick of paying for services that they aren't getting and they are sick of playing NBN ping-pong. Spend the next two weeks getting your house in order. Dolphin Stadium",80
61,Mr HOWARTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," When I went to see then Prime Minister Tony Abbott in 2015, I had a pile of petitions under my arm, my cap in hand and one thing on my mind-'Get this stadium across the line.' I was suitably stroppy that just a few weeks earlier the budget had failed to make available funding to build Dolphin Stadium. Sure, we were after a fair bit of coin-$6 million, in fact-but this was an important project that would deliver in spades for the extended Dolphins family, from under-7s to rep players, the board's administrative team, families, supporters and volunteers. But it would also create jobs and fuel community regeneration. I must've been peeved enough because the PM did get on board, and the stadium has since gone on to be built and draw enormous crowds at a range of events. Most recently in football, Peninsula Power played Melbourne City in an FFA match. Also, the schoolboys rugby league football comp that the member opposite just spoke about is being played there, as well as Indigenous carnivals. I am extremely pleased to announce to the House that the Rugby League International Federation has chosen the Redcliffe Dolphins as the venue for the 2015 Rugby League Commonwealth Championship. The event will be held in February and draws together Commonwealth nations in a nine-a-side competition involving 10 teams. It is fantastic news and part of greater success for Dolphin Stadium. Energy Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (13:55): I stand in this place today to express my anger at this government's complete neglect regarding rising electricity prices, particularly in regional, rural and remote areas of Queensland. What a complete and utter joke the latest solution to rising energy prices is, as delivered in this place by an out-of-touch PM and his out-of-touch government. The Turnbull government's solution is a complete slap in the face for the  community of Herbert. What kind of a solution is a pamphlet? In what parallel universe does the PM think that a pamphlet advising consumers they can get a better electricity price from another provider is a real solution, especially when you don't have another power provider? I challenge the PM to come to Townsville with that solution and talk with the pensioners, the small business owners and the families who are struggling to pay their power bills. I challenge you to hand-deliver every constituent in Herbert a pamphlet and see just how overjoyed they are with your new solution. I challenge you to hand your pamphlet to Now Office Furniture, where local owners are having to turn off their air conditioning throughout part of the day because they cannot afford the price of electricity. I say to the PM and this government: how would you cope trying to run a business in the heat and humidity that Townsville experiences? If real solutions had been created, if a real plan had been developed and if real answers for the north had been proposed, I would have rolled out the red carpet for you, but you just haven't delivered. (Time expired) Swan-Canning River Recovery Program",81
62,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Just before we came back to Canberra, I had the privilege of welcoming the Minister for the Environment and Energy to my electorate of Swan to join me in announcing that the Turnbull government provided $1.1 million to deliver stage 2 of the Swan-Canning River Recovery Program as part of our election commitments. The wild weather didn't stop us. We met at the Canning River Eco Education Centre, along with representatives from environmental and community groups, including the Canning River Regional Park Volunteers, the Wilson Wetlands Action Group and the Swan River Guardians, all of whom played a large role in the success of stage 1 of the program. It was a great opportunity for the minister to meet with some of our hard working volunteers. I would like to thank those who attended. Funding for stage 2 of the Swan-Canning River recovery project will help to build on the important work undertaken during stage 1, which the Turnbull government also proudly supported with $1 million of funding. Stage 2 will continue to rehabilitate the iconic river system by addressing the damaging impacts of weeds on our wetlands, including eradicating the hydrocotyle weed from priority sites. I would like to make a special mention of the Perth NRM's Abi Smalley and CEO Lisa Potter for their continued commitment to the project. I look forward to working with you throughout stage 2. I would like to reiterate that it was the Turnbull government and only the Turnbull government that has committed any environmental funding in Swan in the last 10 years. Minister for Foreign Affairs",82
63,Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I am accustomed to kids getting caught and making the error of doubling down. I have even seen best mates go into bat for their mates to get their detention softened, make some excuses and see if they can get something overturned. But nothing prepared me for this week in the federal parliament. James Campbell put together an article today in the Herald Sun, and I think it best sums up the situation. It says some great things: ONE of the great mysteries of Australian politics in recent years has been the survival of the beliefamong people who should know better-that Julie Bishopthat is, the Foreign Minister might be up to the job of Prime Minister. He goes on: Everyone in politics has their bad weeks. But Bishop'sthat is, the Foreign Minister'sperformance over the past few days has been look-away awful. She, he said: … has demonstrated this week that even a Rolls-Royce can be wrapped around a tree if the driver doesn't know what they are doing. To be fair to Bishop, it wasn't her fault that the National Party, like the Greens, appears to have no processes in place to make sure its parliamentarians aren't unknowingly citizens of a foreign power. … … … But her attack on the New Zealand Labour Party … was all her own work. … … … For her to stare at the cameras with a straight face(Time expired) Clean Energy Finance Corporation Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (13:59): Normally when taxpayers' money is being spent in one's electorate, we come into this chamber and like to boast about it. However, today I'd like to do the opposite: I would like to voice my objection on behalf of my electorate that a taxpayer funded body, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, is loaning $150 million to the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal Project. Firstly, the mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is 'to drive investment'; however, this $150 million does not drive investment. This project was long planned, it was announced to the market on 4 June 2015, and it would've happened irrespective of this additional funding. Secondly, this use of taxpayers' funds will increase particulate matter air pollution in Western Sydney, where we already have levels above those recommended by the World Health Organization. One study shows that distributing goods from Moorebank as opposed to the superior, centrally located areas of Wetherill Park or Eastern Creek will increase transportation costs by seven per cent. That's more trucks on the road, not less. Thirdly, it may come as news to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation that the shift from road to rail results in containers being moved by dirty diesel locomotive engines through our populated areas of Sydney, adding to real pollution, not decreasing it.",82

65,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to Prime Minister. Despite the fact that his deputy has admitted he was a citizen of a foreign power right up until the weekend, the Prime Minister has spent all week fighting to keep his own job, which relies on a one-seat majority that his deputy provides. What is the Prime Minister's response to factory workers in Elizabeth in my electorate, who every day watch this Prime Minister do absolutely everything to protect his job and nothing to protect theirs? ",84
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Barker is warned.,84
67,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. The greatest threat to the jobs of the workers in the honourable member's electorate in South Australia is the highest priced and least reliable energy in Australia. Nothing has done more to undermine the jobs of factory workers and manufacturing workers in South Australia than the high prices of energy and the unreliability of that energy in the honourable member's state. He knows that is a direct consequence of what Labor Premier Jay Weatherill described as his great experiment. I'll tell the member for Wakefield what Jay Weatherill was experimenting with: the lives of his constituents-their livings, their jobs, their futures. What prospect do you have in a competitive world in a state which has the most expensive, least reliable energy in the OECD? I'm glad the honourable member has given me the opportunity to respond to this, because, unlike his party, we have policies and plans for energy that will ensure that energy is reliable and that prices are lower. What was Labor doing about the price of gas? What was Labor doing? Nothing. They weren't thinking anything. They allowed huge export facilities to be built for gas from the east coast and were warned in 2012 by their own energy department and by AEMO that this was going to put pressure on the domestic market. It's all there in black and white. The honourable member for Port Adelaide knows all about it. They were given that warning. They ignored it; they did nothing. As a result we had a domestic gas market that was short of supply, prices went through the roof and electricity prices went up. A state like South Australia, so dependent on wind, so dependent on intermittent renewables, desperately needed firming power-they needed gas peakers more than anyone but they couldn't afford to run them, and they were closed, too. So, there you have the colossal failure of Labor policy in South Australia. I'd say this to the honourable member: the message he can take to his constituents from me is this: we are standing up for them, we are not letting them down like Labor did and we are  determined to ensure that they have competitive and reliable energy that will enable investment and the jobs that follow in his electorate and right across the nation. Turnbull Government",84
68,Mr COLEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how the government delivers on its commitments in an open and transparent manner? Is the Prime Minister aware of any alternative approaches?,85
69,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. The government has made a series of commitments to the Australian people, and we are delivering on every single one of them-openly, transparently and honestly. We promised to deliver real reform to education, and we did-and we are delivering for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth transparent, consistent, national needs-based funding, something Labor talked about but never delivered, something Labor praised David Gonski for recommending but then ignored. We have delivered that. We promised to cut taxes for small and medium businesses, directly assisting millions of Australians across the country. We have delivered on that, and we have more to go. We promised to grow the economy and create jobs, and we are delivering. Jobs and growth is not just a slogan; it is an outcome. Around 240,000 new jobs have been added in the last 12 months alone. We promised to return the rule of law to Australia's building and construction sector, and we had the mettle and the courage to prorogue the parliament, bring it back, ensure that the Senate rejected the ABCC bill a second time, dissolve both houses, call a double dissolution and come back here-and that is now delivered law. We're bringing an end to the CFMEU's thuggery and lawlessness. We've promised to fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and the legislation to deliver that has been introduced into the House today. That will provide Australians who have a disability with the certainty of funding to which they are entitled-certainty for 460,000 Australians who have a severe and permanent disability, who will now be able to live their lives with dignity, thanks to that scheme, and know that the money is there. Parents of children with disability will know the funding will be there for their children when they themselves are no longer there. This is providing a security, an integrity, that Labor failed to deliver. We are delivering that, and we call on Labor once again to back this reform in, because the NDIS deserves to be fully funded. By contrast, if you look at the Leader of the Opposition, what has he opposed lately? It's a long list. He has opposed in the Senate and in this House legislation that does no more than stop businesses paying corrupting benefits to unions. He has opposed transparency and he has opposed integrity. (Time expired) Deputy Prime Minister",85
70,Ms HUSAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Shop assistants working in Penrith Plaza had their penalty rates cut on 1 July after this House voted with a majority of just one. Does this Prime Minister acknowledge that his decision to accept his deputy's vote, when it may have been unconstitutional for him to even be here, is having a real impact on every Australian?",85
71,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The honourable member's constituents should be very pleased that our party is in government and not hers. The honourable member's party has no plans for jobs or economic growth at all. The honourable  member's party is led by a man who was asked on the ABC, 'What is your plan for economic growth?' He couldn't think of one! And then he thought. He said, 'We're in favour of public transport.' That was his response. He couldn't say, as he used to, in the 'old Bill' days, 'Oh, I'm in favour of cutting business taxes, because",85

Everyone knows!' He said, 'Every student of economic history in Australia'-a great student, he is; he's read all those books, he's very knowledgeable-'knows that the way to create investment is to lower business taxes, and that's why we're doing it.'

76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call.,86
77,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the honourable member has asked about pay at Penrith Plaza. Let me tell the honourable member: the driver of economic growth in Penrith and everywhere else in the country is investment. That is what drives jobs-more investment, more jobs. More people have an income; more people go shopping at Penrith Plaza. The idea that a policy-free zone, the Labor Party, dripping with nothing more than envy and malice, is going to deliver jobs in Penrith Plaza or anywhere else is very naive. Envy, bitterness and malice are not going to get people hired in Penrith Plaza. What that needs is investment, confidence and employment. There were 240,000 new jobs over the last year. That's what's being delivered: strong investment-getting stronger-supported by the government and supported by policies that back in growth and will ensure that the constituents of the honourable member will have a greater opportunity under the leadership we're providing than under the envious bitterness of the Labor Party.",86
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just before I call the member for Petrie, I again caution members who are interjecting continuously, particularly those who have been asked to leave understanding order 94(a) on a number of occasions. The member for Griffith is in that category, as is the member for Bruce. I am saying very calmly: even though it's loud, I'm not going to reciprocate with loud responses; I'm going to reciprocate with action to remove them from the chamber. Those who have been removed a number of times can expect more severe action. If that's what they want to happen during question time, I'll be left with no choice. Economy",86
79,Mr HOWARTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer please update the House on the latest employment figures and the action that the government is taking to grow our economy to support more and better paid jobs? Treasurer, are you aware of any alternative approaches?",86
80,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Petrie for his question. The second part of his question was: am I aware of any alternative approaches to growing jobs in this country, apart from the ones being pursued by the government? The  answer to that is no, because those opposite do not have a plan to create jobs. What they have is a plan for envy. What they have from this shifty Leader of the Opposition is a plan to deceive the Australian people. He was shifty as a union official, and he's been shifty as a Leader of the Opposition as well. On this side of the House, we have a plan that we're implementing to create jobs in this country. And we're getting results. Some 240,000 jobs were created in the last financial year. That is the highest rate of jobs growth we've seen in a full financial year since before the global financial crisis. But today's data reveals the strongest six-month growth in full-time jobs in 40 years-the entire period in which the Labour Force Survey has been run-with 210,800 full-time jobs created in the past six months. That is a fact. That is not a slogan; it's a fact. During the same period, some 36,000 young people got jobs. In the most recent data, which came down today, the youth unemployment rate has also fallen, as indeed the overall unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6 per cent. It is not just that. Over that last six months, we have seen more Australians joining the labour force, with the confidence to go out and get a job in this economy. More than 200,000 Australians have joined the Australian labour force in the last six months. Jobs growth through the year is now at two per cent. That is 10 times the rate that we inherited from the job thieves on the other side of the parliament. It is 10 times the rate of growth, and some 736,000 jobs have been created in the less than four years since we were first elected. Average earnings over the year are now more than $80,000. That means, with the tax cuts delivered by the Turnbull government, if you are on the average full-time earnings you are not on the second highest tax bracket. That is a result of the tax cuts delivered by the Turnbull government. The Turnbull government equals jobs. It is as simple and fair as that. It means more jobs for Australians, with some 200,000-plus full-time jobs created in the last six months. That's our record of action. (Time expired) Banking and Financial Services",86
81,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. After all the stories of banking scandals, thousands of victims, life savings gone, homes lost and businesses gone under, the Australian people want a royal commission into the banks. But the government has been using its one-seat majority to protect the banks from a banking royal commission. How can the Prime Minister continue to accept the vote of the Deputy Prime Minister when it means that the victims of banking scandals are denied the royal commission they deserve?",87
82,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The opposition have proposed a banking royal commission for some time. They have expressed this on the basis that they feel it is a way of getting at the banks. The object of our policies and everyone's policies should be to ensure that banks look after their customers and, where their customers have been mistreated, justice is done. That is the difference. Every policy we have introduced since the election relating to banks delivers greater protections and justice for their customers. You can see that our institutions are working. If you look at the money-laundering allegations relating to the Commonwealth Bank, they were uncovered by AUSTRAC. Proceedings have commenced. They'll be before the court, I believe, on 4 September. That is very shortly. We have institutions that are working. The Treasurer and the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services are putting in place a new one-stop shop for people who have  been mistreated or dealt with unfairly by the banks so they can get justice. Royal commissions have their uses and value, but at the end of the day they cannot recompense one person. They cannot provide any compensation. All they can do is inquire and, at the end of a long period, inevitably, write a report with recommendations. And I'd ask honourable members to reflect on this: what would the recommendations of such an inquiry be? You would find that those obvious recommendations are already being implemented by a government that acts, by a government that protects depositors, that protects borrowers, right now. That's our commitment. We are delivering on our commitment to protect the customers of the Australian banks. We are holding them to higher levels of accountability than they have ever been held to before. We're getting on with that job-with more resources to ASIC and to AUSTRAC, ensuring that our regulators do their job. Customers, Australians, want justice now. That's our focus, not a political outcome. NA The SPEAKER (14:20): I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Mr Barry Haase, the former member for Durack. On behalf of the House, I extend a warm welcome to you. I'm also advised we have in the gallery Mr Chris Minns MP, the member for Kogarah in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. On behalf of the House, I extend a warm welcome to you. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Workplace Relations",87
83,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, in a dreadful development, Cadbury is sacking 50 workers at its Claremont factory. The simple fact is that the factory would not be downsizing if the coalition government had delivered on its 2013 promise to inject $16 million of economic stimulus into the northern suburbs of Hobart through enhancements to the factory. Instead, when Cadbury didn't go ahead with the new visitor centre, the government took the money from the battlers in my electorate and used it elsewhere as a political slush fund. Prime Minister, what will you do to return that stimulus money to Denison? What will you do to help the 50 sacked workers?",88
84,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. Like him, we were very sad and disappointed to see the reports today of the job losses at Cadbury's Claremont plant. But the honourable member's historical account is one from which I must differ. The coalition pledged $16 million to upgrades at Cadbury's Tasmanian plant in the lead-up to the 2013 election; that is so. But it is also a matter of public record that Cadbury subsequently withdrew its application for those federal government funds, and the funds were then redirected to a Tasmanian jobs and investment fund-and I will come back to that in a moment. Obviously, the decision that's been taken is a commercial matter for Cadbury's parent company, Mondelez, but we understand that these sorts of decisions significantly, grievously, impact workers, their families and the local economy. We're making assistance available to affected workers through the jobactive service, which is connecting jobseekers with employers through a national network of providers in over 1,700 locations, and the What's Next? website and online resources.  The government is also committed to economic development and creating new jobs in Tasmania. Through the Tasmania Jobs and Investment Fund, there are 56 business projects expected to create more than 700 new jobs in Tasmania. As the honourable member will recall, the $16 million of federal money was joined with $8 million of state government money to make a $24 million fund. We're also investing $25 million in the Regional Jobs and Investment Package for Tasmania, which is",88

We are boosting investment and generating jobs in Tasmania, right across Tasmania, just as we are right across the nation. Registered Organisations",89
93,Ms PRICE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry representing the Minister for Employment. Will the minister outline to the House why it's important that leaders of unions and employer organisations always act in the best interests of their members and disclose to their members any potential or actual conflicts of interest? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?  thank the member for Durack for her question. It is critical that union members have confidence that their leaders are always beyond reproach, are acting in the interests of union members and are making sure that the rules are being followed. It's always funny how the Leader of the Opposition spins around and shows me his back. It's one of those shifty tactics that shifty people would use. But it's very important that union members be able to have confidence in their leaders, that the rules are being followed and that they're not having their money used for the personal purposes of their union leaders  So it very much surprises this side of the House that, in 2005, the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the national secretary of the Australian Workers' Union, gave $100,000 to the organisation GetUp! in spite of also being on the board of GetUp!. He was on the board of GetUp!, he was also the national secretary and he gave $100,000 to GetUp!. One wonders why he won't show us the minutes which indicate whether this was agreed to by the national executive and whether he declared his conflict of interest. A couple of years later, in 2007, AustralianSuper donated $27,000 to the Australian Workers' Union, when the Leader of the Opposition, again, was on the board of AustralianSuper and was the national secretary of the Australian Workers' Union. But we get the trifecta because he was also the Labor candidate for Maribyrnong at the time. Coincidently, the Australian Workers' Union then employed a campaign worker in Maribyrnong, who was paid $26,000 for her work, which seems a very similar number. The piece de resistance also came in 2007. At the moment the Leader of the Opposition is very interested in what the member for Sydney is talking about. They're probably trying to decide the capital of Africa or talking about African languages. We discover that in 2007, when the Leader of the Opposition was the national secretary of the Australian Workers' Union, that union gave $25,000 to his Maribyrnong campaign. He didn't even bother with a third party. He cut out the middleman-he cut out the middleman and gave the $25,000 straight to the Maribyrnong campaign when he was the national secretary of the AWU. He has been asked lots of questions about this. Today he said that he was not going to go through the ins and outs of every issue. We don't want him to go into the ins and outs of every issue; we just want him to answer the question he was asked-did he authorise a $25,000 union donation when he was the secretary of the AWU?

I will tell you one thing: if this man here, this Leader of the Opposition, had a one-seat majority in this place, the boats would be coming like an armada across the seas. There is no question about that. Without the oneseat majority on this side, the Labor Party would still be presiding over 1,200 deaths at sea. Mr Keogh interjecting",91

105,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian public should be in no doubt whatsoever that if this Leader of the Opposition was Prime Minister of this country, if they had a one-seat majority in this House, there would be another 17 detention centres open with another 8,000 children put into detention, because that is what happened when Labor was last in government. That's the reality when you have a leader, as we've got in this Leader of the Opposition, who has no ability to stare down the Left of his party, no ability to deal with the threats at our borders and no ability to deal with the very serious threat to national security. Why do people say of this Leader of the Opposition that he's shifty and that he's shonky and that he's shady? It's because he was at the centre of every shady, shonky and shifty deal when he was leader of the union movement. Let me say, if people don't know where this Leader of the Opposition stands in relation to this very important issue, it is because of the positions he has adopted over a long period of time, including when he was a founding director of GetUp! The Australian public knows that GetUp! is a front tor the Labor Party and for the Australian Greens. The CFMEU gave them $1 million last year. When the Leader of the Opposition was the AWU secretary he gave them $100,000 without authority. And what is their opinion when it comes to this issue of stopping boats? They're running this dodgy, shifty campaign at the moment to bring them here-to bring people from Manus and Nauru here. We know that if they did that the boats would recommence. So, no wonder people are confused about this Leader of the Opposition and whether he can lie straight in bed, because when he was financially propping up GetUp! he was supporting policies that would again see people drown at sea, would see people in detention, would see  thousands of children coming by boat. Yet now, when he's in this position and he wants to be Prime Minister of this country, he's asking the Australian public to believe something very different. The Australian public know not only that this leader is shifty and shonky but that he can't hold a story for more than 24 hours. That's the problem with this Leader of the Opposition. This Leader of the Opposition has been called out by the Australian public, because they know, like many in this place- (Time expired) Deputy Prime Minister",91

I checked, I put two examples to the House: 21 October, 2010 when Minister Crean had such a motion put and he recommenced the answer because the clock stopped, and a week later, on 28 October, similarly on then Prime Minister Gillard.

120,Mr JOYCE,NOES,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Today, we have yet another great example of delivering, because we got through this House today the start of the $4 billion Regional Investment Corporation to be based in Orange. It is yet another sign of our decentralisation plan, a plan that we have for the delivery of a greater standard of living for people in regional areas. It's just like our plan and our money we have put on the table for the Inland Rail to create a corridor of commerce from Melbourne up to Brisbane, through  Seymour and through Wodonga to increase the economic activity and be a boon for places like Parkes, Narrabri, Moree, Goondiwindi and Toowoomba. This is our plan. The plan goes on with decentralisation: the APVMA to go up to Armidale, the RIRDC to go down to Wagga Wagga, the GRDC to go to Toowoomba and moving sections of MDBA down to Wodonga. We have a plan for regional Australia. There are dams that we wish to build, such as a Rookwood Weir. All these things have one thing in common-that is, that the Labor Party does not believe in them. The Labor Party does not believe in the Regional Investment Corporation. The Labor Party doesn't believe in the Inland Rail. The Labor Party does not believe in regional development. The Labor Party was the party that shut down the live cattle trade. The Labor Party does not stand beside the coal miners of the Hunter Valley and does not believe in the coal miners of the Hunter Valley.

127,Mr JOYCE,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. It was certainly his valedictory-he's gone. It's very important that we understand that the depreciation allowance has allowed a boom for the construction of grain sheds in the seat of Parkes. This is the difference a good government makes and it's reflected in the fact that agriculture has seen a 30 per cent increase in its output since we have been in government. All we need from the Labor Party is a belief in regional Australia, something that says that they are going to construct for regional Australia, something that they are going to stand behind. They won't stand behind the coalminers. They don't believe in coal-fired power, they don't believe in the inland rail, they don't believe in the Regional Investment Corporation and they don't believe in dams in places such as Rookwood Weir. There is nothing that they are offering regional Australia. They are completely vacant about regional Australia, except in their incessant belief in playing parlour games. But it was so comforting last night, when we saw eight out of eight in the vox pop in my town, in Tamworth-the one thing people can't stand is shiftiness, and that's why they won't support the Labor Party.

128,Mr BURKE,MOTIONS," I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Watson from moving the following motion immediatelyThat the House: (1) notes: (a) this House has unanimously asked the High Court to determine whether the Deputy Prime Minister is constitutionally qualified to be a Member of parliament and thereby to determine if the Government has a majority; (b) the Deputy Prime Minister has admitted he was a citizen of a foreign power right up until the weekend and has already started campaigning for the New England by-election; (c) former Minister Matt Canavan has resigned from Cabinet and will not vote in the Senate until the High Court resolves doubts about his constitutional qualifications; (d) the Prime Minister is continuing to accept the Deputy Prime Minister's vote in this House even though it means that victims of the banks are denied the Royal Commission they've been calling for and Australians continue to have their penalty rates cut; and (e) the situation with his Deputy Prime Minister is unsustainable; and (2) therefore, calls on the Prime Minister to: (a) admit his continued reliance on the Deputy Prime Minister's vote is causing real harm to the people of Australia; (b) rule out accepting the vote of the Deputy Prime Minister while his constitutional qualifications are in doubt; and (c) direct the Deputy Prime Minister to immediately resign from Cabinet. The Prime Minister told the truth today when he said he was transparent. When the Prime Minister said he was transparent, he was spot on, because no-one has missed the transparency of a Prime Minister who will do and say anything to cling to office. This is an illegitimate government throwing a tantrum, and as they throw a tantrum and throw the toys in every direction, they don't care who they contradict, even when it's themselves. They're willing to jeopardise a relationship and create a new international incident with New Zealand, they're willing to jeopardise arguments they made as recently as Monday, they're willing to undo the arguments that they made when Senator Canavan resigned and they're willing to completely undo the arguments that they put in place when the Greens resignations took place. The Prime Minister will probably get up in the House later and be very passionate, but in order to believe what the Prime Minister says today you have to ignore what he said last week. This issue is exactly the same as everything that we get from this Prime Minister. In issue after issue, no matter how much passion he brings to the table, you can only believe what he says today if you ignore what he used to say. It's not long ago that we heard it was incredible sloppiness on the part of the Greens party, and administratively just how hopeless they were",96

131,Mr BURKE,MOTIONS,"In terms of what happened when the Greens party resigned, if you want to believe those arguments from the government are right then their defence of the Deputy Prime Minister can't be right, because their defence of the Deputy Prime Minister now is: 'Oh, he didn't know; he had no way of knowing.' If that argument's right then every criticism they made about the Greens party is completely wrong. They put arguments in terms of the responsibility of Senator Canavan and whether Senator Canavan had done the right thing. If he did the right thing-and they argued passionately then that he was doing the right thingthen everything the Deputy Prime Minister is doing now is completely wrong. But now we will hear the Prime Minister argue with the same level of passion as to why his deputy is doing the right thing now, with the exact opposite argument to what he put when Senator Canavan decided to step aside and not vote. But of all the arguments that this government has been willing to put, nothing has been more bizarre than their conspiracy theories. It's interesting today: no Dixer for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I was ready to move the extension of time, but the opportunity just wasn't there. Instead of looking like Sherlock Holmes uncovering the conspiracy, it was the school prefect saying, 'How dare you dob on us!' That was the argument they wanted to put. They were like that final scene of Scooby-Doo, when they say, 'We would've got away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids.' What they put forward-their entire defence here, the whole conspiracy theory-is based on the fact that they didn't think they'd get found out. That's what they're upset about-that the Deputy Prime Minister has been willing to go through the entirety of his parliamentary career in breach, on the face of it, of Australia's Constitution. Their objection, their anger-the conspiracy-is that somebody worked it out. Somebody worked out that maybe this government with a majority of one was in fact a minority government. Somebody worked out that, when they were ridiculing the Greens, it was not just some anonymous backbencher who was guilty of doing the same thing; it was the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. What those opposite don't seem to understand-but a lot of their backbench, from Phil Coorey's article, have worked it out-is simply this: what they have done this week is not sustainable. Everybody knows. If they let this two-week break go and parliament comes back on 4 September, do they really think we will have moved on? Do they really think the Australian people will suddenly be okay with the concept that every time there's a vote in this House, we don't know if it is a legitimate majority? Every time the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia stands up, we don't know if he's legally in office. When the Prime Minister goes overseas, Australia will be the only country in the world being run by someone whose own country doesn't know whether he's legally allowed to do the job. That's the situation and the embarrassment that this Prime Minister is willing to put us through. I have to say, you wouldn't need much authority, when the evidence is this strong, to say: 'Deputy, you've got to stand aside. If the High Court clears you, you'll come back.' It wouldn't take much authority to do that. How little authority does this Prime Minister have, that in the face of the House unanimously referring the matter to the High Court, he can't even say that to his deputy? All he can do is look down the barrel of a camera and say: 'I'm a really strong  leader. I am a really, really strong leader.' Strong leaders don't need to say that, Prime Minister. Strong leaders don't need to make comments like that. But you don't need to be a terribly strong leader to say, 'If we don't know whether or not we're governing legally, maybe we ought to ask him to stand aside.' That's not an unreasonable position for the government to arrive at, but this Prime Minister has so little authority that he cannot even bring it to that. The government wants to argue that, somehow, this is a matter only within the Canberra bubble that doesn't have an impact on the real life consequences for Australians. Well, tell that to the victims of the banks, who were denied a royal commission in this place by one vote. Tell that to the shop assistants at Penrith Plaza, who the Prime Minister dismissed by saying: 'Oh no, trickle-down economics will work for them. They'll get jobs.' They've got jobs-the problem is they had a pay cut. And the reason they had a pay cut was one vote-one vote! For some of the lowest-paid workers in this country it was getting a pay cut or having their conditions protected, and it was the one vote of the Deputy Prime Minister that may well have been unlawful. The Prime Minister might like to think the issue will drift off because the media cycle will move on. I say to the Prime Minister: just stop and think about the gravity of what we are talking about this week. The government only has a majority of one, and we have unanimously voted, to the High Court, that we don't know whether that majority is lawful. This is a big deal, and this doesn't require much leadership to be able to move on. If the people behind the Prime Minister have given him so little authority that he can't even direct a member of his front-bench, who might be there unlawfully, to step aside for a couple of months, then why are they keeping him there? If they won't give the Prime Minister enough authority to make a simple decision like that, then they should make the move that the member for Warringah is beckoning on. If there was any stability in those behind him, there would be stability in this parliament. But there is not. The government at least last week thought maybe it would get a diversion this week from the postal vote, or the postal survey. Well, they got it-they got the diversion they were looking for!-and the entire legitimacy of this government is called into question. Those opposite in the front row might not have worked it out but the Australian people have, and those behind them have worked it out too. (Time expired)",97
132,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Is the motion seconded?,98
133,Mr FITZGIBBON,MOTIONS," I second the motion, and I want to indicate to the House that I've agreed to give up some of my time to Mr Wilkie so he can make a contribution on behalf of the crossbench. This motion is one about ministerial responsibility. It's about time this Deputy Prime Minister started to take some responsibility for his own action, or inaction. When he was caught out doctoring his Hansard, it was the fault of his staff. When his departmental secretary tried to stand up for the staff-well, we know the history there: he was gone. When he couldn't answer a question on Channel Ten's The Project, he first blamed the person doing the interview, and then, when that didn't work, he blamed his media adviser. Do we remember the hashtag #PrayForJake? When he wouldn't move on the white spot outbreak in the prawn sector, it was the Queensland government's fault. When he introduced a backpacker tax for the first time, it was the Labor Party's fault",98
134,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The member for Hunter will cease speaking for a second. He needs to relate his speech to why standing orders should be suspended, as the Manager of Opposition Business did.",99
135,Mr FITZGIBBON,MOTIONS,"I will, Mr Speaker. This motion is urgent because people out there in the community are watching this parliament, and they are seeing a rabble. They are seeing a Deputy Prime Minister who, by his own admission, is not validly sitting in this place. They are seeing a Deputy Prime Minister and a minister for agriculture, resources and Northern Australia sitting in this place, and they are asking themselves: how can people in those sectors take this minister seriously when there is such a black cloud hanging over his head? Already, people are asking themselves about the capacity of this Deputy Prime Minister. In four years in that portfolio, he has not done one thing to help the agriculture community. People in the mining sector and other sectors now have a very low expectation about his capacity to do any more. The government needs to explain, again, what is the difference between the case of Senator Canavan and the case of the current member for New England. I cannot understand the position of the Prime Minister. He heard the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources admit himself that he is a goner in the High Court. He has kicked off his campaign in New England. I say to you, Prime Minister: if he's accepting his demise, it's time you accepted it. We thought we might hear better from the Prime Minister. We thought he might take some responsibility. He has form in not taking responsibility. His failed NBN project is a perfect example. But we would have thought that, as a Prime Minister of this country, someone holding such high office, he would stand up and take responsibility for the actions of the Deputy Prime Minister. It's apparently everyone else's fault but the Deputy Prime Minister's. It's New Zealand's fault. It's the Labor Party's fault. It's anyone's fault but the Deputy Prime Minister's. He has a responsibility to his constituents. He has a responsibility as Deputy Prime Minister and to the electorate more broadly to concede, admit, accept and take responsibility for his own actions and inactions and step aside both from his portfolio responsibilities and from his right to vote in this place until the High Court has come to a conclusion on the matter he himself and his own government-not the Labor Party, not the opposition, but his own government-has referred to the High Court. So it's time, Deputy Prime Minister, for you, for the first time in your 10 years in this place-remember that, for 10 years you have sat in this place with a big question mark hanging over your head-to take responsibility for your own actions and, indeed, inactions.",99
136,Mr WILKIE,MOTIONS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I will just very briefly speak on behalf of the member for Indi and the member for Mayo and explain why we have been abstaining this week on this and similar motions. We agree that it would be better for the member for New England to step aside from cabinet and the position of Deputy Prime Minister until this matter is resolved. However, we cannot support a motion that his vote does not count because, frankly, until the High Court has decided on this matter, he has been elected and the people of New England deserve to be represented and it's proper to accept his vote. I think we should pay respect to the High Court and allow it to adjudicate on this matter, and then it will be finalised. In the interim, why don't we all just get back to work and focus on the issues that everyone in this country is concerned about, such as health, education and  jobs, and stop this fractious, juvenile debate which has interrupted every question time this week? It has not been in the public interest. We know there's an issue. We know it's an important issue. We on this side and most of the crossbench agree that the member for New England would be better to step aside from the cabinet and the position of Deputy Prime Minister. But, please, let's respect the High Court and let them adjudicate on whether or not his vote should be counted.",99
137,Mr TURNBULL,MOTIONS," The member for Denison and I agree on this fundamental point that the member for New England is entitled to sit in this House. He is a member of parliament. As long as he is a member of parliament, he is entitled to be a minister of state under the Constitution. We acknowledge the advice from the member for Denison, but the fact of the matter is this: the member for New England is entitled to sit in this House. The reference to the High Court was not done for any reason other than to give the court the opportunity to clarify this area of the law which has been the subject of so much controversy recently. I agree with the member for Denison when he says we should be focusing on the issues of vital importance to Australians. That is why this motion should not be supported. Just in the last six weeks, this is what the government have been doing to keep Australians safe. We have gone to the G20 and secured the support of the 20 leading economies to take action to counter terrorism right across the world, to ensure that the internet is not used to promote terrorism and to spread extremism and to ensure the big tech companies and social media companies cooperate with governments to ensure that we can track down and defeat those terrorists. And we've seen",100
138,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"Can I just ask the Prime Minister to pause for a second. As I said, I do give a lot of latitude in these debates, but it's important that the material relate to why standing orders should or should not be suspended. The Prime Minister has the call.",100
139,Mr TURNBULL,MOTIONS,"The matter that I'm addressing is the important issues that we are dealing with now and the House should be dealing with because the issue about the Constitution is, as the member for Denison said, going to be considered by the High Court. But let me get back to the most important obligation of government, which is keeping Australians safe. In the last few weeks, we saw the most dangerous, potent terrorist plot in our history disrupted and contained. We saw extraordinary work from ASIO, the Federal Police and the New South Wales Police Force-all our agencies working together. This government-my government-has never been prouder of our agencies than we were when we saw them frustrate that plot and have those two men charged, knowing that their action, their professionalism and their courage has saved hundreds of lives. We have been working, too, to relieve the pressure on energy prices. We're taking action to bring down the price of gas simply by ensuring that Labor's failure of policy is not continued and there will be adequate gas supplies on the east coast. That's an urgent matter the House could be debating. That's an urgent matter upon which we are acting. Of course, in the right now and in the here and now, so many Australian families and businesses are paying more than they need to for electricity. That's very clear. They're on the wrong plan. They were on a plan, then that expired and nobody told them what was going to happen. They find themselves paying much higher rates. Literally millions of households are paying more for electricity  than they need to. We've taken action and brought in the heads of the big electricity companies. What they're doing is they are now contacting their customers and telling them of the opportunities to pay less for electricity. That is ensuring that Australian families who are feeling the pinch and who are struggling with higher costs will have the opportunity to get the information to get them on the right prices. In the last 12 months, we have seen 240,000 new jobs created in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition talked about it being a jobless economy with no job growth. Two hundred and forty thousand new jobs is a lot of jobs-believe me. The participation rate is high. We're seeing strong jobs growth. What we're not seeing is enough growth in wages, and that is why we want to drive stronger economic growth. Let me tell you what will deliver higher wages: higher economic growth and higher demand. The Governor of the Reserve Bank said just a few days ago: 'If labour markets are strong, workers will get bigger pay rises. Where there's strong demand relative to supply, wages will rise.' There's very strong demand for some types of construction workers because of the infrastructure spending of this government. That's what's happening. We're spending money on infrastructure-$75 billion. So the Governor of the Reserve Bank acknowledges that there's demand there. He notes there's demand in some other areas-in IT-but we need stronger demand. What is going to give stronger demand? What is it? It's more investment. How do you get more investment? You reduce business taxes. The opposition used to know that. That cowardly fellow, who always turns his back when things get a little uncomfortable, the Leader of the Opposition, knows exactly what happened.",100
140,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The member for MCEwen, on a point of order. Mr Rob Mitchell: I ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that unparliamentary remark.",101
141,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,You can't ask anyone to withdraw. It wasn't directed at you. Mr Rob Mitchell interjecting,101
142,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The member for MCEwen will not argue with me. You're allowed to raise a point of order. You can't ask people to withdraw-I can. You can have a look at Practice on exactly how this occurs. The Prime Minister has the call.,101
143,Mr TURNBULL,MOTIONS,"In the last six weeks also we have passed laws to ban the practices of the Leader of the Opposition when he was running the AWU-all of the unaccountable, shifty conduct he used to get on with; taking money from big companies in order to trade away workers' penalty rates. That's what the opposition leader did when he was running the AWU. What about giving money to himself? He talks about conflicts of interest. This is a union leader who, with union members' hard-earned funds, spent $25,000 on himself. He paid it to himself, to his own campaign. Even worse in many respects, he took $32,000 from a building company with which he was negotiating an enterprise agreement. He didn't tell the members about that-oh no. No, no. I tell you what, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition, when he was running the AWU, always had his members on a need-to-know basis, and he thought they didn't need to know anything. He sold some mushroom workers down the river, and he treated all of his members like mushrooms: he kept them in the dark. He told them nothing. So we passed that law, and the Labor Party voted against it. What we've done also is ensure that unions will have to be accountable, as companies are, and transparent.  Under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, he paid $100,000 to GetUp!$100,000 to GetUp!. There is no evidence that it was authorised. We would love to see the minute. It would be good to see the minute, but it hasn't been produced-$100,000 to GetUp!. Very relevantly this week, GetUp! only a few months ago started a campaign to rename Australia Day 'Invasion Day'. That's the organisation he was funding and of which he was a board member. GetUp! is prominent in campaigning to destroy Operation Sovereign Borders. GetUp! is the biggest campaigner, joined by many members of the Labor Party, for opening up our borders so that we would once again have thousands of unauthorised arrivals, drownings at sea and kids in detention. This is the shameful record of Labor. The Leader of the Opposition funded a capable political organisation, GetUp!. They've got a big organisation, they get their message out-it is a dangerous Left-green Labor message. They get it out there, and they've been funded to do it by the Leader of the Opposition. He can't walk away from that responsibility. For the last six weeks, we've been keeping Australians safe, we've been putting downward pressure on electricity prices and we've been growing the economy. Those are the urgent issues. That's what we should be debating. That's why this motion should be denied. (Time expired)",101

146,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable the Leader of the Opposition proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need for the government to deal with issues confronting Australians and govern in the national interest. I call upon all of those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their place. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",104
147,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Today I want to have a conversation with Australians. I understand that people are unimpressed with what they have seen in this place for the last two weeks. We are watching, sadly, the disintegration of a Prime Minister who-even though I wouldn't have voted for him-offered to this country the promise and the hope of a different politics. His hoarse, rambling and unconvincing performance a few moments ago failed to mention his Deputy Prime Minister more than once in 10 minutes. A resolution was put forward by Labor in the standard parliamentary convention: we said the Deputy Prime Minister, with a constitutional shadow over his eligibility, should stand aside from his responsibilities-just as his colleague Senator Canavan did when confronted with a very similar set of circumstances. This was an opportunity for the Prime Minister to come forward and say, 'No, there's very strong merit to Minister Joyce; he's irreplaceable in the construct of the government,' and to explain the case for having double standards between Senator Canavan and the minister. But he didn't do that. There was only one reference to his beleaguered Deputy Prime Minister in 10 minutes. This is actually a symptom of the greater problem. He spent more of his speech vilifying Labor, attacking unions and attacking his opposition than he spent seriously mounting a case for his vision for Australia. There are two things that I want Australians to know in the next few minutes: (1) as long as the Turnbull government is consumed by chaos and crisis, as long as the very legitimacy of its mandate and its majority are under a cloud, it cannot and will not do its day job; and (2) I  want Australians to hear from us that Labor are focused on the people of Australia and our plans for a better future for this nation. Turning to my first point, this crisis caused by the government's negligence might seem like an obscure thing-the 'vibe of the Constitution', as Dennis Denuto would say; or, as the cynics in the ranks of the government ministry say: 'This is inside the Canberra bubble. It's political correctness.' That's what they might whisper on their alt-right sites. But Australians should know there are consequences. If the Deputy's Prime Minister's dual citizenship had been revealed earlier, if he'd stood aside and done the right thing, this parliament could have reversed the penalty rate cuts for 700,000 low-paid workers. If the Deputy Prime Minister had stood aside, we would have had the overdue banking royal commission that this country is demanding of the parliament. Australians following these antics might well ask: what on earth is going on? In the last week, we have seen this Prime Minister suggest that his opponent should be in jail. They have suggested a treasonous plot-a plot with a dangerous foreign power, affectionately known as New Zealand. But, unfortunately, this government becomes more desperate. I say to the government: we understand that the more you attack us, the less you have to say about yourselves and, more importantly, the less you have to say about the people of Australia. Where on earth is that new style of leadership that he promised? When we see neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching on the streets of suburban United States, our Prime Minister is reduced to criticising a local council in Australia. In a time of international uncertainty, with North Korean missile testing, with the threat of fundamentalist terrorism, Australians see their foreign minister embarking on a war of words with New Zealand. Given that it is his last week in the gallery, I think we should hear from Laurie Oakes. On that particular bit of strategic foreign policy genius, he wrote: 'I think it's laughable. It's a joke. It makes the foreign minister look stupid. It makes the Prime Minister look stupid.' Well said, Mr Oakes, and thank you for your service. When our schools don't have the resources they need, when the TAFEs are closing, when apprenticeship numbers are falling, when women fleeing family violence cannot find a safe place to stay and when Aboriginal people are taken from us too soon because of preventable diseases, Australians are entitled to ask: why is this government spending $120 million on an unnecessary postal survey? Australians are entitled to ask of the parliament and the government: what does this government have to say about people struggling with wages growth at its lowest level since records were kept? It has nothing to say to the Holden workers in Elizabeth, nothing to say to the workers in Penrith Plaza, to the families swamped by power prices, to the young people priced out of university and priced out of the housing market. To all of those Australians worried about handing on a lesser set of conditions to their kids, what do they have to say to them? What do they have say to Australians on the wrong side of inequality, which is at its highest level in 75 years? This is the plan the government offers Australians: a tax increase for working people and a tax cut for the top end of town. The foreign minister and the Prime Minister publicly humiliated themselves with their bizarre conspiracy theories. This is a matter in our political history. But we shouldn't forget that the Treasurer publicly humiliated himself on Monday when he was caught out trying to verbal the independent Parliamentary Budget Office. What I want to say to Australians is that it is not the incompetence, the trips and missteps of the government which most concern me; it is the unfairness of their policies; it's the ignorance  they show towards the problem of inequality. It is the priorities of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister in the people they fight for that concerns us. They don't fight for the workers who need a wage rise. They don't fight for Australians who are underemployed, underrepresented and underpaid. They don't fight for young people being beaten at auction by investors subsidised by the taxpayer. This government does nothing to help these people. This government fights for its people-the millionaires, the multinationals and the tax minimisers. Let me be clear: in the Labor Party, we do not begrudge the top two per cent of income earners their success, but we think they are pretty good at looking after themselves. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer puff themselves up over their plan to increase the tax burden for seven million Australians, and when we say no to that they call it the 'politics of envy'. They think our plan to close loopholes for tax minimisers, to introduce one set of rules in our taxation system for all to stop the income splitting available to the few, not the many, is a war on aspiration. This government thinks that aspiration is getting a good tax adviser and minimising their income. I think Australians have a different definition of aspiration than this elitist, out-oftouch government. Aspiration is handing on a better standard of living to your kids, a better quality of life, a better deal for your kids than you inherited from your parents. Aspiration is a strong Medicare. It's a good education for your children. It's a decent National Disability Insurance Scheme and proper aged care for your aging parents. Aspiration is working hard and getting ahead. Aspiration is being able to afford to buy your own home. Aspiration is being represented at work when you need assistance. Aspiration is about being able to marry the person that you love. Labor's aspiration is for a fair go all round. We cannot afford to forget the Liberal rationale for their tax cut for millionaires. They criticise Labor for saying that we don't want to reduce the taxes of millionaires, and they call it the politics of envy. They say that, when we want to restore the budget deficit levy, it is a tax on success. They measure success by how much you earn. Let me be very clear: does that mean that when this government increases the income taxes of seven million people they're not successful people, so therefore it is not a tax on success? Let me say to Australians that the Labor Party does not judge Australian success by money alone. We don't say that a childcare worker on $60,000 is not a success-yes, you are. We don't say that a police officer on $70,000 is not a success-yes, you are. We don't say to the teachers in our classrooms, the firefighters in the fire stations and the people working in regional Australia that if you don't earn a lot of money you are not successful. Labor understands that success is whether or not you're a good parent, a good neighbour. Success is not measured by what is in your wallet; it's what is in your heart. Labor will stand up for all of those people facing income tax increases under this government. In conclusion, I say to Australians that last night I had a conversation with about 150 students at the ANU. They're worried about the cost of their degrees going up. They don't know if they're ever going to be able to afford to buy a home. They're frustrated at the lack of action on climate change. They can't believe we're even debating marriage equality through a postal survey. They're worried about having their pay cut at their part-time jobs. They don't know why this government has such a lack of understanding of young people, but I assure them: we have the plans and we will deliver. (Time expired) ",104
148,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Today, I would like to continue this conversation with the Australian people, but I will do so without the zingers. There are two things I would like the Australian people to know. The first is that the Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted. I will repeat that: the first thing is that the Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted. The second is that the Turnbull government is focused on the things that matter for you. Why can't the Leader of the Opposition be trusted? Let's take one example: GetUp! A hundred thousand dollars to GetUp! was there when GetUp! was set up. What does GetUp! stand for? To start with, GetUp! stands for completely dismantling our current immigration laws. Mr Rob Mitchell: This is what the people want to know about? Hopeless!",107
149,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Australian people do want to know this. GetUp! stands for completely dismantling our current immigration laws. What would that lead to? The borders would once again be open to the people smugglers. That is what GetUp! wants. The Leader of the Opposition comes in here and says, 'I support strong border protection,' yet he funds an organisation that wants our current immigration laws dismantled. What's the second thing that GetUp! want? This is very important. I have here the relevant minister, the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, and I'm sure he'll be very interested to know this. GetUp! want to change the day that this nation celebrates Australia Day. That's what GetUp! want to do. They want to change the day we celebrate Australia Day, yet the Leader of the Opposition, who came in here yesterday and said 'No, we should continue to celebrate Australia Day on 26 January,' funded the organisation that want it changed and was one of the first people on the organising committee to set it up. Those are the double standards we are dealing with. You're going to hear more about GetUp! You haven't heard the last about GetUp! Mr Rob Mitchell: Because you've got nothing to stand on!",107
150,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, we do. The second part of the conversation that I want to have with the Australian people today, carrying on from the conversation started by the Leader of the Opposition, is about what this government is focused on. We are focused on the things that matter to the Australian people. Let's take national security to start with. The first job of government is to keep the Australian people safe. We have returned the Defence budget to two per cent of GDP. We are the first government in a decade to fully fund a Defence white paper. We didn't just say, 'Here's a defence white paper. Here's an aspiration. This is what we should be doing.' We fully funded it. We put the money there to back up what we say. That's because this government doesn't just talk, this government acts and this government delivers. We've seen this when it comes to defence. We have also seen it when it comes to national security laws. We have put national security laws in place, which are helping to keep the community safe. There have been five significant, major pieces of national security reform which have kept this nation safe. We are determined to make sure that the terrorists will not win. National security is our key focus. It's the No. 1 priority of government. We are  delivering on it. We are delivering on it not just by talking about it but by putting money in place and putting laws in place that are keeping the Australian people safe. Let's have a look at the economy. The second most important issue of any government is to make sure that it's providing for its citizens. What is the best way to provide for our citizens? That is to make sure that people have a job. That is what we are doing. Look at the job figures. I haven't heard anything from those opposite on the recent job figures. They're not coming out, saying, 'Isn't it wonderful that jobs are growing and jobs are growing significantly?' Did we hear any applause or any acknowledgment from those opposite when the Treasurer got up and spoke about the latest job figures? Did we hear anything from those opposite? No. It's the fastest growth in full-time jobs since they have started recording the data, and what did we hear from those opposite? Not one word. There was not one acknowledgment of where this economy is going or the jobs growth that is occurring in this economy-not one word. It would be very good if those opposite just came out and said, 'Look, it is good that the economy is growing, it is fantastic that there are new jobs being supported and it is fantastic we are seeing full-time job growth.' It's the fastest on record since they have been recording the data. One would have thought that those opposite would stand up and applaud when the Treasurer spoke, but instead we got nothing-zilch. The third most important issue that this government is focused on is energy. We are focused on energy. We are making sure that the Australian people will see downward pressure on their energy bills, not upward pressure. We are doing this despite those opposite, who are there encouraging the Premier of South Australia to make sure that there is upward pressure put on energy prices. We are delivering to see downward pressure put on energy prices-absolutely, we are. There's the Snowy Hydro 2.0-look at what that will do. It will be delivered and it will be transformational. The government has secured, through the COAG Energy Council, 49 out of the 50 Finkel recommendations. They were immediately adopted and are immediately being worked on. We are abolishing the limited merits review, which has allowed network businesses to game the system and put billions of dollars of costs onto our consumers. We are putting downward pressure on energy prices, despite the efforts, especially at the state level, by those opposite. Finally, there are the borders. I touched on what those opposite would like to see when it comes to our borders. Secretly, we know-and it will be very interesting to see what the next speaker has to say about this-that those opposite want GetUp!'s policies to come to fruition. Ms Butler interjecting",107
151,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You do! She just said she does. A government member interjecting,108
152,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member here heard it, too. She wants GetUp! policies implemented. That says it all. On this side, we are very happy: a thousand days without a boat arrival, no-one lost by drowning at sea and all children out of detention. That is the record on this side, yet we've just heard that those opposite want GetUp! policies implemented. They want to see a return to the porous borders that they presided over. On this side, we don't. I would like to continue the conversation that the Leader of the Opposition started. I will sum up how that conversation should go. We will keep pointing out on a daily basis that the Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted. On this side, we will be focusing on the things  that matter to people. We will be focusing on keeping Australians safe. We will be focusing on growing our economy, making sure that the record full-time jobs growth that we have been seeing will continue. We are going to make sure that we are putting downward pressure on energy prices, not supporting state governments that want to put upward pressure on them. Lastly, we will continue to have policies in place which make sure that our immigration is controlled by the government, not by people smugglers. (Time expired)",108
153,Ms BUTLER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," What a ridiculous excuse for a government; what a farce this government is. This has been a week of revelation. Not even I realised just how ridiculous this government has been. I'd like to start by telling the House that I have uncovered, finally, an explanation as to why this government has such a poor record when it comes to investment in infrastructure. Obviously, they don't like investing in infrastructure. They are not a government that is big on investing in infrastructure. They would rather complain about Labor than get to work and do anything. They would rather complain and whinge-we've seen that from the Prime Minister today. It turns out there is an even more interesting explanation for this government's failure to invest in infrastructure. And that explanation is this: it turns out they think that people will want to marry infrastructure if we change the marriage laws. They actually think that people will want to marry the Sydney Harbour Bridge. That's why they haven't invested in infrastructure-they actually think that it might lead to people getting married to infrastructure. We've seen Senator Abetz today in the news indicating that he thinks that, if we change the marriage laws to allow people to get married to each other, then the obvious and necessary consequence of that is people wanting to marry the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Ms Lamb: It's laughable.",109
154,Ms BUTLER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is laughable-that's absolutely right, Member for Longman. But unfortunately it is not even close to the most laughable thing that's happened this week. In respect of the ridiculous marriage survey that this government wants us to have, we've had the Special Minister of State having to go out and clean up this government's messes when it comes to silent enrollers and people overseas. We've had the Treasurer be embarrassed and humiliated when the Parliamentary Budget Office put out a correction in respect of his claim that some figures that he had published were PBO figures. We've had the ridiculousness-and it's hard to top this-of a foreign minister of this nation managing to utterly overegg the pudding, to the extent that we had not just Labor deservedly laughing at the foreign minister but the press gallery utterly demolishing her arguments. You've got to worry about what this is going to mean for Australia-this vast, treacherous, treasonous conspiracy that the foreign minister is unveiling-when it comes to the AustraliaNew Zealand relationship. We need to seriously consider worrying about not just whether people are getting married to the Sydney Harbour Bridge but whether we should have the Navy stationed under it so that when people come across the Ditch to invade we're ready for them. I have to tell you, she is right to be worried about the New Zealanders. I have been to an All Blacks match; I've seen the haka, and I was intimidated. She should be worried about the New Zealanders coming over the Ditch to invade. But I have to say: all of these examples of ridiculousness, as entertaining as they are in a shallow and superficial way, actually mean that this government has spent the entire week wasting its time instead of dealing with serious issues. HILDA came out recently, and what  did it show: incomes have declined. Private debt for under-40s is at record levels. Homeownership for under-40s is incredibly low. We heard the previous speaker talk about employment, but what he didn't want to mention-for obvious reasons-is that underemployment is at record highs in this country and wages growth is at record lows. This year we saw the wages price index at a lower rate than the consumer price index: a real pay cut for Australians. And what is this government doing about it? It is doing nothing about it. I'll tell you what the government hasn't done: it hasn't stepped in in order to protect people who are having their penalty rates cut. We had an opportunity to prevent those cuts from taking effect. There was a vote in this parliament, and this parliament failed to pass legislation to protect those workers. Why? Because, in the House of Representatives, we lost a vote by one vote-one vote that could have prevented penalty rates from being cut for 700,000 workers. And why did we lose that vote? Because there is one member in this chamber who was a foreign citizen at the time that he was elected, and he should not have exercised a vote. Had he not exercised a vote, we would have stopped penalty rate cuts for 700,000 low-paid Australian workers. We would have a banking royal commission going ahead right now if the Deputy Prime Minister had not been illegitimately exercising a vote in this parliament. The ridiculousness of this week-the crazy, ridiculous ideas of Senator Abetz and of the foreign minister-has been disgraceful. This government is a mess. (Time expired) Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan-Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services) (15:51): I thank the opposition for this MPI, because the actual MPI reads: The need for the Government to deal with issues confronting Australians and govern in the national interest. That is exactly what the Turnbull government is doing. In fact, this Labor MPI again highlights the lack of interest that the Labor Party has in actual policies. It is more interested in playing around on the sidelines with distractions. The coalition government is governing and delivering for Australian families. The coalition government is governing and delivering for Australian workers-indeed, this year, for 240,000 more workers; more than any other year in the last 40 years. The coalition government is delivering for Australian small businesses, and, closer to my portfolio, it is delivering for those living with disability. Perhaps instead of asking such a question of the coalition, the opposition should be asking the Labor leader how he justifies authorising donations of union money to his 2007 campaign when he was secretary of the AWU-a small conflict of interest? Not if you are in the opposition. The opposition leader has always been big on promises, but short on plans; big on talk, but short on delivery; big on shifting his position, but short on consistency. Instead of attempting to govern in the interests of its union puppetmasters, the opposition should be considering how to serve its constituencies. Compare Labor's lack of achievements to the track record of the strong coalition government and you will see a government that gets on with the job of delivering for all Australians and a Labor opposition that delivers distractions and has no plans. Labor stands for higher taxes on Australians. Labor stands for higher taxes on Australian small businesses. We see an opposition that delivered secret funding deals to 27 schools throughout the country. The coalition government has delivered increased funding, real reform and transparent national needs-based funding for education in this country. As the Assistant Minister for Social Services and Disability Services, I see first hand the benefits a fully funded NDIS, delivered by the coalition government, will have for some  460,000 Australians who are living with disability and for their families. We want to give them the certainty they deserve-unlike the opposition, which left a $4.1 billion shortfall in the funding for 2019-20. Labor failed to specifically set aside adequate funding, and they spent any savings that they said they were going to use to support the NDIS several times over-typical Labor, magic pudding 'Shortenomics'. Instead of funding the $4.1 billion, they left the most vulnerable in our community in a state of uncertainty. Australians want security. This coalition government has delivered security for our borders. We have delivered more than 1,000 days without a boat arrival and zero deaths at sea and closed 17 detention centres. Australians want secure and affordable energy. The coalition is putting in place measures to provide affordable and reliable gas and electricity for all Australians. If Labor had its way, Australia would literally be living in the Stone Age with rolling blackouts. Australians want a secure future-one of prosperity and stability. They do not want the frivolous debate thrown around by the Labor Party at the behest of the member for Maribyrnong. Australians want the coalition government to continue our demonstrated track record of delivering on good government, and continue we will. We are a government of job creation, a government of small business success, a government of economic growth, a government of delivering infrastructure and a government of delivering Medicare guarantees. Labor has demonstrated that they are a threat to investment in Australia, a threat to business, a threat to jobs and a threat to families. As Prime Minister Turnbull said earlier this year: Their failure to provide for the future is imposing an unconscionable level of debt on our children and grandchildren. While the opposition ducks, dithers, distracts and wastes time, the coalition government is getting on with governing in the national interest. Contrary to Labor's nay-sayers, we're delivering literally more than 100 pieces of legislation through the Senate because we want to deliver for the benefit of all Australians.",109
155,Mr FEENEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I'm very pleased to speak to this matter of public importance-indeed, I might say, this matter of grave importance-because these are dark and dangerous times. For over 100 years, Australians have believed that New Zealand was a friend, a neighbour, a place that shared our values and a country with whom we would face the world together-our ANZAC brothers and sisters. Indeed, in our Constitution there is a standing invitation for New Zealand to join the Commonwealth of Australia. In this friendship, of course, Australians have often lightheartedly joked about our relationship with New Zealand. Some of you may recall The Gruen Transfer and its entertaining joke about New Zealand is 100 per cent for the taking. As it's turned out, how complacent was that? That's because we now know, and this week it's been revealed, that, in fact, across the ditch lies a foreign power-not just a foreign power but a malevolent power that seems to have cast its avaricious eye upon Australia! This transformation in our foreign policy has been revealed by a few brave patriots who I think should be singled out for comment for their courage and for their imagination. The first out of the blocks with this remarkable threat to this country was the Leader of the House-'the fixer'-who is a politician known well throughout this parliament as a conviction politician. The other, of course, was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is that foreign policy colossus and paragon of loyalty-loyalty to leader, loyalty to party and loyalty to nation. Of course,  what these remarkable patriots have done is they have flung down the gauntlet to this foreign power. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will not be distracted by North Korea and its development of ICBMs. This Minister for Foreign Affairs will not be distracted by the issues confronting President Trump, the UN or anyone else. This Minister for Foreign Affairs will turn her gaze, her 'eye of Mordor', on to New Zealand. Christopher Pyne said: How many other foreign governments or foreign political parties in other countries has the Labor Party been colluding with to try and undermine the sovereignty of the Australian Government? Has hethe Leader of the Oppositionbeen talking to the people in Indonesia; or China, the Chinese Communist Party potentially; or Japan; or the Labor Party in the UK? This brave patriot comprehended the possible scale of what we were dealing with! The foreign minister was not to be outdone. She understands the power of the Labor Party. She said the Australian Labor Party set up the New Zealand government. She said: Should there be a change of government, I would find it very hard to build trust with those involved in allegations designed to undermine the government of Australia. In those remarks, she not only laid down a red line for Australia; she decisively intervened in New Zealand's own elections. This act of genius meant she not only defended our interests but also cast our hegemonic ambitions across the ditch. So it is that we are accustomed to confronting a government that is swift and decisive, that dominates the political conversation in this country, that helps us defend this country from a hidden menace, and thus now, behind closed doors, is taking decisive action. There's been talk of there being over one million infiltrators from this foreign power in Australia. There has been talk of this foreign power establishing cells in this country for over a century. Even as I speak, Defence under 'the fixer' must be constructing a new defence posture-forces moving to the ditch. This colossus of a foreign minister must now be engaging the United Nations in contemplating sanctions. This has not been satire; this has been the coalition's key-lines document. Over the course of this week, this fantastical picture is what they tried to conjure. This is what passes for political strategy in the government. It is a remarkable thing. It's not simply a laughing matter and it's not simply a laughable thing; it's a government that, in a desperate moment, looking for advantage-although finding comedy-threw our bilateral relationship with New Zealand overboard. For a moment's advantage, the foreign minister abandoned her responsibility as a foreign minister to protect that most important relationship, and we on this side are not surprised. (Time expired)",111
156,Mr HOWARTH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," How many people in my electorate are asking me for higher taxes? How many people are asking me to lower their house price, push up their rent and scrap negative gearing? How many people are asking me to let people smugglers back into business? How many people want a brand new carbon tax? How many people wish there was less support for schools? None. How many people are talking to me about changing to a republic? None. How many people are talking to me about same-sex marriage? Very few. They're not talking to me about it. Not once have most of these things been raised, yet they're fundamental Labor Party policies. The opposition is obsessed with issues that are of little or no concern to not just the people of my electorate but the majority of Australians. Australians  want tougher border control. They want to pay less tax. They want a good education for their children and grandchildren, and to be able to see a doctor when they need to. They want increased opportunities, and they want government support for them and their community. Most of all, they're yearning for positivity, not the Labor negativity that we continue to see. Take infrastructure, for example: the government is implementing practical measures not just in Petrie but right around the country. In Petrie we're investing in road, rail, stadiums and community group support-there's lots happening. What do we hear from the Leader of the Opposition on this MPI? The MPI is: … to deal with issues confronting Australians and govern in the national interest. What does he do? He comes in here and sticks up for his shadow foreign minister-a shadow foreign minister who has said 'My chief of staff contacted a New Zealand Labour MP without my knowledge.' I ask those opposite, and every member of this House, 'How many of our staff go contacting foreign MPs overseas without our knowledge?' I call her out and say that is rubbish from the shadow minister. And that is what he comes in here and speaks about. He's got a serious issue with foreign policy when he acts as the deputy Labor leader from the job. His current shadow minister says that she doesn't have faith in her own staff. It's outright wrong. And his biggest issue is to call our strongest ally, the President of the US, all sorts of names. That was the Leader of the Opposition himself. The Australian people would have an issue if this opposition ever came to government. You know what the Leader of the Opposition also talks about? He was talking about white supremacists in the US in his MPI today-like the people of Petrie are really interested in that! The Leader of the Opposition spoke about penalty rates, but he failed to mention that when he was leader of the AWU he slashed penalty rates. He slashed penalty rates for workers at Cleanevent and Chiquita Mushrooms. Why did he do it? He slashed it for a handout to his union. The latest employment figures we heard today from the Treasurer: 240,000 new jobs in the last financial year and 210,000 in the last six months alone. Youth employment has plummeted thanks to policies from our government, like the PaTH program that those opposite voted against. They voted against it. And I say to those opposite: give me one policy that you have to create a new job in this country. Not an interjection. Exactly! They have zero policies, and they don't know. You know what their policy is? Their policy is to smash small business, to increase taxes for those businesses with less than $10 million turnover. Yet small businesses employ 80 per cent of Australians. Those opposite want to come into this place and talk about the casualisation of the workforce. I'll tell you that if you start smashing trust and smashing small businesses, you'll see greater casualisation. I'm on the ground, talking to people in my electorate every day, and I can tell you what things are important to them: national security, immigration, jobs and energy prices. We have a state Labor government moving debt onto our power companies-and we wonder why, in Queensland, our energy prices have doubled! (Time expired)",112
157,Ms BIRD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," We have reached the final sitting hours of an extraordinary two weeks in this place. The MPI before us goes to the heart of what the problem is with the way this parliament is operating. Members opposite say that they want to talk about the things that really matter in their electorates. Well so do we. Last week, we had to deal with the fact that we had a government which, in its throes of division, decided the  answer to the problem of resolving marriage equality in Australia was to throw $122 million at a non-compulsory, non-binding postal survey, for which we can't even be sure that they have the process tied down in a correct way that will deliver a fair say to all people. This week has just been extraordinary! We arrive on Monday to find out that the Deputy Prime Minister has to ask every member of this chamber to vote to refer him to the High Court to determine if he can even be a member of this place. I mean, that is an extraordinary outcome. And then they want to say, 'Now, just look away; just pretend that didn't happen; business as usual; let's keep going,' so the Deputy Prime Minister can continue as a member of the executive, answering questions on behalf of the government, making agreements on behalf of the government, holding an executive position, voting in this parliament, in a place where the government only has a majority of one, on laws that will determine the lives of our constituents. He can do all that and we don't even know if he's entitled to sit in this place. You cannot pretend that it's not something dramatically problematic that this parliament needs to deal with. Why on earth did the Prime Minister not-to be honest, why on earth did the Deputy Prime Minister himself not recognise the fact that it is untenable for him to continue in the executive? What sort of leadership-no, what sort of commitment to your own team does that show when you don't have the capacity to understand that you are undermining your own team, your own government? That's what he's done all week by continuing to operate as the Deputy Prime Minister and as a member of the executive. I am not surprised that there are reports that members of his own backbench are absolutely bemused by his continuing to hold that position. If nothing else, as a member of your own team, you would have to be able to see that you were undermining the credibility of your own government. I'm just bamboozled that they have tried to persevere all week and will no doubt try to do so for weeks to come with him in that position. The reality is, as so many of our colleagues have pointed out, that we've had votes in this place where there has only been a one-vote majority, and those votes have profound impacts on people right across our electorates. Two clear examples are the vote to take action to protect the penalty rates of working people-over 10,000 in my electorate; every electorate is the same, with people being affected by that decision-and the vote to have a banking royal commission-thousands and thousands of people across this country have been directly affected-and the vast majority of Australians think we should be doing it. They are just two examples. This government, at its heart, is exposing the problem that it has, and it's a simple one: they are so divided, there is so much division and dissension within their own ranks, that they can't provide leadership. That's what is going on here. When we had that ridiculous farce last week over marriage equality, at the heart of that was a government incapable of governing because of its own internal divisions. This week we have had a whole week in parliament with an extraordinary position, unprecedented in the parliament's history, of a Deputy Prime Minister continuing to operate while he is under consideration in the High Court. At the heart of that is the fact that the government are so divided that they couldn't do what they needed to do-and they know they needed to do it because they expected it of Senator Canavan. When it was him on the chopping block, they knew what needed to happen, but now they can't take the steps they need to take. Let's hope they get some sort of order in their house before we come back  to this place, because this speaking list shows that we are willing to discuss the issues. Where are they? (Time expired)",113
158,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Before I call the member for Fairfax, I would like to recognise, in the students gallery today, students from grades 5 and 6 of Macquarie Anglican Grammar School from Dubbo. They are magnificent ambassadors for their school and town and, I might say, the electorate of Parkes. Mr TED O'BRIEN (Fairfax) (16:12): I felt so desperately sorry for the Leader of the Opposition when he tried to present this MPI today. He struggled to characterise what the Labor Party stands for. Finally, he came out with a line suggesting that the Labor Party is focused on the Australian people. So this is a Labor Party who doesn't want the Australian people to have a say. This is the Labor Party who wants to deny the people a say in the plebiscite. The only focus they have on the Australian people is this: it's the money. They want the people's money. They're happy to tax them. They're happy to see income tax go up. They're happy to deny small businesses tax cuts. Ms Keay interjecting",115
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Braddon is warned! Mr TED O'BRIEN: They're focused on the people only when it comes to the money. The Leader of the Opposition might struggle to define that which characterises his Labor Party, but it's not that hard to define that which characterises the Leader of the Opposition-words such as 'shifty', 'shady', 'shonky', 'shallow'. They all seem to have a bit of a fit. Nice alliteration.",115
160,Mr Sukkar,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They all fit; they've got a good ring to them. Mr TED O'BRIEN: It has got a very good ring to it. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition, who was shifty enough to look Kevin Rudd in the eye and say, 'I've got your back.' He had his back, all right! And then he did the same with Julia Gillard: 'I've got your back.' And then again with Kevin Rudd: 'I've got your back.' This is the same fellow who said to the Australian people only a few years ago, 'I believe in a plebiscite when it comes to the issue of same-sex marriage.' Now what does he say? 'I don't believe in a plebiscite when it comes to same-sex marriage.' This is a Leader of the Opposition who used to go into bat for reducing company taxes for small businesses. Guess what? He's now against it. This man is completely shifty, but he's also shonky. This is a fellow who's more than happy to trade away the rights of workers even though his fundamental role previously with the AWU was to protect the rights of workers. He was happy to trade them away and, in return, ensure the companies with whom he was negotiating would tip money into the union movement-in other words, a shift of money from the worker through to Labor Party candidates. Take from the people, give to the Labor politicians. The Leader of the Opposition is shonky. He is also very shady, as we now know, with him facilitating $100,000 for the GetUp! organisation. Let us not forget that the GetUp! organisation as we speak-right now, today, online-is trying to get rid of our border control. We have had 1,117 days without an illegal boat arrival. Those members opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, were in government when at least 1,200 people died at sea. Those opposite are more than happy to support GetUp! and more than happy to fund GetUp!, who want to open up the borders and put the lives of innocent people at risk. That is the character of the Leader of the Opposition.  But he's also shallow. We can't forget his shallowness. As we heard over recent days, there is his infamous interview with the ABC, when he was asked what his economic plan was for the country. You would think that an alternative Prime Minister, of all things, just might have an economic plan; he just might have one plan that would create one job. He didn't have an answer. So, alternative Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, what is your economic plan for Australia? Pause, silence, and then finally he says he believes in public transport. Woo hoo! Haven't we got a leader in the opposition! I rest my case.",115
161,Mr KHALIL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," It's been an eventful sitting week, hasn't it? I think that's an understatement. This week, we've had the Deputy Prime Minister announcing that he has been a dual citizen of New Zealand for the duration of his parliamentary career, raising all the doubts about his ability to stay in the place under section 44 of the Constitution. Then we've had the Prime Minister channelling the Chief Justice of the High Court, proffering what I would think is a dissenting opinion on the Deputy Prime Minister's eligibility. The common interpretation is that the relevant section clearly provides that the Deputy Prime Minister has been, by his own admission, a dual citizen of New Zealand until only this week and is therefore ineligible. It's only right that the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, will decide the fate of the Deputy Prime Minister this coming week. The High Court will determine the legitimacy or not of the Deputy Prime Minister, as they should. I will leave those deliberations, unlike the Prime Minister, to the judicial scrutiny and expertise of the High Court of Australia. I might add that this comes from a healthy respect for the separation of powers. That's something those on that side should understand better, particularly the Yarra 3. But I won't blame the Yarra 3, because they're following the direction of their great leader! The High Court will deliberate on the legitimacy of the Deputy Prime Minister's eligibility to be in the House, but I question the legitimacy of the government's policies. The political point, really, is that the government holds power by one vote. The government was able to give a $65 billion tax cut hand out to multinational corporations by one vote. They were able to give working Australians a tax increase by one vote. The government blocked a royal commission into misconduct in the banking sector in this country by one vote. The government was able to pass its flawed citizenship legislation through the House this past week by one vote. The government was able to cut school funding by $22 billion by one vote. The government has been able to inflict cut after cut to Medicare by one vote. It was able to make changes to the pension assets test, which affects 1,800 pensioners in my electorate, by one vote. It has been able to cut the energy supplement, designed to help pensioners to pay their power bills, by one vote. And when Labor tried to restore the penalty rates of 700,000 working Australians in hospitality, pharmacy and fast food, the government blocked our attempt by one vote. Australians are entitled to ask: what does this government have to say to people struggling, with wages growth at its lowest level since records were kept? What does it have to say to workers in my electorate who have lost jobs in auto manufacturing and are worrying about what the future holds? What does it have to say to families and pensioners who are being overwhelmed by power prices that are out of control? What does it say to young people being priced out of an education and priced out of buying a home? What does it have to say to Australians who are worried about handing on a lower standard of living to the next  generation? With this abysmal record, it's only natural that the people of Australia are questioning the legitimacy of this government, and we know the High Court will determine the legitimacy of this government. We all question the legitimacy of this government's austerity program that targets the most vulnerable Australians-with a Centrelink robo-debt program that went after pensioners, students and the disabled-and targets the working class. It's absolutely obscene. Legitimacy does not come with just one vote; it comes through a vision of fairness. For working Australians, penalty rates mean the difference between paying the food bill and the electricity bill. How many on the government benches even understand the choices that some Australians have to make when they have to make a decision between buying clothes for their kids or paying the electricity bill? This is about priorities, and the priorities of this government are all wrong. We, Labor, are focused on the people of Australia and our plans for a better future for this nation. A Shorten Labor government will take action on housing affordability and climate change. A Labor government will deliver budget repair that is fair. And the tragedy of all this, with all the questions this week swirling around about the legitimacy of this government, is that the government is so focused on its own drama, its own conspiracy theories and its own incompetence that it has lost sight of the very reason that it is here, and that is to serve the people of Australia.",116
162,Mr WALLACE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," It's with great joy that I take the opportunity to rise today on this motion, because it gives us the opportunity to paint a picture between white and black, between right and wrong, and between what we stand for and what the opposition stand for. Of course, those opposite are all leaving now! If you look at what this side of the House stands for and what we've been able to deliver in the short time that we've been in government, you'll see that what we stand for is honesty and integrity in government. We have restored the Australian Building and Construction Commission after that lot on the other side of the House decimated it when they were in government. We passed the new Australian Building Code. We passed the registered organisations bill and the corrupting benefits bill. Of course, when we talk about industrial relations, they head for the doors! Mr Ted O'Brien: Run, run!",117
163,Mr WALLACE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Run away, run away-that's right! They know that they have absolutely not a shred of respectability when it comes to industrial relations. It's very sad, because what it's doing is costing our country billions of dollars a year because of the corruption that goes on between the Labor Party and the union movement. Not all unions are corrupt-I accept that-and not all union members are corrupt. What we are against on this side of the House is corrupt unions. What have they given on the other side? What do they stand for on the other side? They stand for secret deals between unions and employers. They stand for corrupt benefits. They voted against our legislation on corrupting benefits. They give away penalty rates. They stand here and they, with the greatest amount of sanctimony, talk to us about",117

But it was in fact Bill Shorten, when he was the head of the AWU, who sold his workers out-the most disenfranchised, the most lowly paid workers. He sold them out; he threw them under a bus. And for what? So that his own AWU could get secret commissions from those same employers they did dodgy deals with. And it turns out there are all sorts of grubby, dodgy deals being done between the AWU and GetUp!, and in fact the Leader of the Opposition, who's seen, as it turns out, payments being made to his election campaigns. To add salt to the wound, they then set out to try to discredit one of Australia's greatest jurists and undermine the Heydon royal commission-very, very sad, particularly when you look at the number of legal professionals on the other side of the House, that they would go and do that. But it's not just about industrial relations. The difference between us and them is stark in relation to taxes. On our side of the House we've got an agenda to provide and promote jobs and growth. We've achieved record job numbers. Just today we've found out that there were 240,000 new jobs in the last financial year, the strongest full-time jobs growth in 40 years, with 210,800 jobs added just in the past six months-and I see the other side have gone awfully, awfully quiet! Unemployment dropped down to 5.6 per cent, with jobs growth at two per cent-10 times the rate of growth. The Turnbull government are all about jobs-make no mistake about that-and we are getting on with the job. But it's not just about jobs; it's about security. We are getting on with the things that are important to Australians, whilst the other lot, over on the other side of the House-what are they concentrating on? They're concentrating on doing things like arguing about two seconds. The member for Watson was arguing about two seconds today.",118

168,Mr GOSLING,BILLS," I will make a couple of unscripted comments on the importance of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Legislation Amendment (Defence Force) Bill 2016. It's not perfect. There could've been some more consultation. But at the end of the day we want to make sure, as I'm sure the government does, that there's less red tape. The less red tape, the better. And if our men and women who have served this country can get a more common sense approach to the handling of their issues under the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, then that's a good thing, and I encourage the minister to re-dedicate himself to that most important task of looking after the men and women who have served our country. Debate interrupted. NA",119
169,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Parramatta Electorate: Local Government",119
170,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT," It was almost this time last year when I stood in this House to speak about the lack of community consultation in Parramatta, and it's a shame, but no surprise, that this has continued. The speed with which the former Baird and now the Berejiklian government have acted, once they abolished our councils, to rip out community infrastructure and sell off public land, is astonishing. Most of their decisions, arguably, would have never made it through an elected council, and they cannot be undone by a newly elected council, come September. They said, for example, that we couldn't have a new stadium without demolishing our memorial pool, a pool paid for and loved by Parramatta residents. The Parramatta pool is gone. Finally, the state government offered to partly pay for a new one outside of the CBD, still many hot summers away, but-surprise, surprise-it is largely the Parramatta ratepayers who paid for the first pool and didn't want it demolished who will now have to pay for the new one. The government has graciously agreed to fund the restoration of historic sites in North Parramatta, including the Parramatta Female Factory. It's disgraceful that those sites, given  their historic significance, are in the state that they are in now, under state care. But, in return, the residents must accept that 2,700 units will be built around and on top of what is a site of both Indigenous and colonial significance. Hundreds of established trees will be uprooted, and public land sold off to the highest bidder. Worst of all perhaps is that this development undermines any move towards World Heritage listing of the female factory precinct. Over 1,000 submissions were made against the proposal. The residents asked for the council's decision on the development control plan to wait until after the council elections in September, at that time just six to eight weeks away. But, rather than wait, the council administrator pushed ahead with a mammoth list of points in what was to be the last ordinary meeting of council before caretaker mode. It was 5½ hours long, with the business papers over 1,300 pages. The administrator said newly elected council members would be duty bound to abide by her decisions. The meeting included major infrastructure projects such as the Parramatta light rail, which will cut through a heritage precinct and requires the demolishing of the popular 188-year-old Royal Oak Hotel. Committee members had to submit speeches to the council verbatim before the meeting was held. Journalist Elizabeth Farrelly, who attended the meeting, wrote this: … if you'd designed a faux-democratic process deliberately to exclude people from deliberating on their own land, in their own city, this would be it. For the last two months of administration, regular council meetings had agenda papers 3,000 to 4,000 pages long. This is what we have had to put up with in Parramatta-decisions made by one person, and community considerations ignored while the state government pushed through their agenda. And this is after decades of neglect. We have a new administrator and, suddenly, we find our community infrastructure and our public land sold off from underneath our feet. Of course, the M4 toll is back. Ten years ago, the M4 toll was removed because the road had been paid for. Now it's back in place for an extra lane between Church Street and Parramatta, charging an extra toll of $4.56 each way just for that section, which means an extra $2,188 per year for every motorist who travels to the city for work five days a week. So you can understand that traffic is now moving off. Our side roads are now chockers, with cars parked on Parramatta Road. Once again, the problem that we had before is back. But, unlike other toll roads in Sydney-because Western Sydney is 'special' to this state government-the increase is not in line with inflation. The M4 WestConnex tolls will increase by four per cent every year up until 2040, nearly twice the level of CPI. The residents of Parramatta and the rest of Western Sydney should not be paying for a road which was already paid for. In large numbers, they are refusing to. We also shouldn't be paying for a road that's going to be built close to the city. Western Sydney gets the toll; the inner city gets a new road-one, I should say, that they don't want either. We also of course have the on-again, off-again relocation of the Powerhouse Museum. I'm running out of time, so I just want to say this to the people of Parramatta: on 9 September, the community of Parramatta has the chance to bring consultation back in a big way with the elections of a new City of Parramatta council. You will have your long-delayed say on the future of Parramatta after 18 months of administration. It's a serious matter. This is our democracy. Choose carefully. Consider who the candidates are. Make sure you know who you are voting for.  I'd like to acknowledge the people of Parramatta who have led the discussions on our city's future, despite the deaf ears of our leaders: the North Parramatta Residents Action Group, who have led the charge against the closure of the pool and rallied to preserve the Fleet Street precinct, especially Suzette Meade; local Darug elders Jacinta Tobin and Kerry Kenton, and others, who are trying to protect the artefacts; Parramatta Female Factory Friends, who continue to push- (Time expired) O'Connor Electorate: Infrastructure Mr RICK WILSON (O'Connor) (16:34): I rise to update the House on some much appreciated federal investment in my electorate of O'Connor. Last week I opened the Cranbrook Community Hub, which received $300,000 in National Stronger Regions funding to leverage $1.3 million of investment to create an incredible multipurpose facility. On 1 September, I will be opening the revamped Tambellup Sports Pavilion, which received over $900,000 in National Stronger Regions funding. The Tambellup sports ground is where I played many a game of football, and I look forward to sharing the dais with one of Tambellup's favourite sons, Richard Goyder. While Richard may not have made his mark as a footy player, he has undoubtedly kicked plenty of goals in the fields of business and philanthropy, and is now the chairman of the AFL. O'Connor has scored more wins in round 1 of the Building Better Regions Fund, receiving over $13.5 million, which will leverage over $37 million worth of investment. One of the projects I am most proud of is a nine-shire collaboration, the Great Southern Housing Initiative, which will receive a massive $10 million to co-fund the construction of 79 housing units across the region. I congratulate the shires of Broomehill-Tambellup, Cranbrook, Gnowangerup, Jerramungup, Katanning, Kent, Kojonup, Plantagenet and Woodanilling, for addressing the economic challenges of providing accommodation in our smaller shires. This grant will fund the construction of 43 units for independent seniors and 36 units for regional employees. Keeping our ageing family members in the regions is always a challenge, so I am thrilled that our valued senior citizens will be able to remain living in the communities they have contributed to all their lives. Quality housing is also very much needed to attract and retain skilled professionals in our smaller towns. The commercial return on rental properties is often insufficient to generate private investment for new builds, so I am pleased to see the federal government giving our shires a hand to alleviate some of the housing shortages in the bush. In the beautiful south west region of O'Connor, we have been fortunate to receive funding for two projects that will drive tourist visitation and grow the regional economy. The Shire of Collie has received $74,131 towards creating a truck stop toilet and recreational vehicle dump point. Collie is an important regional transport link for bringing our fabulous O'Connor produce to port, so it is important our truckies can rest and recharge on their long journeys. Collie is also a growing tourist destination for campers and caravaners, and this dump point is the final requirement for Collie to become an accredited RV-friendly town. In the heart of our magnificent Southern Forests, the Shire of Manjimup has secured a massive $2.7 million toward their South West Energy Experience. This facility will incorporate a museum which will showcase the history of power generation in Western Australia dating back to the 19th century. It will also include a cafe, a function centre and a visitor centre. The total cost of the project is almost $6 million, and it will provide a fantastic  new tourist experience and encourage exploration and enjoyment of the surrounding historic towns, quality wineries and magnificent forests. These Building Better Regions Fund projects continue the government's strong record of investment in the south west, with Manjimup previously receiving $1.6 million in NSRF funding toward the Manjimup Wellness and Respite Community Centre. The town of Williams forms the northern gateway of O'Connor for those travelling along the Albany Highway. I drive through Williams often, as do another 4,000 vehicles every day. The Shire of Williams has received $360,000 for the Williams Lions Park redevelopment project. This $774,000 project will refurbish and enlarge the all-ages playground and upgrade the ablution facilities in the heart of the town. This will encourage travellers to stop, relax and recharge to combat driver fatigue. For families like mine with young kids, it's an opportunity to get out of the car, have a bit of a break and spend a little extra time, and money, in the town. That's what this program is all about-driving economic activity and bringing more people into our regional towns. Last but not least, it was great to see the Goldfields town of Norseman receive nearly $450,000 to co-fund a cultural, visitor and community precinct. Norseman is at the junction of the Eyre Highway and the Esperance Goldfields Highway, with over 500 vehicles a day182,000 per year-stopping in Norseman to rest and refuel. The Shire of Dundas has seized the opportunity to create a precinct that will capitalise on their beautiful woodlands, rich Ngadju culture and Goldfields history, and make Norseman an attractive tourist destination, not just a thoroughfare. This is a project that will certainly drive economic growth in the region. I call on the WA Minister for Regional Development, Alannah MACTiernan, to commit to funding the other 50 per cent of these projects, which had been committed by the previous state government. If we don't get that money, the $37 million worth of projects will not be going ahead. Bass Electorate: Health Care",119
171,Mr HART,ADJOURNMENT," In the time available to me this afternoon I would like to speak about some of the challenges facing my regional community in relation to access to health care. My community is served primarily by a tertiary hospital called the Launceston General Hospital. It is now administered by the Tasmanian Health Service. I was fortunate in my legal career to have served on the governing council of the Tasmanian Health OrganisationNorth, which was previously responsible for the governance of the Launceston General Hospital. We have significant areas of disadvantage within my electorate, particularly in the northern suburbs of Launceston and in the more remote areas away from the Launceston urban areas. Whether you are talking about somebody that suffers from particular disadvantage or somebody who has invested in private health insurance over an extended period of time, there are significant difficulties within my electorate in accessing both public and private health care. As a consequence of that, there are additional pressures upon the public system. We have problems with bed block and we have consistent reports about ambulance ramping at Launceston General Hospital. Of course, those who are familiar with Tasmanian media know that the issue of ambulance ramping affects all of the hospitals within Tasmania. But I'm not here, despite appearances, to simply criticise the Tasmanian Minister for Health, Michael Ferguson. I think it's necessary for there to be a bipartisan approach, not just in the political  sense but also across the public-private divide, in the Northern Tasmania community to attract additional medical specialists to Northern Tasmania. I will explain what the present problem we are facing really means. Because of loss of specialty from the Launceston General Hospital and because of the fact that the two private hospitals servicing the north of Tasmania are operated by the one entity, there is difficulty in attracting medical specialists to Northern Tasmania. Effectively that means that both the public and the private sector suffer from a lack of services and a lack of ability to deliver capacity into the health system in Northern Tasmania. What I would like to see is additional investment by both the public sector and the private sector in attracting talent to Northern Tasmania. What that means is that all levels of government-state, federal and local government-need to work together to attract medical specialists to Northern Tasmania. In my former life I was able to act as legal adviser to a Tasmanian private health insurer. From that experience I know of some of the wonderful initiatives that private health insurers, both Tasmanian based and the larger operators, are offering to the market. A good example is the service that is now offered by St.LukesHealth. Because of the closure of private maternity services in Launceston, St.LukesHealth introduced an innovative postnatal service based out of the Charles Hotel, which is directly opposite the Launceston General Hospital. This was a fantastic example of both the public system and the private system working together to deliver alternative services to fill a gap in the market. We also have significant issues with respect to access to mental health services in the north of the state. This is a pressing issue, whether you are in the public system or the private system. Again, it is incumbent upon both the public system and the private system to work together to solve this issue. I know that people of goodwill are able to work together and deliver local solutions within a regional community like Northern Tasmania. From my experience in serving on the board of the Launceston General Hospital, I know of the many fine people that serve in the administration and clinical areas within the hospital. We owe a debt of gratitude to the specialists, the nursing staff and the ancillary staff that provide our health care on a daily basis. It's vitally important that everybody works together. (Time expired) Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program",122
172,Mr MORTON,ADJOURNMENT," Late last month I had the great privilege to spend time with our Australian Defence Force personnel as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. I visited the Middle East region, including Afghanistan, to learn about Operation Highroad and Okra. Australian troops are performing key roles in the NATO led Resolute Support Mission to train Afghan security forces, as well as Operation Okra, Australia's contribution to combat Daesh or ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The member for Lindsay and I were embedded to live and work with the Australian servicemen and women on their deployment, to experience the challenging aspects of service life and to understand Defence Force capabilities. Like any other ADF member being deployed, we completed reception, staging and onward movement training. This included being briefed on intelligence and operational matters, explosive and first-aid training, weapon handling and shooting on the range. The member for Lindsay outgunned me with the rifle, but I regained my honour with some proficient pistol shooting. We were both pretty good at driving the Australian Bushmaster, an asset that is the envy of other nations.  I was very grateful to learn more about the activities of the Force Support Element, the Expeditionary Airbase Operations Unit and the headquarters of Joint Task Force 633. Air Commodore Guy Wilson, deputy commander of JTF633, gave us a better understanding of operations in the region, and I thank him. Flying into Kabul in the cockpit of our RAAF Hercules, and within Kabul on board the United States Black Hawks, was an experience I will never forget. In Kabul we were hosted by Brigadier Michael Prictor, commander of Task Group Afghanistan, and we got a very good understanding of Australia's role of training Afghan security forces, and of our adviser trainers to the Kabul Garrison Command. We met with Australian Ambassador Richard Feakes and First Secretary Rohan Titus. It was very special to spend time with the troops at the Hamid Karzai base and the Australian base at Resolute Support headquarters, known as ANZAC Cove. I thank Lieutenant Commander Frank Cahill, who gave great insight into ADF life in Afghanistan. We departed Kabul aboard a British C-17 Globemaster of Her Majesty's Royal Air Force, and I was so proud of the reputation of and respect for the ADF within the foreign militaries I encountered. We also spent time at the Air Task Group, hosted by Group Captain Stephen Young, learning about our KC-30A mid-air refuelling tankers and the role the Hornets play in defeating Daesh. We witnessed briefings of the crew before their missions and got to check in on progress later in the day. We also helped to assemble bombs that would be used in the fight against Daesh. Our visit would not have been possible without Major Erica Abend, who escorted us. I thank Erica for her patience and dedication. I have never met anyone who loves coffee so much, and I thank her for her introduction to the 'Bean around the MEAO' coffee shop at Camp Baird. In this place, Labor and Liberal members sit opposite each other in political combat, but as participants in this program, we represent our parliament, not our parties. This program gave me the opportunity to better understand my own colleagues. The member for Lindsay and I are very different people, but the eight days we spent together on this program means that we understand and respect each other better, because we got to learn about the things that motivate us, including our common shared values. There is no doubt the program makes us better parliamentarians, but that's only half of the story. I have the pleasure of welcoming Craftsman Greg Hall into my office this week and into the chamber today. Members of the ADF are hosted by parliamentarians to observe parliament and the work of MPs. Craftsman Hall is currently posted to the Joint Proof and Experimental Unit at Port Wakefield as an electronics technician. He has previously served with the 10th Force Support Battalion in Townsville and the Middle East. Craftsman Hall, I hope you've gained a greater understanding of our parliamentary processes and, indeed, our democracy. The Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program absolutely improves parliamentarians' understanding of the ADF. It enables us, as elected representatives, to be informed in debates on national security and Defence expenditure. I thank the servicemen and women of the ADF in the Middle East. Thank you for your training and briefings, and I thank you for your service to Australia. It was an honour to be able to spend time with you. I am very proud of our Australian troops. I will always have their sacrifice in the front of my mind in my work as the member for Tangney.  Greenway Electorate: Public Transport",123
173,Ms ROWLAND,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to raise a very important quality-of-life issue for local residents in my electorate-namely, accessibility to public transport and, specifically, commuter parking at local train stations. This is one of the single biggest issues raised with me as the local member. I constantly hear accounts of residents who are affected by the chronic lack of parking in our area, particularly at Schofields and Quakers Hill train stations. It has become a fact of life for public transport commuters in north-west Sydney that they face a struggle every morning just trying to find a parking spot. That's before they even board a train to begin their commute, most often to the city, which is about an hour away. We have hundreds of thousands of new homes going into our region and, with an even larger population that needs to commute, it's abundantly clear that we desperately need more parking. Without safe and accessible train stations, and when commuters are parking literally in the next suburb to access their local station or even catching an Uber from where they do park their car to the station, it's understandable that frustrated residents take to the roads. The current parking situation is a strong disincentive for local residents to use public transport. To add insult to injury, the state Liberal government is locking in a massive toll on Western Sydney drivers with the toll being reintroduced on the M4. This is a toll on hard working commuters. And, when commuters decide to try and use public transport instead, what do they have? They simply can't find a parking spot at their train station. I am continuing to lobby the New South Wales government to take meaningful steps to address this pressing issue. If no serious action is taken, and taken urgently, this problem is only going to worsen. A New South Wales parliamentary committee is currently conducting an inquiry into commuter car parking across New South Wales. I made a submission to this committee based on the feedback provided to me by local constituents. Numerous residents from my electorate have also made submissions in order to send a clear message to the New South Wales government about the serious lack of parking at our local train stations. In fact, from the submissions gathered thus far, it appears that almost half of all submissions from the whole of New South Wales to this inquiry have actually originated in my electorate. I would not be surprised if a significant number of the remaining submissions also originated in my local area, because this is a fundamental issue which goes to the quality of life of everyone using public transport in Greenway. The failure to meet growth with infrastructure and services is one of the biggest failures of the Liberal government in New South Wales. The state Liberal member for Riverstone is missing in action on this important issue. He promised 60 additional spaces at Schofields station in 2016, yet residents are still waiting for work to begin on that project. That's not to mention the fact that those 60 spots will go nowhere near addressing the chronic shortage of parking at Schofields station. You are seriously lucky to get a parking spot after 7 am on any given weekday. In the suburbs of Schofields, Riverstone and The Ponds we are seeing rapid development. In an area that was once farmland and agricultural plots we now see large housing estates taking form. We have thousands of new families coming into the area. Precious little is being done to provide adequate infrastructure and community services for residents in terms of public transport. Populations will continue to grow and, without action on commuter parking  at our train stations, this problem will only deteriorate. For this reason we have to take a holistic approach and be innovative in how we use technology, in addition to our infrastructure spending, to improve commuter parking. In practical terms, this could mean using connectivity, sensors, data and smartphone apps to help improve parking options. To give an example, in Manuka, just five minutes from here, smart-parking sensors are being trialled. The real-time data feeds into Canberra parking availability apps that allow consumers to see where parking spaces are free nearby. This idea might sound unremarkable, but even modest improvements can have a very significant impact. Unfortunately, what we've seen from both federal and state Liberal governments is just lip-service to making cities smarter and more liveable. We see the media releases, the glitzy forums and the hype but we barely see any outcomes of substance on the ground and barely anything for those commuters trying to get a park each day. This is simply not good enough. I know that for residents of Greenway the lack of parking means less personal and family time. I know that from personal experience. I am committed to making sure families and communities in my area have better access to commuter parking options. That's why, prior to the last election, the shadow minister for infrastructure and I pledged $5 million under a Labor government to kick-off expanded parking at Schofields station. I'm totally up for working with the New South Wales government if it will only heed the concerns of residents across Greenway and move quickly to increase commuter parking options for our local residents. Bonner Electorate: Roads",125
174,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT," This month saw the release of plans for the Green Camp Road corridor upgrade at Wakerley. I have spoken many times here about this project. That's because it is such a huge win for my electorate. Green Camp Road carries 30,000 vehicles every day. This part of the road network will no longer grind to a halt at peak times, thanks to this vital project. The upcoming works to widen Green Camp Road to at least four lanes between Rickertt Road and Manly Road as well as upgrade the Tilley Road and Rickertt Road intersections will drastically improve peak-hour commute times for thousands of my constituents. Earlier this month, I joined Brisbane Lord Mayor Graham Quirk and local councillors Adrian Schrinner and Ryan Murphy to unveil details of the project. Brisbane City Council is investing $18 million to tackle traffic congestion along Green Camp Road. Thanks to a further $10 million contribution from the coalition government, the scope of the project has been increased to also include capacity and safety upgrades at the Rickertt Road intersection. Construction is expected to start mid-2018 and to be completed in late 2019. It will include: two through-lanes in each direction on Green Camp Road from Manly Road to approximately 180 metres past the Rickertt Road intersection; three through-lanes on Green Camp Road's northbound carriageway at the Tilley Road intersection; signalisation at the Green Camp Road and Tilley Road intersection; the Tilley Road intersection approach widened, with one left-turn and one right-turn lane; two through-lanes on Rickertt Road in each direction over a distance of 200 metres from the Green Camp Road intersection; the Rickertt Road intersection approach widened, with a separate left-turn lane and two right-turn lanes; a new on-road cycling lane and an off-road shared pathway; and raising Green Camp Road and upgrading culverts to improve drainage and flood immunity.  The Green Camp Road corridor upgrade will reduce motorists' commute times up to 50 per cent in the mornings and 35 per cent in the afternoons. It will cut down long peak-hour queues on Rickertt Road and Tilley Road and reduce congestion not only on Green Camp Road but on the arterial roads across the eastern roads network. More importantly, it will deliver safety improvements for thousands of commuters who travel through the area. I applaud the Brisbane City Council's vision and commitment to deliver this infrastructure that will help meet the needs of future generations. I also thank the Minister for Urban Infrastructure, the Hon. Paul Fletcher, and the member for Bowman, my good friend Dr Andrew Laming, for their hard work in securing the federal government's additional $10 million investment. This upgrade wouldn't have been possible without valuable feedback from the public. That is why I'm encouraging my constituents to share their ideas for other vital upgrades in our area by filling out my online infrastructure survey. I appreciate their comments so far which will help secure more important projects for Bonner in the future. Environment: Plastic",126
175,Mr ZIMMERMAN,ADJOURNMENT," Earlier this week, I represented the Minister for the Environment and Energy at a screening in this parliament of A Plastic Ocean, a film which shines a spotlight on one of the globe's great environmental challenges. The film tells us some alarming truths and highlights the magnitude of the damage we have caused to the environment through our failure to properly dispose of plastics. More than eight million tonnes of plastic finds its way into our oceans every year. That's the equivalent of 16 plastic bags for every metre of global coastline, only excluding Antarctica. A plastic bag can take up to 60 years to degrade, and some fishing lines can take 600 years. It is estimated that half the world's seabirds and a third of turtles have plastic in their gut. They live under the constant threat of plastic congestion or entanglement. For us, those plastics enter a food chain which can ultimately end on our plates. The scale of the problem was dramatically highlighted in A Plastic Ocean. It was genuinely shocking and confronting to see magnificent albatrosses and shearers in the Pacific-our own front yard-being dissected following their deaths from plastic consumption. In some cases, their stomachs were hardened and engorged from plastic pieces they had ingested. Scientists in the film were literally scooping a tangle of hard plastic from the stomach cavities. The film, produced by Jo Ruxton and her team, was described by David Attenborough as one of the most important ever made. Australia is uniquely placed to lead on these issues. The largest marine polluters are nations in our own region-China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. We must use regional and international fora to demand that they take action. We must also lead by example. Reducing the impact of waste is the subject of considerable effort by the Turnbull government and the states, where primary responsibility for waste management often lies. Federally, the government is working, for example, to protect and mitigate damage through the Threat abatement plan for the impacts of marine debris on vertebrate marine life. At the state level, we are seeing many jurisdictions implementing container deposit legislation. I am pleased New South Wales is implementing a scheme at the moment. Many of us grew up making extra pocket money by collecting cans. We know that CDL schemes can considerably increase the flow of plastics and bottles to recycling.  Many states have also implemented bans on single-use plastic bags. We should applaud the efforts of retailers-Woolworths, Coles and ALDI-who have announced the phase-out of single-use plastic bags. I hope all states will, however, go further. It's time a ban on single-use bags was implemented in New South Wales, as it has been in many other states. We as individuals can take action by reducing our own use of plastics or by recycling. We owe it to future generations to ensure that we are acting now to tackle this major environmental problem. House adjourned at 17:00 NA The following notice was given: Mr Burke to move: That this House resolves that as there is doubt over the Government's reliance on a single vote in the House of Representatives, all divisions in the House shall be deferred until the House has been advised of the determination of the questions this House referred to the Court of Disputed Returns on 14 August 2017 concerning the constitutional qualifications of the Member for New England.

176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOTICES,Ms Vamvakinou) took the chair at 10:00 NA Broadband,129
177,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Fibre to the node, fibre to the curb, fibre to the premise-three different technologies-and, under the Turnbull Government, it is the luck of the draw which technology is rolled out in your street. In a number of suburbs across Canberra, neighbours are pitted against each other when it comes to broadband. On one side of the street, residents will receive fibre to the node; on the other, residents will receive fibre to the curb or, if extremely lucky, fibre to the premises. In Bottrill Street in Bonython, one side of the street will have fibre to the node; the other, fibre to the curb. Which house would you purchase in that street? It's unacceptable that this government is creating a digital divide in Canberra. The majority of homes in Canberra are slated for fibre-to-the-node broadband relies on the existing copper lines to deliver the service from the node to your house or business. The existing copper lines are already a problem in Canberra. They are degraded, and infrastructure isn't being invested in because, just like winter in Game of Thrones, NBN is coming. During Senate estimates in February, NBN Co conceded there was no capital set aside in the current 30-year NBN business case to upgrade the copper network. Internationally, other countries have moved away from fibre to the node in their rollouts. They recognise that a fibre-to-the-node network produces three times as many faults as a fibre network. This government is doing everything it can to keep moving the goalposts to make a fibre NBN seem as unrealistic as possible. The government had an opportunity to scale up the rollout of fibre to the curb to homes and businesses that had not yet entered into an NBN design or construction pipeline. But, instead, it has ramped up its rollout of the copper network. There will be many who think that fibre to the node is a better alternative to what they currently have, particularly here in Canberra where we are getting of speeds less than one megabit per second. I got an email today from Jenny and Steve. They are getting speeds of 0.15 megabits per second-this in the nation's capital; this in 2017. I ask you this, Deputy Speaker, and I ask Canberra: for the many hundreds of Canberrans who have shared their broadband nightmares and sent me their speeds, so why would they settle for a second-rate NBN? And they shouldn't have to. While I represent Canberra, while I represent this community and while Labor represents you, Canberra won't settle for a second-rate communications infrastructure. If better broadband technologies, like fibre to the curb and fibre to the premises, are being rolled out in some streets to some homes and businesses, then it can be rolled out to every home and business in Canberra. Victoria: Crime",129
178,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," We cannot be silent on crime in Victoria any longer. It's time to call out the shocking crime rise in Melbourne which is costing not only the thousands of Victorians who are victims of violent criminal incidents but also the broader population through rising costs of insurance premiums.  Not a week passes by without another report of a carjacking or a brazen violent daylight robbery by crime gangs here in Victoria. Families living in usually safe suburbs tell me they feel threatened in their own homes and while visiting their local shopping villages. Disappointingly, Victoria has shot to the top of the table as Australia's worse state for claiming insurance for home thefts and for burglaries. Victoria has twice as many claims as New South Wales, despite having two million fewer people. Now, I am a proud Victorian, but this is something that we all should be deeply ashamed of. Statistics from the Insurance Council of Australia reveal an across-the-board jump in car thefts, in burglaries and in home thefts over the past 12 months. Claims relating to car thefts in Victoria are up an extraordinary 62 per cent year on year in the first quarter of 2017. Burglaries and home theft claims in Victoria were worth $92 million, almost twice as much as any of the other states. Vehicle theft in Victoria has resulted in $72 million in claims, higher than any other state. Home and contents claims are up almost 25 per cent in Victoria, compared with just nine per cent in Queensland and two per cent in New South Wales. With people already very sensitive to cost of living pressures, Victorians cannot afford this extra burden. The Victorian Crime Statistics Agency also shows that crime has significantly increased in suburbs throughout Higgins. While law and order is predominantly a state issue, the federal government is doing what it can within its powers to help fight crime, and I will not shirk my duty as a local member. In my electorate of Higgins, we have delivered funds for CCTV cameras in South Yarra, Prahran, Carnegie, Ashburton and very soon Malvern. We have done this throughout Victoria. We have also cancelled the visas of a number of members of the Apex crime gang and will continue to do so where members are not Australian citizens. But it is clear that we need more urgent action from the state government, which has weakened bail and sentencing laws, and reduced frontline police numbers. The Andrews government must act. They must act to safeguard our citizens in their streets and in their homes, and they must act to protect their hip pockets, because they are paying. They are paying, and it is not right. Local Council Elections: New South Wales",129
179,Ms MCBRIDE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On September 9, the Central Coast will finally go to the polls, and not before time. It has been almost a year and a half since Wyong and Gosford councils were sacked and elected councillors were marched out of the buildings on 13 May 2016-part of the New South Wales Liberal government's failed push for amalgamations. I would like to mention the staff who have lived through the merger. They don't deserve the uncertainty that this amalgamation has brought. To candidates standing for council-and I have been there-you have a big job cut out for you. First, get used to 'bureaucratese' or local government speak. I have an original Grass Roots DVD that might help. When I joined Wyong council, I was staggered by the policy for the development of policies. However, even this has been surpassed by the council in administration with the decision to not make a decision. Isn't that a decision? Is this a local government version of strategic patience? Next, scour the briefs, and local government speak makes that tough, but you are there to look out for us.  Check very closely sections that deal with our community assets. As part of the merger, Central Coast Council adopted new fees and charges which have left many community groups much worse off. The Country Women's Association of Tuggerah Lakes had a rate hike but can't get a kerbside pick-up because they are classified as a business. As they tell me, they are a whole lot more than tea and scones, but that is a stretch. Many sporting clubs and community groups have been handed hefty lease agreements with short notice and sharp fee hikes as section 355 committees are dissolved. What about the Berkeley Vale mahjong group? They were recently slugged $3 a week for drawer rental and $8 for cupboards. You will be a quick study in fancy graphs and charts, which can appear to be council speak dressed up with numbers. Take the council's own Gantt chart, charting the progress of its own transformation, which shows we are not even a third of the way through the process. In fact, the only milestone likely to be reached on time was the development of the transformation program plan itself. Finally, I will turn to the serious matters before council. Recent revelations about financial oversight and waste management ring alarm bells, and, like our entire community, I am keen to see strong, local elected representatives. That's why I am backing the local Labor team to rebuild our council, protect our community assets and provide services to all our community. Lisa Matthews in The Entrance, Kyle MACGregor in Wyong and Doug Vincent in Budgewoi lead a formidable team of local activists who have our community's best interests at heart. Bradfield Electorate: Volunteers",130
180,Mr FLETCHER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I am very pleased to rise to speak about the extraordinary contribution made by volunteers in Bradfield in so many different organisations, including: the Ku-ring-gai Art Society, which recently held its annual art awards exhibition; the Ku-ring-gai Historical Society, which has done extraordinary work to acknowledge and document the impact of World War I on our local community; Studio ARTES in Hornsby, which does such a wonderful job serving both young adults and adults with intellectual disabilities; the Ku-ring-gai Youth Development Service, or KYDS, which provides counselling services for young people with mental health issues; all of the local service organisations-Rotary, Lions and so many others-the local scouts and guides; our local sporting organisations; and our clubs-of which there are too many to name them all-including Ku-ring-gai Netball Association, the Ku-ring-gai Amateur Swimming Club and the Northern Suburbs Football Association. In short, Bradfield is very fortunate to have such a strong and rich tradition of volunteering and such an active level of volunteering in so many fields that continues today. Recently, this was acknowledged with DoSomething Day, a collaborative effort between the NewsLocal papers, ClubsNSW and the charity DoSomething, which is designed to shine a light on local community volunteer activities. I was pleased to be able to join Ku-ring-gai Meals on Wheels in a delivery run in the St Ives and Turramurra areas. It was a chance for me to see the work of the volunteers in this fine organisation. With Judy Hales, I visited a number of homes in St Ives and Turramurra. We had the chance to speak to Mr Neville Witten and Mr and Mrs MCKee, and I could see for myself, first hand, the importance of a friendly conversation and the checking-in on how people are doing-as well, of course, as the tangible and valuable physical service of a hot meal.  Meals on Wheels is a wonderful volunteer association that provides three outcomes for the health and well-being of the community: a meal of course-nutrition is so important for elderly people in particular, or those who may be unwell, who may struggle to adequately feed themselves on a regular basis; a general check on the safety and well-being of the Meals on Wheels clients, some of whom may be isolated, lonely or have health issues; and promoting a greater sense of social cohesion, including the benefits that volunteers experience through feeling, quite rightly, that they are performing a valuable service for their community. Meals on Wheels is a wonderful organisation and one of the many wonderful volunteer organisations that serve the community in Bradfield. I congratulate all of the volunteers. Home Care Packages",131
181,Mr NEUMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Recently I went to Cabanda Care, an aged-care facility in Rosewood, where I paid a visit to a constituent of mine, Alan Chriscoli. Alan is 73 years of age and an upstanding member of the Ipswich and Rosewood communities. He arrived in Australia from England as a young man and went on to serve his new country as a member of the Australian Army. Following this, he started a local painting business and developed a reputation as a hard working, skilled tradesman, completing projects right across the Ipswich region, including on some of Ipswich's most iconic buildings. To this day Alan volunteers twice a week at the Rosewood Community Centre, something he's done for the past 10 years. He plays a significant role in his local ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day services and is an active member of his local church. Regrettably, due to a decades-old injury, he has no movement in his legs and he struggles to use his hands, both of which make life extremely difficult for Alan. He uses a wheelchair to get around. In January this year Alan finally sought help from the My Aged Care website and was immediately assessed as being eligible for a level 4 Home Care Package, the highest level of service available-and when I say 'immediately', that was his word. Despite this, Alan is currently only on a level 2 package, which limits him to a few short sessions with a carer a few times a week. This is woefully inadequate for his needs. I've written to the Minister for Aged Care about Alan's case, and I urge the minister to intervene and lend a hand to someone who really deserves it and who has contributed much to our community and to our country. Alan is not alone. We know that right now there are countless Australians who are facing waits of up to 12 months for home care packages they need, on top of excessive delays for assessment. There isn't an MP in this country who hasn't been contacted by someone on a waiting list, I'm sure. The situation is dire for older Australians in need. The report from the Aged Care Financing Authority in 2015 shows level 4 package occupancy rates above 90 per cent. It has gotten worse. In the 2016 report that rate increased to above 92 per cent. The government needs to urgently outline how it intends to meet the continuously growing demand for these places and address the appalling blowouts in time with ACAT assessments that other constituents of mine have told me about. The budget failed to provide relief for those stuck waiting for the assessment and the care they need. Thanks to the government's inaction, more and more people will be forced into residential aged-care facilities or will have to try and make do with inadequate levels of care. We cannot ignore this problem. On behalf of Alan and everyone else in Ipswich and Somerset who aren't receiving the care they should be receiving, I implore the government to do much better for older Australians.  Boothby Electorate: Infrastructure",132
182,Ms FLINT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Thanks to the federal Liberal government we are solving two of the biggest road infrastructure problems in my electorate of Boothby. The first is the Oaklands rail crossing where, for the past 40 years, residents have had to suffer lengthy delays and bottlenecks on a daily basis. I was delighted to join the Prime Minister during the election campaign to announce that our government would be the first ever to provide funding to fix the Oaklands crossing permanently by pledging $40 million for the upgrade. The Turnbull government recently agreed to provide an additional $55 million, bringing the total federal commitment to $95 million, so that this vital road and rail separation can commence. We have also provided 80 per cent of the funding for the Darlington interchange project. This $496 million upgrade will separate two of Adelaide's biggest intersections: Shepherds Hill and Ayliffes roads, which sees 73,000 cars pass through every day; and the Main South Road and Sturt Road intersection, which sees a traffic jam of 98,000 cars a day. During the 2016 election campaign, I also worked hard to secure the related Flinders Link rail project, which will extend the Tonsley rail line up to Flinders University and the medical centre. The Turnbull government committed $43 million to this rail overpass, which will finally connect the Flinders precinct with the city. It will connect Flinders University's Tonsley campus innovation hub with the main campus at Bedford Park. It will also unlock some $2 billion worth of economic growth as Flinders University builds new student accommodation and a health and retail precinct. As my residents in Boothby know, parking at the Flinders Medical Centre and university can be an absolute nightmare. The rail extension will provide an excellent public transport option for students, academics, doctors, nurses and patients and their families to easily get to where they need to be. It will take parking pressure off surrounding streets in Bellevue Heights and it will give residents there and in surrounding suburbs, like Eden Hills, Bedford Park, Aberfoyle Park, Happy Valley and Flagstaff Hill, a brand-new public transport option. Just as importantly, the Flinders Link rail project will also unlock hundreds of millions of dollars in private sector investment, creating much-needed jobs in my electorate of Boothby and also in Adelaide's south. None of this would have been possible without the half a billion-plus dollars of investment from the federal Liberal government. This funding will transform the area in terms of public transport and ongoing jobs. The Tonsley, Darlington and Oaklands projects are precisely the sorts of projects that the government should invest into improve public transport and to unlock private sector investment and jobs in our economy. I fought hard to secure funding for these projects. I am so proud to be making a real difference to the lives of people in my community. Turnbull Government",133
183,Ms HUSAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today, I rise to put on the record my support for all of the people in Lindsay. It is a privilege and a very, very humble duty that I have to serve my community. The people of Lindsay are hard working, decent and honest people, and I say that at every opportunity. What they don't want to see is their hard-earned taxes squandered. That is exactly what they see when they look at the Turnbull government spending $122 million on a sham postal survey. It is exactly what they see when they look at cuts to penalty rates and it  is exactly what they see when they see promises not kept to ensure services are provided in our community. Wages are not rising, but the state and federal coalition governments are ensuring that the cost of living does. There has been a cut of $77 a week to penalty rates, a 20 per cent rise in electricity prices in New South Wales and $9 a day in new taxes for people of Western Sydney, and no funding whatsoever to help the hard working nurses and doctors at the most under-pressure hospital in New South Wales, the Nepean. When will the Liberals who are running this and the New South Wales government fix this? There are a couple of them in here now and I ask them. Now we have a postal survey that we don't need to have. It will mean that $122 million is spent on something that we could deal with right now. The Turnbull government are bereft of ideas and paralysed in thought because they can't follow the laws of the Constitution dated 1901 or they think they're above the law. A government member interjecting",133
184,Ms HUSAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,I will take that interjection. Maybe you should have come to the Power of Speech and the breakfast this morning to support the kids living with hearing loss.,134
185,Unknown,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Honourable members interjecting,134
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,Order! Order!,134
187,Ms HUSAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"They think that they are above the law. The people of Lindsay are offering them some fresh inspiration. That $122 million could go a long way, and my constituents offer some free advice to those opposite. Overwhelmingly, they want $122 million spent on health, education, domestic violence resources and disability services, and affordable housing wouldn't go astray either. That $122 million could buy 175 houses for families in Penrith. Cassandra Way, Shell O'Mal and Becky Bailey wanted funds for teachers and nurses. More teachers would be a great idea, and $122 million would provide 1,906 New South Wales public teachers on an average salary of $64,000. Sharon Carter and Katie Fahey supported more funds for specialised teachers and assistance for children with disabilities. That $122 million would go a long way towards establishing and servicing the needs of the women's community shelters. People like Sharon Levy, Bec Jarett and Natalie Felvy would agree, and they are heading up my amazing committee. Do you know what else they say? They say, 'How about politicians'-who are paid very, very well, I might add-'get on with it and do the job that they're actually paid to do: respect the Constitution, respect the job and the position they hold and let the free vote pass this parliament.' Calare Electorate: Community Groups",134
188,Mr GEE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Calare electorate is made up of many dedicated, hard working and passionate community groups. I would like to recognise a number of them today. Firstly, there is the Capertee Progress Association. I'd like to make special mention of the president, Graeme Pike; vice-president, Judy Eckersley; secretary, Dorothy Pike; treasurer, Lyn Stanford; and members, Bill Leuffen, Rachel Trounson, Colette Parr, Dave Eckersley, Judith Amey, Joyce Kirk, Anne Rohrich, Lyn Vidler, Kathy Grimshaw, Jason Grimshaw, May Barnes, Sam Price, Anne Barnes, Linda Stoev, Kelly Jackson and Stan Stanford. The Capertee Progress Association have been extremely busy in the last 12 months. It's their goal to ensure the prosperity of the community, so they have started train rides into  the valley. The Capertee Valley is indeed something special. It's the second largest canyon in the world. It's just one kilometre wider than the Grand Canyon. In August last year, they began train rides into the valley for high tea. Another was held in May and planning is underway for their third train ride in November. It is an extremely popular event. I would like to congratulate them for the great work they do. I'd also like to congratulate the Cullen Bullen Progress Association and make special mention of the president, Carol Banks; vice-president, Agnes Tilley; secretary, Elaine Deveigne; and treasurer, John Caesar. They are famous for their Back to Cullen events. Every two to three years, the association invites former residents back to the community that they grew up in. The reunion involves entertainment and dinner. Between 250 and 300 people come home for the event. It's wonderful community organisations like these which keep our country communities going, just like the Wellington PCYC. It has more than 500 members and an amazing team, including the club manager, Matthew Devenish; the youth case manager, Senior Constable Leigh Davy; the gymnastics instructors, Katherine Bell and Jenny Jones; coordinator, Wendy Ambachtsheer; the Bluestar participants, Sarah Samut-Hayter and Peter Sarsfield; and youth volunteers, Ellie Campbell and Georgia Knijff. They do wonderful work in the Wellington community, particularly with our young people, and they need to be acknowledged here today. Lastly, I'd like to thank and acknowledge the Gulgong Pioneers Museum. My parents visited there just last week. I'd like to make special mention of president, Marie Gorrie; senior vice-president, Chris Fies; junior vice-president, Arthur Johnson; secretary Bronwyn Assaf; treasurer, Karen Reedy; and committee members, Gene Monaghan, Penny Pinnock, Alan Rickwood and Marlene Roach. The Gulgong Pioneers Museum is home to a range of memorabilia from Australia's pioneering days. It's one of the leading museums in Australia, I think. It also has one of the best printing displays in New South Wales. We thank the Capertee and District Progress Association, the Cullen Bullen Progress Association, the Wellington PCYC and the Gulgong Pioneers Museum for their contribution to our great country communities. Keep up the great work. Deputy Prime Minister",134
189,Ms BIRD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today we sit in this place on the last sitting day of this week of parliament and what a week it has been. We have seen this week the blatant display of the absolute double standard of the government in how they apply rules when they are involved, as opposed to how they apply rules when ordinary constituents in my electorate are affected. We started this week on Monday with the most extraordinary outcome of the parliament having to unanimously carry a motion to refer the Deputy Prime Minister of this nation to the High Court for a determination on whether he is actually eligible to sit in this place. The rules in that circumstance are in the Constitution. The Deputy Prime Minister said, when he was happy to jump on the bandwagon on the back of Greens senators having to resign: 'They are black and white. It's just sloppiness that would mean that you weren't complying with them.' Now, when he himself is caught up in this situation, it's a different situation. We have heard that there's a problem with the rules. They aren't really reflective of what they should  be. We've heard that there's a problem with how you interpret those rules. We've heard that perhaps he didn't actually know about the rule or the circumstance in which he found himself. Of course, we have heard the perennial final excuse by this government-it's all Labor's fault. Somehow this extraordinarily unprecedented and ridiculous situation they have got themselves in is all Labor's fault. The Deputy Prime Minister at the very least should have stood aside from his executive positions, as Senator Canavan did, because the outcome of his continuing in that role with the situation in the House of Representatives with a one-seat majority has been that we have seen legislation pass that has directly affected constituents in my electorate. Let's not talk about all of those constituents who this government sent threatening and distressing letters to about their compliance with Centrelink requirements, the vast majority of whom were found to have complied with the rules. It was okay to come down like a ton of bricks on them in those circumstances, but it's a different set of rules when government members are involved. Let's not forget that one of those one-vote majority votes took penalty rates off people in my electorate. Over 10,000 of them lost their penalty rates on one vote. The government continue to say that they can operate without complying with the rules in a way that they never extend to ordinary people like my constituents. Joondalup Health Campus",135
190,Mr GOODENOUGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I thank the Minister for Health for visiting the Joondalup Health Campus in my electorate recently to view the hospital's success as a publicprivate partnership. Together with the member for Pearce, we discussed the critical need for the next stage of the hospital's expansion in order to meet future population growth in our northern suburbs. The hospital's CEO, Kempton Cowan, lead a tour of the campus, accompanied by Deputy CEO Dr Amanda Ling and Operations Executive Manager Kevin Cass-Ryall. A boardroom presentation summarised key elements of the hospital's successful public-private partnership and provided an overview of the hospital's operations and proposed capital expansion plans. The local population of the cities of Joondalup and Wanneroo, which the hospital services, is growing rapidly. Forecasts indicate that the population in the northern corridor will exceed 550,000 residents by 2036. The need for more funding to expand the hospital's emergency department and provide more inpatient beds, including mental health beds, must be addressed as a priority. Currently the hospital has 716 licensed beds, 12 operating theatres and one of the busiest emergency departments in Australia, with close to 100,000 presentations each year. In 2016-17, the hospital carried out some 32,013 procedures and attended to 3,782 births. The hospital is under significant pressure, particularly over winter periods, and urgently needs an expansion in capacity to meet the specialist medical needs of a growing residential population. Ramsay Health Care has developed a proposal designed to provide the necessary infrastructure to meet the projected demand. The current expansion plans presented to the health minister include 145 new private beds, an additional 50 beds in the day procedure unit, 90 new public hospital beds, eight new operating theatres, a central plant expansion and more parking facilities. The construction cost for the upgrade is approximately $312 million, of which the Western Australian state government has committed $167 million, leaving a $145 million shortfall.  I strongly make the case in parliament for $145 million in financial assistance from the federal government to support the expansion of the Joondalup Health Campus. Upgrading our regional hospital will predominantly service the health needs of residents from the four neighbouring electorates of Pearce, Moore, Cowan and Stirling. (Time expired)",136
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," If no member present objects, constituency statements may continue for a total of 60 minutes. Esso Longford: Workplace Relations",137
192,Ms CHESTERS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This week in parliament we've had a visit from Esso workers-Exxon Mobil workers-based at the Longford facility in Gippsland, Victoria. Who is Exxon Mobil-Esso? They are one of those large multinationals-in fact, the sixth-largest in the world-that's not paying any tax in this country, yet last year they made $8.6 billion in offshoring Australian gas and oil. So they are a company doing incredibly well off the back of Australian resources. Up until recently, workers within their organisation-within their facilities-shared some of that wealth. However, recently, Exxon Mobil have got greedy. They are now attacking their workers through loopholes in the Fair Work Act. We have heard that they have offered the new contract to a labour hire company that wants to cut the pay of these workers-who work offshore in dangerous conditions-by 30 to 40 per cent. It is wrong. They want to change the rosters-again, reducing take-home pay-which creates problems within family units by not giving people time with their families or certainty going forward. They've said to these workers, 'It's a take-it-or-leave-it scenario.' The workers, many of whom have worked for Esso for a long time, have refused. Now the company is refusing to bargain with them in good faith. It's summed up by Troy Carter's son. Troy came here and talked about the dispute and what it would mean for their family, if they accepted this take-it-or-leave-it contract-and it would mean loss of pay. His son said, 'Dad, why is your boss taking money from us?' After thinking about it for while, Troy replied, 'The truth is my boss is greedy.' It's not a very nice answer, but it's the truth. He says he was brought to tears when his son then came back to the kitchen, poured his money bank onto the table and said, 'Don't worry, Dad. Here's all the money we need.' As the family said, 'If our children can understand this, how come the company can't?' This dispute is all about corporate greed. There are problems and loopholes in the Fair Work Act, yet the government is refusing to do anything about it. The only intervention that we've seen from Fair Work is to order the workers to take down Scabby the Rat-take down a protest rat-rather than actually force the company into genuine, good-faith bargaining about restoring pay and conditions. Esso is not short of a dollar. They are not paying any tax in Australia, and now they're ripping off their workers. It's time this government acted. Hinkler Electorate: Aged Care  would like to present to the Federation Chamber this morning some of the facts about agedcare funding to my electorate-and these are the facts, not the beat-up. Federal government funding for aged care in Hinkler has actually increased by almost $3.7 million from 2014-15 to 2015-16. In fact, overall federal government funding in aged care will grow by six per cent each year for the next four years, with an estimated $12½ billion provided for residential aged  care in 2017-18. The residential care funding per resident for the sector has increased. It has gone up from $63,450 in 2015-16 to $65,456 in 2016-17. In the most recent aged-care approvals round funding-and this is the absolute reality-my electorate has received an additional $37 million since 2014. That includes $11.4 million for aged-care services for an additional 174 residential care places-144 of those at The Lakes aged care in Bundaberg, which is a new service; 30 residential care places for Kalkie in Bundaberg, which are additional places. It includes $17 million for funding for aged-care services in the 2015 round-144 places for BUPA Bundaberg at Avoca, which is a new service; 90 residential care places for Regis Hervey Bay, which is a new service; and 44 residential care places for Anglicare Meilene in Bundaberg east. And it includes $8.6 million in the 2014 round-32 home-care packages for Churches of Christ in Bundaberg, a new service; 25 home-care packages for Kepnock Grove Retirement Centre; 96 retirement care places for Carinity at Bargara, a new service; and 30 residential care places for Ozcare in Hervey Bay. This is an extensive increase. For those who are concerned about aged care who do have problems, and there are always challenges in large services, please use the Aged Care Complaints Commissioner on 1800550552 or via their website. They are there to receive complaints. I do have a complaint of my own, and that is around ACAT assessments. Some years ago, I stood in this chamber and said that the level of ACAT assessments in my electorate was not high enough and that it was taking far too long for people who are in very difficult circumstances. As I'm sure you know, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvanikou, when a decision is made by an individual to move into residential aged care, it is very, very difficult. The waiting list at the moment has moved out to as long as six months. Six months is completely unacceptable to me. The Commonwealth engages state and territory governments to provide those assessments. We subsidise those services through the Aged Care Act 1997. We cannot continue to have this type of extension for people who are in a very difficult situation-we simply cannot. I say to the Labor government in Queensland: just because we are in a regional area, that should not matter; get yourself sorted. We need these assessments completed. I will be meeting with Community Care Network in Bundaberg next month to see just how significant this problem is. Corio Electorate: Vietnam Veterans Day",137
193,Mr MARLES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last Sunday, I had the a honour of attending a service at the Geelong war memorial. It was a memorial for Vietnam Veterans Day, which is this Friday. On 18 August 1966, 108 Australian and New Zealand men of Delta Company 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment were on patrol in South Vietnam near the abandoned village of Long Tan and they found themselves in contact with an enemy force of 2,000 enemy soldiers. Facing overwhelming odds in horrendous conditions, the bravery and gallantry they showed made the Battle of Long Tan became one of the iconic Australian stories of the Vietnam War. Long Tan now stands as an exemplar of Australian soldiers displaying the bravery, teamwork and endurance shown at ANZAC Cove, Tobruk, and Kapyong. There are soldiers from this battle living in and around the country, including the Geelong region, and we remain ever thankful for their service. As we approach 51 years since the Battle of Long Tan, it is easy for time to dim the lessons of Vietnam for those who did not serve. Time does not have the same effect on veterans. They  remember their mates, their loneliness, their fear, their loss, their duty to each other and, most importantly, their desire to come home. As a country, we haven't done as well as we should have for these veterans when they did return home. Many Vietnam veterans were forced to look after their own and to help out their mates. The Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia was formed to provide the mutual support and advocacy many veterans needed to tackle the physical and mental challenges they faced. Geelong was amongst the first associations established in Australia, and it remains a strong organisation contributing to the community. In 1987, following the long overdue welcome home parade for Vietnam veterans, then Prime Minister Bob Hawke decreed Vietnam Veterans Day a key commemorative activity in the national calendar. This recognised the long march veterans and their families faced to garner national support and respect for their sacrifice. Falling on the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, it serves as the focal day to acknowledge and pay respects to all those who served in all theatres of Vietnam from 1962 to 1975. I am honoured to stand here to commemorate Geelong and Australia's Vietnam veterans and thank them for the legacy of their efforts in the years since returning home. Our war commemorations are never about glorifying war. They are about remembering-remembering what it means to sacrifice for friendship, for family and for country; remembering the men and women who have devoted and continue to devote their lives not to themselves but to us all. Remembering the debt of gratitude is measured by our actions long after the last shots are fired. I acknowledge Commander Sam Woolrych, who is in the chamber today with me as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program. I am indebted to him for preparing this speech. Australian Chinese Community Association of New South Wales Oatley 101 Society of Artists",138
194,Mr COLEMAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," On 20 July I attended the 43rd anniversary dinner of the Australian Chinese Community Association of New South Wales, or ACCA, as it is well known. It was a great evening, celebrating ACCA's tremendous achievements over its long history, and it was terrific to be there. ACCA provides a range of social services, including inhome care support for older Australians of Chinese background, support groups, meals services and a range of other activities. It is a diverse service provider for Australians of Chinese background. With about 17 per cent of all people in my electorate being of Chinese background, ACCA is a particularly important group and is very valued in our community. I'd like to recognise the president of ACCA, Shirley Chan, and thank her for all the work that she does, and recognise the vice presidents, Tim Feng, Daniel Kwan and Theresa Liang, for their contributions to ACCA. I'd also like to commend Ted Seng, the general manager of ACCA, for all of his ongoing efforts. ACCA is a great organisation, with a long track record of doing good work in the Chinese community. On 4 August I attended the members exhibition opening night at the Oatley 101 Society of Artists. Oatley 101 is a unique group in my electorate. It is an in-house group of resident artists who come together at a former scout hall in Oatley West and learn about painting and a range of different forms of art. It's a very active group, with about 200 members. Oatley 101 holds an annual exhibition to showcase the work of members and other artists. It is always a great night, and the exhibition is judged by a professional artist. The society has been around  since 1997 and does great work in the Oatley area. I'd like to congratulate Ann Clark, who was awarded best in show for her work at the awards evening. I'd also like to thank the local businesses that sponsor Oatley 101. It's really important that these small businesses back Oatley 101, because it is a very valuable part of our community. So, to PRDnationwide Oatley, St George Maso's, The Gardens on Forest, Galluzzo's pharmacy and Jenny Bates Hair Studio, at Penshurst, thank you for your support of Oatley 101. Most of all, I'd like to thank Geraldine Taylor, the president of Oatley 101, who does an extraordinary amount of work in holding together a really important group in our community. Newcastle Volunteer Service Awards",139
195,Ms CLAYDON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In my electorate last week, I was very proud to host the Newcastle Volunteer Service Awards for the fourth time. This is a great event, which always reminds me just how fantastic the city of Newcastle is and just how many people in our community are genuinely committed to giving back, to ensure that our community is the very best we can be. I also know, from experience, that, despite our increasingly busy lives, the number of Novacastrians who are now volunteering in our community is increasing. This fact is backed up by recent data from the census. In 2011 the census said that 16.2 per cent of Novocastrians undertook volunteering activities. From the census last year, this has grown to almost 19 per cent, and I am really proud to say that this is above both metropolitan and state averages. Newcastle people are really punching above their weight. The awards ceremony this year was the biggest it's ever been. There were close to 200 attendees and over 100 Novocastrians recognised for their service to our community. We had an exceptional field of nominees in the categories of sporting service, school service and community service. People were recognised for an incredible range of activities they undertake in Newcastle. They patrol our beaches. They support our teachers to educate the next generation in our schools. They beautify and maintain our public spaces. They contribute to the rich artistic and cultural life in our city. They provide care and companionship to other Novocastrians. They give up their time to train our young athletes. They raise much-needed funds for community organisations, and some even set up their own community organisations. This year two fabulous groups were also nominated for awards. The first group was the volunteer team at the Hunter Community Legal Centre, a team of law students and graduates who selflessly give their time and experience so that the centre can provide free legal services to the most disadvantaged in our community. The second group to be recognised was the incredible army of dedicated volunteers who helped save the Birmingham Gardens Regal Cinema from almost certain demise. The cinema's story is a tale of community triumph against the odds. In 2007, it closed down because of council safety concerns and was marked for demolition. It was only saved by the hard-fought community campaign and the extraordinary work of volunteers. All the volunteers who were recognised last week play an important part in enriching our city. I know they don't do it for the recognition or thanks, and some were very embarrassed to be nominated, but they deserved to be. Wright Electorate: The Royal Queensland Show",140
196,Mr BUCHHOLZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It is wonderful to see my electorate so strongly represented this year at the Brisbane Ekka, a wonderful locality. In my electorate, the biggest contributor to GDP is agriculture, and the Ekka is the biggest showcase in Queensland where city meets the bush. It is a wonderful place. I particularly draw attention to the local councils  in my electorate-Lockyer Valley Regional Council, under the leadership of Mayor Tanya Milligan; and Scenic Rim council, under the leadership and mayoralty of Greg Christensenfor the work they do advocating in the horticultural space. They have some amazing displays. The Ekka is an opportunity for our local artists, bakers, gardeners and photographers to exhibit their talents and handicrafts and put them up against the best in the state. It is a chance for our equestrian champions to compete in the ring against the best in the state and for our auctioneers to make their sale and show their wares. Our animal lovers can showcase their dogs, poultry and cattle while our local growers feature their produce, stamping our region's claim to be the 'Salad Bowl of Australia'. The Ekka is an opportunity for like-minded people to connect and forge long-lasting relationships, and often they only get the opportunity to catch up once a year at the Ekka. Congratulations to the successful exhibitors from my electorate. A special mention to the Haag family from Teviotville, who created a prize-winning Moreton District exhibit, taking out the best collection of exhibits from the districts. And of course special mention should also go to Tom and Joy Surawski from Boonah, who took out the champion pen of three steers and heifers in the prime beef section. Tom, I know, would have already started backgrounding next year's steers for the competition, and they probably already have 30 days under their belt. Bookending at the Ekka are our own agricultural shows within the electorate. It was my pleasure to open more recently the Boonah and Kalbar shows earlier this year, and the countdown is on for the Canungra show and rodeo on 26 and 27 August; and the Beaudesert Show, which will bring the community together on 8 and 9 September. Local shows are where family traditions are made and childhood memories are passed down through generations. I congratulate everyone who exhibited, competed or attended this year's Ekka, and I look forward to seeing you again at the Canungra or Beaudesert shows. In closing, I want to thank the tireless volunteers who put in hours to help our show societies become a reality. I want to acknowledge the work that our judges do, which is often a thankless task. I want to thank the stewards and officials who give countless hours volunteering. I want to thank the competitors and exhibitors, who come from all around the state to compete against the best. All of them help the city meet the bush, and I hope everyone has a great Ekka. Medicare",140
197,Ms LAMB,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Australian people really do cherish Medicare. It really is the pride of our nation. People are proud that, regardless of who you are and how much you earn, Medicare is there to support you. If you ever get sick or if you injure yourself, there will be support to get you back on your feet, back to work or back to school. But, for whatever reason, and I'm yet to determine why, this government is out to undermine it. And I know it's not the first time that that has happened. Coalition governments have historically tried to dismantle Medicare, touting that they would rather Australia be subjected to an American-style system. This absolutely makes no sense at all to me, and I know it makes no sense at all to my constituents. I've had plenty of Longman locals come to me fearful of what the government would do if Labor wasn't opposing cuts to Medicare and holding them to account. They live in fear about  their precious Medicare and what it means to them and their families. So that's what I'm doing today-standing up for my constituents of Longman, standing up for Medicare. I'm standing up to tell the government to keep their hands off Medicare. Universal health care is a basic right. It's a basic right for the five-day-old baby who has just been brought home at Narangba-it's a basic right for that infant. It's basic right for the 15-year-old student who went to school today at Burpengary State High. It's a basic right for the 35-year-old early childhood educator who went to work today in Morayfield and educated our young children. And it's a basic right for our 75-year-old farmers out at Woodford or our 75-year-old retired rail workers on Bribie Island. It is a right to be healthy, no matter what your income. Recently released data shows that the median personal income in my electorate is $580 a week. People who are earning $580 a week cannot afford to pay more for health care. For some people, it means that they have to forgo it. And it's a story I've heard many times before. It is not fair that low-income Australians have to make a decision between whether they get health care to get well or to fix an injury, or whether they eat. It is not fair. It is not right. It is not the type of society that people in Australia want to live in. They don't want it for themselves; they don't want it for their families. I cannot stress enough how important the Medicare system is for people all over Australia and, like I said, in particular for people in my community. It wasn't that long ago that Prime Minister Abbott stood up and promised no cuts to Medicare before turning around and doing just the opposite. I'm standing up today and telling this government: keep your hands off our Medicare. Australia Day",141
198,Ms BANKS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Australian sense of humour is unique. It has come to be part of the Australian fabric. January in Australia wouldn't be the same without the lamb ad, the traditional Australian advertisement for Meat & Livestock Australia. A small group of people complained and moaned about it, but the vast majority of Australians loved it-as we love our lamb. If I had to say what is one key thing I love about my role as the member for Chisholm, I would say, unequivocally, that it's the diversity of its people, overlaid with the great, unique Aussie sense of humour in this our free country. With diversity comes a richness and vibrancy that is something to be treasured and celebrated. Australia Day is a traditional day for all Australians, especially given that one of the things we subliminally celebrate is our freedom to enjoy our cultures, traditions and a mix or merge of them. What I object to, vehemently, is how Labor and the Greens seek to apply negativity to anything that is positive. In my humble beginnings of immigrant heritage, I grew up in a family that didn't have much but that lived with optimism and faith in this country. And so do those in my electorate, whether they are of Malaysian, British, Chinese, Indian, Korean, Greek or Italian heritage. Any advanced democracy would have positive and negative elements in their story. The complexity and tragedy of our Indigenous past and the mistreatment of Indigenous Australians should be recognised by everyone. But Australia Day is not and should not be about being political and picking a side-and the negative side-as Labor and the Greens now constantly do.  One of my greatest joys is attending citizenship ceremonies. My first Australia Day citizenship ceremony as the member for Chisholm was this year. I looked at the sea of proud, happy and excited faces from all over the world. In these faces, I saw the same optimism and faith that my family, who didn't have much, and that many families of immigrant heritage have enjoyed over the years. Their faces changed when the Greens politician who spoke said it would be 'remiss of her' not to mention that this was really invasion day. She took it upon herself to make it negative, politicise it and ruin the celebratory positive vibe and moment for these future citizens of our country. I'm told that, on the same day, the Leader of the Opposition sought to politicise and instil a negative tone in his speech on Australia Day. This is what the Greens and those on the other side seek to do: to make anything positive negative. Although I have the honour of attending many citizenship ceremonies now, the most special for me was my husband's ceremony on Australia Day in the late nineties. Our children were toddlers, and my mum and late father were there. My father said to my kids, 'Your daddy is doing what I did in the same town hall in 1958. He's become an Aussie.' We went home and we had a barbie, ate mum's spanakopita, some lamb and some lamingtons that my kids helped me bake. Thank you. Aged Care",142
199,Mr ZAPPIA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I have previously spoken in the House about elder abuse, a problem within society that appears to be getting worse. It seems that whichever way one turns older Australians are being taken advantage of-particularly with regard to their finances. Since 2013 the coalition government has consistently sought to cut payments and services to older people. Were it not for the Labor opposition the cuts would have been much deeper. The private sector has been equally ruthless. Energy companies are exploiting older people with their energy contracts, and then there are businesses that now charge to mail out accounts. There are even charges being applied for payment of accounts if the electronic transfer payments systems are not used. That forces older people to become internet technology users, which in turn leaves them vulnerable to internet scammers. I have personally spoken with older people who have had tens of thousands of dollars stolen from them by very clever internet scammers. There are two areas which are of particular concern to me. Firstly, there are the rip-offs that are now occurring in the retirement village sector, with some unethical operators fleecing residents of tens of thousands of dollars in exit fees. Again, I have had to intervene personally in some of those matters. In some cases we have been successful in getting back the money. The recent Four Corners program highlighted this matter. Whilst it is largely a state government responsibility, it is time that the federal government also stepped in and led the way with uniform national laws. The federal government has its own questions to answer, especially in relation to the extraordinarily long waiting lists for ACAT assessments and aged-care packages-particularly level 3 and 4 packages, which are virtually not available. I heard the member for Blair speak earlier about this very matter. When packages are allocated, it also seems that most of the money is swallowed up by administration fees charged by the provider, leaving very little money for real services.  Lastly, there are real and widespread concerns about the disgraceful level of care being provided by some residential aged-care facilities. I stress the word 'some' because there are some good operators in the sector. Clearly, the government-approved accreditation agencies are failing in their duty as much as the bad providers are. How they fail to detect the problems is beyond my comprehension. Older people deserve much better than they are getting from this government, and it is time that the government stepped up and showed them the respect they deserve by giving them the support they need. Page Electorate: Schools",143
200,Mr HOGAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Baryulgil Public School community are used to celebrating the success of their students. On Saturday, they will celebrate the 100th anniversary of their school. Life was very different in 1917 when Baryulgil Public School first opened its doors to the local community. There was no electricity, no computers, nor many other things that we take for granted today. It promises to be a great day, with a welcome to country by Heather Monaghan, and with Aboriginal education officer Lynette Donnelly speaking. Former school principals Bruce Robinson and John Duroux are also returning for the celebrations. The honour of cutting the all-important commemorative cake has been given to Patricia Simmons, Heather Monaghan and Kiarla Yuke. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the school principal, Gary Barton, Kayleen Stephenson and the school committee, who have been working hard to ensure the day is a success. I know they have a huge range of activities planned for the centenary, with over 250 people expected to attend the event. I'm looking forward to the day. It's going to be a wonderful day to celebrate. I'd like to congratulate the 45 students from my community who recently graduated from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Secondary Schools Cadet Program and their eight cadet mentors. This 10-week program for Year 9 and 10 students teaches the cadets skills such as basic firefighting and fire safety as well as developing an appreciation for community and the important role of emergency services. It also teaches them life skills, such as confidence, team work, leadership and initiative. Three schools in the Clarence Valley offer this cadet program; they are the Clarence Valley Anglican School, the South Grafton High School and the Maclean High School. I'd like to acknowledge the graduating recipients from the Maclean High School: Katherine Behn, Katie Carr, Caitlin Cunningham, Jesse Davis, Eden Duggan, Thomas Everson, Sarah Kurdi, Anika Moran, Shannon Moran, Ellie Nagle, Jesse Shepherd, Angus Thompson, Flynn Versace, David Walsh, Aaron Wescott and William Woods. Their mentors were: Caleb Clarke, Kiani Clarke, Alycia Goad, Lindi Martin, Charlotte Ringland, Mya Smith, Ben Soden and Clais Szekely. From South Grafton High School we had the students Monique PetchDorrington, Kate Burt, Toby Henderson, Domonic Kennedy, Jarrod Chalker, Kirstian Knight, Adam Barrett, Emma Spencer-Purss, Nick Worley, Ryan Williams, Accarlia Davey, Bianca Staggard and Paul Hewitt. The graduating recipients for the Clarence Valley Anglican School were Georgina Munro, Malea Ensbey, Kiara Clark, Faith Sullivan, Zach Cahill, Dylan Freeman, Jono Wilks, Dane Collis, Josh Pattison, Jaeben Loy, Will Griffioen, Declan Keam, Jackson Craig, Deakin Ryder, Sinead Buist and Josh Wilks. I congratulate everyone involved. ",144
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The time for members' constituency statements has concluded. NA Gibson, Hon. Brian Francis, AM Consideration resumed of the motion: That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 15 August 2017, of the Honourable Brian Francis Gibson AM, a senator for the state of Tasmania from 1993 to 2002, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",145
202,Mr ANDREWS,CONDOLENCES," I rise to mark the death of the Hon. Brian Francis Gibson, senator for the state of Tasmania from 1993 to 2002, and to convey my condolences to his wife and family. Brian was born in Melbourne. He was educated at St Patrick's College, Ballarat, and then completed studies at the University of Melbourne. Prior to coming here in 1993, Brian had led a long and distinguished career, notably in Tasmania. That included being chairman of the Hydro-Electric Commission and being involved with the board of the Australian Newsprint Mills, the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation, and the National Association of Forest Industries. He also served as a member of the council of the University of Tasmania. Brian was elected to the Senate in 1993. He came here two years after I did. His vast experience and, indeed, his range of talents were almost immediately recognised when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, an office he held from 1994 to 1996, when the Howard government won power. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in 1996, before falling foul to what I think is generally regarded these days as a far-too-narrow ministerial code-one of a number of ministers in that early year of the Howard government that suffered under the breadth of a ministerial code subsequently changed and not gone back to at that level by any government ever since. Despite that loss of office, Brian remained optimistic. He remained a great contributor to this parliament during the remaining years, which he served in the Senate for the people of Tasmania until 2002. After leaving parliament and the Senate, Brian subsequently served on many business and charitable boards and made a continuing outstanding contribution not just to people in Tasmania but more broadly to the people of Australia. I always found Brian to be an impressive person: very thoughtful, a friendly and considerate person who was interested in the good of others and, indeed, the welfare and the future of the people of Australia. I extend my condolences to his wife, Pauline, and to his family. He was a great Australian. May he rest in peace.",145

207,Ms RYAN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to celebrate some Australian heroes that I met in my office yesterday. I met with Esso workers and members of the Australian Workers' Union. I have come in here today to tell their story, because they are Australian heroes. These are unionists fighting for their jobs. They are Esso workers from the maintenance crew. They all reside in Sale, where 220 workers have been told that they can accept lower pay rates and accept a pay cut of between 17 and 40 per cent without guaranteed rosters, through a loophole in the Fair Work Act which allows companies to bring in labour hire companies to employ their workers for them. These workers are standing up for their safety record. These workers are the maintenance crews that have done so well for Esso. It is an absolute betrayal that they would be in this situation. Of course, it is in the frame where we have growing inequity in this country. Wages are at record lows in terms of growth. An article in today's Sydney Morning Herald quoted Australian Bureau of Statistics data which, on Wednesday, showed that wages grew by just 0.5 per cent in the June quarter in the private sector. This is what these workers are standing up for. It is an outrage. This is happening across our country; it is endemic. These workers will join young people in my electorate who have only casual work and who have had their work made insecure. The impact on their families and their community will be huge. They are doing what the Reserve Bank governor says workers should do: they are demanding more of their company's profits-not forgetting that we couldn't find a more profitable business than Esso in this country. Their profits are skyrocketing, yet they are actively seeking to drive down the wages and conditions of these workers. So, for me, these men are heroes. I spent some time with them and talked about their families and the impact on their community. They are from Sale. We know that Gippsland is under enormous stress. We know that there are jobs that have gone already. We know about the paper mill issues. There are issues down in Gippsland that are getting a lot of attention here, but there's not a lot of attention going to the catering staff at Esso who have already been sacked and replaced by people on lower wages. This is a critical moment in Australia's history. The pendulum has swung too far. We are not just in a situation where wages aren't growing; wages are being driven down. And the impact on the federal budget will be extraordinary, notwithstanding the impact on local communities. These men were concerned. They were concerned that the people in their community might think they were being greedy. Let me dismiss any such notions. They are concerned about their community; they are concerned about their families. I call on their community to stand with these Australian heroes. These workers are not just standing up for their families and for themselves. They are taking the fight to this company for workers right across this country. They met up here with their local member, the member for Gippsland.  I call on those opposite to get behind these workers. This is the core of the issues that we have. I can extrapolate that to my community, with young people waiting for a text message to tell them whether they've got work tomorrow or not. Young people are unable to leave home. Young people are getting no work for a week and panicking about how they're going to pay the rent or the mortgage next week. It's important to note that these workers are from Sale, too, because I spoke in this Chamber this week about the Dorevitch workers, represented by the Health Workers Union, whose office in Sale has closed. That company has, this week, locked out workers who have not had a pay rise for a decade. These workers are doing exactly what this country needs them to do: they are standing up for fairness. They are Australian heroes. I stand with them and I ask everyone across this country to stand with them. They are acting for justice. Like the Dickens hero Oliver Twist, they are just asking for their fair share. Workplace Relations Exercise Talisman Sabre",146
208,Mr BUCHHOLZ,ADJOURNMENT," It is, indeed, a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Lalor. I want to raise a few points about the issues she raised, quite dutifully, about low wage growth. Everyone knows that low wage growth is not just a problem that we are dealing with here in Australia; it is an economic issue that the globe is dealing with. The evidence for that is the evidence that the RBA governor gave the other day at the recent economics hearings in Melbourne, where he stated that very point-that low wage growth is an issue that is hampering all of the OECD countries, including Canada, America and those in Asia. We have a plan for how we are going to address wage growth into the future. The reality is-to make it as simple as I can for Australians who are tuned in-the way a business is able pay their employees a greater percentage of the turnover is for those profits to become bigger. Now, let me give you 101 economics as to how profits don't become bigger: they don't become bigger when a Labor government sets out and says to the Australian community they are going to tax family trusts and take more money off small businesses. I have a family trust. I'll put that on the record. I don't know how long I'll have it for, but I have a family trust. I am a transport operator. I've got a couple of trucks, and I used to employ 105 people. But the government thinks that I am the perfect hit to go after because I am some type of multimillionaire who can afford to pay more. If you take more money out of the family trusts, thinking that that's going to have a direct positive impact on wage growth, I struggle to understand what your economic rationale is with that. I'm struggling to understand how the Labor Party think if they put their hands in the pockets of small businesses around this country that somehow that is going to create a stimulus for our economy and for small business, not to mention the school teachers",147
209,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,147
210,Mr BUCHHOLZ,ADJOURNMENT,I'll take that interjection. Say that again.,147
211,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order! The discussion will take place through the chair. That's for both sides.,147
212,Mr BUCHHOLZ,ADJOURNMENT,"I thought Labor members on the other side of the Chamber were making an interjection to correct me. They were actually reiterating the fact that all companies  should pay tax. We're not disputing the fact that tax has to be paid; we're disputing the claim that taxing more will have a positive impact on wage growth. For the benefit of Hansard, those on the other side of the Chamber are shaking their heads. There is no rationale for, or logic in, the claim, which those opposite are clinging to, that Labor's measures will not have a negative impact on wage growth. I am flabbergasted-absolutely flabbergasted. I stood up to speak about some of the good things that the government is doing, in particular in the Defence Force Parliamentary Program. Recently I had the great pleasure of being able to attend Exercise Talisman Sabre at Shoalwater Bay, which is a military exercise involving about 30,000 military personnel that took place 90 kilometres north of Rockhampton in Central Queensland. The exercise included American, Australian, Canadian, Japanese, French and New Zealand personnel. It was a remarkable logistical exercise that involved amphibious landings, ground operations and so on. I think I mentioned to the Chamber previously the exciting spectacle when four C-17s flew over the site, the back of the aircraft opened and no fewer than 500 parachutists jumped out. I said to the commander on the ground, 'Are they enthusiastic to jump out of the plane? Do they need much encouragement?' and the commander said, 'They need no encouragement whatsoever. They've been on those aircraft for 44 hours. They left Alaska and it's been a direct flight. We were rehearsing our mid-air refuelling capabilities.' He reiterated the point that the 500 marines would be very enthusiastic to get off the plane as quickly as they could. He also indicated to me that those soldiers would spend no less than 72 hours on the ground, only to be put back on the aircraft and sent back to Alaska. That talks about the capacity of our allied forces to come from one side of the world to the other in a very short amount of time. Being able to put trained deployed troops on the ground in any type of environment is evidence of every cent that we spend in our defence capacity. To our fully enlisted brave men and women who participated in that exercise, I say that, as a country, we are so proud of you. We are so proud of our reservists. Keep up the great work. Our country is proud of you. Hearing Awareness Week Macquarie Electorate: Broadband",147
213,Ms TEMPLEMAN,ADJOURNMENT," If you work or live with somebody who's constantly saying 'Sorry, what was that?' there's a chance you're talking to someone with hearing loss. Most people are pretty comfortable admitting that they need glasses. I look around this room and every one of us, bar one person, is wearing glasses. But, for some reason, people aren't as comfortable admitting that they don't hear well. I am perfectly happy to tell you that I have really bad hearing, but, like others who now wear hearing aids, I didn't realise the consequences until I put those little buds in my ear and suddenly there was clarity. I can only compare it to when you first put on glasses and you can finally read each word. People have often commented that I look really intent when I'm listening to someone. I like to think that is from my years of radio journalism, honing my listening skills, but I suspect it's because I needed to pretty much lip-read people to make sure I was following what they were saying. When you don't hear well-and often the decline is so gradual that you don't notice it-a number of things happen. You miss parts of conversations. It's harder to keep up with the flow of a discussion when a number of people are talking. You  annoy your family by making them repeat things often. You also ask them what someone said midway through a movie. It's tiring having to work so hard to hear things, whether it's people or TV or music. It's also isolating. Sometimes it's just easier to avoid conversations. The consequences can be really serious. A new report on the social and economic costs of hearing loss in Australia by Deloitte Access Economics, launched yesterday in this place, puts the financial cost of hearing loss at $15.9 billion a year, and $12.8 billion of that is through productivity losses, mainly due to reduced employment of people with hearing loss. It's estimated that one in seven people have a hearing loss. That is just under 15 per cent of the population. We need to look seriously at how we help these people cope with their hearing loss. The report's data shows that the money invested pays a great return for each dollar spent. As we're at the start of Hearing Awareness Week, I encourage you all to have a hearing test or nag a family member to have one. There was great delight in Blackheath with the announcement last year that the NBN would begin rolling out. Very quickly, that's turned to despair for many people who now have a poorer service than before. I recently hosted a forum in Blackheath with the Blackheath Area Neighbourhood Centre. We were full to overflowing with people, most of whom were somewhere between disappointment and despair with the NBN experience. Shadow minister Michelle Rowland and I heard story after story of installation problems, wait times, slow speeds and dropouts, and of course there are the people in the too-hard basket, with some extra complication to their connection. These problems, by and large, are because Blackheath and the whole of the Upper Blue Mountains is getting fibre to the node-optic fibre running to a box on their street somewhere, connected to their home by their old copper phone line. One man whose connection is less than impressive shared the comment from a technician: the copper from the node to his house was laid in 1932. You don't get a 21st century telecommunications service on nearly 100-year-old copper. We also highlighted the widespread concern about the loss of phone lines when there's a loss of power, which, as Blackheath knows only too well, can happen in big storms or bushfires. I'm grateful to everyone who shared their experiences, but it does little to give me confidence about the experience that other parts of my electorate will receive as their rollout continues. In fact, in the Hawkesbury, the inequality of service is staggering. Under Labor, places like Richmond and Windsor received fibre to the premises, full fibre into their homes, equally rolled out from household to household. The worse criticism I recall from that rollout was that the grass wasn't always put back as neatly as it should have been. But, under the Turnbull government, similar densely populated suburbs, like MCGRATHs Hill, will have to make do with fibre to the node. Wilberforce will have second-rate fibre to the node. Freemans Reach will have fibre to the node. While parts of the new development in North Richmond get fibre to the premises, the rest get dodgy fibre to the node. They are not looking forward to the experience that this government is landing them with. This is on top of other parts of that area being forced onto fixed wireless and still others on satellite. It makes the Hawkesbury one of the least equal places when it comes to internet access. It's something that this government should be ashamed of.  St George Lions Club Banks Electorate: Sporting and Recreation Facilities",148
214,Mr COLEMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to congratulate the Lions Club of St George on its recent morning tea and breakfast for Jeans for Genes Day, which was held on 4 August at the Beverley Park Golf Club. John and Tina Harrison do a fantastic job at St George Lions, as do the entire committee, in running every year a number of different events to raise money for important projects. Jeans for Genes Day has been running for quite a number of years around Australia and funds raised support the Children's Medical Research Institute, which is based at Westmead in Sydney. The CMRI does world-leading research on a wide range of issues of great importance to families with kids who have illnesses. So I thank St George Lions for that and also for being involved in the Wrap with Love project. Under the Wrap with Love project, our members were knitting and crocheting squares to come together into blankets. They've been doing so for quite a number of months. Those blankets then go to places all around the world. In fact, more than 70 countries around the world benefit from the Wrap with Love project. It addresses issues of hypothermia and other very serious matters in developing countries around the world. So thank you, St George Lions Club, for everything that you do. In Oatley in my electorate there is a very important environmental issue that needs to be addressed by the Georges River Council. Adjacent to the Myles Dunphy Reserve, which is a pristine area of bushland in Oatley, there is a former bowling club site. For a number of years that bowling club site has been dormant. The question now is: what do we do with that land? My very strong view is that that land should be preserved as public space and it should be incorporated into the broader Myles Dunphy Reserve. The Myles Dunphy Reserve is beautiful local bushland. It is enjoyed by many residents of Oatley and surrounding areas. Oatley, more generally, has a reputation all around Sydney as one of its most beautiful suburbs. There is Oatley Park, Myles Dunphy Reserve, Oatley Pleasure Grounds and a range of other beautiful spots along the Georges River. The council shouldn't proceed with the proposed high-rise aged-care development at the former bowling club site. It should be preserved as public space. It is very important that the council speaks with clarity on this issue to the residents of Oatley. There is overwhelming support for the retention of this area as public space, and it is time that the Georges River Council spoke very clearly on this issue and allayed the concerns of residents. I will be continuing to raise this matter on behalf of the Oatley community. The St George area is one of the very few places in Sydney that does not have a synthetic athletics facility. Pretty much every other local council area in Sydney or the region does have such a facility. Bankstown, next to St George, has a great facility at the Crest. The Sutherland Shire has two synthetic athletics facilities, but St George doesn't have even one. As a consequence, the athletics community is being left behind, relative to other parts of Sydney. When St George Little Athletics gather every Friday night at Olds Park in Penshurst, parents and volunteers are literally going out and marking out the field with chalk in a way that hasn't changed since the 1960s. St George should have a proper synthetic athletic facility and a proper athletics area, pretty much like every other part of Sydney.  That is why the federal government has committed $500,000 to this very important project to get St George the synthetic athletics facility that it deserves and needs for both St George Little Athletics and for the broader St George athletics association. What we need now is for Georges River Council to decide where this athletics facility will be. There's $500,000 on the table from the federal government towards this project. There are many hundreds of local families who will benefit from this, and this is only asking for St George to have what most other places in Sydney have. So Georges River Council needs to make a decision, and we need to get this athletics facility put in place for the St George community. Australian Broadcasting Corporation",150
215,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT," I like the ABC. I am a regular viewer of it. I appreciate and value the national broadcaster. I acknowledge the comments-I think it was last night-of Justin Milne regarding unnecessary criticism of the ABC, and I understand the need for a diversity of opinion and the need to hear minority views and have proper debates on our national broadcaster. But I don't think that should include the broadcasting of neoNazis and people who are adherents to national socialism. I spoke out the other night about Triple J's interview with one Mr Eli Mosley, who is an American neo-Nazi, and I was shocked on Tuesday night to turn on 7.30 and find yet another interview on our national broadcaster. This time it was with a Mr Matthew Heimbach, who is, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, quite the extremist and has views that would be completely unacceptable to this country, to the United Kingdom, to the US and to all of those who fought under the flag of the United Nations.",151
216,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,"Government members interjectingThose opposite should actually listen to this, because it is a very relevant point. This is the very thing: we shouldn't have neo-Nazis on our national broadcaster, because of the way these people are presented. For instance, Mr Matthew Heimbach on 7.30 was positioned as a white nationalist and as a representative or a spokesman of the Traditionalist Worker Party rather than being identified as a nazi. When he was put on this program, he was allowed to advance a self-defence theory for the individual involved in the tragedy in Charlottesville. In response to him advancing this theory, the reporter, Stephanie March, said, 'What you are saying is very provocative to some people that he may have been justified in killing this young woman,' and then allowed Mr Heimbach to advance his theory. The ABC has to be very, very careful about interviewing such people because the alt-right, as they call themselves, have done a bit of public relations and they don't like calling themselves Nazis anymore. They like calling themselves white nationalists and the alt-right, but they are actually Nazis. They seek to move, what is known as the Overton window, the acceptable boundaries of public discourse to a place where they can advance their horrific views. The ABC's interviewing style of playing devil's advocate-of interviewers repeating the contrary argument to the propositions put by those interviewees-is particularly susceptible to those using a strategy to shift public discourse, no matter who those people are, whether they are extremists of any type, to those who are propagating inaccurate claims, fabrication or outright lies. The ABC needs to be aware that this is afoot. It is not just the Nazis. It's non-state actors. It's extremists on all sides of the horseshoe of extremism and, of course, it's sometimes state  actors like other countries. We need to be particularly aware that this is happening, and the ABC needs to be particularly aware that it's occurring. If we were in the 1930s, we wouldn't think it was appropriate to interview Goebbels, Goering, the Brownshirts or Adolf Hitler. We wouldn't think it was acceptable to put them on the national broadcaster and accept their propositions uncritically or to mislabel them as nationalists or as being on the right. Nazis aren't on the right side of politics. They're not in any way associated with the normal spectrum of political thinking in this country or the normal spectrum of political thinking across the world. So this is an insult to all those who fought at El Alamein, Tobruk or in the Mediterranean, or in Bomber Command. Those people didn't die so our society could be democratic and free, and we could put Nazis on the national broadcaster. They wanted us to have a proper democracy, where facts are facts and where extremist views are contested and not embraced or encouraged or put in a benign fashion. It is critical that everybody is aware that those who have extremist views-as I said, they're not really across the spectrum; they lie in the same place, in effect-and who will use violence to enforce them do not belong on the national broadcaster. Murray Electorate: Energy",151
217,Mr DRUM,ADJOURNMENT," Energy is possibly one of the most important issues, if not the most important and most pressing issue, in my electorate of Murray at the moment. I am getting phone calls and emails from constituents worried about their household energy bills. But the problem is going well beyond the household; it is affecting local industry. We have many industries in my electorate that are heavy energy users and that are huge employers, and they are paying millions of dollars each and every year in energy costs. Those energy costs are going through the roof at the moment. We were very happy to see the Prime Minister last week call in the energy companies to work out how they can be more transparent with their billing processes and to work out how they can send out information to the Australian public to make sure they let them know that the special discount that they were previously on has expired and to encourage householders and businesses to change retailers, energy providers, to make sure that they are getting the cheapest energy that is available to them. We understand and acknowledge the real pressure that households and businesses are under, especially because of the gas market on the east coast. We have to do whatever we possibly can to overcome the current shortage of energy. There are a number of factors driving this shortage of energy on the east coast. Some of the gas fields in southern Queensland are not as productive-there is not as much gas there as they thought. There are dwindling supplies out of Bass Strait. Energy that was traditionally put aside for the domestic market in Victoria and New South Wales was purchased and exported by companies that had been given the green light by Queensland Labor five years ago-with no monitoring associated with the way they were to deliver that gas to Asia. That's why it was very good to see the Prime Minister last week meeting with those energy companies. It was also good that on 1 July this year, the government introduced the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism. This mechanism will allow the government to impose export controls on LNG projects if there is a shortfall of gas in the domestic market. This is a targeted, temporary measure designed to ensure that there is security of gas in the domestic market.  What is really concerning is the attitude of the Victorian Labor Party, which has an absolute ban on exploration and extraction. Whilst the area is undergoing extreme shortages and the price of gas is going through the roof, the Victorian Labor government is refusing to acknowledge that there is any issue whatsoever. They are saying that in Victoria there will be absolutely no exploration. They're not even letting the scientists go out and discover new fields. We don't know what it is that they are prohibiting. They are deliberately confusing the term 'fracking' with conventional gas extraction. When you ask why aren't we allowing more gas exploration and gas extraction out of the Victorian gas fields, they say: 'Well, you don't want to be pumping chemicals and sand, and breaking open aquifers and poisoning and contaminating the aquifers. Surely you don't want that.' It is deliberately confusing the terminology between fracking and conventional gas exploration. What needs to be put out there and what we need to do is identify that Labor, the Greens and organisations such as GetUp! and Lock The Gate are having a direct impact on employment. The industries throughout the Goulburn Valley-whether it be food manufacturers such as Campbell Soup, SPC, Heinz, Murray Goulburn, Kagome tomatoes and Unilever, or whether it be the engineering plants that are heavy users of energy-are all in a very tough situation at the moment. Their businesses are marginal. We have gas prices and electricity prices going up. We all understand that electricity prices are set, in part, by the price of gas at any one moment. Yet, we have a Labor Party in Victoria with its head in the sand saying that we have no problem whatsoever. We have a severe problem. Unless we have an understanding that these current policies in relation to gas and electricity are going to have a detrimental impact and direct impact on jobs throughout Australia- (Time expired) Question agreed to.
