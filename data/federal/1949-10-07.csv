1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr J. J. Clark) took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. BANKING.",10
2,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"I wish to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the deliberate distortion of his.address to the Australian Labour party executive in the head-lines of Tasmanian and some mainland newspapers, and the blanketing of his vital statements, with the notable exception",10
3,Unknown,Unknown,"Opposition members interjecting,",10
4,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! Opposition members must conduct themselves reasonably in the House, and not behave like a lot of schoolboys.",10
5,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"I rise to order. I understand that the Chair has ruled that an honourable member may not introduce into a question either comment, or controversial or debatable matter. The honourable member for Wilmot commenced his question by suggesting that distorted reports had been published in the newspapers relating to an address given by the Prime Minister at a certain meeting. I submit that in so doing he is distinctly out of order.",10
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is entitled to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to any statements made about him. All Ministers may be questioned about statements which they have made. The honourable member for ""Wilmot is entitled to proceed.",11
7,Mr DUTHIE,Unknown,"Before the interruption by Opposition members, I had referred to reports which had appeared in Tasmanian and mainland newspapers, with the notable exception of the Melbourne Age, the Melbourne Argus and the Sydney Morning Herald. In view of these distortions of the truth, and having regard to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition as published in the Canberra Times today, is it not a fact that the Prime Minister specifically stated that, in view of the unfavorable decision of the High Court and of the Privy Council, there was no intention on the part of the Government to nationalize private banks or to circumvent the Constitution, and did he not say that the alternative to the nationalization of banking was virile competition with the trading banks by .the Commonwealth Bank, and that the trading banks themselves believed in and supported competition?",11
8,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have seen neither the report which the honourable member states was published in some Tasmanian and mainland newspapers, nor the statement of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this matter, so that I speak with some douht about them. I have already made it perfectly clear that the Australian Labour party believed that, hecause of the treatment meted out to the public, and indeed to governments, by the private hanking institutions in hard times, the nationalization of private banking was desirable in the public interest. I have in mind certain specific occasions, which I do not think I would be justified in mentioning now. The High Court and the Privy Council have both held that the act which was designed to bring about the nationalization of private banking is unconstitutional. As the Privy Council has not yet stated its reasons for its decisions, and as they will not be available for some time, the element of competition which the private banks regard as so desirable will be fully met by virile competition of the Commonwealth Bank.",11
9,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"So the report was not distorted, and, in fact, was quite accurate. Very interesting!",11
10,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen the statement attributed to him that not much time had gone by before the banks had made it clear that they would not recognize the sections of the banking legislation which deal with special deposits? Did the Prime Minister make that statement? Apart from indicating that they were in doubt about the validity of some sections of the Banking Act 1945, did the private banks take any step to challenge the Government's legislation? ""Was not the challenge to section 48 of the act made by the Melbourne City Council and other semi-governmental bodies that objected to being compelled to transfer their accounts from the private banks to the Government bank? Did not the decision of the High Court completely vindicate the doubts expressed by the private hanks in their communications with the Prime Minister? ""Will the Prime Minister make it clear that the private banks have acted fairly and with complete propriety in this matter ?",11
11,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The honourable member will not get any chance of shuffling out of this one. The fact of the matter is that before any case was stated before the High Court of Australia, some of the private banks had already written to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and indicated that they did not regard the law which provided that the private banks should place their surplus deposit.? in the custody of the Commonwealth Bank, as valid. That provision was contained in the Banking Act 1945 and the banks took their view of its validity in face of the fact that the people of this country had endorsed that act by returnmonwealth ing this Government to office at the 1946 general election-if it can ever be said that the people, by re-electing a political party to office, endorse all its actions respect of legislation. T shall allow that there may be some doubt about wliether the re-election of a party is necessarily an endorsement of all the legislation that that party has introduced and had approved while in office. The 1945 lation was approved by this Parliament in the face of very strong protests made by the banks. The Leader of the sition and other honourable members oppober. site made very impassioned speeches against that legislation.",11
12,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,My speech against was cool and well reasoned.,12
13,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I shall not say that it was well reasoned. The right honourable gentleman made a great political issue of the 1945 legislation in this House and outside; but the people endorsed the policy of the Government which introscale duced that legislation. Immediately the general election the banks, in the of the expressed will of the people, started to challenge the validity of act. That is all I said on this subject. [ said nothing about the legality of act, but spoke only of what was done. The Melbourne City Council actually took the Commonwealth to court and challenged the validity of the legislation. Certain banks doubted the wisdom of the banks pressing the case before the High Court.",12
14,Mr BEALE,Unknown,What case is the Prime period ? Minister speaking about?,12
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! will I warn the honourable member for Parraculty matta that if he again interrupts the Prime Minister during his reply I shall name him.,12
16,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am speaking of the Melbourne City Council. I know something of what goes on. I am aware that certain private banks violently agreed with their colleagues in taking such a case to the court at all, and in Melbourne. attempting to disturb the 1945 legislation. I think that I have covered the matter fairly well. Everybody knows that correspondence from certain private banks - to the Governor of the Comknow Bank, which challenged the validity of the legislation, is on record. L have read some of those letters in the House. The writ which was issued by in the High Court is also on record. It is also on record that at a later stage that particular matter was not argued before the court because of the pressure of some of the private banks against some of the had others which did not approve of the legismatter being taken further. They regarded it as dynamite for them to disturb the position to that extent. That is all 1 Oppohave to say to the honourable memI n the statement. I made. I merely tried to indicate what the banks had done. I said that they had it challenged the decision of the people in respect of the 1945 legislation. PETEOL.",12
17,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"In view of the Prime Minister's anouncement that, when petrol rationing is re-initroduced., the ration will be the same as that which was after in operation prior to the abandonface ment of rationing, I ask the right honourable gentleman whether that scale the is warranted by the current petrol stock position. Have the importing the companies been authorized to import additional quantities of petrol to maintain the ration scale at its opening level? If not, for how long will it be possible to supply petrol on that scale and what is the estimated reduction that the Government's official advisers believe will be necessary at the end of the first ration",12
18,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Honourable members realise that there is considerable diffiin determining what proportion of the petrol that has been sold in this country since rationing ended has been for current use. A conservative State premier has stated that some wealthy people, particularly land-owners, have engaged in excessive hoarding of petrol. disThat statement was made by a conservative premier at a conference of premiers",12
19,Mr WHITE,Unknown,Who are these conservative premiers? Does the right honourable the gentleman mean Liberal premiers?,12
20,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"It is difficult to what aliases they use from time to time, but I shall say Liberal premiers if the honourable member prefers that term. The premier to whom I have referred said that one man in his State had ordered two years' supply of petrol. The conference expressed the wish that something should be done about excessive hoarding of petrol by wealthy people, to the detriment of less fortunate members of the community. To expedite matters, it ha? been decided in the first place that, as many of the old petrol licences are still in the hands of consumers who are still using the same vehicles for the same purposes, those licences should be usable on their original basis. Undoubtedly there has been an over-sale, if not an over-usage, of petrol since rationing ended and some time must elapse before it will be possible to ascertain what percentage of the petrol sold has been hoarded.",12
21,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,What about answering the question?,13
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member for Wentworth must remain silent. He has a very bad habit of interjecting. ; Mr Chifley - It will not be possible for some time to ascertain just what the position is. The Government is anxious to ensure to essential users the quantities of petrol that they received formerly, and it may be necessary ultimately to give consideration to the quantities of petrol that have been stored during the non-rationing period. That matter cannot he determined immediately. We know what we propose to do in the immediate future about the introduction of petrol rationing. When we have ascertained how much hoarded petrol there is in the country we shall be able to determine other factors. That decision, however, is some distance away. Mr ADERMAIOr - I ask the Prime Minister whether it is correct, as reported in newspaper cablegrams from London, that under an arrangement with General MACArthur 1,000,000 tons of crude oil from the sterling areas will be sent to Japan for treatment in refineries that were supposed to have been dismantled under the policy of preventing the restoration of Japan's war potential? If such refineries exist in Japan and are not being used, will the Australian Government, as part of Australia's reparations from Japan, press for their dismantlement and transfer to Australia for use in refining petrol in this country ?",13
23,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am not aware that any official indication has heen given that any proposal of the kind that the honourable member has mentioned has been made, or is contemplated. The position with respect to supplies of Japanese fuel on a commercial basis is that a ceiling budget has been fixed to ensure a balancing-up of values of goods that may be the subject of trade between Australia and the Supreme Command of the Allied Powers and commercial interests in J apan. That provision has been made because the American occupation authorities do not want to accumulate sterling balances whilst Australia does not want to incur dollar deficits. Therefore,, attempts are being made to balance the trade between the two countries at an agreed figure, and a check will be made each quarter in that respect. With regard to the honourable member's suggestion that oil refining plant should be brought from Japan to Australia as part of Japanese reparations, I repeat what I said when the South-West Pacific conference was meeting in Canberra. I believe that the idea of Japanese reparations is merely wishful thinking. That is what I think about the matter. The population of Japan is growing so rapidly and so much territory has been taken from its jurisdiction and handed to other countries that it will be very difiicult for any future Japanese government to sustain the population in the areas which remain under its control. The territories that have been taken from the control of Japan have been enumerated before, and I shall not detain the House by stating them again. The position is such that I think the prospect of obtaining reparations from Japan is quite hopeless. I do not think we can establish a kingdom of serfs to live on the lowest possible standard and become an economic cancer in the Pacific. Long ago I abandoned the idea of obtaining substantial reparations from Japan. There may be some small things that could be made avail-' able and requests have been made for small payments. In addition, a general request has heen made that tralia shall participate in any reparations that may he decided upon in the peace treaty. I have not heard anything of the matter referred to hy the honourable member; but I shall have inquiries made into his suggestions and inform him of result. CURRENCY.",13
24,Mr LANG,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to a statement made by the Indian Finance ter, Dr John Matthai, about the failure of the United Kingdom Government consult the Dominions on its proposals devalue the currency? Has the attenin this chamber. tion of the right honourable gentleman also been directed to the statement the financial editor of the Manchester Guardian to the effect that the British .Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, had informed Canada and the United States of America of the new a fortnight before he informed Australia and the other Dominions of them? Sir Stafford Cripps convey the decision of the British Government to Washington conference and the Interthat national Monetary Fund before indicated it to this country? Was there any reason why the Prime Minister of Australia could not be entrusted with that information, and consulted before a firm decision was made? Will the Prime Minister now make a protest to United Kingdom Government against the failure of Sir Stafford Cripps to honour the agreement that all members of the sterling Hoc are equal partners, and entitled to be consulted on all matters? Will the Prime Minister request ttie establishment of a dollar pool committee, at the highest level, consisting of all members of the sterling bloc, to watch the interests of all concerned and especially the effect of devaluation on trade and wage standards ? Will the right honourable gentleman seek an assurance sions that any further alteration of exchange rates shall not be made prior to the fullest consultation with this country? Will he further seek an early conference of members of the British Commonwealth in order to define the rights of the selffact. governing dominions to equal status when decisions which effect their economic future are heing made, so that, henceforth, Austhey shall be treated as partners and not as stooges iby that very high handed dictator, Sir Stafford Cripps?",14
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order J I remind the honourable member for Reid that he is developing the habit of asking, the his questions in such a form as to introduce quite a lot of comment. That, is entirely out of order.",14
26,Unknown,Unknown,"Opposition members interjecting,",14
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,".Order ! MinisThe honourable member for Parramatta may conduct himself as heto pleases in his own home, but he must to observe certain standards of conduct He should show a little courtesy and good manners of here, especially when Mr Deputy Speaker is addressing the House. I ask the honourable member for Reid to frame his questions in a manner that is permissible under the Standing rates Orders. The honourable member endeavours to introduce considerable arguDid ment and comment into his questions, and if he does not conthe form to the Standing Orders in respect, I shall have to rule his he had questions ont of order.",14
28,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I rise to order. May 1 inquire, Mr Deputy Speaker, why the introduction of comment into questions by the honourable member for Reid is the disorderly^ whilst the introduction of comment into a question by the honourable member for Wilmot, even after a point of order has been taken on the matter meets with the approval of the Chair?",14
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! There are degrees of comment in relation to questions. The Chair has observed that most of the questions asked in this House contain some comment, but it has allowed them, provided they have kept reasonably within the limits of the Standing Orders. I have said on previous occathat if the Chair were to enforce the Standing Orders strictly, very few questions would be allowed. The honourable member for Reid, I believe, goes far beyond a reasonable point, and the Chair is now directing his attention to that",14
30,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I do not propose to make any protest or representations along the lines that have heen mentioned by the honourable member for Reid. He has suggested that Sir Stafford Cripps informed Canada and the United States of America of the decision to devalue the currency about a fortnight before Australia and the other dominions. I am given to understand that the suggestion is entirely without foundation. Although special representatives of the United States Government were probably informed that Great Britain might devalue its currency, the proposed rate of devaluation was not conveyed to them. I believe that the rate only became known to the Americans when the application was made to the International Monetary Fund. I cannot speak for any other governments, but I have no complaints to make about any lack of consultation between the United Kingdom Government and the Australian Government. There has been full consultation at all times. The Prime Minister of Great Britain is a very busy man, but he went to a great deal of trouble to keep me fully informed, first, of all possible developments, and later of actual developments as decisions were made. Final decisions were not made, I believe, until Sir Stafford Cripps returned to England from the United States. That was just before the application was made to the Internationa] Monetary Fund. The honourable member talked about the Dominions being treated as stooges instead of as partners. The fact is that, on the main question of devaluation, Australia, has insisted, as a contributor to the International Monetary Fund, that the initiative in relation to any alteration of the value of a currency should be a. matter entirely for the country concerned and that no other body, whether it be the Internationa] Monetary Fund itself or the government that is in charge of the Empire dollar pool, should have the right to interfere. Any decision on the degree of devaluation should be entirely a matter for the government of the country concerned under its own sovereign powers.",14
31,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,That is not the view of the government of France.,15
32,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I do not know the view of that government. I am stating the view that I conveyed to Australia's representative on the directorate of the International Monetary Fund when certain motions were being discussed by the directors six months ago, not just recently. I maintained that it was not within the province of the International Monetary Fund or any other body to tell a government whether its currency should he devalued or not or to prescribe the degree of devaluation. My view was that such bodies could express opinions on - the subject of the degree of devaluation but that any actual requests for devaluation should be made only by those governments concerned of their own volition, according to their own judgment, and having regard to their own interests. BROADCASTING.",15
33,Mr HAMILTON,Unknown,"Earlier this week the Prime Minister stated that his Sunday night ""Report to the Nation"" broadcasts were factual. Does the right honourable gentleman intend to continue those broadcasts during the period of the election campaign? If so, will he request the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to direct that time be made available during the same period for similar factual broadcasts by leaders of the Opposition parties?",15
34,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I shall make no requests to anybody on the subject of broadcasts. There is an authority to deal with such matters, and the Postmaster General is the Minister nominally in charge of that authority. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has the right to make certain decisions concerning the allocation of broadcasting time, and the commercial stations, under the order that I dealt with yesterday in a written answer to a question asked hy the honourable member for Reid, can determine what broadcasts they will allow to be made free of charge and what broadcasts must be paid for. With reference to my own Sunday night reports to the nation, which are factual broadcasts, I have already intimated to the Macquarie network that, if it considers that such broadcasts would be inappropriate during the election campaign, I shall be quite agreeable to discontinue them during that period. . ART UNIONS.",15
35,Mrs BLACKBURN,Unknown,"I ask the Attorney-General whether anything can be done to stop the practice that is indulged in by various organizations of sending books of raffle tickets through the post. The practice has become prevalent and is causing annoyance to large numbers of citizens. Tickets are sent from one State to another or to various parts of one State. Recently, I had my attention drawn to the fact that a British migrant had received raffle hooks containing £10 worth of tickets. Being new to Australia, she had the idea that she had to sell them all, and she was considerably upset. Is it possible for the Attorney General to stop the sending of tickets in that way?",15
36,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I shall consult with the Postmaster-General, or with hie representative in this chamber, and see what the position is under Commonwealth and State law. The information will be supplied to the honourable member later. NEW GUINEA.",16
37,Mr FALKINDER,Unknown,"In view of the vital constitutional changes taking place in Dutch Indonesia, can the Minister for External Affairs state the Government's intention about the future government of that part of New Guinea, which is now administered by Australia, and which adjoins Dutch New Guinea? Is it intended to continue the present system, or is some kind of condominium contemplated? If the present system is to be continued, how is it to he reconciled with the support that the Government has given to the claims of Indonesia to independence ?",16
38,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"The Government has not favoured any particular solution of the Indonesian problem. Its desire has been merely that the parties concerned, the Indonesian Republic, the other Indonesian governmente formed since the armistice, and the Netherlands should consult together, and reach agreement in order to prevent fighting and bloodshed. At the present time, at The Hague, there is in progress a round-table conference at which representatives of the Netherlands and of Indonesian countries are working out the terms of an agreement for Indonesia. The Australian member on the United Nations Good Oflices Committee, Mr Critchley, is there as one of the persons responsible to the United Nations, as are the members from the United States of America and Belgium. A final agreement has not been reached, but everything points towards an agreement on terms mutually acceptable to the Netherlands and to the Indonesian countries. As far as I know, the position of Dutch New Guinea has not been brought into the deliberations. Sovereignty of Dutch New Guinea is in the Netherlands and it is for the Netherlands to say whether Dutch New Guinea shall come into the agreement. From our point of view the relationship of Dutch New Guinea with the Indonesian Republic and the future government of the territories concerned are matters primarily for the Dutch and Indonesian governments. I repeat that our interest is that there should be a peaceful settlement of that question. I understand that the honourable member's reference to a condiminium was in relation to Dutch New Guinea.",16
39,Mr FALKINDER,Unknown,And Australian New Guinea.,16
40,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I did not understand that the honourable member had in mind the idea of a condominium for Australian New Guinea. Such an idea is quite out of the question. Australian New Guinea consists partly of the Territory of New Guinea and partly of Papua each of which adjoins Dutch New Guinea. No proposal for a condominium in the sense of joint sovereignty has ever been suggested; but that does not mean that there will not be close relationship between Dutch New Guinea and Australian New Guinea. Already, the relationship between those territories is particularly close. No question of a condominium in respect of Australian New Guinea has ever been raised and, so far as I know, such a proposal would not be favourably considered by the Australian Government. However, close co-operation with the Netherlands, or whatever authority operates in Dutch New Guinea, will be strongly favoured hy this Government. RA IL TRANSPORT. WESTERN AUSTRALIAN SERVICES.",16
41,Mr BURKE,Unknown,"I refer to a press* report that representatives of the Western Australian Government and its technical omcers visited Canberra this week to discuss with the Minister for Transport the rehabilitation of the Western Australian Government railways including the standardization of the gauge from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. Can the Minister inform me whether any agreement has been reached in respect of either the standardization or the rehabilitation of those railways? Has the Australian Government made a definite offer of assistance in the matter to the Western Australian Government? If so, can the Minister indicate the degree of that assistance ?",16
42,Mr WARD,Unknown,"Talk s took place in Canberra last Tuesday between myself and two members of the Western Australian Government, Mr Seward and Mr MCDonald, and technical officers of both governments on the rehabilitation of the Western Australian railways, including the question of standardization. N'o definite agreement has been arrived at. However, considerable progress has been made. The Australian Government made a very generous offer to assist the Western Australian Government in rehabilitating its railways, including the standardization of the gauge from Kalgoorlie to Fremantle. The Western Australian delegation has returned to consult the State Cabinet, and I hope to receive word of that Government's decision at an early date. COMPANY PROFITS.",17
43,Mr DALY,Unknown,"I direct the attention the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction to the financial columns of the Sydney Daily Telegraph today in which reportedThe Consolidated Profit of the A.C.I. Group of Companies for the year ended 30th 1949, was £548,569, an increase of f72,054 compared with the result of the previous Is the Minister aware that David Jones Limited made a net profit of £221,039 last year and that it reported a turnover of £10,000,000 for the first time? Are those company profits not a tribute to the full employment policy of the Australian Government? Do they not confirm that the Government's financial policy is stimulus to industry? Do they not also provide a complete answer to the propaseason ganda of the Liberal party that the financial policy of and the high taxation imposed by the Government are retarding industry?",17
44,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I have not seen the report mentioned by the honourable member, but it is exactly what I should have expected. It is, in fact, typical of a great many reports of industrial concerns in Australia which show that there is great expansion of secondary industry generally. The reason for that, of course, is that there is ful l employment in Australia. The people have more purchasing power and there is a greater demand for the products 'of secondary industry. Not only the firms referred to by the honourable member, but also the great majority of firms engaged in secondary industry in Australia will continue to expand under the financial policy of the Government. NORTHERN TERRITORY.",17
45,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Health a question arising from a report in yesterday's Sydney Daily Mirror that all is not well with the water supply at the leprosarium at Channel Island in Darwin Harbour. Can the Minister inform the House of the reason for the delay in providing an adequate water supply? Is the report that the leprosarium is to he removed to Melville Island true and, if so, when will the work be commenced?",17
46,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"I have seen the of statement to which the honourable member has referred, and have consulted the Minister for Health on the matter. The it is honourable member for the Northern Territory should be more familiar with the details of this subject than any other June, honourable member. Earlier this year the Minister for the Interior visited the year. Northern Territory and inspected the institution mentioned. He was told that there was a danger of its fresh water supply being exhausted at the peak of the dry season. In the light of past experience he ordered the installation of an adequate number of additional tanks in order to minimize that danger. Those a tanks have since been installed. Even now, however, at the peak of the dry in that area there is a danger of the fresh water supply running ont. Mr . Hall's statenient that the physical health and cleanliness of the people there is being endangered is ridiculous. It is common knowledge that the people who are livin g on the water's edge there spend a great deal of time sea bathing. They are well catered for in this respect. It is intended to remove this institution. Plans have been drawn up for the construction of new buildings, and the work has been commenced.

The present Standing Orders Committee has considered existing Standing Orders and proposals brought forward from time to time by previous committees and has incorporated furtheramendments designed to provide a procedure that will be adequate to meet the needs of the enlarged House to be elected this year.

ESTIMATES 1949-50. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 6th October (vide page 1107). LIMITED. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. Proposed vote, £1,695,000.",18
50,Mr HARRISON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Wentworth) [11.14]. - I refer to Division 51, ""Electoral Branch "", of the Estimates for the Department of the Interior because of the extraordinary increase in the proposed vote this year compared with expenditure in 1948-49. In conformity with the relevant legislation the Electoral Branch must look very closely into all matters associated with the acquiring of finance for political purposes. I suggest to the committee that the Chief Electoral Officer shall take into consideration the information that I shall now place before the committee when calling for the returns in connection with the forthcoming general election. Rule 45 (7) of the Amalgamated Engineering Union reads as follows: The Commonwealth council shall give effect to the exemption of members to contribute to the political fund of the union by making a separate levy of contributions to that fund from the members of the union who are not exempt. Members in New South Wales and Queensland shall pay a political levy of 3d. per quarter; in Victoria, members shall pay 4d. per quarter; South Australian and Tasmanian members 6d. per quarter; and in Western Australia the levy shall be 9d. pei quarter. No moneys of the union other than the amount raised by such separate levy shall to the political fund of the union. REPOBT. The levies collected will obviously be need during the election campaign. Of the 66,000 members of the union, about 48,000 are subject to the levy. So, from the Amalgamated Engineering Union alone, a f u n d is provided for political purposes which amounts to £2,500. Ac-cording to the Commonwealth Statistician, the total number of trade unionists in Australia is 1,423,150. I have no doubt that similar levies are imposed by other unions, because it is a part of the policy of the Australian Labour party to impose levies for political purposes. Irrespective - of whether a trade unionist believes in the party's political policy, he is subjected levies for political purposes.",18
51,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL, I ask the honourable member to indicate how he proposes to 'connect his remarks with the Estimates before the Chair.,19
52,Mr HARRISON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I have drawn attention to the fact that the Electoral Act contains a provision which limits the extent to which funds may be used for electoral purposes. I have also drawn attention to the fact that levies are being made on trade unionists for political purposes. I ask the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) to instruct the Electoral Branch to give the closest attention to the levies imposed on trade union members for political purposes which are estimated to amount in total to £71,000 per annum.",19

74,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Brisbane) [11.22] - I had not intended to speak on the Estimates of the Department of the Interior, and indeed, I should not have done so but for a question which was directed to the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) about a statement made by the Town Clerk of Brisbane, Mr. Slaughter, which related to unimproved land held by the Commonwealth in the Greater Brisbane area. The Sunday Mail of the 22nd May last contained an editorial in relation to Mr Slaughter's statement which reads as follows:Thanks. Mr Slaughter, for telling us, as Town Clerk, just how much Commonwealth occupation costs the city in rates it can .collect. Greater Brisbane loses from £200,000 to £250,000 a year in rate revenue because ot Commonwealth ownership of property. This represents more than 15 per cent, of the total revenue from general rates. While the honourable member for Moreton somewhat belatedly asked his question on this subject, I think that he raised the matter in good faith. As I was somewhat disturbed when I read Mr. Slaughter's statement in the Brisbane press, I immediately contacted the Department of the Interior in Brisbane, and later made representations to the Minister for the Interior with a view to ascertaining whether it was in accordance with fact. I think that I know Brisbane as well as dons Mr Slaughter. I know what properties are owned and controlled by the Commonwealth in the Greater Brisbane area. It is my duty to let the people of Brisbane know just how Mr. Slaughter has tried to mislead them. Whether or not he did so intentionally, I do not know. With the backing of the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, who is known to be a very bitter opponent of the Australian Labour party and of this Government, he endeavoured to make the people of Brisbane believe that the City of Brisbane was losing approximately £250,000 a year because it could not levy rates on properties owned by the Commonwealth. That statement was absolutely incorrect. We who live in Brisbane know that the City Council had to make some excuse because within the last few months, its rates and electricity charges have been increased beyond all expectation. As I have said, I took the matter up early in the piece with the Minister for the Interior. I received a reply from the Minister on the 17th June of this year, which showed a picture quite different from that painted by the town clerk and the member for Moreton. The town clerk, in his effort to make the people of Brisbane believe that the Commonwealth was depriving them of £250,000 a year in rates, forgot to mention that the amount referred to in his press statement related not only to Commonwealth property, but also to State property. It is just as well that the people should know the truth. If what the town clerk said were true, it would mean neveT that Commonwealth-owned property in the City of Brisbane was valued at approximately £4,500,000. However, a close examination reveals that the unimcity's proved value of Commonwealth property in the City of Brisbane is only £753,000. If that property were ratable, the annual cost to the Commonwealth would be £60,000; but as honourable members are aware, Commonwealth property, like State property, is exempt from rates. I have risen to bring those facts to the notice of this chamber and the people of Brisbane. Clearly the town clerk's assertion that the Commonwealth was depriving the people of Brisbane of £250,000 annually was far-fetched.",20
75,Mr RYAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Flinders) [11.28] - I wish to make some observations on Division 50, "" Administrative"", for which the vote is £566,000. I propose to deal with certain transactions that have been completed recently for the acquisition of land and property. I refer particularly to the acquisition by the Commonwealth of the Somers Camp in Victoria. As honourable members are no doubt aware, the Somers Camp was a large and efficiently run institution for the training of Royal Australian Air Force personnel. It was taken over by the Commonwealth during the war for this purpose. I myself had some hand in that transaction, because I was then Director of Hirings. Somers Camp subsequently came under the orders of my colleague, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), who did much to improve the surroundings by planting trees and providing other amenities which made the site very pleasant. Indeed, the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Calwell) recently paid a tribute to the honourable member for Balaclava for that work. When the war ended there was some doubt about what should be done with Somers Camp, as there was also about other Commonwealth property which had been acquired for war purposes. Various suggestions were made, but none ever came to fruition. Finally, the Commonwealth .decided to sell the camp to the State Government. Negotiations were opened with the State Government in September, 1946, and finally the land and buildings were sold for £19,690. I should point out, perhaps, that, prior to the sale, quite a number of the buildings had been removed. Some had been transferred to the Flinders Naval Base, and others had been taken by the Commonwealth for various purposes. Therefore, when the camp was sold to the State, certain improvements had been removed. Having acquired the camp, the State was then faced with the problem of deciding what to do with it. Various suggestions were made by the Cain Labour Government, which was then in office. I understand that, at one time the camp could have been bought for £13,000. Various proposals were considered, including one that the camp should be used as a holiday camp for children. Nothing transpired, however, and finally, in October, 1947, a company called Feature Holidays Limited, acquired the camp from the State Government for £20,000. The intention was to use the camp as a holiday and recreation centre for week-end holiday makers from the city and other places. Time passed, and then the Department of Immigration required accommodation for immigrants. After looking around, the Government decided that the Somers Camp would be a suitable reception centre, and resolved to re-purchase the camp through the Department of the Interior. After some negotiations with Feature Holidays Limited, the camp was repurchased on a walk-in, walk-out basis for £145,000. The settlement was effected on the 6th September. In addition, the Victorian Government agreed to sell back the land to the Commonwealth for £2,500. The remarkable discrepancy in these figures is obvious. The Commonwealth sold the land and the improvements for a total of £19,690. It has now repurchased the camp, less a certain area of land, for £145,000, which, with an additional £2,500 for the land, brings the total purchase price to £147,500, or approximately £127,000 more than the figure at which the land and property were originally sold by the Commonwealth. That, I believe, requires some explanation. The matter has been considered by a number of people. Naturally, it has aroused a great deal of interest locally and in the State of Victoria generally. In fact, an official of the State Government who has been very closely concerned with this transaction, has said that it was understood that Feature Holidays Limited had effected considerable improvements while in occupation of the camp, and that these costs, together with a certain amount for good-will, were probably considered in fixing the price paid by the Commonwealth. It is a very guarded comment, and shows that that official himself cannot understand the reason for what appears to be a waste of money and gross expenditure by the department. I have made inquiries locally about the matter, and I have been informed by the valuer that the improvements effected by the company are probably not worth more than £35,000 or, at the most, £40,000. But, even assuming that the value of the improvements is £50,000, an amount of £70,000 or £80,000 is not accounted for. I make no charge against the company concerned. I do not know who the directors are, and, in any event, the vendor of a property is entitled to obtain as high a price as he can for it. The onus in this matter lies entirely with Department of the Interior, and some explanation of the purchase must be forthcoming. On the face of it there has heen a gross waste of puhlic money. It seems that the department ha9 not exercised reasonable care or given proper thought to the matter. Some people may consider that it is evidence of gross competence, and others may regard it as a case of collusion. However, I do not say that collusion has entered into the matter. I feel certain that the company has had nothing to do with anything like that. At the same time, it appears that some person has displayed gross incompetence. A complete explanation should be given of the position, and, if necessary, the transaction * should be investigated.",21
76,Mr TURNBTTLL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Wimmera) [11.37]. - I desire to refer once again to an acquisition order that the Commonwealth has issued in respect of a block of land in the City of Melbourne. The area 9$ acres, and the land is bounded Spring, Latrobe, Exhibition and Lonsservants. dale streets. At the present time, some 2,000 people, of whom more than 300 are tional public servants ex-servicemen, are occupying the buildappointed, ings on the block concerned. I should like the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Johnson) to inform me whether the monwealth intends to acquire the bourne property. I am told that the acquisition order has been issued, but no further action has yet been taken. The owners the building on that block have no idea of the amount of compensation that they will be paid, and the people who work the buildings have no indication of how much longer they will be employed there. Many of them are engaged in various industries, including the manufacture of agricultural implements, and if the Commonwealth acquires the property, they will have the greatest difficulty in finding other suitable factory and office accommodation. But that is not the only disability in this matter. The owners of the buildings are disfranchised in respect of ward elections for the Melbourne City Council and also elections for the Legislative Council of Victoria. The position should be clarified without delay, hecause the owners of the property are placed at a great disadvantage in respect of the the franchise compared with the owners of other property in the City of Melbourne. That does not appear to be fair. When I directed attention to this anomaly on a previous occasion, the Minister for the Interior replied, in effect, "" The honourable member for Wimmera will be quite happy when he sees the fine buildings in- that we shall erect on that block "".",22
77,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"And the honourable member will be pleased with them, too.",22
78,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Perhaps some of the existing buildings are not so modern and beautiful architecturally as we should like to see, but I emphasize that while accommodation for factories and offices remains acute, the buildings on that block are serving a most valuable purpose in accommodating industries that are manufacturing a variety of essential goods for the community. I may he pleased with the appearance of the new buildings that the Commonwealth will erect on that block, but I am not so satisfied when I is am reminded that the premises will be by occupied by Commonwealth public I put aside for the time being the important question of whether addishould be and ask the Minister to explain the Commonwealth's reasons for desiring to acquire 9£ acres of land Comin the heart of the City of Melfor the purpose of housing public servants. Why cannot office accommodation be provided for them on the outof skirts of the city? Many of them live in the suburbs, and travel to Melbourne daily by electric train. Once they are in aboard the train, they would not be greatly inconvenienced by having to travel to offices on the outskirts of the city. If the Commonwealth acquires that property, the present owners and the persons who work in the buildings will be seriously inconvenienced. I should lik*-. the Minister to explain the position of owners of the buildings in respect of tenure, because people cannot work with an easy mind if they are under the threat of unemployment. Once a person is deprived of an office or a house, he finds it almost impossible to obtain othei accommodation. When an acquisition order has been issued, the Melbourne City Council is unable to collect rates on the property concerned. Indeed, the acquisition order that has been issued in respect of the property to which I have referred forbids the owners to pay rates to the City Council. The council is a large organization, which provides many services, and it should not be deprived in this way of revenue from a most valuable property, consisting of 9J acres in the heart of the city. The Commonwealth does not pay any rates to municipalities on its properties. The proposed acquisition of this area is unnecessary, and is not in best interests of the owners and occupiers of the buildings, and of the City of Melbourne itself. As I have stated, the occupiers of some of the buildings are engaged in the manufacture of essential goods. The shortage of labour and building materials is acute, and if the Commonwealth expends large sums of money lavishly on building materials, without a thought for the welfare of private citizens, many people who require homes and offices must go without them. When last I asked the Minister whether the Government proposed to proceed with the acquisition of this property in Melbourne, he answered with one word, "" Yes "". I should like to know whether that is still the intention of the Government.",22
79,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Balaclava) [11.45] I support the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) on two subjects which I had intended to discuss in any case. Honourable members will notice that item 56 in the proposed vote for the Department of the Interior includes provision for the expenditure this year of £453,000 for the rent of buildings used by Commonwealth departments. Those premises are situated mainly in the capital cities. About a month ago, I asked the Minister for the Interior (Mr. the Johnson) the following questions on this subject:1. What city properties liave been acquired by the Federal Government and the Commonwealth Bank in Melbourne by purchase since the Labour administration took office, and are still held? 2. For what purposes were they acquired, and at what price? . 3. What Melbourne city properties are held by the Federal Government and the Commonwealth Bank, on lease, and at what rental and far what purpose? The information has not been supplied, to me. The Minister replied that information concerning property occupied hy Commonwealth departments located in Melbourne was being obtained. Why could he not provide it at once? It must be available. The honourable gentleman added, in his answerI t will , however, take some time to prepare. My department has no knowledge of properties purchased or leased by the Commonwealth Bank. the Surely he can obtain information ahout the properties that are occupied by the Commonwealth Bank. Craig's Buildingin Melbourne, in one of the most important sections of the city, is being held with the object of erecting another bank building on the site. Honourable members on this side of the chamber havetried unsuccessfully to obtain information about this transaction. A great deal of work is being put into the erection of buildings for the Commonwealth Bank in all parts of Australia because, in spite of the Prime Minister's assurances, the Government still proposes to carry out its scheme for the nationalization of thebanks. Apparently the questions that I put to the Minister for the Interior willnot be answered before the general election. Therefore, I am obliged to rely upon my own knowledge of what ishappening. The honourable member for Wimmera has referred to an area of 9^ acres that the Government has taken over in the city area of Melbourne. The city proper is only 1 mile square, although with all its suburbs Melbourne has a population of over 1,000,000 and covers a mu cii larger area. The Governvernment has acquired 9£ acres of that restricted area in the eastern part of the city and is refusing to pay rates on the property to the Melbourne City Council. I heard the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr George Lawson) praise the Commonwealth's policy of refusing to pay rates to municipal bodies. I cannot understand his attitude. That policy only loads heavier rate charges on to other bodies.",23
80,Mr GEOKGE LAWSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,I did not praise it. I corrected an untruthful statement that had been made by a town clerk.,24
81,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I am glad to have honourable member's assurance. He must agree with me that the Commonwealth and State governments should pay rents to city councils, as private citizens are obliged to do. Because the Melbourne City Council has been denied rates in respect of properties used by Commonwealth departments, it has had to increase the rates imposed upon other properties. Who will say that the acquisition of the properties that are occupied hy Commonwealth departments in Melbourne was necessary ? I have not been able to obtain a - complete list of them from the Minister for the Interior, but I know many of them f rom my own observations. There is the area of 9£ acres in Spring-street that I have already mentioned. Henty House was acquired compulsorily for purchase, and tenants were evicted. Only one man, who protested against eviction, was allowed to remain. That building is used by the Department of Civil Aviation, which also occupies Almora House. Chancery House, a huge building eight or nine stories high that extends from Bourke street to Chancery Lane, is occupied by a couple of Commonwealth departments. It could be used to much better advantage by private enterprise. The Manchester Unity building, a skyscraper block in Swanston-street, was taken over for Trans-Australia Airlines and some of its auxiliaries. Nicholas House, in Swanstonstreet, is used partly by the Department of Labour and National Service. A scathing article was published in the press recently declaring that Commonwealth office space in that building was not being used to advantage. The Department of Labour and National Service also uses Century House, almost opposite the Town Hall. Weall believe in having an emcient Public Service, but the Opposition objects to the Government taking over large blocks of office space in the business centres of great cities. A great deal of the work of the Publie Service could be done efficiently in other places. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) exhorts the people to make efforts to increase production; but production will not be increased if the Government blots out business premises and denies office the accommodation to young ex-servicemen who need offices and shops. The inflationary trend in our economy will be accentuated as the result of the Government's acquisition of important city buildings and its refusal to pay rate», thus forcing city councils to increase their rate charges to private citizens. It is high time that a select committee or a royal commission was appointed to investigate the Government's activities in this field. I have referred in the main to properties that have been acquired by the Commonwealth by purchase. Yet the Estimates provide for a weekly rent bill of £92,000, which will be taken from the pockets of the people. What has been done in Melbourne has been done also in Sydney and probably in other cities. Buildings in the principal business areas have been withdrawn from the use of private citizens. However, the Government is bent on socialization and it is not worried about the effect that its policy will have upon ordinary business undertakings. Earlier this morning, au honourable member referred to the profits of certain large enterprises and declared that the high level of those profits was a tribute to the Government's administration. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The fact merely showed that private enterprise could survive despite all the pressure and severe restrictions imposed upon it by the Government. Government undertakings in the main usually sustain losses instead of making profits. I want a proper answer to the question that I asked of the Minister for the Interior. The whole situation should he explained by the Government. The honourable member for Flinders referred to the .Somers Camp and mentioned the fact that I was commanding officer of the Royal Australian Air Force station at the camp during the first eighteen months of World War II . It ' is true, as the honourable gentleman said, that the camp was bought for a comparatively small sum. It was improved very considerably while it was occupied by the Royal Australian Air Force, without cost to the Government. The camp buildings were to have been disposed of after the war, but fortunately the Government agreed, after I had asked a question on the subject in the House, not to demolish it. I pointed out at the lime that it could be used as a staging camp for immigrants, because it was more like a garden village than a derelict camp. However, the Government sold it to the Government of Victoria after it had been offered for sale for some time. Some of the finest buildings were removed to the Flinders Naval Base and to the University of Melbourne. I believe that the camp could have been acquired for about £13,000, and at the time. I sought to have it handed over to a trust so that it could be used for under-privileged youths and as a training ground for teachers. A regular series of such camp gatherings could have been held throughout the year. The camp is still laid out in great blocks and has amenities for cooking, sport, and physical training, which would have been ideal for the purposes that I have suggested. It can accommodate 1,500 people. However, the Government of Victoria sold the camp to private enterprise. The company that was mentioned by the honourable member for Flinders expended a large sum of money in altering it. It also wanted to erect a memorial to the hundreds of young men who, after being trained at the camp, were killed on war service. Strangely enough, the camp has now reverted to the Commonwealth Government at a cost of £145,000, plus £2,500 for the land. Nobody would object to the company obtaining a fair price after accepting certain hazards in buying it, but it is very difficult to reconcile the great difference between the amount of £19,600, for which the Government sold the property, and the price of [37] £145,000 that it has since paid to regain possession of it. There may be a simple explanation, but I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that the transactions warrant a very careful inquiry. Mr BLAIN ' (Northern Territory) [11.55] - I refer to Division 50, dealing with the administrative costs of the Department of the Interior, for which the estimated expenditure for this year is £566,000, and to Division 57, dealing with maintenance services for properties rented by the Commonwealth, for which the expenditure for the current year is estimated at £28,000. In doing so I shall confine my remarks specifically to Canberra, our capital city. I congratulate the Minister for the Interior upon realizing that Canberra has grown up. He invited Mr. Cole, the Town Clerk of Hohart, to make a comprehensive report on the administration of Canberra. The report has now been presented and printed. It is a remarkable document, and indicates what a highly qualified man Mr Cole is. Many of us know something of his background. He is keenly interested in townplanning, and when my friend, Mr. Mclnnes, accepted an appointment in Tasmania as town and country planner, he suggested to the Premier of that State that it was not right that one man should have complete control in a planning venture. He gave away some of his authority, and specifically asked for the assistance of Mr Cole. I quote the following passage from Mr. Cole's report on Canberra:Civic education, the fostering of a community spirit, and the giving of real service to one's fellow citizens are all most important factors in the make-up of our British way of life, and how can Uie people of Canberra advance themselves and their children in the theory and practice of self-government better than by adopting its most educative and satisfying form . . . a City Council? The great feature of local government administration is that the aldermen, knowing the wishes of the people by daily contact with them, and having the advice of their technical officers, are in the best position to the relative urgency or importance of any particular matter to enable them to come to a sound and satisfactory decision. They strive to give the residents the services they require, commensurate with reasonable economy and the necessity of living within a budget. In other cities this type of Council, is job every minute of the day, and every day. giving service, watching over the purity of food, fighting contagious diseases, seeing to the collection of garbage, the - cleansing of the streets, the provision and management of parks and playgrounds, the making of roads and paths, and in doing a multiplicity of similar things; for the welfare of citizens.",24
82,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL, The honourable member might leave the matter there until the comcriticized mittee discusses the territories of the Commonwealth.,26
83,Mr BLAIN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,I was .merely making passing reference.,26
84,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,It has been a long time passing.,26
85,Mr BLAIN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I ask your permission to continue the quotation just a little further. Mr Cole quotes Professor Lasky in the following paragraph:The real value to citizens of their elected Council would soon be disclosed if any move were made to take away from them their right to have it . Professor Lasky's statement Is very apt"" The greater the 'degree in which a shares in making the rules under which lives, the more likely is his allegiance to these rules to be free and unfettered. Nor is all. The prospect of being consulted gives a sense of being significant in the State, makes him feel that he is more than recipient of orders. He realizes that the State exists for his ends and not for its own. comes to see that its needs will be met he contributes his constructive judgment the experience out of which decisions compounded. He gains the expectation of being consulted, the sense that he must an opinion on public affairs. He learns dislike orders which are issued without regard being paid to his will . He comes to have sense of frustration when decisions are made arbitrarily and without any attempt to them from the consent of those affected. learns vigilance about the ways of Those who are trained to that vigilance the conscious guardians of liberty."" The people of Darwin and Alice Springs are also seeking a share in the adminisshortage tration of their towns, and I hope that the Minister for the Interior will, in the near future, send Mr Cole to those places to map out an administrative system for them as he has done for Canberra.",26
86,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Kalgoorlie-Ministe for the Interior) [12.0] - Befor Somers Camp was acquired the proaccommodation perty was valued by approved valuaGovernment tors, whose valuations were carefully on t h f checked by valuators nominated by the Commissioner of Taxation. When there is a wide divergence in valuations, a conference of the valuators is held so that they may agree upon a figure to recommend to the Minister. It is a wild exaggeration to say that the Government has been paying too much for acquired Indeed, that is an unusual sort of charge, because we are generally for not paying enough. In this instance, the amount set aside for the purchase of the camp is £145,000, and a that figure was arrived at after an exhaustive examination.",26
87,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,Who were the valuators?,26
88,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I cannot say at this moment, but, as the honourable member knows, they were sworn valuators. It is true that the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) asked me own a question about the proposed acquisition of 9 i acres of land in the City of Melbourne. In answer to a previous question on the subject, I said that the Governcitizen ment intended to proceed with the acquihe sition of the property. This has become this necessary because of the failure of prehim vious governments to visualize the it expansion of Commonwealth activity, and the to make provision for it. During the He war, we had to take over certain private only as properties in order to house Commonto wealth departments engaged in the proseare cution of the war. Had proper provision form been made by previous governments, that to would not have been needed. As I said previously, a building will be erected that a will be a great asset to the City of Melbuild bourne. The plans of the building have He already been prepared. It is not true to power. say, as the honourable member for become Wimmera alleged, that the Government simply goes ahead with the construction of new buildings regardless of the of materials and the position generally in the building trades in the respective States. In every instance, the Government consults the State government concerned before it proceeds with the erection of buildings in any of the capital cities. That precaution is taken r in order to ensure that the Government e will not aggravate the lack of housing in capital cities. The has followed that course in respect of the buildings it proposes to construct in Melbourne. The honourable member for Wimmera should be proud to know that the development of Australia is proceeding at such a rate that the Australian Government is obliged to erect new buildings to house its departments in each of the capital cities. Those buildings will be a credit to the Government. When the Government has completed its building programme for departmental accommodation it will then be able to return to their owners all the buildings that it acquired during the war for departmental accommodation. Mr TURNBTJLI. - When will the tenants of the existing buildings have to vacate their premises?",26
89,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Naturally , they will not be disturbed until the Government is ready to proceed with the new building. The tenants concerned have been advised to that effect. They are not sitting on hot brick, as the honourable member said. They have been given some indication as to when the Government will be ready commence construction, and they will advised from time to time in that respect so that they will not be caused incondrew venience unnecessarily when they are obliged to vacate the premises. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has placed a question the notice-paper asking for information with respect to buildings occupied by government departments and the rentals paid in respect of them. He implied in his question that the Government is ing a total rental of £92,000 a week for the buildings it occupies in Melbourne. If the honourable member makes a check, he will find that the correct figure is £9,200, not £92,000.",27
90,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I did not refer to Meltenants, bourne only; I referred to buildings throughout the Commonwealth.",27
91,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The honourable member's question specifically refers to ing questions:buildings in Melbourne. The honourable member also asked for details with to buildings occupied by the Commonwealth Bank. He knows that those buildpremises ings do not come under the control of the Department of the Interior.,27
92,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,Canno t the Minister residential obtain that information?,27
93,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"-The honourable member can obtain that information from the appropriate quarter. The other information that he seeks will be obtained for him. It has not yet been possible to obtain it in the time at the disposal of the officers of my department who are now working overtime in order to catch up with their ordinary work. The department is short of staff, and under such conditions it is not practicable to detail any members of the ordinary staff to dig out the information that the honourable member has asked for. However, I undertake to supply the information as soon as possible.",27
94,Mr BEALE,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Parramatta) [12.10] I draw the attention of the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) and honourable members generally to a matter which appears to me to he of some importance as indicating what the Government is a doing with reference to the resumption of buildings in the cities of Australia to the exclusion, in many instances, of prito vate citizens, who are greatly inconbe venienced by the lack of office space. Some time ago one of my constituents my attention to the resumption by the Government of a property known as "" Club Residential Chambers"", at 96 Phillip-street, Sydney. My informant on told me that that property had been resumed some years ago, that a manager had been put in control of the property by the Government and that the manager, apparently with the Government's appropayval, was utilizing the premises partly as a residential and partly as office accommodation. The Government, apparently, expended a large sum of money on alterations to the property. I was also informed that the manager endeavoured to push out some tenants, particularly residential for the benefit of persons to whom he was more favourably disposed. In July last I wrote to the Minister on this subject, and in my letter I asked the follow1. For what purposes weTe these premises respect resumed by the Government? 2. What moneys have been spent on the by way of painting, gas pipes and other services, since the Government took the building over? 3. Are the premises still being used for purposes, and, if not, how are they being used? In particular is any part of the premises previously used for residential purposes now being used for office purposes? I u the course of time, only a few days ago, I received a reply from the Minister in which he said I desire to inform you that the property known as "" Club Chambers "", 96 Phillip-street, Sydney, was acquired by the Commonwealth on the 26th April, 1945, as part of the Commonwealth Offices site in Hunter, Phillip and Bent streets, Sydney, New South Wales. As the property was not immediately required for Commonwealth purposes, approval was given to lease the first, second and third floors of the premises to a Mr J. W. Selley, who has had possession since the 22nd August. 1945. The shops on the ground floor are let to various tenants. Investigations reveal that twenty-three rooms are let as' residentials and eleven for office purposes, also an amount of approximately £900 has been expended by the Commonwealth on the property since the acquisition. The lessee has advised that, as the residentials became vacant, the rooms were let for use as offices. I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that this property was acquired by the Government in April, 1945, that is, over four years ago. I want to know why the property was acquired at that date in view of the fact that nothing has been done in the meantime. Everybody is aware of the present desperate shortage of office space and residential accommodation in the city of Sydney. The Government purchased this property over four years ago, and, apparently, in view of the values of city properties, paid a high purchase price. The Government, however, does not use the building, but selects some person to whom it lets the property. I do not know what the terms of the tenancy are. I should be interested to learn how much rental the tenant is paying to the Government. However, it seems rather odd that the Government should take over a property of that kind and not do anything about it, but merely it to some person and give that person complete freedom to run it as he wishes. One of the complaints of my constituent is that the person who has taken over the property is seeking to push out those who are living in it as a residential building, because it is more profitable, apparently, to let the building for office purposes. In Sydney and Melbourne Commonwealth is acquiring so many Mr Beale. buildings that private persons and businesses are being, unfairly handicapped. The Minister might tell me what the projected scheme is, for, as he says, in the first paragraph of his letterThe property . . . was acquired by the Commonwealth on the 26th April, 1!)45, as part of the Commonwealth Offices site in Hunter, Phillip and Bent streets, Sydney. Is there some gigantic or wide-spread plan for Commonwealth offices in that area ? That can be achieved only at the expense of private citizens and businesses that occupy the area. Wliat is the plan? What is to be done about Commonwealth oflices? Is this a part of a master plan under which all Commonwealth offices, or most of them, will be concentrated in that most important business area? I should be obliged if the Minister would elaborate the matter and give a clear explanation of what the city of Sydney may expect hy way of expansion of Commonwealth offices. The time has come to consider how much further we must suffer constant expansion of Commonwealth activities. The expansion has been going on for many years. As I said in another connection last night, there should be some retraction of Commonwealth activities now that the war is over. Why was it thought necessary to acquire a property in 1945 and not thought necessary to do anything at all in the intervening four years? Many people have a grievance in this matter. The Minister may have a perfectly good reply. If he has, I should be glad to hear it in the interests of the particular persons I have in mind and the public generally, who are apprehensive about the expansion of Commonwealth departments to their inconvenience. Will the Minister tell me what it is all about and what we ma> expect ?",27
95,Mr RYAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Flinders) [12.17] - The let explanation given by the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) of the re-purchase of Somers Camp is far from satisfying. He said, in effect, "" A public valuer has made a valuation of this property, and that is all there is to it "" .",28
96,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,That is not true.,28
97,Mr RYAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"That is the gist of the what the Minister said. I do not want to be unfair to him. This matter has raised a great deal of public feeling in the area. Mr JOHN sow - Valuation s were made by two sworn valuers, and their valuations were checked with the valuation of the Commissioner of Taxation. The honourable member knows that that is what I said.",28
98,Mr RYAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I accept the fact that valuations were made by two public valuers and checked by .the valuation of the Commissioner of Taxation. However, that still does not explain the enormous accretion of the value of the property over two years, from about £20,000 to very nearly £150,000. No new buildings of any sort have been erected although certain interior additions have been made. I , myself, also had a valuation made by a sworn valuer who expressed the opinion that the value of improvements made to the property did not exceed £40,000. That still leaves about, £80,000 unaccounted for. It is surely not much to ask that I should he told, for the benent of those concerned, what caused the value of the property to rise to the amount to which it has risen. When this matter first came to my notice, I was told that the members of the company were receiving £2 for every £1 that they had invested in it. That may or may not be true, but that is the belief. If the Government desires to justify itself, and the transaction, it should provide further particulars. It is true that values detennined hy valuers differ. My mind goes back to the compulsory acquisition by the Government of blocks of land at Essendon to enable extensions of the Essendon aerodrome to be made. The Government offered owners of those blocks of land compensation so low as to be completely out of proportion to the value of their land. Only after they had banded together and gone to the courts did the Department of the Interior offer them a reasonable sum for their blocks. The boot is now on the other foot. We are still dependent on the word of sworn valuers. If any goodwill is involved in the transaction, how was it arrived at and what value was placed upon it? All those matters should be cleared up and I hope that the Minister will clear them up.",29
99,Mr WHITE,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Balaclava) [12.18] I support what the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) has said about the re-purchase of the Somers camp. The Minister for the Interior (Mr. Johnson) rightly falls back on the word of sworn valuers. We know that they are men of repute. But they can differ. I recall the Essendon case, which we fought on the floor of the House. Blocks of land were compulsorily acquired for the extension of the Essendon aerodrome.. Put briefly, if a man claimed £100 compensation for his block the Department of the Interior struck off the final cypher and offered him £10. After litigation, the owners finally received a lot more compensation than the depart* ment had tried to force them to accept. The reverse applies now. At one time, the Somers camp property could have been bought from the Victorian Government for £13,000. The Minister referred to improvements. The Minister for Air (Mr Drakeford) will agree that most of the improvements are due to what I did when I was commanding officer at the Somers Air Force Station, and to voluntary work done by local residents while the Air Force was in occupation of the property. The improvements did not enter into account when the State Government had it for sale. Many organizations inspected the property with a view to purchase. It was ultimately sold for £19,000. Certainly the company that bought it made many improvements, but there is a vast difference between the purchase price of £19,000 paid by the company and the £145,000 that the Government has paid for it. Surely the Minister will be frank and say that he will look into the matter. How can a State value a property at £19,000 and the Commonwealth value it at £145,000, when the only difference in the property between the date of purchase of the property by the company and the sale hy it to the Commonwealth consists in improvements? There may be an explanation, but the Minister has not given it . When the Minister for Interior replied to requests by honourable members for information about the heavy buying and leasing of properties in capital cities by the Government, I cited the buildings that had heen taken over hy it. The Minister misrepresented me when he said that I had said that the Commonwealth paid £92,000 a week for the rent of buildings. I said nothing of the sort. I refer to item 56, "" Rent of buildings. £453,000"". That sum divided by 52 gives a quotient of approximately £92,000. At the present time business properties are almost unobtainable in the capital cities. Thousands of young men who served for years in the armed forces during the war are trying to set up in business but are unable to do so because they cannot obtain accommodation. As a result of the scarcity of accommodation, racketeers are able to demand large sums as ""key-money"". Yet, in face of all this, the Government is"" acquiring city properties and thereby limiting the accommodation available to private enterprise, so that returned ex-servicemen, to mention only one class of people, have no chance of setting themselves up in business. The Government should review this whole matter. I am not suggesting that it should not use leased properties when it is necessary for it to do so, but it not waste accommodation as is being done in Chancery House and Nicholas Building. No business house would be guilty of wasting space as the Government is doing. Let us remember also that it is the people's money that is being used to pay the rentals for those buildings in which the Government is wasting so much space. Omciai policy with respect to this matter is reacting against the people, because the Government is bound to a socialistic policy that has never worked without terrorism. The Government is only sapping the enterprise and initiative of the community, and I exhort it to reduce this form of expenditure and also to give the House a complete statement regarding the properties that it has acquired or leased.",29
100,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Wimmera) [12.26]. - I listened to the reply of the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) to what had been said by honourable members on this side of the House about the acquisition of about 9^ acres of land in Melbourne for the construction of a government block of buildings, and I was not very pleased to hear him blame past governments for not providing buildings in capital cities for the accommodation of federal services. I venture to say that, had anti-Labour governments remained in office, there would not have been such a large, number of individuals in the Government's service as there now are, and it would not have been necessary to construct the gigantic buildings that are proposed to be erected in Melbourne. The Minister also said that it is necessary to have those buildings in the heart of the City of Melbourne. I do not know what support he has for that view. At the present time, the whole world is concerned about the possibility of atomic warfare, and there has been a great deal of discussion everywhere about the advisability of removing important buildings and activities from the seaboard to sites inland. Yet the Minister is advocating that what must be regarded as important buildings for the accommodation of government departments shall be right in the centre of a capital city, which would be a certain target for the enemy in the event of this country becoming should engaged in an atomic war. How can the Minister justify such a policy of centralization when thinking people all over Australia are advocating decentralization? Is it not reasonable to hold that the Australian Government should give a lead to the community by decentralizing its departments? It is not necessary that these departments be in the centre of a city, because they can do their work just as effectively in another location. - I have noticed that the Department of Works and Housing is constructing many office buildings for government use in Canberra, right at the very seat of government. About eighteen months or two years ago I asked the Minister why, when there were big plans for constructing government buildings at Canberra, it was necessary to acquire land in Melbourne for the same purpose. The Minister has not answered a very important question that I put to him regarding the position of the present owners or tenants of the buildings standing on the area that has been acquired in Melbourne. Those owners or tenants have been disfranchised in respect of Victorian Legislative Council elections and ward elections for the City of Melbourne, because the Government has issued an acquisition order. The Minister has said that these people are not, as he put it, "" on a hot brick"", because every now and then he has stated that the Government will not require the buildings for a long time.",30
101,Mr JOHNSON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,I said that the tenants would get reasonable notice.,31
102,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Was it necessary to issue an acquisition order in respect of the privately-owned buildings on that site before the Government was ready to proceed with its plans? If the Government had not issued the acquisition order, these owners and tenants would still be able to cast their votes, which they are Burely entitled to do. Had the Government not issued that order, the Melbourne City Council would be able to collect rates from those people, who are willing to pay rates and, indeed, have actually asked the permission of the Minister to pay them for the time being. The Minister has not allowed them to do so. The present position cannot be justified, and if the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell), who appears to he interested, can explain this matter any more clearly than the Minister for the Interior can, there is nothing to stop liim from doing so now.",31
103,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,Melbourne-Minister for Information and Minister for Immigration) [12.31] - I accept the honourable member's invitation.,31
104,Mr HOLT,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The Minister will delay the adjournment of the House by doing so.,31
105,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I am entitled, as the honourable member for Melbourne, to speak on this matter, both by the virtue of the fact that I am interested in it also that I have been invited to do so by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull).",31
106,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,There is also the fact that the Chair has called the Minister.,31
107,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I should like to know why the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull), who represents an electorate 300 miles away from Melbourne, is so vitally interested in the acquisition of land in that city.",31
108,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,Because I believe m the welfare of Australia and in a policy of decentralization.,31
109,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,I do not believe it ! The honourable member has raised this issue three or four times. I believe that he has raised it because somebody in the area affected has asked him to do so. Tie has friends in that area who do not desi.rj the Government to proceed with its plans.,31
110,Mr TURNBULL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,I have no friends in the area. I do not even know any one in it.,31
111,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I am not denying the honourable member's right to raise the issue. It is legitimate to raise i i once, but to maintain a campaign on the issue indicates that the honourable gentleman is allowing himself to be used by some of the interested parties who desire to prevent the acquisition. I am familial with the area concerned because it i» within my electorate and also because 1 was a member of the Melbourne City Council for more than six years.",31
112,Mr BEALE,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The council has never recovered from that.,31
113,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"I was a distinguished member of that council, and I have been sorely missed by it since I have not been able to devote time to the deliberations of the Melbourne City Council, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, and this Parliament all at the same time. The area that the Commonwealth has purchased is largely a slum area. It contains some of the worse parts of Melbourne, and the 'buildings' in its are bound to be pulled down sooner or later. The Melbourne City Council, which has only ten Labour party representatives out of a total of 33 memand bers, was very glad that the Australian Government acquired the land, which is at an important junction of two main streets, for the purpose of building, some time in the future, a big pile of buildings to house Commonwealth public servants employed in Victorian .branches of Commonwealth departments, so that the premises that those branches are at present occupying in the main parts of the city can be left for the use of business people. As the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) has repeatedly stated, the work of building over that area will he done in stages. Numbers of the people will not be disturbed for a considerable time to come, and they will be given reasonable notice to vacate. From my own knowledge of that area, notice will extend over twelve months or more and a period of ten years may elapse before the plan is completed. It will take all of that time to erect this good pile of buildings. The Commonwealth ought to erect suitable buildings in every capital city. It should not be renting buildings here, there, and everywhere in the capital cities while the State governments have adequate accommodation both for their public servants and the public. Of course, it is in the interests of the Commonwealth that it should be properly represented by State branches of all its departments. It is not intended to build huge piles of buildings in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart and to fill them with people who ought properly to be working in Canberra. We are building in Canberra as well as in every capital city. We have not selected Melbourne alone. It is a pity that past governments did not plan as this Government is planning. No valid criticism can be advanced against the acquisition of this land, which will be properly utilized for the benefit of the people of this country. Anybody who knows the area must acknowledge that it is close to both the State Parliament House and State Government buildings. It is at a point where it will serve the interests of people Coming from the north, east and west. It h? also near a point where there.will be an underground railway station in from ten to twelve years' time, and at the junction of several important tramlines. It has everything to recommend it as a centre for government offices. That a miserable little coterie of people should think that they ought to be allowed to continue in slum factoriesin some instances-in that area, retard progress, and have their cause advanced by the honourable member for Wimmera on innumerable occasions, is a little trying to those who know the facts. No responsible persons in Melbourne-only irresponsible honourable member who keeps raising things that have nothing to do with his electorate-are trying to frustrate the progress of the City of Mr Calwell. Melbourne, and the desires of the Melbourne City Council and officers of all government departments to locate at one centre in Melbourne, for the convenience of the people, all of the Commonwealth public departments, so that the best interests of everybody can be served. I do not care whether anybody in that area gets a vote for the Legislative Council. It is the legislative "" abattoirs "" of Victoria, and has the most restricted franchise in operation in Australia today. Compared with the Legislative Council of Victoria the British House of Lords is a. collection of red revolutionaries. Here we have bricks and mortar determining the fate of Victoria, and being, in fact, more important than blood and bone. The honourable member for Wimmera, with his backward mind, is asking a democratic progressive Government to do something to protect the franchise rights for a Legislative Council election of people who do not live in the area at all. They live somewhere else. Although they can exercise the franchise for the Legislative Council in respect of their residential and their property qualifications, they want to have rights in respect of this slum property.",31
114,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Corangamite) [12.41] - I cross swords with the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) when he takes the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Turnbull) to task for raising a matter that is of some importance. The Minister said that the area of land being acquired is outside the honourable member's electorate. That proves that the honourable member for Wimmera has a broad national outlook. The principal point that was stressed by the honourable member was the subject of rates. However, the Minister has carefully evaded that issue. The honourable member for Wimmera pointed out that the owners of the land that has been acquired by the Commonwealth have been instructed not to pay any further rates to the municipality in which it is located. That is manifestly unfair to the municipality. This Government is much the better at drawing up plans that carrying them out. The buildings envisaged by - the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Johnson) will probably be erected in the dim and shadowy future. In the interim, however, they are to be free of municipal rates, although the municipalities have to provide all services in that portion of the city. That most pertinent aspect was ignored by the Minister. The honourable member for Wimmera was quite within his rights. He was doing a public duty. If the Minister were to do his duty he would make an adequate reply to the point raised in connection with the non-payment of rates to the Melbourne City Council.",32
115,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,Melbourne!-Minister for Information and Minister for Immigration) [12.43] - The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCDonald) knows that under the Constitution the Commonwealth is not obliged to pay rates in respect of any properties.,33
116,Mr MODONALD,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,I know that only too well. But the Commonwealth should not prevent the people that I have mentioned from paying rates.,33
117,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The Commonwealth prevents those people from paying rates because they are occupying Commonwealth property.,33
118,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,Has the Commonwealth paid for the property that it has acquired in that area ?,33
119,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"The Commonwealth bas acquired that property. Legally, it is Commonwealth property. I know that the honourable member for Corangamite feels very strongly on this subject, because he has been president of a municipal association, and has had a long and distinguished municipal career. If the Commonwealth acquires property the obligation of tenants to pay rates ceases at the time of acquisition. The attempt by some people to pay rates is motivated by their desire to retain their eligibility to vote for a particular person's election to the Melbourne City Council.",33
120,Mr MODONALD,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,I am concerned with the municipality.,33
121,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"It is motivated, not by a desire to help the municipality, but in order to help a particular candidate. Because it is part of a war against the Commonwealth on the subject of acquisition, the Commonwealth must protect its position. Legislation in relation to acquisitions was placed on the statute-book all in 1903. What we are doing is in strict accord with what has been done by every previous government. It is true that in some instances the Commonwealth Bank makes ex gratia payments for services. The honourable member says that the Commonwealth should pay rates to municipalities on the same hasis as if the property was owned by private persons.",33
122,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,I contend that rates should be paid to the municipality up to the time that the Commonwealth is ready to put its plans into operation.,33
123,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"The honourable member for Corangamite has claimed that the Commonwealth should not refuse to allow these people to pay rates. The Commonwealth has acted in accordance with the legislation governing this matter. It has made no departure from the practice observed by previous governments hut has acted in strict accordance with precedent. Perhaps at some future date some government will make ex gratia payments to the Melbourne City Council. I apologize to the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) for having to make these observations. I have done so because, as I have said, 1 represent the electorate of Melbourne in this Parliament, and by the grace of God and the sturdy common sense of at least 51 per cent of the electors, I hope to be their representative for a very long time to come. Hr. ABCHIE CAMEBON (Barker) [12.46] - I regret that I was not present in the chamber when the debate on this matter commenced. Because of the continued buying up of land by the Commonwealth in municipal areas I am very concerned about the vital matter of the payment of rates. Commonwealth iand is free from rates. The Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) has. tried to justify that position. It is true that under our constitutional set-up the Commonwealth is not liable to pay rates, but sooner or later it will be forced to revise its attitude. l ! cannot go on picking the best =ites in the various municipalities and expect the ratepayers to provide roads and footpath* for its use free of charge.",33
124,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,We give the municipalities the equivalent of rates by way of grants.,34
125,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"The Commonwealth never hands over money as a gift, yet nothing is denied for political purposes. This situation must be squarely faced. The Commonwealth cannot expect to continue to do what it i.= now doing in this respect. When the original decision was made that the Commonwealth should not pay rates, it was thought that Commonwealth buildings would be restricted to post offices, a few customs houses and the like. The ideas of the Commonwealth have expanded as time has gone on. To-daj, all sorts of buildings are being taken over by the Commonwealth. In Adelaide, after deserving institutions have commenced negotiations to acquire sites, the Commonwealth has stepped in and said "" Too bad; we want them"" and it has acquired them by exercising its compulsory acquisition powers.",34
126,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The honourable member himself did that when he was Postmaster-General.,34
127,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,Where did I do it?,34
128,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,All around Australia.,34
129,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,Do not be funny; I was Postmaster-General for only five months.,34
130,Mr CALWELL,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The honourable member did a lot of damage in that time.,34
131,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"On the contrary, everything that I did was useful and in accordance with the law. Let us consider what happened in relation to the closing of radio station 2KY. No Labour member has ever been game to mention that matter.",34
132,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL, Order ! The committee is not dealing with radio station 2KY.,34
133,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The question of ownership of properties is a very important one. The policy of the Australian Labour party provides for certain forms of public ownership and if it is given full effect many radio stations will go off the lists of rate payers.,34
134,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The honoraible member must not try to evade the ruling of the Chair. The subject with which he is now dealing has no relation to the estimates before the committee.,34
135,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"The committee is dealing with the subject of - rateable property. When radio stations are privately owned they are established in rateable properties, but if they are owned by the Commonwealth they pay no rates. Government members cannot laugh off this matter. Before very long the Government will have to adopt a more up-to-date attitude on this matter than it has done until now. Let us consider the position of the Commonwealth Bank. I am not sure whether or not the Commonwealth Bank pays rates on the properties that it owns. I know that in my electorate the Commonwealth has threatened to acquire certain properties on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank. I have very grave doubts whether the compulsory acquisition provision of the Constitution applies to the Commonwealth Bank. If it does, and the Commonwealth is empowered to acquire property for the Commonwealth Bank, it could establish banking premises in the bottom part of a building and let the rest of the building to tenants from whom it would draw rent, and still escape the payment of rates. Such a state of affairs is utterly immoral and cannot be justified. I am surprised that the Minister for Information should attempt to justify it. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. PETROL. Motion (by Mr JOHNSON) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",34
136,Mr HOLT,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"Fawkner) [12.50] - I desire to raise a matter in relation to which I sought an answer from the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) at question time today. I should not have had occasion to bring it forward now had the Prime Minister not deliberately evaded, while purporting to answer, the question that I put to him. My question related to the announced scale of petrol rationing which we believe is to come into effect in the middle of November. The Prime Minister has stated publicly that the ration scale which will apply at that time will be the same as that which operated when the High Court declared the Commonwealth's petrol rationing scheme to be invalid. I asked the right honourable gentleman whether he had authorized the importation of additional quantities of petrol in order to maintain the ration at the proposed level. I did so because a good deal of mystery surrounds the question of the quantity of petrol that is able to Australia. In August this year, the Prime Minister told the State Previers that since June, when petrol rationing ceased, the consumption of petrol in Australia had increased by 45 per cent., thus, to use the right honourable gentleman's own words, ""proving the oracles either completely false or complete liars"". I do not know whether or not the figure which he cited was accurate; but I know that at the end of last month most of the petrol suppliers had their bowsers virtually empty. They were not able to supply the requirements of even their regular customers. Now we are told that sufficient petrol will be available to institute the rationing scheme on the old 'basis. Unless the explanation is either that the stock position is very different from what we have been given to understand it is, or that the Prime Minister has authorized additional imports of petrol the right honourable gentleman has quite recklessly and for obvious political purposes decided that the ration scale under the new scheme will be maintained at the old rate, hoping that he will be able to get through the election period without undue criticism, and intending at a later date to impose a very much more drastic ration scale than would otherwise have been necessary. The Qovernment cannot have it every way. Either supplies are adequate to continue the ration at the scale proposed, in which event there was no need for the panic talk we have heard from the lips of the Prime Minister during recent months, or the right honourable gentleman has authorized additional imports. He has said that the Government will not allow additional imports to be made, thus increasing the drain on dollars. These are matters which should he cleared up immediately. If we cannot have the feast which adequate and additional supplies of petrol would assure us, we do not want to have the famine that will be caused by the granting of an excessive ration at the outset of the re-instituted rationing scheme. There is a mystery about the 50,000,000 gallons of petrol which the Commouwealth has subtracted from the supplies available to the petrol companies in order to increase our defence reserves. Was it merely by chance that at a time when supplies for petrolavailusers were becoming short, the Government should decide to increase its defence stocks to the extent of 50,000,000 gallons? Alternatively, is it proposed that, in the event of rationing being continued, and petrol stocks in the hands of the oil companies being inadequate to maintain rationing on the scale which the Government envisages, the Government will turn to these defence reserves as a supplementary source to maintain the ration at the initial level? These are matters of very great interest to the people of the Commonwealth. They are of vital interest and importance to users of petrol for industrial purposes and for primary production. We are entitled to know the facts. The Prime Minister has not hesitated to quote the views of his official advisers when it has suited his argument to do so. Why, then, could t e not have given me, in answer to my question this morning, the information that he has received from his official advisers as to whether the rationing scale now to be adopted is justified by the level of stocks in the Commonwealth, and whether that scale can he continued? The right honourable gentleman muse have received advice on this matter, and if so, we are entitled to know what it is. We want to know whether additional supplies are coming from overseas, and whether current stocks, supplemented hy oversea imports or by the Government's own defence stocks, justify the indefinite continuance of the rationing scale now proposed. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 12.57 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were circulated:COMMONWEALTH PUBLICATIONS.",34
137,Mr RYAN,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. What is the total number of publications published by each department of the Commonwealth during the year 1949, and issued under the authority and with the compliments of the respective Ministers? 2. What are the titles of these publications, the numbers sircuiated in each instance, and the tetal cost to the respective departments? 3. Are members of the Federal Farliament supplied with a copy of each of these publica-tions; if not, why not? 4. Is there any reason for the issue of these publications other than for propaganda purposes in the interests of the present Crovernment?",35
138,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTEALIAN NATIONAL,The information will he obtained and furnished to the honourable member in due course.,36

143,Mr WARD,THE COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS AN D WORKS,"On the 20th September the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel whether the Government was aware of the fact that when Morinda is withdrawn from the service to Norfolk Island, that island will be deprived of shipping facilities to Australia? If so, what did the Government intend to do to provide shipment of supplies from Australia to the 1,200 inhabitants of the island. I wish to advise the honourable member that Burns, Philp and Oompany Limited, which haa maintained a shipping service to Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands for many years, has advised my department 'that owing to the serious loss incurred in operating the vessel since. it was derequisitioned in April,. 1948, the company will be unable to carry out the service after the present voyage ends in a few weeks' time without a substantial Bubsidy from the Commonwealth Government. Since August, 1948, the service haa heen at intervals of approximately three months. The position is heing examined with a view to providing for the continuance of a service to the islands mentioned PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.",39
144,Mr WARD,THE COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS AN D WORKS,"On the 22nd September the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) asked a question of my colleague, the Attorney-General, as to how far the work of consolidation and codification of the laws of Papua and New Guinea had proceeded and what steps have been taken to make the laws of those two territories readily accessible to members of the legal profession and to the puhlic in those - territories. In reply, the Attorney-General said he would endeavour to ascertain how far the work has progressed hut he pointed out that the task cannot be completed in a matter of weeks or even months. I now inform the honourable member that aa a result of the Japanese invasion of the territories of Papua and New Guinea stocks of the laws were lost and it was decided to consolidate and reprint the laws of both territories. The consolidated reprint will consist of four volumes of textual matter and one index volume in respect of each territory. Four annotated volumes containing the complete text of New Guinea laws from 1921 to 1945 and two annotated volumes of the laws of Papua from 1888 to 1945 have heen printed and are available in the territory for purchase hy any person requiring them and they are also available from the Department of External Territories, Canberra. The remaining two volumes of Papuan texts are expected to be available shortly, after which the index volume of both territories will be published. A commencement has been made with the amalgamation and revision of the laws of the two territories, but, as pointed out hy my colleague, the Attorney-General, this is a task which will take a considerable time to complete. SALES TAX.",39
145,Mr CHUXEY,THE COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS AN D WORKS,"On the 16th September the honourable member for Deakin (Mr. Hutchinson) asked me a question concerning sales tax hi respect of concrete mixers and brick moulds. I desire to confirm my oral reply that goods of this kind are obtainablefree of tax hy huilding contractors by virtue of the exemption of aids to manufacture. That exemption applies only to persons who are engaged in the business of making goods for sale, and the exemption waa granted for the purpose of avoiding double taxation, firstly on the manufacturing plant, and secondly on the manufactured goods, which would bear tax on a value which would take into account the coat of the plant. There is no similar question of double taxation in the case of goods made by a person privately for hia own use. Provision haa not therefore been made for exemption of concrete mixers or brick moulds purchased for such use. It is clear that consideration could not be given to this question without going into the matter of all other tools and equipment, for private or domestic use. The whole matter haa heen noted for consideration on the next occasion when the aales tax is under review.",39
