1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The following paragraph was published in a recent issue of the Sydney Morning HeraldIn regard to the system of giving officers in the Telegraph Department their Sunday pay by a day off, in lieu of cash, as mentioned in Saturday's Herald, the Postmaster-General, Mr. Mauger, states that he long ago issued instruc-' tions that the system was to be discontinued. His order is now - in force in Victoria, and should be'all over the.States. Is the Postmaster-General - aware that the order which he issued some lime ago, to apply uniformly throughout the Commonwealth, is being disregarded so far as Sydney is concerned?",14
2,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"At the time of my recent visit to Sydney, the instruction which I had issued was not beingobserved there; but I have taken steps to bring about its observance hereafter. IMPORTATION OF GUNS.",14
3,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Referring to the rumours current in England, that foreign firms are manufacturing and sending to Australia guns which are imitations of well-known English makes, is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware if that is being done? Has he been informed by his officials that such guns have been imported ?",14
4,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"The matter is receiving close attention by the De-. partment. It is believed that something of the kind re€erre d to is taking place, and when we are certain, we shall take steps to prevent it.",14
5,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Will the Minister refer to the matter later on ?,14
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,J shall be glad to let' the honourable member know the result of the investigation - continued COMMONWEALTHAND STATES : FINANCIAL PROPOSALS.,14
7,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I ask the Treasurer, without notice, whether, in order to carry out the proposals wh ch, on behalf of the Government, he has submitted to the Premiers' Conference, it will not be necessary to obtain' the amendment of sections 94 aiid 105 of the Constitution?",14
8,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In consultation with the Prime Minister, I became aware that to give effect to the scheme it 10.30 would be necessary to propose the amendment of the Constitution, and asked the assistance of the Premiers ito bring that about should the scheme be adopted. That statement, almost in its entirety, was made to the Conference by the Prime Minister.",14
9,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer whether, in view of the fact that a general discussion is taking place in the Premiers' Conference upon the proposals of the Government .for adjusting the future financial relations of the States to the Commonwealth, and that these proposals can have no effect unless they are approved by a majority of this Parliament, he. will afford us an early opportunity of expressing an opinion upon the scheme outlined by the Prime Minister?",14
10,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Everythin g will depend upon the action'taken by the States Premiers as to whether the proposal will be submitted to Parliament immediately or not. But certainly it cannot be so submitted until we have dealt with the questions which are now before us ,14
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Pu t it in .the Museum.,14
12,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member would look well beside it .,14
13,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"As I have not been able, from a casual perusal of the Prime Minister's scheme, to ascertain whether the £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 which it is proposed to return annually to the States is to be returned perpetually or whether it is only to be continued for alimited timesay, for thirty-five years- I desire to ask the Treasurer what the position really is.",14
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 is not intended to be returned to the States annually for all time.",14
15,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"It will be returned to them so long as the debts remain, in existence.",14
16,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It will not be . after the redemption of the debts.,14
17,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Seeing that it has been reported in the press that the financial scheme put forward by the Prime Minister is that formulated by the honor: able member for Mernda., I desire to ask the Treasurer whether-he is aware that the Government officials at the Treasury simply "" riddled "" that scheme when, it was first propounded ?",14
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I was not aware that the Treasury officials ""riddled "" the scheme put forward by the honourable member for Mernda. I think that his scheme represents an attempt to do something which is very difficult, and to do it fairly. The Government scheme is largely, based upon that which was put forward by the honourable member. It embodies a few variations, but, personally, I give the honourable member for Mernda every credit for the work which he has performed. I go further, and, on behalf of the Government, thank him for doing all that he possibly could to assist them in the settlement of this most intricate question. SLANDERS ON PARLIAMENT .",15
19,Mr REID,Unknown,"W it h reference to the statement made by the Treasurer yesterday, afterwards withdrawn, that an American Trust, known as the Standard Oil Company, had acquired am improper influence over honourable members in connection with an item in the Tariff relating to kerosene-the statement - arising out of something said by the Minister of Trade and Customs to the Treasurer, which, though not intended for publication, made public, to the effect that a'certain decision of the Committee in connection once what I said. with the item would be a victory for the trust-whereupo n the Committee decided that. ro postpone the further consideration of the made outside. item, and with reference also to the fact that direct charges of the bribery and ruption of members by the company in conhave nexion with this item, previously made persons outside, were thereby revived, I dealt with. ask the Treasurer, as representing the Prime Minister-who m I know to be unMinister avoidably absent-whethe r lie into his immediate consideration ' the desirability of making either indepenthat dently or by means of the joint Comand mittee appointed by Parliament, as a result desire will be done. of the direct charges, an investigation into the truth of the allegations? The nating desire in my mind is, not to bring about the punishment of persons who have this morning. made statements reflecting on Parliament, but to give an opportunity to them to jusreflecting t if y what they have published, and, if bers. they cannot clo so, to allow the character of Parliament to be cleared of the aspersonal explanation. sions. Sir - WILLIAM LYNE - W it h reference to what the right honourable gentleman has said about charges made yesterday, my reply is that none were intended to be made.",15
20,Mr REID,Unknown,"At any rate, they were withdrawn.",15
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No charges were intended to be made.,15
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why does the Treasurer keep saying that? Charges were made.,15
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Unles s the House itself wants an investigation into the matter, I do not think it of sufficient importance to justify any action. As for the rumours which the right lionorable gentleman says were revived, I understand that their investigation has been referred to a Joint Committee. I do not think that I shall see the Prime Minister before Monday, but I shall consult him about the other matter when I meet him, and if he thinks that what transpired yesterday is of sufficient importance to be referred to the Joint Committee, or to be inquired into in any other way, I shall agree to that course- Personally, I am strongly of the opinion that a mountain has been made of a molehill. No imputation of anv kind was intended last night.",15
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"At any rate, what was was said was offensive.",15
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I withdrew at,15
26,Mr REID,Unknown,I do not desire to dwell on I think more of the direct charges,15

28,Mr REID,Unknown,I suppose that the Prime will make a statement about the will take matter on Tuesday ?,15
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am sure he will. I shall consult him about it, anything that honourable members may I do not pay any attention myself to the rumours and repedomititions, and the distorted reports of what I said last night, which appear in the press No one, I am sure, has the slightest wish to make any imputation on the honour of honourable memI have made none.  In a leader in this morning's Age, I am referred to as having made a statement about certain - protectionists in this House. That is utterly false. I have not made such a statement, nor have I had in my mind the opinion which it embodies.",15
30,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The fact that the statement appears in the Age should be its refutation.  tion of the leader of which I complain.,16
31,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Surely the honourable member does not desire that the words shall be repeated in Hansard.  ber think that .I am content to lie under a foul slander? As the statement has appeared in the press, surely my denial should appear in Hansard. That part of the article of which I complain readsBut they must blame themselves that their motives have been misinterpreted in certain circles. It has always been in their power to crush the evil flow of slander at its source by denying the professional lobbyists, of whom they have good reason to complain, access to the precincts of Parliament. By postponing this course until it has been practically thrust upon them they have clone Parliament an ill turn, and at the same time they have very badly served all semi or insincere protectionists. Page very sensibly remarked last night, those gentlemen will now be placed in a most unfortunate position should they register their votes in favour of the foreign Trust.which is trying 'so hard to destroy the Australian industry. I did not make such a statement, and I give the newspaper account an emphatic contradiction. Sir WILLIAM LYNE laid upon the table the following paper :Papua - Ordinance s of 1908-Por t dues revision. MR. R. S. WALPOLE.",16
32,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Has the Attorney General seen the account of a meeting of the Employers' Federation, held yesterday, at which the honourable member for Fawkner was present, when Mr R. S.Walpole is reported to have saidThe greatest fight that Australia had ever known would be at the elections at the end of 1909. It was a question of which class was to be top dog, and if the employers had the assistance of the farmers they would be sure to win.",16
33,Mr REID,Unknown,That man must be a perfect as. . He is of more value to the honourable member's side than to any one else. I believe that he must be in the pay of the Labour Party.,16
34,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I ask the Attorney General whether he advocates a class war?,16
35,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It does not seem to me that the question arises in connection with any matter affecting the administration of my Department. The fight referred to is presumably a political contest. In my opinion,' any party which attempts to participate in a class contest will carry its own condemnation.",16
36,Mr REID,Unknown,"Hear , hear. Anything of the sort would be the greatest political evil.",16
37,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"We are prepared to go into it up to our necks. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I desire to ask the Attorney-General whether a law can be enacted to prevent any man from preaching class destruction in this country, seeing that that means the destruction of property. In the event of our being unable to prevent an incendiary of that class from preaching such a doctrine, will the Attorney-General take steps to suppress elections altogether? ",16
38,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The most important part of the honourable member's question is As Mr the last part, in which he expresses a desire - that this Parliament should be made perpetual. Perhaps there is something-in that suggestion which is worthy of consideration. The point involved in his suggestion is whether it is right that any individual should be allowed to advocate attacks on private property. I can understand the honourable member's anxiety upon that score. But I am not aware that the statement in PAPER. ' question had reference to' an attempt to take property from any individual. It appears to have been a statement made on behalf of property and interests .generally. The existing law sufficiently enables the authorities to deal with any individual who attempts to lead attacks on property.",16
39,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. As my name has again been introduced into this matter, I wish to say that I heard what Mr Walpole said upon the occasion referred to. That gentleman directed special attention to the fact that if the Employers' Federation were going to do anything injurious to the working men of this country, he would not be able to co-operate with .them any longer. I think that the class to which he alluded was that which is dominated by the caucus.",16
40,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I desire to point out that personal explanations are not permitted to deal with the remarks of other than honourable members themselves. Honourable members who have been' misrepresented or misunderstood are at liberty to make a personal explanation, but they are not at liberty to do so on behalf of . persons outside of this House.",16
41,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he has seen an account of the meeting to which attention has been drawn, and whether he has noticed that the honourable member for Fawkner, who was chairman of the gathering, is reported to have said- 1 Mr Walpole was going to take a well-earned rest. . . . Mr Walpole was a believer in the eight-hours principle moderately applied. I also desire to know whether in his new protection proposals, the Treasurer intends to provide definitely for the observance of the eight hours principle, or whether he purposes recognising the eight hours' principle ""moderately applied"" ?",17
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Whenever I have an opportunity of doing so, I always endeavour to provide definitely for the observance of the eight hours system. NATIONAL BANK. Mr J. H . 'CATTS - I desire to ask the Treasurer whether he is in favour of the establishment of a National Bank?",17
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I really think that questions without notice should be very simple, and certainly the honourable member's question does not come within that category. I know that a great many persons favour the establishment of a National Bank, and I want to see something approaching such an institution created, but not a bank of exchange. . Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Treasurer wants a pawn shop. DUTY ON' PRINTING PAPER. INSTRUCTION TO CUSTOMS OFFICERS.",17
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question relating to the instruction issued by him some time ago, which enabled certain newspapers to get their imprinted British supercalendered paper, which was otherwise dutiable at 15 per cent., in free as *' news "" paper. In the answer he gave to a questionwhich I put to him the other day, the Minister stated that the Bulletin was specifically mentioned in the instruction which I quoted, because the questioni was first raised in connection with that journal. I desire to ask whether other newspapers have received a similar privilege, against the will'of Parliament, under the following instructionPrinting paper, coloured, for covers of weekly publications, and similar productions, registered for transmission through the' post, may be deemed ""news"" and dealt with under item 352D under security. I may add that that instruction is dated 12th September, 1907.",17
45,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I must ask the honourable member to give notice of his questioni, but I may add that no newspapers have received any privilege in opposition to the will of Parliament. EMPIRE RIFLE MATCHES.",17
46,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"the Minister of Defence, ufon notice Whether he is aware that the cadets taking part in the annual Empire rifle matches are not all able to get the use of the best rifle that can be used in such contests. If so, will he take steps to provide enough rifles to supply to those Commonwealth cadets who have demonstrated their proficiency, ond also any other aids to excellence under his control ?",17
47,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I previously made inquiries into this matter, and found that the procedure adopted was not satisfactory. Instructions have now been issued which will remove all cause of complaint in the future. CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL.

48,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.57] - Before I submit a motion in reference to this item, I desire to say a few words. It has been suggested-and with a good deal of force^that the duty which has been requested upon oregonnamely, is.'per 100 superficial feet-is too high, and I have been considering whether some of the timber included in the paragraph under consideration should not be made dutiable at that rate, whilst the softer woods-especiall y oregon-shoul d be admitted at 6d. per 100 super, feet.",17
49,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,What about the white timber for butter-boxes included in the next paragraph ?,17

51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In the north. they do that? An abundance of it can be obtained in Queensland. If those concerned choose turn their attention to the matter, there plentv of timber suitable for butter-boxes to be found in the Commonwealth. A dedevelop putation from Queensland recently waited our pine forests. upon me in reference to this matter, and I requested them to put their views in writing. They .did so, and they informed methe that the opposition to the duty upon this spect of class of timber really emanated from the importers, who are making very heavy profits indeed. They declared that whenonly ever any proposal is made to supply timber for butter-boxes from Northern Queensthe other timbers in this paragraph. land, the importers kill it by quoting the price at which the imported article can obtained. When I asked why the statethe ment had been made, that it was impos1st September nextsible to place an order for between £2,000 and £5,000 worth of this timber their reply was that there was plenty available one if those requiring it were prepared to pay a reasonable price. I am not so concerned about the request with respect to the duty on butter-box timber as I am about that relating to the duty on oregon, because, according to the honourable memme on the subject. ber for Barrier, oregon, which is not duced here, is absolutely necessary for in mines. I differ from the honourable to them made in writing. member, but recognise that he has a better knowledge of what is required of Broken Hill than I have.

I have takai into consideration, as far as possible, the information supplied to me by the trade. It is pointed out that to stop at timber ""r-inch thick would be ' to penalize users of weatherboards,. Weatherboards slightly less than J-inch thick, and unless we adopted this rule importers will be required to pay duty upon them on a basis different from that adopted in other parts of the world. Those who deliberately send in timber less than j | inch in thickness must pay on it the full duty on timber of not more than 1 inch nor less than g inch in thickness.",18

79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No , only in respect of timber of less than 3 of an inch in thickness. I have made this statement in order that honourable members may are know 'what I intend to do when we reach a later request relating to this division. I move That the requested amendment be made, with the following modification :-""Ad d new subitem :-Oregon , undressed, in sizes of 12 inches x 6 inches (or its equivalent) and over, per 100 super, feet, 6d."" - Mr Glynn (Angas) [11.15] - I do not intend to occupy the attention of the Committee for more than a few minutes, because some honourable members are more conversant than I am with the details of the timber trade. I am pleased that the Ministry, to some extent, have recognised the extreme character of the suggestion made by the Senate in respect of an item on which we made a great fight in this House. It seems inconceivable that senators should make a suggestion which will hit an industry with exports representing between £26,000,000 and £27,000,000 of outtotal exports, in favour of manufactured exports representing about £ 2 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 . While desirous to encourage the manufactures of the Commonwealth, the Senate has displayed a lamentable lack of the sense of proportion in striking at an industry on which most of the other industries rest, in favour of one which shows such a small proportion of our total exports. On the question of measurement, I merely wish to the draw attention to the effect of the suggested alteration in the definition, and I am surprised that the Ministry, when they recognise that the Senate is wrong, do not revert to the original decision of the House of Representatives. There is always some matter of substance underlying these verbal alterations; and I remind honourable members that the original definition which appears to be the standard definition, was. inserted after ample consideration - I do not intend to go into details as to the operation of the proposed duties, but shall simply state, on information supplied to me, that in one case the duty will be increased by 14 per cent., in another case by 33 1-3 per cent., in another by 58 per cent., in another by\ 86 per cent., in another by 100 per cent., and in a fifth by 166 per cent.",19
80,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,And the greatest increases are in connection with sizes of J inch and under.,19
81,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have no desire to cumber Hansard with details, seeing that the item was exhaustively debated on a previousoccasion. These duties f all on a class of timber largely used by the workthere ing and poorer classes in the erection of their houses; and the Committee ought to hesitate before agreeing to any increase.",19

88,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have never complained about those interested Coming - to Parliament House, but there was a jeering interjection about representatives from Queensland placing certain facts and argusome ments before the Treasurer.",20
89,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Surely they are entitled to wait as a deputation on the Treasurer !,20
90,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Not only are tliey entitled, but it is their bounden duty to do so. I remember well that, when the timber duties were under discussion in 1901-2, were representations made from every State that there was no timber in Australia .fit for making butter-boxes-that only New Zealand pine was suitable.",20
91,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable up member is wrong in suggesting that every said there was no suitable timber nr,20
92,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"My recollection is that until samples made of Australian timber were shown here, the statement generally made was that the only suitablematerial was New Zealand pine. At any rate, Ausbe adtralian timber was spoken of in cona temptuous terms, and we were informed by importers that it was most unsuitable and dangerous for the making of butter-boxes. But, after all, what does a duty of is. per first question is 100 feet mean ?",20

99,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is another matter; we are now dealing with the handling wood in mines.,21
100,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,Is not railway freight regulated by weight?,21
101,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes , but I do not desire to confuse the two issues. The strong into it. argument against Australian timber - was that it is heavier to handle in the mines. We get tired of debating questions of this of hardwood? kind, but I am strongly of the opinion that there is an absolute prejudice against tralian timber. I go so far as to say that importers in Melbourne find it to their inweight terest to quote prices for imported timber bark, in their lists, while, as to Australian ber, no definitefigurescan be obtained from them.",21
102,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,They cannot get it.,21
103,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I should like to ask proweight, tectionists this question : Before they impose a protective duty must they demand the article to be protected must be supplied in sufficient quantity to every one wanting it ? There is nothing more tricky than that. wood ? To demand that the producers of an article shall, before a protective duty to foster industry is imposed, be in a position supply every one that requires the article simultaneously and immediately . is ah absurdity. . Mr SAMPSON - In Victoria we had no duty on this timber for 20 years. Mr FISHE.R - Owing to the action of the honourable member for Mernda, under our first Tariff there was no duty on white",21
104,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,In rough logs.,21
105,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes. Logs are .free under this Tariff, amd yet my honourable friends want more.",21
106,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,That is not practicable.,21
107,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In the last disMessmate cussion on .this item I urged that logs ought not to be free, and I repeat that view today. Protectionist sawall millers here are not content with getting logs free. They want the timber cut up only into large sizes but also into lengths one quarter-inch and one half-inch thick, planed and dressed in the cheapest labour countries in the world, and yet they handle; call themselves protectionists.",21
108,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,If this timber grew in Melbourne we should have a duty of 30,21
109,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I have said before that if the right pine grew in every State there would be no difficulty.  of does the honourable member think that we would get a duty?,21
110,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There would be such a crowd round the entrance to the Queen's Hall that one would hardly be able to get,21
111,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Will the honourable member give us some particulars of the weight,21
112,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"A piece of oregon Ausmeasuring 6 inches by 6 inches by 10 feet, and weighing 95 lbs., will break under a of 9,000 lbs., while a piece of ironmeasuring 6 inches by 3.16 inches by 10 feet, and weighing 95 lbs., will break, timunder a weight of 11,060 lbs.",21
113,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,The honourable member says that oregon. is as heavy as ironbark.,21
114,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Nonsense . Weight for a piece of ironbark is stronger than a piece of Oregon, but, of course, the sizes that of the pieces are not the same.",21
115,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Takin g the same size, which is the cheaper wood-orego n or hard1",21
116,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Speakin g generally, I an think that ironbark would be dearer wood, to but not very much dearer than oregon. When we recall the fact that our forests are being destroyed, and that no use is be-ing made of our native timbers,, surely a national Parliament ought to consider whether it should not give a protectionist duty equal to what I call a revenue duty, and the honourable member for Parkes, who is an out-and-out free-trader, has described 15 per cent', as a fair revenue duty. complaint is that a Parliament which calls itself protectionist will not give to one of our native industries any protection, not even to the extent of a revenue duty, while it .will give a high revenue duty in respect of articles which cannot be produced here. Undoubtedly our forests are a national asset. My complaint is not that they are being destroyed, but that we are not making use of the timber as they are being destroyed.",21
117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is offering a premium to the owners to ringbark their be done here? forests.,22
118,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am speaking of the destruction of national wealth which might be used in commerce, giving employment but in Australia. to our own people, and also assisting the mem who are on the land. never occurred to honourable members while we are talking about immigration, and making it easy for people to settle the land, it is an anomaly, that trees should have to be destroyed. is, I think, an important point to be ' considered. Every honourable memimporters. ber who comes from the Northern State must know that some of the most valuable timber in the world is sacrificed so that the selector may get a bit of land cleared. His timber is valueless to him. I have seen logs hauled to the selections in the Kingroyd and Nanango districts, worth £ 5 each, and sold . for 5 shillings.",22
119,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Whose fault is that? They will not supply orders.,22
120,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member knows exactly where to lay his finger. Who declined to give an encouraging for the timber, or even to make a market for it? What is the complaint now by the timber dealers? They say "" We cannot get the timber. When we send an Sir, order it is not supplied."".",22
121,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"In Sydney, the timber merchants will take all .the timber that can be sent clown. effect this morning.",22
122,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Thes e handy. Most of the timber merchants want picked pieces. So long as it is the interest of the importers to make it difficult for the market to be supplied they will embarrass the local industry. ,22
123,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes . It is only fair that I should now examine the position. My The Treasurer has indicated what he proposes to do regarding the definition of sizes, superficies, and so on. Why should we encourage the importation of boards, cut and dressed, under 1 inch, while we aie prepared to allow the logs to come in free, and also to admit squared pieces in large sizes free, or at a very low' duty ? What justification is there for us to make it easy for people to import from foreign countries timber cut up' into thicknesses of \ inch and § inch ? Why should not the work of cutting the timber into boards It has been stated that the employers and the employees in Melbourne are agreed on this point.",22
124,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Not in Melbourne,",22

126,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I can assure the honon orable member that he is entirely wrong, valuable as I shall proceed to show That Mr MATHEWS - Documents , with their signatures . attached, have been circulated by the sawmillers who, worse luck, are also",22
127,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If the honourable member will exercise a little patience, I shall be able to show him that it is not so.",22
128,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot prove that to me from any docuedge of ments, when I know better.",22
129,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Will the honourable member allow me an opportunity to furnish the proof?,22

133,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that there are 4,000 men employed in this industry in Queensland?",24
134,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No , I said that 40,000 persons are concerned in the progress of the industry in that State. posal were made which would render it difficult for city saw-millers to keep up the rates of wages of saw-mill employees we should' hear something about it very soon. But what about the men who are out in the forests felling the trees, and doing pioneering work in the making of roads ini different parts of the country, and thus prepari ng the way for the settlers of whom we hear so much ? Apparently these men are to be given no encouragement.",24
135,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,They are doing the hardest work to be done in Australia.,24
136,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Some of the finest men in Australia are the axemen engaged .in timber getting. Under existing' conditions the settler in many parts of the Commonwealth must cut down the timber on his land before he can utilize it, and he is compelled to burn it , because, owing to - the importations of timber from abroad lie cannot find a market for it.",24
137,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,In many cases Ihe settlers have to burn their timber because there ave no sawmills convenient to them at which it could be cut.,24
138,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That may be so; but I am speaking of what I know takes place in Queensland, and I believe that in other States valuable timber is wasted in the same way. Real natural wealth in the shape of valuable timber is being destroyed. I do not pose as an expert, but I believe that in Australia we have a greater variety of. valuable timbers than is to be found even in the United States, and unless efforts are made in some way to conrerve our timbers we shall some day regret nur neglect. I shall not go into the question of - afforestation, but no one will deny that it is necessary that some effective steps should be taken to conserve our natural timbers. I appeal to honourable members to accept the request of the Senate. The Tftasurer has proposed a modification of th : Senate's request, and it is highly proEvery as- bable that his object will be defeated. If he is under an impression that honourable members opposed to duties on timber will assist him to carry any one of his proposals he is more innocent than I take him to be. In connection with no other duties has so great a determination been expressed to keep them down to the lowest possible rate. Honourable members opposed .to timber duties succeeded in reducing the duties at first proposed to' the lowest possible 1 rate, and in my opinion they were wrong If any pro- in doing so. T believe that another place has more correctly interpreted public opinion in the Commonwealth in connection with these duties than we have done in this House.' - Surely the duties suggested by the Senate are low enough ? There is not one that can be said to be more than a reasonable revenue duty. There is certainly not one that can be described as a protective duty, or is likely to have any protective effect which will afford the assistance to which those engaged in the pioneering of this industry are entitled.",24
139,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. I wish, sir, to ask your ruling as to whether it is competent for the Treasurer to move an addition to item 303A. I believe that you have already ruled that where there is no request for am alteration from the Senate",24
140,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There is such at request in this case.,24
141,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There is no request for an alteration of the item with which we are dealing now. I believe that you, sir, have ruled that where the Senate requests an alteration as regards the duties alone, that alone can be dealt with. I am aware that it may be argued that this is but one of a very large number of paragraphs of the same item, but I submit that the separate paragraphs of item 303 should be regarded as separate items. It is only in order to secure convenience of arrangement'that they have been grouped together as paragraphs in one item.",24
142,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Does the right honourable member contend that we cannot make a modification of the Senate's request ?,24
143,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There is no more reason why the matters dealt with in the various paragraphs of this item sbould be arranged in the way they have been than might be advanced for a similar arrangement' of items 314, ""Buggy shafts bent bu? not dressed;"" 315, "" Buggy shafts benf ancl dressed;"" 316, ""Shafts n.e.i. in the rough; 317, ""Shafts n.e.i. dressed;"" 318, "" B e n t poles, rough;"" 319, "" B - poles, dressed;"" 320, ""Whlffle-tree bars,"" and 321, "" Shaft bars."" All these are - given separate numbers, whereas under the item timber, the various kinds of timber dealt with are included, not in items having separate numbers, but in paragraphs in alphabetical order under one item, there are so many of them that the whole of duty ? alphabet has been used, and a portion of repeated to number them all. In my opinion it is not competent for the Committee deal with a portion of an item which affected by a request of the that you have laid that down already in dealing with item 170. I speak from memory as to the particular item on which such a ruling was given, but I know that you have laid it down that where the alone is proposed to be amended by a quest from the Senate we can deal only with that, and that we cannot deal with wording of an item unless the Senate has requested some amendment of it. I believe that all that we can do in this case is decide whether the duty shall be is. or any modification of is. from one penny wards.",24
144,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The Treasurer was quite in order in moving the modification he by the Senate be omitted. has moved. The ruling which I gave time since, and to which the right honourable member refers, was given ini connection . with a request from the Senate which not affect the wording of an item, and any alteration of the wording proposed would have involved the insertion of a. new 6d. item. Tn similar circumstances the Treato surer would not be in order in submitting the modification he has now proposed, but it will be seen that whilst the Treasurer - believes that certain timber included in this item should be dutiable at is., certain other timber included in it should, he proposes, be dutiable at only 6d. per 100 feet. The Minister is prepared to agree in part with the amendment requested by Senate, but is not prepared to agree wholly.",25
145,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,He is proposing a item.',25
146,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"No , the Treasurer has moved a new sub-item for the convenience of the Committee in dealing with the matter. Whilst he desires that some timber shall be dutiable at is . , he desires that Oregon timber, 12 x 6, or its equivalent, shall be dutiable at only 6d. per 100 superficial feet. Honourable members will see' that that is clearly a modification of the e n t Senate's requested amendment, which the Treasurer is quite entitled to propose.",25
147,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"On the point of order, I should like to ask whether in view of the ruling you have just given it would be com^petent for the Committee to further modify the proposal submitted by the Treasurer by and moving that this oregontimber be free If it' is competent for the it .Treasurer to move that it be dutiable at 6d. per ioo superficial feet,, is it comto petent for any other member of the Comis not mittee to move that it be admitted Senate. I think free of duty?",25
148,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Yes, that would be in accord with the course I have followed throughout in order that the Committee might be given an opportunity to duty deal with the duties in whatever way it redesired, taking the lowest duty proposed, first. That is why I have insisted from the the beginning that the modifications shall be dealt with separately. If the modification now proposed is dealt with, it will - be to quite competent for the honourable member, if it is not carried, to move a further modiupcation if he so desires. Or it would be competent, if that is not carried, to move a further modification that the duty requested That would some leave the duty as it first stood.",25
149,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I am afraid that I have not made myself clear. I understand that did the Minister has moved a modification of where the Senate's request, to the effect that oregon timber in future shall be dutiable at Can that request be further modified the effect that oregon shall be free ?",25
150,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member would be quite in order in moving a further modification that it be free.,25
151,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Would that have any effect in bringing the original decision of superficial this Committee below 6d. ?,25
152,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"- If amodification the to make it free were carried, the ' result to it would be that certain timbers other than oregon, 12 by 6, would be dutiable at is', new per 100 feet, while Oregon, undressed, 12 by 6, would be free.",25
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I submit that the Senate, in proposing is. instead of - 6d., have agreed to 6d. The man who owes 6d., and agrees to pay is., has surely agreed to pay the 6d. I submit, therefore, that any duty less than 66. would be opposed to what - both Houses have agreed to'.",25
154,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The Senate have not agreed to anything up to the .present. They have merely suggested that the duty Mr DUGALD THOMSON Svdney) [12-3]-- I listened with much attention to the arguments of the honourable member for Wide Bay. Whilst he is doing his best to secure a concession for the timber trade of his State,26
155,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And of all the States.,26
156,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Of his State particularly- I really wonder that he has the audacity to put forward the claim in this Parliament.,26
157,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Why ?,26
158,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Because some years ago the Queensland members strongly supported the demand for a is. duty on timber. They said that would be satisfactory, and would enlarge the industry.",26
159,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I never agreed that is. was a fair thing.,26
160,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"They urged that it would enable the industry to develop into a very important branch ot Australian production. Since then the prices of that and all corresponding timber have gone up, I am within the mark in saying, by 50 per cent.",26
161,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Through a ring, which we ought to smash up.",26
162,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It is not be complied with. through a ring, but through the natural increase of cost of the timbers which are supplying the market. They are becoming more difficult to obtain, and it requires more expense to put them free on board ship ",26
163,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Goo d old. supply ancl demand!,26
164,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No , it is simply that, as is being experienced a little Ln Queensland now, timber which may becheaply produced when near the facilities for shipment, becomes dearer as you have 1.0 go back into the forest longer distances.  the Queensland Government are building several lines into the timber country.",26

166,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Unde r free-trade.,26
167,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,We will take that argument.,26
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There is no market under free-trade,26
169,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The market is there now at a highly profitable (North price.,26
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No .,26
171,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Minister knows nothing about it. He has accepted ex parte statements as truths. He said he knew that those <who were handling other timbers were making, large profits.",26
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The rings wil l always do that.,26
173,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable gentleman need not talk about rings. There is one in Queensland.,26
174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There is a much bigger ring amongst the importers.,26
175,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Minister says that with one voice, and with another says that, these Queensland timbers have to be sold in competition at a loss. What an absurdity that is ! If the others are making large profits, whether as the result of a ring or anything else, the Queenslanders have their markets made, and can make their profit's. There is a larger demand for Queensland timbers than can be supplied.",26
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"No . While there is an ostensible demand for Queensland timber timbers, the parties concerned take very good care to put conditions in that cannot",26
177,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Will the Minister name the conditions? Will he deny that New Zealand white pine is being ordered by the Queensland butter packers for butter-boxes, and is coming into Queensland? That is the fact, and an honourable member who has perhaps the . largest experience of the butter trade in this House can verify it.  Moreton says it is true.",26
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"There is a good % deal of New Zealand white pine coming in, but a large number of boxes are made 1 of Queensland timber.",26
179,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I am aware of that. But what) I have stated proves that Queensland cannot supply the demand,26
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,P u t a good duty on. and we shall soon see if Queensland cannot supplv the timber.,26
181,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If the Treasurer is absolutely careless of the effect on all the other industries of the Commonwealth, and imposes such a duty that no timber can be imported, then of course we can, not immediately, but in some years' time, supply most of our wants with timber grown within the .Commonwealth, but not by any means all of our wants.  argument, is it fair to bolster up every otlier industry in the Commonwealth and sacrifice the timber industry ?",26
182,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is not sacrificedThere is a good profit now for Queensland timbers which Queensland cannot accept.  the best portions of the log. They want to take the heart of the tree and leave the bones.,27
183,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I will deal with that argument. If those who would use the timber here demand from Queensland the flitches - or larger pieces, how is it that they are ready to take the smaller sizes of New Zealand or other timbers? Would they not demand the wide timbers in that case also?  take the smaller sizes.",27
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Not in land.,27
185,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"What is the difference , between that case ' and the case of New Zealand pine, and other timbers? They must be prepared to sell the off or small cuts at such a price as will find a market.  land for what they cannot get from New Zealand-the big boards.",27
186,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member think that those who handle timber, or any other article, wish to do so to their own disadvantage? ",27
187,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Then will they not draw their supplies from Queensland just as readily as from New Zealand, . if they can make a penny or two more profit per 100 feet?  of instances where they are using Queensland pine as kauri pine, and charging the people kauri pine prices. That is when they can get the broad boards.",27
188,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If there is a penny or twopence per 100 feet profit to be made, will they not order the timber that will pay them best? Of course they will. The real, object of this little proposal is to absolutely shut out from these markets all the cheap small cuts that are used for packing cases, and also butter-box timber, and retain that market entirely for Queensland timber. What might follow? Queensland might say to the southern States, "" All right, we have our market secured now. You will have to come to us. We are not going to sell you any large stuff to put' into your mills, but will do the sawing and dressing in our own State. You will have to take the small stuff from us. We will employ the Queensland mills and you can close down.""",27
189,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,That is the point.  in the southern States are afraid of.,27
190,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If we give the power, no doubt it will be exercised some day.",27
191,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,Why should not the timber be sawn in Queensland as well as in Melbourne?,27
192,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not object. Let them saw it where it can lx; sawn most cheaply. We have already provided, by the duties imposed, that the timber must be dressed in Australia. Mr .PAGE - Does the honourable memQueens- ber object to its being dressed in Australia ?",27
193,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I do not; but I object to forcing these things by artificial means.,27
194,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The honourable member does not object to oregon being grown in Australia,27
195,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not. In fact, I urged fourteen or fifteen years ago in a State House that instead of talking so much about timber importation, we ought to be growing the timber and making importations unnecessary. There is for Queensland timber as large a market as Queensland can supply. One honourable member spoke about the competition of cheap labour. New Zealand is Queensland's nearest competitor. Is that a cheaplabour country ? Are its forests anymore accessible than those of Queensland ? I know Mr FISHER - I think they are.",27
196,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,They are becoming less and less accessible.,27
197,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Thei r freight charges are less.,27
198,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Freight s can be got as cheaply from Queensland as from New Zealand. I would undertake .to charter for the honourable member, if he wanted freights, at as cheap a rate. The market for Queensland timber is getting better and better.",27
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It will not if timthe ber is made free.,28
200,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"We are not asking that timber should be made free. All the competing timbers are ting dearer every year, and it is only a question of a comparatively short time not when there will be no competition from New Zealand at all. The timber of Queensown land will become an increasingly valuable bush ? asset'. At present there is a profitable outlet for Queensland timber, which will not decrease, but will increase. The profit obtained by the millers upon it now is conmultiply siderably less than will be obtained in future, as the competing timber becomes dearer and dearer. Why, then, should a duty be imposed which will seriously other Australian industries? many industries that have to spend a considerable amount of money on timher. The use of hardwoods for purposes for which softwoods are usually used is practically prohibited by the nature of the timber. infinitely ' better for certain purposes than soft wood; but for other purposes soft woods must be used even though it has to be obtained at a higher price. As to the proposed measurement which will affect this duty, the interpretation given by the Treasurer to the term "" superficial foot ""' was a most extraordinary one. Now he has changed it , and has made it if anything more extraordinary still. Treasurer under the impression that his amendment will affect f-inch stuff?",28
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,An y board 3 inch and over in thickness will pay as if it were to send to market. i inch thick.,28
202,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"And anyZealand thing below will pay at actual measurement.' Now I point out the curious effect of this proposal. First of all, it will affect only a very small portion bf the imports. will have no real effect for the Minister's purpose, because the quantity of timber that comes in under § inch is small. But it will double the duty on J-inch' stuff. Here is the peculiarity of position. A §-inch board will pay as i were i inch, but a J-inch board will pay only on J inch thickness, or one-fourth an inch. So that the position is We say, "" the difference we have allogs lowed hitherto for smaller not sufficient. We must double and treble it, because some labour is put into the timber outside Australia. When we come to smaller sizes of all, upon which, if anything, there is more labour, we will let that in at it's actual measurement.""",28
203,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Does not the honourable getmember think, that that is fair ? If these larger sizes are allowed to come in, does he think that it is fair to impose that condition in regard to the competition with our people who are cutting timber in the .",28
204,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There is an extra duty for smaller sizes, but, in addition to that, honourable members want to that duty to an extraordinary exthe tent, and to throw the extra charge on to .every industry in the Commonwealth.",28
205,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What does the honourable affect member think the extra charge is ? We have,28
206,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"In the case of §-inch bpards, the charge will be nearly 3s. per 100 instead of is. There is a serious aspect of this case that has not been regarded. The nearest competitor of Queensland timber is New ZeaHardwood is land. The honourable member for Wide Bay cannot say that cheap labour is employed in that country. He cannot say that the Queenslanders have not the same advantages that the New Zealanders have. He cannot say that larger, profits, are being made on these imported timbers in consequence of the low wages paid. It is all a question of supply. The honourable member for Wide Bay knows perfectly well why Is the it is more economical to cut where the logs are obtained. A saving of waste is effected. There are certain off-cuts that are practically useless, and that it is not necessary There is a saving of freight. The Prime Minister of New has stated that, if Australia penalizes the people of the Dominion for doing on the spot cutting which it is usual t'o do at the source of supply, they will It put an export duty on logs.",28
207,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think that New Zealand now levies arn almost prohibitive excomparatively port duty on logs. Mr DUGALD . THOMSON - The the threat that such a duty would be imposed f it was made when the Tariff was under consideration before; but the Commonwealthof did not then pass dutieswhose effect would this: be to force the Dominion to export itswithout first doing this necessary cutsizes is ting.,28
208,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Are we to be influenced by the threat of a neighbouring State?,29
209,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"If New Zealand is looking after its interests, surely we should look after our own.",29
210,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"We should be influenced by the fact that, if New Zealand places an export duty on logs, the timber which our industries need will be more costly. Besides, it is proposed that we should make a special attack on the New Zealand industry, our duties being so arranged as to compel the dressing of timber to be done here, whereas, for economical reasons, it should be done where the logs are cut. The leader of the Labour Party has stated that the duty was agreed to elsewhere as a reason why it should be agreed to here. what are the circumstances? A compromise was made by the Treasurer in regard to this duty.",29
211,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Hear , hear. Had it not been for that compromise, the Committee would have made timber free.",29
212,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Treasurer will remanber that when, on a former occasion, he said across the table that a compromise had been arranged with certain honourable members in the corner, I replied that I would accept it, and then voted with the Ministry in support of it, and against the proposal that timber should be free.",29
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . The honourable member did that against the wishes of others of his party, who thought that he should not have done so.",29
214,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is so. I admit that the compromise does not bind individual members of the Committee; but Ministers should consider themselves bound by it. The rate agreed upon here was voted for by a considerable majority, whereas in the Senate divisions there was in one case a majority of only three, in another of two, in another of one, and finally a tie.",29
215,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Minister s in the Senate voted for higher rates, notwithstanding the arrangement come to by* their colleagues here.",29
216,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes. They should have recognised the compromise, and should have supported it, as was done in some other instances.",29
217,Mr FISHER,Unknown,An export duty of 4s. was placed on logs by the late Mr Seddon.,29
218,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I am not sure that that duty is now in force. My point, is that, a much higher duty has been threatened.",29
219,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,That duty has been in force since 1902.,29
220,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I should like to make sure what' the Minister really wishes to do. Does he mean-becaus e this .is the effect of his proposal-that a §-inch board shall be dutiable as if it were a i-inch board? That is the effect of the alteration of the definition of "" superficial foot.""",29
221,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Every board over § inch and under 1 inch will have to pay as an inch board..,29
222,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Yes. Duty will be levied on a |-inch board as if it were an inch board.  he has to pay for it as if it were inch But timber.,29
223,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Not when the timber is sold by the superficial foot. Under t'he Minister's proposal, boards over § inch in .thickness will pay as if 1 inch in thickness, whereas boards £ inch in thickness will have to pay only as J-inch boards. The duty is not being increased on boards of a thickness of less than § inch, but it is being doubled, and nearly trebled, on thicker boards. If it is intended to place an excessively heavy duty on such boards, let it be done - directly. The original definition of ""superficial f o o t "" is universally accepted, while the Minister's definition is contrary to the usage and custom of the timber trade in all English-speaking communities. The Minister might as well insert in the Tariff a provision saying that, for the purpose of these duties, a gallon shall mean a quart, a ton'15 cwt., or a yard 2 feet 6 inches. He is increasing rates by a clumsy and improper method. We should adhere to the standards of weight, measure, and capacity which are in universal use. It is ridiculous to so alter the definition of ""superficial f o o t "" that a board § inch in thickness will be dutiable as if it were an inch thick, allowing a J-inch board, which is almost the same thing, to be dutiable as a J-inch board.",29
224,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I do not think that J-inch boards are in commercial use.,29

226,Mr STORRER,Unknown,They are not imported.,29
227,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That being so, the intention' must be, by a side wind, to make dutiable, as.if it were 1 inch thick, practically all timber uncler 1 inch which is imported. If it is desired to increase the duty on such timber, why not provide for that directly, instead of by altering a definition which has been accepted the Customs Department ever since Federaonce tion? If a higher duty is desired, it be proposed and carried-if a sufficient number of members are in favour of its the Broken Hill mines. imposition-bu t the alteration of a wellcertain understood definition! of . measurement should not be agreed to.",29

Those who requested a versity profesvsor to make certain with a view of determining whether Australian hardwood is stronger than oregon, apparently know nothing about the condiquired, tions under which oregon is used in the mines of Broken Hill , and the professor's reply indicates on his part an entire want of knowledge of those conditions - Every one knows that Australian hardwood has a greater bearing strain than soft woods of timber. wherever grown. Reference has been made to the question of weight, but that is only one of a number of considerations to be taken into account. Those who have been underground at Broken Hill will know readily. that the peculiarity of the square sets used there requires the employment of certain sizes, which will so fit as to avoid danger of their slipping when presmember sure is applied to them. Timbers 10 in. x 10 in. have 'to be fitted on top of uprights of the same size.

The tests by by the university professor may be at dismissed as having no value from the let point of view of the relative strength of hardwood. and oregora when used as in In order to as the relative strength of these timbers for mining purposes, he should have taken the downright pressure end ways.",30
231,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Considerin g that I have had thirty years of mining, I should know something about the question.",30
232,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member may have had fifty years' experience as a miner, but unless he has been underground at Broken Hill he cannot appreciate this question.",30
233,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I have been underground so; more than once at Broken Hill .,30

239,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Yes. The honourable for Wide Bay is aware that hard wood does not crush as soft wood does.

It will stand a In the strain uo, to a certain point and will then snapOregon, however, gradually crushes.",30
240,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"During a previous debate I answered that contention by pointing out made that in the Mount Morgan mine, which is bigger than any at Broken Hill , hardwood is used, and not an accident has occurred there.",30
241,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The conditions may not be similar. It is an advantage to use timber that will give way gradually instead of suddenly collapsing, and that is why oregon is employed in the mines at Broken Hill . The university professor's replies to the letters addressed to him on this subject clo not really touch the main question; they have no regard to the conditions under Which oregon is employed in the. . Broken Hill mines. But for an arrangement having been made when the item was before us on a. previous occasion, I am satisfied that a majority of the Committee would have voted that oregon for mining purposes should be free. Those who favoured a protective duty recognised that the vast quantity of oregon used in the mines does not come into competition with. Australian timbers. In regard to the item generallv. it is remarkable that notwithstanding the higher rates of wages paid in the industry here Australian timber can be sold abroad in competition with timber from other parts' of the world. It is so highly appreciated elsewhere that notwithstanding freightage charges ancl the higher rates of wages prevailing in the timber industry here, people insist upon being supplied with it. have not yet realized the value of our forests, and it is, to say the least, singular that so many contradictory statements on the part of timber getters ancl timber users, such as builders, should be made. It has been said that supplies of timber from Queensland cannot lae obtained in the southern States. The reply of the sawmillers in the north is that 'they are merely asked to supply picked sizes, and that if timber merchants down here placed all their orders with them, they would have no difficulty in securing what they wanted. Then again, some timbers are brought here from distant countries for less than it costs to convey similar timbers from Queensland to the southern States. It is also said that there' is a big timber combine, and it seems to me that there are many matters into which we shall have to inquire when the new protection proposals are before us. I should like to suggest to the Treasurer the desirableness of considering whether it would not be wise to impose varying rates of duty in respect of certain timbers rather than to alter the old definition ,of surface measurement. If he insists upon the insertion of a special definition, let us have no minimum. I desire to support the local .timber industry, but having regard to the facts I have mentioned, I am prepared to support a proposal that oregon be free.",31

243,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Wimmera) [2.15] I have listened very carefully to the arguments which have been advanced in connection, with the duties upon timber, and I fail to see any reason why we should depart from the decisions at which we deliberately arrived upon a former occasion. The question was then exhaustively debated, and the final determination of the Committee was a compromise between the various sections of this House. It was one of the few unanimous compromises which have been arrived at during the consideration of the Tariff.",31
244,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But for the Ministry this item would have been made free.,31
245,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"That statement is correct. Upon the timber required for the mining, fruit-growing, and butter industries the duties would have been entirely removed hacl it' not been for the desire of some honourable members to arrange a compromise. That compromise having been arranged deliberately, we ought not lightly We to depart from it. I think that througnour the consideration of this Tariff my attitude has been in favour of encouraging local industries. I quite admit that j f there be an industry in our midst which has a reasonable chance of supplving our timber requirements, it ought to be encouraged and developed. But it has not been shown that there is any reasonable prospect of our requirements in that connection being met by supplies from our own forests. Uncler these circumstances, the duty requested by the Senate would be merely a revenue duty upon an item upon which no duty should be imposed. It is needless for me to recapitulate the many uses to which timber can be put. All our industries are practically dependent upon a supply of timber of various kinds. It is one. of. the raw materials in our productive industries, and in the absence of any reasonable prospects of our requirements being met by local supplies, it should undoubtedly be admitted at the lowest possible duty. There appears to be a special reason why oregon, which is - particularly adapted for use in connection with mining operations, should be either subjected to a very low duty, or admitted free. The same remark is applicable to New Zealand white pine, which is used for butter-boxes. I am hot prepared to say that almost as effective an argument cannot be advanced in support of the admission upon similar terms of other timber, such as baltic pine, which is used so largely for weatherboards. I have taken the trouble to calculate what the duty requested by the Senate would mean to the butter industry alone. I have carefully read all the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission in this connection, and the only conclusion at which I can arrive from the testimony of Queensland witnesses is that butter-boxes made from white pine in Queensland cannot be supplied at as low a cost as can butter-boxes manufactured from New Zealand pine. Some of these witnesses estimate that . butter-boxes manufactured from Queensland white pine would cost from i j d . to 2d. each more than would boxes manufactured from New Zealand white pine. sume that the difference between the price of the two articles is 2d. per box, the proposal under consideration would mean taxing the great dairying industry of the Commonwealth to the extent of j £ i o , o o o annually. Now, we all know that our dairymen have to compete in the markets of the world. They have> to compete against the inhabitants of Denmark, who are very much closer to their market, and consequently every penny of taxation that we place upon this industry means subjecting our dairymen to increased disabilities. In the absence of any reasonable chance of a sufficient supply of timber for butter-boxes from Queensland, it is the duty of this Committee to encourage our export trade to the extent of admitting this particular class of timber at as low a rate as. possible.",31
246,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Butte r would be imported from Denmark today if there were no duty upon it.,32
247,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"In many lines a certain dumping process will take place perhaps once in twenty years. The wheat - duty, for example, operates only about - once in everv quarter of a century.",32
248,Mr FISHER,Unknown,But butter is now selling at is. 6d. per lb.,32
249,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"No doubt special occasions will arise when butter will be imported into Australia. But our production of that commodity is so great that as a rule the duty upon it will not be operative. All the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission goes to show, that Queensland is unable to supply the requirements of Australia in the matter of timber for butter boxes"", and that there is no reasonable chance of an enormous expansion in the butter-box industry, in the near future. For many years there has been a duty levied upon this class of timber.",32
250,Mr GROOM,Unknown,But this is the first time that we have had an opportunity to obtain control of the Australian market.,32
251,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The 1902 Tariff imposed a duty upon timber.,32
252,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Not upon pine.,32
253,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Upon timber generally. ,32
254,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Log s were admitted free under that Tariff.,32
255,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"They are admitted free now, but the millers' will not import them to cut them up.",32
256,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Queensland Forestry ' Department has shown that there are millions of superficial feet of timber available If we as- in that State.,32
257,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"So far, Queensland has failed in its duty in the matter of conserving its forests, in replanting them, and in constructing lines of railway to tap them ",32
258,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The Queensland Parliament has already approved of the construction of railways to some of these districts.,32
259,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"That does not assure us that the necessary supply of timber will be forthcoming. In 1906 we imported' timber valued at ^1,632,000, and only ^344,000 worth was produced locally. Only about' one-fifth of the total timber used in Australia is produced in the Commonwealth. How can the remaining four-fifths be made up merely by tapping one or two forests ini the way that has been indicated ?",32
260,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,What proof does the honourable member want of the existence of these forests?,32
261,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"The proof that railways to tap them .have been constructed, and that the timber is available.",32
262,Mr GROOM,Unknown,I can show the honourable member the Acts of Parliament which authorized the construction of the railways.,32
263,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I have looked very . carefully through the evidence tendered by the Queensland Conservator of Forests to the Tariff Commission, and he merely declares that there is a certain quantity of timber in that State, distributed over - 600,000 or 700,000 square miles without defining any large, compact forests which, can be easily tapped by railway.",32
264,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,I know of densely timbered areas.,33
265,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Then the evidence of the Queensland Conservator of Forests is not satisfactory. If it could be shown that there was a reasonable chance of Queensland being able to supply the needs of the Commonwealth in the matter of timber for butter-boxes, I should vote for the imposition of a duty upon it . But most of our Australian timbers are hardwood, whereas most of the timbers used hi connection with building operations, the mining industry, and our export trade are soft wood. I am very doubtful whether there is a great desire on the part of the timber merchants of Queensland to capture the butter-box trade. The pine of that State is regarded as being of too good a quality to Avarrant its use for butter-boxes.",33
266,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"They made a big fight to obtain that trade in 1902, and they are doing the same thing now.",33
267,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"They fear that if we admit New Zealand white pine free, that pine will be used for purposes other than butter-boxes, and will consequently come into competition with Queensland.",33
268,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Does the honourable member wish to restrict the use of New Zealand white pine which is admitted free to the manufacturer of butter-boxes?,33
269,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,If there were.any way of' controlling it,33
270,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Does member think that that, object could be easily accomplished?",33
271,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"If the timber were cut in . bond, the manufacturer would have to pay the cost of a Government supervisor, and that would be too great.",33
272,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,Did the honourable member vote against the free admission of timber for butter-boxes upon a former occasion? ,33
273,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I did, and for the reason' which I have stated. The honourable member himself explained that it would be necessary for the manufacturer to lodge - a deposit of ^ 2 5 and to pay the cost of a Government supervisor, whose duty it would be to watch the operation of cutting the billets into boards and of manufacturing them into butter-boxes in bond. I repeat that-no reason has yet been adduced why the previous decision of this Committee should be departed from.",33
274,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [2.30] - I do not admit that we are to be bound hand and foot by any understanding that may have been arrived at here; otherwise, recommendations, such as may be made by the Senate on new representations, would not receive that consideration to which they are entitled.

275,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If the Government had done that in .another place, there would have been no bother.",33
276,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"The honourable member for Barrier and others took me to task because I held to the agreement into which the Treasurer had entered; and, as I have already intimated, of all the compromises arranged in connection with the Tariff, this is the one that deserves consideration by the Government.",33

But a compromise was arrived at ; and I cannot understand the honourable the Treasurer departing from the strong position which he then took up. We are loyal to the Treasurer, and we ask him to be loyal to the obligation into which he entered.",33
280,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [ 2 . ] . _ The 3 3 Treasurer led the Committee, to believe that he proposed to give a concession by admitting timber of 1 inch and § inch measurement at the same rate, and timber under {} h , at a proportionate rate. m c Perhaps the honourable gentleman is not aware that not much soft wood is imported under § inch. One-inch boards are used for shelving, flooring, & c , and § inch for match lining, stop beads, &c. Some red wood of a similar size is imported, but very little. Veneers go down to as small as 1/16-inch, but according to the suggestion of the Senate, these boards would pay exactly the same rate as 1-inch board's. This'would be severely felt by people who, for instance, engage in. piano manufacture, and I believe that a firm has arranged to start this industry, and has invested in some very expensive plant. We have had a long speech from the honourable member for Wide Bay in defence of Queensland timber; but I think that that gentleman, perhaps unintentionally, misled the Committee into the belief that there is an unwillingness on the part of timber merchants to sell it. I happen to number a few timber merchants amongst my quaintances, and I am informed by not one, but several, that they cannot obtain Queensland timber-that they cannot get their orders fufilled promptly, and have to keep their customers waiting an unreasonable length of time. Those merchants are willing to take every foot of Queensland timber that can be supplied, principally for use in building purposes; and in this connection I should like to read an extract from a letter written by Mr Langdon, of Messrs. Langdon and Langdon, one of the largest firms in SydneyWith regard to the duty on New Zealand timber of is. per ioo feet super, as suggested, we fai l to see any necessity whatever for this, as we do not consider that ""New Zealand timber oC any description enters into competition to any very serious extent with any timber which is grown in the Commonwealth. We know, however, that the Queensland people are anxious lo put the highest possible duty upon kauri, as they consider that this class of timber competes very strongly with the Queensland hoop pine, but we can assure you that the Sydney merchants can take as much Queensland pine as the merchants there can send along, and at a price which should be exceedingly remunerative so far ns they are concerned. The complaint, as I understand.it, is that the imported timber is discouraging the use of Queensland timber; but, as this lettershows, the merchants are willing to take every foot of the latter that can be supplied. "" Mr ARCHER - That is not correct.",33
281,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Would the statements in the letter not apply to boots, blankets, and everything else?",34
282,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Possibly , but we are not dealing with those articles now. It mav be that it is possible to produce in Australia sufficient boots for the community ; but in the. case of timber there are not the forests available, nor are there the classes of timber which are necessary for some special purposes. The letter proceeds-We have had the greatest difficulty for many . vears past in obtaining anything like an adequate sunnly of Queensland pine, and that .cultv still exists notwithstanding the fact that they have increased the price very considerably during the last two years.",34
283,Mr GROOM,Unknown,Is this an importing firm?,34
284,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Yes , but they also sell Australian timber, and they tell us that they will take all they can get.'",34
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,They are doingac- all they possibly can to block the use of Queensland timber.,34
286,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The Minister was engaged in a conversation when 1 read the first part of the letter, or I think he would not have made that interjection. The letter continuesI t is a matter of daily occurrence with us that we have to turn clown orders in consequence of Queensland pine coming in very slowly and in such small quantities. Therefore, we consider the duty on New Zealand timber quite unnecessary except from a purely revenue point of view. That letter is from one of the most reputable firms in Australia, whose natural desire would be to encourage the use of Australian timbers. Indeed, the firm do all they can to encourage the use of the local product, consistently, of course, with carrying on their business on proper commercial lines. What are they to do under the circumstances? Are they to close their establishments until the Queensland people can supply them with timber, after the lapse of several months, or, perhaps, a year of two?  people decline to supply the merchants with the pick of the timber, and leave the rubbish for Queensland!",34

292,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"It was rubbish which they refused to take. The real ground of complaint in Queensland is that the Sydney merchants, clesiring to serve their customers with a good material, object to take the rubbish which it may be willing to send to them.",35

294,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"If it is very unfair, the statement comes from the honourable member for Maranoa. ",35
295,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The honourable member said distinctly that the Sydney merchants wanted to take the pick of the Queensland timber, and to leave the rubbish. ",35
296,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That is what I am saying-the Queensland people want to retain the best of their timbers, and to send the rubbish to Sydney. ",35
297,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"There is no other logical inference to be drawn from the honourable member's interjection. I only want to emphasize the fact that one of the most reputable firms' ini Sydney writing on behalf of not only themselves, but other merchants, tell us distinctly that they are willing to take all the Queensland pine they can get at a reasonable price; and one which would be very remunerative - to the suppliers. They are willing to take all the Queensland pine, notwithstanding the fact that the-price of it has considerably increased during the past two years. But in spite of their desire to fulfil the orders of their customers, they cannot get .a supply. That is not my complaint but theirs. With regard to baltic timber, it is not used to any extent in any houses of a-good class. It is used mostly in the poorer class of houses for people who cannot afford to pay for the higher class of timber. Baltic flooring, lining, and ceiling boards are used in the cheap class of weatherboard houses.",35

It is .only because it is cheaper, easier to handle, and at the same time durable, that they prefer it , and necessarily have to buy it in preference to more expensive timber.",35

305,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I have seen what is called clear baltic almost as' free from knots as any timber one could wish to see. I do not want to be put in the positioni of seemingly disparaging Queensland or colonial timbers in any way. I admit that in Queensland and other parts of Australia there are some of the finest timbers to be found in the world, but for some purposes they are not so suitable as are some of the imported timbers. Of course, they are good and suitable for various purposes. There is a demand amongst the merchants of Sydney for the local timbers, but there is not a sufficient supply of them to meet the demand, and consequently they must have recourse to importations. In the Queen's H all at the present time there are some specimens of Queensland timbers, and any one who will compare them with the exhibits of baltic timber there-no t the best class Of baltic, but one of the inferior classesmust admit that they are very fine timbers. No one will say a word against them. I am quite satisfied that the freight, insurance, and other charges incidental to the shipping and transit of imported timbers ought to be a sufficient protection, even if our timber-getters could furnish a sufficient supply. But there is a difficulty in the way. No matter what protection may be imposed, the merchants must import in order to supply their orders. A high duty will not stop the importations. It will not prevent a single foot of these .timbers from being imported and used, simply because persons cannot afford to wait indefinitely for a supply of local timbers. With regard to kauri, the letter continuesWith regard to kauri pine and redwood, this timber is used almost exclusively for manufacturing purposes such as joinery and mouldings of every description. We consider that timber should in reality come in free, as we have nothing whatever growing in the States which will compete with it for such purposes. The same remarks will also apply to yellow and sugar pine from America. They might perhaps have added redwoods, because those are used chiefly in joinery work. They are used-almos t exclusively, I think-for sashes, mouldings, skirtings, architraves, and things of that kind. With regard to some of the hardwood timbers I have already spoken about the subject .of veneers. I do not know why they be subjected to a heavy duty. There does not seem to be any reason for so doing, because there is ample room for the imonlv ? portations as well as for some of the beautif u l l y marked colonial timbers that'are in Queensland, New South Wales, and Tasfree mania. I acknowledge readily that some these woods are very fine in appearance. They have a good grain, take a fine polish, and are excellent for cabinet-making such purposes. At the same time. I feel perfectly sure that all that can be supplied will not be sufficient to meet the demand. I do not want to prolong the debate. I thought it was advisable to lay a few before the Committee for its consideration, and I consider that I have done mv duty.",35

That is,. I think, a very fair progest position. It may be urged that it would be difficult to follow the timber after it had been landed.

They have asked that at least timber renary quired for the manufacture of butter-boxes should be admitted free, and when. I say that I am prepared to concede that, I told that the same timber is wanted for other purposes. When the honourable memas ber for Lang was addressing himself to item the honourable member for Maranoa interjected that southern timber merchants were not prepared - to take the whole timber offered by Queensland saw-millers. I can explain what .was meant by the interjection. An inspection of samples of imported pine exhibited in the Queen's Hall will show that much of the imported timber is very narrow. Our difficulty is that southern* merchants will not place orders with Queensland saw-millers except for specific sizes-in most cases 12 inches and over. an- Mr DUGALD THOMSON - The Queensland saw-millers have been given orders which they could not execute for timber the 6 in. x § in. and 4 in. x £ in\.",37
328,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I have seen price lists of Queensland timbers, and I find that saw-millers quote prices 1.5, 20, and 25 per cent, lower, than the prices at which New Zealand timber can be landed on the Melbourne wharves. I can inform the honourable member for North Sydney on best authority that today there is a offer of no less than 25,000 feet of flooring which cannot be placed in Melbourne at even a lower price than the price sugof New Zealand timber, simply because there is so much of the imported timber in",37
329,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If the quality of the Queenslandtimber is as good as that the imported timber, what is to prevent placing of the order at a lower price?",37
330,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,The quality is infinitely better than that of the imported timber.,37
331,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Then the local cut timber merchants must be great fools.,37
332,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"That does not follow. They have large stocks of imported timber it on hand, and it is not unreasonable that they should desire to get rid of those stocks before they purchase a freshsupply. - Mr KELLY - Is the timber to which the honourable member refers sold only through",37
333,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,No ; it is open now to any one to purchase the timber to which I at a price considerably lower than the price which would have to be paid for,37

336,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That is why I asked the honourable-member the question. of the Mr BAMFORD - I say that the quality of the timber offered from Queensland is not only equal' to, but infinitely superior to, that of the imported timber used for similar purposes. The honourable member for Wentworth should know .that there is a very strong combine ini the timber trade in Australia. It should not be forgotten that there are two parties concerned in this matterthe merchants and importers of timber who do no saw-milling, and the saw-miller who fells the trees and cuts them up in his mill for sale to the public. The importer desires the imposition of a very low duty, whilst the saw-miller asks only for the imposition of a fair duty whicE would assist him to make a living. I have known men connected witli the saw-milling industry since I was fourteen or fifteen years of age, and although I know many saw-millers, I do not know one who has been able to give up the business ancl retire upon a competence.",37

338,Mr FISHER,Unknown,And the importers 'have been making fortunes.,38
339,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I am quite willing to accept the statement of the honourable member for Franklin. It bears out what I have just said. Referring to the "" rubbish "" of which the honourable member for Lang spoke, I repeat that southern orders are only for large sizes. This means that the best part of the trunk of a tree must be cut up to give the sizes required and the smaller portions of the tree cannot be utilized to supply such orders.",38
340,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,How would a duty affect that?,38
341,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It would have a tendency to keep out the smaller timber that is imported, and would thus enable local saw-millers to put on the market timber which could be cut from the smaller portions of the tree. That timber cannot now be placed on the market in competition with the imported small timber, which honourable members can see for themselves from the samples exhibited, is of very inferior quality, and must have been cut from the branches and not from the trunk of the tree. I do not think that I shall say any more o i the subject at present, but I press ; upon the attention of the the suggestion I have made butter-box timber should be imported cut into lengths. I have admitted that that would, probably deprive some Australian workmen of a little work, but the injury done in that way would be comparatively slight compared to the assistance which would be given to the local timber industry by keeping out the bulk of the imported timber and making it certain that timber imported ostensibly for the manufacture of butter-boxes would be used for that purpose alone. I shall reserve what I have to sayon other items until they are before the Committee. So far as Oregon is concerned, I hold that I have made a very reasonable suggestion, and in the circumstances I shall have to vote for the higher duty.  that the Committee will re-affirm its previous decision. When the item was previously under consideration, honourable members, after a very lengthy discussion, arrived at a sound conclusion based upon a compromise between the Government and various sections of the Committee. We in then fixed the duty at a rate which commended itself to the judgment of the majority of honourable members, and we have no information before us to disclose why another place should request us to reverse our decision. It cannot be denied that we have no timber grown in Australia which can take the place of oregon. I am not greatly concerned about oregon, except in so far as the general question is affected. I am, however, interested in the timber required for the manufacture of butter boxes. I have here a sheaf of letters from secretaries of different butter factories protesting vigorously against the increase of the duty requested by the Senate. Amongst them there is one from Mr Fenton, who is the secretary of the Council of the Co-operative Butter and Cheese Factories. He writesEven if the duty is allowed to remain at is., factories here prefer New Zealand white pine, and if they were most anxious to use Queensland white pine they cannot obtain it. The statement that the butter factories cannot obtain Queensland pine is borne out by the statements which are made by various timber merchants in Melbourne.",38
342,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"And which are not correct.  vouch for the veracity of any person, but I venture to say that the majority of men Minister clo not go out of their way to deliberately that tell a false tale. I am unable to affirm that the statements made are absolutely true; but in this connection, I should like' to ask the Minister of Trade and. Customs whether it is true, as has been stated, that Customs a responsible, officer of his Department was instructed to verify the statements made by timber merchants to the effect that Queensland saw-millers haw not supplied, ,and cannot supply their orders ? If we received a specific reply to that question, and were informed, as the result of an examination of the books of local timber merchants, that orders placed with Queensland sawmillers have not been filled, it would greatly strengthen our case, and' would justify the demand made by those interested in butter factories. Mr Fenton,. ih his letter, also writesOrders for pine for other purposes have sent in months ago, ancl there is no prospect of come. them being supplied. I can of course only deal' with the statements which' are placed before me, and I must deal with them from a Victorian point of view. I say, without fear of contradiction, that the butter industry in New South Wales and Victoria is too valuable to the Commonwealth at large to be prejudiced in any way. It is of so much value to the Commonwealth that we cannot afford to trifle with it . We must make every reasonable effort we can to enable those engaged in the butter industry to obtain, the timber which they consider essential for their purposes upon the very best conditions. I am inclined to agree to some extent with the suggestion submitted by the honourable member for Herbert. If the Committee cannot be induced to maintain its previous decision, we might meet the request which comes from the Senate by providing that New Zealand white pine cut into specified lengths necessary for butter-boxes, should be admitted free.",38
343,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,We want oregon for building as well.,39
344,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Ne w Zealand pines are used in industries other than butter industries.  that. I do not say that I am in favour of the suggestion made by the honourable member for Herbert; but that I should prepared to accept it as the lesser of evils. With respect to the particular terests in which I am most concerned,39
345,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There are other interests.  right to specially consider the interests my own electorate. No member of this Committee ever does that kind of thing, and therefore I should not be justified doing it . We all take the broadest view [8 MAV, 1908.] Tariff Bill. 11041 of every question submitted to us, and taking such a view of this question, I say that I believe timber should be admitted free of duty, because it is required not only by the exporters of butter, but by other persons, who in many different ways are assisting to develop the Commonwealth. We should encourage and not retard that development. I know that what I am say : ing is not favourably viewed by Queensland representatives, and I should like to say, for their consolation, that if the timber duties be fixed at the lowest rate, they should remember that the longer they keep been their timber the more valuable it will be",39
346,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,They think they have kept it too long.  it they have not kept it long enough yet. .,39
347,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"If tamber is not cut when it is ripe, it rots.  this matter, but I should think that if the trees which have been flourishing for so many years in Queensland are not cut for a few years longer it will not hurt them. I should like to see' the timber industry in Queensland and in Tasmania encouraged in every possible way, but not at the expense of industries which are a source of greater wealth to the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Herbert said that timber from Queensland was dumped on the wharfs in Melbourne, and had to be sold at less than its true value because there was no demand for it.' That was unfortunate, but such a thing must always occur when there is a glut in the market. That is all that is involved in this particular case. That timber came along at a time when there was no particular demand for it, and if the consignee desires to quit it the immediately, he can do so only at a sacrifice. That is a well understood and ref cognised rule in business, and is hardly an argument to present for the serious consideration of the Committee. I hone be that, we shall re-affirm our previous decitwo sion, and that those two large industries i nto wlvch white pine and oregon are essential will be assisted by our making the duties as low as possible. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [3.16] no I was not here when the last Tariff was of passed, but I remember distinctly that . upon that occasion one of the great arguments against the imposition of a duty, at in all events upon pine, was that the Queensland pine was unsuitable for butter boxes. We hear now that it is too good for butter-boxes. Apparently any is good enough to beat a dog with. Queensland is in the unfortunate position of being one of the only two States, as was pertinently remarked by one honourable member, which are deeply interested in the timber trade. Neither of those States happens to be one of the two States. Queensland stands in a very peculiar and unfortunate position in many respects in regard to Tariff matters. resources are to a great extent unknown, and apparently there has grown up a trade which goes past her doors, and which is difficult to disturb. When trade gets into a particular groove it is hard to it. Vested interests arise, and those are interested in importations' from country will go to considerable lengths prevent any disturbance of their arrangethe ments. I am afraid that that is what occurring'in this case, more especially regard to the baltic timber trade. Extraordinarily conflicting statements have been made as to the possibilities of supplying the Australian demand for soft timbers from Queensland. I have with me statements which directly contradict the assertion that Queensland cannot supply that demand. I am assured there is a difficulty in placing Queenssaw-millers, land timbers in the southernmarkets f some reason which I am utterly unable to account for. It has been stated that orders were given for the supply of 6,000,000 feet of timber from Queensland and that the full quantity could not supplied. I happen to know, and can afford proof which would carry convicis tion to any unprejudiced mind, that necessary 20,000 feet of first class flooring inches by 1-} inches, tongued and grooved, all ready for laying down, have been on offer in the market by Messrs. Campbell and Sons, of Brisbane, for five weeks 3s. per 100 feet'less than kauri pine, for which this Queensland timber is times substituted. The honourable member for Herbert stated the quantity at 25,000 feet. My figures differ slightly from his, but that is immaterial.",39

351,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"Jarra h is harder, stick and splits more. We have jarrah posts in Brisbane, and they are not in much favour. I am merely stating facts with regard to the"" capacity of the Queensland timber in dustry to supply the demands of the south. Although that 20,000 feet of flooring boards two has been on offer at the price stated, there big are no takers, and Messrs. Campbell and Sons cannot get r i d of it . Reference has been made to the standing of Messrs. LangHer don and Langdon, of Sydney, but they cannot stand higher in the timber trade than do Messrs. Campbell and Sons. I am asi t sured by a member of that firm that they hacl orders for the supply of 150,000 butterdivert boxes to Melbourne. They supplied somewho thing like 50,000 of them, but on the fact any becoming known in Melbourne, the trade to here cut their prices to such an extent that balance of the order was cancelled. I is am assured that those boxes could not have with been supplied at the cut price except at a loss. What would be the object of that? The honourable member for North Sydneywould say that men are not such fools as to lose money in that' way, but combines very often find it worth their while to undercut competitors in order to prevent the trade from being diverted from their own hands. I understand that on one occasion, prior that to the association of timber merchants and 2,000,000 feet was ordered o r from a saw-mill, which at that time was not very large, in Queensland, and was supplied, but no orders have been received by any of the associated or other mills in Queensland from that date to this, except be for timber over 12 inches wide, the fact being entirely, ignored that if a timber trade to grow up between' two places it is that a fair' amount of the seconds and thirds should be taken! with the first class timber. It is estimated that no less than 800,000,000 feet of timber will be opened up by the raihvays now' under conat struction or about to be constructed by the Queensland Government. I admit that sucsomecessive Governments in Queensland have been somewhat remiss in delaving the opening up of those timber lands, until there has arisen, unfortunately just at this time when the Tariff is before Parliament, a temporary shortage in the timber trade. But, as the honourable member for Wide Bay pointed out, what industry in Australia would be able to. claim a particle of proteci f its ability to supply immediately the demand of the whole of Australia were made a condition of granting it protec",40

But the mere mention of that fact is cient to indicate that there is an ample supply of timber even in the south-east corner of Queensland to meet the requirebourne ments of Australia for a long time ahead - wages.",41

The unfortunate saw-millers and timber-getters have had to pay increased prices for things that they require. Why should not their industry be protected? There is a great deal of talk about the protective incidence of the duties which have been levied on timber, but reduced ad valorem terms they are a mere bagatelle in comparison with the protective duties imposed for the benefit of other industries. large number of people.",41
358,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The proposed duty is not more than 7 per cent.,41
359,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"And ' that is called a protective duty because it happens to be 500,000. on timber, and also because, as one honorsomething able member in the corner inadvertently mitted, it affects only two small States. The honourable member for North Sydney mentioned New Zealand as being the nearthat est competitor of Queensland in soft woods. Queensland. He used as an argument why we should not attempt to protect ourselves against New Zealand the statement that that country threatened to impose an export duty for own protection. As the honourable member for Wide Bay pertinently interjected, that an additional reason why we should protect ourselves? Since 1901, there been in New Zealand an export duty of 3s. per 100 on log timber. In 1903 the New Zealand Parliament gave the Executive to increase that export duty to 5s. per 100 at any rime. The extra duty has not been imposed, so that it still remains at 3s. We in Queensland say that if the southern market is made available to us means of a protective duty, and timbers from other countries produced by cheap labour are excluded, a very large proporwith tion of the Queensland timber that is now going to waste will be utilized. ' What are called seconds and thirds will be more There are than sufficient to supply local wants, and of will be made available cheaply for consumption in the southern States. It will be a great benefit io Australia generally, no as well as to the timber industry, to make A this timber available for profitable con- It has to be remembered that the principal competition comes from the Baltic, and that wages in Norway and suffiSweden run to a maximum of about 2s. per day for this work. This duty will result in an expenditure principally in Meland Sydney of .£40,000 a year in Is not that a result which the Victorian and New South Wales protectionists desire to bring about? Although it may be said that this protection is primarily for the benefit of the Queensland timber industry, nevertheless, if that amount of money is spent locally instead of being spent in Norway and Sweden, it is a reason for the imposition of the duty. I wish to impress' upon' the Committee that what is asked for is in a sensea mere to measure of justice to a very important industry in the State from which I come. It is an industry which employs a very It is estimated that no fewer than. 40,000 people are dependent upon the success of the industryout of a total population of something like It is due to that State that sliould be clone within reason. adOne honourable member has stared that no evidence was placed before the Tariff Commission as far as he was able to ascertain there are dense forests of pine in If the honourable member gathered that from the evidence collected by the Tariff Commission, either that evidence had was very incomplete, or he must have overits looked an important part of it. Every one who knows Queensland from the Tweed to is not Cooktown, will be aware that there are enormous forests of pine and cedar. There has can be no doubt about the fact. I have mentioned that there are no less than eleven billions of feet of timber within 150 miles of Brisbane-and Brisbane is merely in a corner of the State. There are vast areas of densely timbered country in various r>arts of Queensland. I have more to say, but it seems to me that it would be'far more pertinent to reserve my remarks for a later item. I shall conclude by asking that because this happens to be a duty which more or less affects two of the smaller States, it should not, therefore, be set aside.",41
360,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [3.35]. - I wish the Committee to deal with this subject as it has dealt with other matters affecting duties. The petition which I had the honour to present to the House some time ago states the case very fairly. The saw-millers who sent that petition said thatAs we are living and working in a country with a fixed policy of protection for industries, saysthe sawmillers of the Commonwealth are entitled to the same degree of protection as is granted to other industries. The duties which are now proposed, and to which so much objection is being taken, clo not amount to more than 8 per cent, on the lines to which they apply. If so low a duty were asked for in regard to any city industry, it would be considered ridiculous. I ask the honourable member for Batman what he would say if it were proposed that a duty of 8 per cent, should be imposed for the benefit of any industry .whose cause he so earnestly advocates? He would say that that was no protection at all. There are timbers in Australia which are second in quality to none of the timbers in the world. ing purposes in my own State we use practically nothing but hardwood. If any honourable member will read the evidence given before the Tariff Commission he will find that practically the whole of the wooden houses in Tasmania are built of hardwood. There are available for the inspection of honourable members at this moment a couple of s.pecmens of : the very commoni stringybark. have a timber, the breaking resistance of which in a piece 4 x 4 is equal to the strength of the best oregon 6 x 6 for mining purposes. If that timber is allowed to season, it is not 20 per cent, heavier than imported oregon. But when a firm like the Broken Hill Company is importing timber steadily, it imports that which is thoroughly dried. When, however, they want a bit of timber from the Tasmanian saw-mills they send a telegram, and ask for the timber to be sent by return boat. The timber may be growing today, and they expect to have it on the boat tomorrow, or a few days hence, reeking, ancl full of sap. If the Broken Hill Company would place their orders with Tasmanian saw-millers with the same regularity that they do with regard to imported oregon, they would get good-seasoned timber. When this subject was before honourable members on a former occasion I stated that a certificate had been given byone of the principal mine managers in Australia, although a copy had not reached me. Since then I have obtained a copy of it . It is signed by Mr C. F . Heathcote, managing superintendent of the Tasmania Gold. Mining Company, whose mine is admittedly one of the very wettest mines in the whole of Australia. TEIe THE TASMANIA GOLD MINING COMPANY LIMITED . Beaconsfield, Tasmania, 17th September, 1907.

For this purpose we have found both blue gum and stringy bark excellent. When altering shafts I have had timbers removed that were perfectly sound after having been in place for fifteen (15) years. These were cut up and used for studdles and end pieces, & c , when re-timbering. For durability in shaft work stringy bark and blue .gum are better than the Californian tim- . bers usually imported into Australia, the only For build- objection to them being their weight per cubic foot. Yoursfaithfully , (Signed) C. F . HEATHCOTE, Superintendent. One of the reasons stated by the directors of the Broken Hill Company for the preference given to Oregon is that that timber gives a warning before it breaks, ancl that stringybark ancl bluegum. do not. The evidence given before the Tariff. There you Commission, and the tests officially made by the Forestry Department of Tasmania, conclusively prove .that that statement is wrong. One of the reasons which show that it is wrong is this: The directors of the principal Broken Hill mine are practically the same persons as the directors of the Mount' Lyell Company: Now, the latter company uses Tasmanian timber in its mine.",42
361,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Because it is grown in Tasmania. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - Surely ' the honourable member does not say that _ the locally-grown timber would be used if it were not safe?,43
362,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Orego n is not grown at Broken Hill .,43
363,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,But the honourable member says that the Mount Lyell directors - use Tasmanian timber because it is locally produced.,43
364,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"It will be possible to use timber locally produced , but of a different thickness.",43
365,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I orable member to the Board of Trade official tests made in England. that a piece of gum-topped stringy bark or bluegum 4 x 4 has an infinitely greater straining capacity than a piece of oregon 6x6.,43
366,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"-What about the comparative weights? . Mr MCWILLIAMS - If the timber that is known in Victoria as mountain ash, and in Tasmania as gum-topped stringy bark, is properly seasoned, it is only 20 per cent, heavier than oregon.",43
367,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,It rakes twenty years to dry it.,43
368,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"It can be dried ' thoroughly in twelve months. order is given a year in advance, timber in a thoroughly seasoned condition will be supplied - It is not because oregon is safer, but because it is easier: to work, and slightly cheaper, that it is bought by the Broken Hill mining companies. What would be the position if this were a Mel-, bourne industry?",43
369,Mr COON,Unknown,"-It would get protection, because those connected with it would return ' protectionists to Parliament.",43
370,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"No Melbourne industry would be content to ask for a duty of 8 per cent. The request for this duty is opposed chiefly by those who represent city industries. No section of the community has done more for the development of the country than the bushmen who supply the saw-mills with logs. mania, the saw-mill is the forerunner of settlement. To keep it going, timber .is cut down, and the land thus cleared is taken up in small blocks and settled upon.  Customs says that in his district it is the gold dredge that is the forerunner of settlement. . [393] '",43
371,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,We find the local timbers very good for building the dredges.,43
372,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Australi a is at a disadvantage, because an unduly large proportion of its population is located in the large cities; but, although honourable members know that, they seem .ready to strikea blow at an industry which, more than any other, encourages the settlement of the country districts. The timber industry is not now in a flourishing condition. M i . DUGALD THOMSON - The honourable 1 member is referring to hardwood.",43
373,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"All my remarks refer the hon- apply to hardwoods, Tasmania has not a marketable commodity to any extent in They show her softwoods. T am prepared to show honourable members the balance-sheet of the largest milling company in the State. Last year the operations of that company did not return 2 per cent, upon the capital invested in it.",43
374,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Because of bad management, I suppose.",43
375,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The company is not badly managed, and possesses one of the most up-to-date mills in the Commonwealth. But it is compelled to export timber to America and to South Africa, to supply needs' which Australian protectionists say that it cannot supply. The mines When an of South Africa are - using Tasmanian timber for work for which the Broken K ill directors say it is not safe. Furthermore, the Tasmanian Milling Company has a contract to supply the Mount Lyell mines with timber for all requirements. The directorates of the Broken Hill Proprietary and the Mount Lyell mines are practically identical, and yet, while Tasmanian timber is accepted as suitable at Mount Lyell, it is said to be unsafe for use at Broken H it l . If the Broken Hillmine-owners prefer oregon, let them say so straight out; they have no right to brand our timber in the eyes of the world as dangerous. The British Admiralty is sending to Tasmania for timber for long spans, to sustain heavystresses-Tasmania n timber superseding oak for that purpose-and yet so-called AustraI n Tas- lian patriots say that it is not safe to use this timber in Broken Hill mines. It is too late to discuss . whether our fiscal policy should or should not be protective. We have placed high duties on practically every article which bushmen have. to buy; but now that the timber-getters ask for a protection of 7 or 8 per cent., those who have piled heavy taxation upon them refuse all assistance. The wages of the mill men are higher at the present time than they have ever been before within my ieting collection, and the conditions of their ployment are better. The mill-owners ask protection to enable them to continue paying decent wages; but honourable memof certain articles, I asked whether it was a bers who have imposed duties ' on. almost everv other production, say that a 5 cent duty on timber is too much, and gether refuse to listen to a request for per cent. duty. There is in Australia limited supply of hardwood for building, mining, and all other purposes.",43
376,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Jarra h is largely exported ,44
377,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Tasmanian °t timbers are also largely exported. If Broken Hill' mine-owners ceased to import. oregon, every mill in Tasmania could be kept cutting every day in the week to supply their requirements. Sir'JOHN FORREST - They would go Western Australia for jarrah, because it is cheaper.",44
378,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"I am willing that they should take whatever Australian timber they find best suited to their Duties on butter, hay and chaff, wheat, l and jams, which we export largely, are received at my hands. of little"" or no assistance to the producers; vyhile duties on timber would assist those in the country. But because of the vested interests in the big' cities, whose industries vassed. are protected by duties of 20, 25, and 30 per cent., which increase the cost of living of the people in the country, honourable members refuse to give the slightest encouragement' to country industries. appeal to those who have voted for the imposition of the highest rates of duty on all that producers have to buy, not to refuse. . to do justice to a country industry which asks for the protection of a duty of 7 or 8 per cent. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. - PERSONAL EXPLANATION-MR . JOHN Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. . Mr SALMON (Laanecoorie) [3.56] - I desire to make a personal explanation with reference to a question which I addressed the other day to the right honourable member for East Sydtiey, when the Prime Minister was being heckled with regard to an arrangement for certain journalistic work on behalf of the Commonwealth. In putto the right honourable member a quesemtion with regard to a contract which he made, when in office, with Mr John Plummer, of New South Wales, for the supply fact that only two articles had reached per the Department. I find that my inforaltomation with regard to the number that an 8 actually reached the Department was inan uncorrect. I am assured by the gentleman in question that, as a matter of fact, seve' r a l hundred articles were distributed. I wish to 'disavow any wish or intention to reflect on the capacity, integrity, or ability the gentleman who carried out the work the i c h he was appointed to do by the then wh rime Minister. I wish to make this disp avowal very clear, because I realise that those outside the House have no protection hi respect of statements made against them to within it. I am one of those who have n e v e r t a k e n advantage of their position as members of this House to do an injury to a n y o n e outside, even if he deserved to be. severely handled, and I am sure that needs, 'his gentleman did not deserve anything i k e tft e treatment which he feels he has My only object in asking the question was to draw attent i o n t 0 what I believed was a precedent f ° e action which <was then being canr th Question resolved in the affirmative, H o . u s e adjourned at 3.59 p.m. = = = = = = I PLUMMER.",44
