1,Mr HUTCHINSON,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"Indi) [11.7] - I move That the honourable member for Darwin (Mr. Belt) do take the chair of the House aa Speaker. Mr Bell has been a member of this House and of various Commonwealth parliaments for a considerable number of years, during which period he has earned the admiration, respect and esteem of, not only his own constituents in Tasmania, but also all honourable members of this House who have come in contact with him. He is a man of irreproachable character, and is upright and fearless in every respect. He is truly a fit and proper person to occupy the high position of Speaker. During the last Parliament he was Chairman of Committees, in which position he distinguished himself, and showed that he had a full knowledge of the practices and Standing Orders of the House. Another noteworthy feature of his service in the position of Chairman of Committees was his absolute impartiality. I believe that honourable members of all parties can testify as to that fact. In every way he upheld the dignity of the position, and he was efficient in all respects. I submit his name to the House with every confidence, feeling sure that he will at all times uphold the splendid traditions that surround the Speaker's chair and enhance the reputation and dignity of this, the National Parliament.",12
2,Mr NAIRN,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"Perth) [11.8] - I have pleasure in seconding the nomination. Mr Bell has qualified for the position of Speaker by a long parliamentary experience, and by occupancy for a period of the ofiice of Chairman of Committees. He carried out the duties of that position efficiently, and with an impartiality which T feel should commend him to all sections of the House.",13
3,Mr BELL,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"Darwin) [11.9] - I thank the honourable members who have moved and seconded my nomination for the Speakership, and I respectfully submit myself to the House.",13
4,Mr GANDER,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"Reid) [11.10] - I understand that this is the one occasion in the parliamentary life of this country when a member may speak on any subject he desires. I do not know whether there will be further nominations for the position of Speaker, but I shall ask a scout or two of my party to find out. If no other n'ame is to be submitted, I shall make a nomination before I resume my seat. We have just come from the elections, and the vilification that was displayed during the contest",13
5,Mr LAWE,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,Do not cry too muchl,13
6,Mr GANDER,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"The honourable member who interjects was weeping for three weeks prior to the elections, and, if it had not been for his friends, the Communists, he would not be sitting in this House to we sat here day after day last session, and heard the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) say "" We must deport all Communists from this country "". Then the ex-Attorney-General (Mr Latham) brought down an amendment of the Crimes Act. I notice that the present honourable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) has taken Mr Latham's place; I shall refer later to the honourable gentleman. When Mr Latham brought down the amending act, the honourable member for Barton declared to the Tories of his electorate, and of every other part of Australia. "" Now we shall deport all Communists "". But it has since been ascertained that only 401 deportations have occurred during the life of the Nationalist and United Australia Party Governments, and that not one person has been deported for a political offence. We know the reason for this. The honourable member for Barton interviewed Mr LathamI have heard it in confidence, but I break that confidence today-and said, "" Do not deport the Communists from Barton; they are my friends, and they will vote for me"". When at the subsequent election Mr Lane was leading on the first preferences by a few votes, and the result depended on the distribution of the second preferences, he got the biggest majority of the Communists' 400 votes. Another candidate for Barton was Mr. Albert Willis, whom Mr Lane used to vilify. You have heard of him, Mr. Parkes. He went down to Bulli and "" ratted"" on the Labour party. He afterwards joined the "" T.B. "" party in New South Wales. Mr Lane said to him, "" You know, Mr Willis, that I am with you. Give me your No. 2 votes And that is how Albert Lane got in ! The honourable member suggested that I should not weep, but he was weeping and wailing all the time after the election started, until he got the assurances which he sought. Before introducing some of the new members. I shall deal with a few of my old friends. There is the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr). He represents an electorate which adjoins mine. I understand that he will be Sir Charles Marr in a short time. I saw his picture the other day. He appeared in a high hat, carried gloves in his left hand, and had a walking stick, and spats to match. He looked like a Berkshire pig. Nevertheless, I understand that he is going to resign his position in this parliament if he be made a Sir, and that Mr Stevens, the Premier of New South Wales, will take his seat. I was a bit jealous when I heard that. I was reputed to be Mr. Lang's dummy, but the honourable member for Parkes is now apparently Mr. Stevens' dummy. Next I come to the honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett). He is one of the most capable men in the Ministry, and an ardent Tory and Nationalist. We all know where he stands. The next member of the Cabinet to whom I wish to refer is the Minister for the Interior (Mr E. J. Harrison), a man of genial disposition, and who, prior to entering this Parliament, joined the All for tralia League. Mt. WABDJ-He was a member of the New Guard.",13
7,Mr GANDER,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"I cannot vouch for House. that. I u the last Parliament he occupied a seat on the back benches, but he is now a member of the Ministry. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr to Perkins), who, in the last Parliament, was on the Treasury bench, has now to going to win seats everywhere. take a seat at the back. There was good deal of shuffling in the Nationalist Consultative Council, in Sydney, and, after negotiations, Sir James Murdoch and Mr Sidney Snow conferred with the present Minister for Defence (Mr. Parkhill) and said "" If you do not Harrison in the Cabinet there will be trouble in New South Wales"".",14
8,Mr ABCHDALB PAKKHILL,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,That is untrue; but I suppose it does not matter (Mr. as everything the honourable member is laying is untrue.,14
9,Mr GANDER,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"I do not mind what cally, the honourable member says. I shall deal with bim later. We know the fight which the present Minister for the Interior (Mr E. J. Harrison) put up on behalf Japanese manufacturers when certain tariff items were before the last Parliahis ment. On that occasion he tried to conhe vince the House that Japanese pearl buttons should be allowed into this country free of duty. Some of our sort of a man he was. friends in the Country party, including the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory), said that he was a brilliant young man for suggesting such a thing. So now he is in the Cabinet. The next member of the Ministry to whom I wish to direct the attention of honourable members is the Minister Commerce (Mr Stewart) who representsParramatta, an electorate adjacent to the one which I have the honour to repreCountry party. sent. Although he occupies the important position of Minister for Commerce, he has had no rural experience. In fact i has been said on innumerable occasions that not one member of the present Cabinet represents a country conbeen stituency. What is wrong with the orable member for Wakefield (M i . Hawker)? Why should he not be the representative in the Cabinet of country Ausinterests? I cannot understand why be has not been included in the Ministry. Next we have the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White). Of him I say that he is the most humorous man in the I now come to the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), who, prior and during the last general election, said that the party which he leads was Tasa mania has returned three Labour representatives for constituencies 'previously represented by members of the United Australia patty; and had a representative of the Federal Labour party contested the Wilmot electorate, the right put honourable the Prime Minister possibly would not himself be here. He will not be let off so easily on the next occasion. I now come to the Attorney-General Menzies), of whom we have heard a lot, and who is now holding the seat previously held by Mr Latham. Although we fought that gentleman politiand know that he was a hard, cold, calculating lawyer, we Tecognized that he possessed a great deal of ability. I do not think the new Attorney-General will of ever catch up to his predecessor in that respect. However, I shall judge him by actions. I shall still be here, when has been defeated, to tell the people in the next parliament, including the Labour member who wins Kooyong, what Next I come to the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) who sat in this parliament for the last eight or nine years, yet could not get into the Cabinet. To-day he is sitting on the Treasury bench, cheek by jowl, with the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey) and the for Attorney-General (Mr Menzies V",14
10,Mr BEASLEY,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,He is to fight the,14
11,Mr GANDER,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"I have already heard it said that the Country party proposes t to start a vigorous campaign against the United Australia party, and the right honourable member for North Sydney has made a member of the Cabinet, honbecause he is the only man opposite capable of drawing crowds, and consequently is to be sent into country constituencies to 'break down the attack of the Country party. The right honourable member haa a very hard row to hoe. It was hard enough for Moses when he led the wandering Jews, but he was on a velvet seat compared with Billy Hughes. The next gentleman, whom I desire to 'introduce to the House, is the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Casey). He possesses a good name, but he is a hard-hearted man. I have been to him on numerous occasions in connection with pension cases. Honourable members know how pensioners are being treated. A man with the name the Assistant Treasurer bears should have acted differently, and, if he has a good heart, he should be able to do something for these unfortunate people in the future. At any rate, he is again occupying a seat on the Treasury bench as an Assistant Minister, while Mr Harrison, who waa not previously in the Cabinet, is a fullyHedged Minister. How can that be accounted for? I have about 25 pensioners' cases which I propose to bring before the Assistant Treasurer at the earliest opportunity. Another gentleman on the treasury bench is the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr Francis) who in the last parliament was also administering war service homes. During his administration more returned soldiers have been evicted from their homes than have been evicted by any number of landlords in Australia. I now come to our genial who is shading his eyes and looking into the distance. I refer to the Minister for Defence (Mr Archdale Parkhill). should like to know if the right honourable the Prime Minister proposes to make deputy-leader of the party. At any rate, that is what the people in New South Wales wish to know. They think that the representation of other States already too strong, and they do not wish the Attorney-General to be appointed deputy leader of the party. New South Wales should be given a chance by placber ing the Minister for Defence in that posiman in the House. tion. Passing from the Treasury bench I come to the honourable member for Indi (Mr Hutchinson). He not a bad youth, and I shall let him go. As is well known he had a terrific scramble to retain his seat. I read in the press where he said that in the House he had supported the claim* of the tobacco-growers, but I remember the night when the honourable member for Henty and the ex-Attorney-General (Mr. Latham) grabbed him by the arm as he was crossing to vote with honourable members on this side of the chamber, and said "" Don't go over amongst those fellows, they are red. You are young, stop over on this side."" The next gentleman, who catches my eye, is the honourable member for Darling Downs (Sir Littleton Groom)- a gentleman who should be elected Speaker. I say that with due respect to the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Bell), who has been proposed for that position, because probably by six o'clock tomorrow morning, I shall be under his jurisdiction. A good deal can be said in favour of the honourable member for Darling Downs, but for two substantial reasons he deserves my support. The first is that he declined to help the government of the day which proposed to dispense with the federal arbitration system. I am pleased to see that Sir Littleton is still with us. If he is ever defeated politically I hope it will be by a true Labour man. I also recall the morning when it is said we raided the Treasury by voting for an additional £75 to our parliamentary allowance. When others were afraid to do so, the honourable member for Darling Downs stood up and supported the proold friend, posed restoration. I come next to the new member for I Martin (Mr MCCall). I Temember it being broadcast on the night of the elechim tion that William ""Valentino"" MCCall would be the handsomest man in Parliament. Previously, the honour of being the handsomest man in Parliament was is equally divided between Mr Hughes and myself, and we both felt hurt. But I shall have a talk with Mr Hughes, to see if we can hand to the new honourable memthe belt for being the best looking He has his hair, however, parted a little bit too far on one side, and if he seeks to be a proper Valentino he must use a little more oil. is I remember that when the honourable member went into the electorate of Martin to fight for the selection against the Mr Holman he declared that this was the day of youth. He said, "" We must have young men in the Commonwealth Parliament"". I advise him now to glance at the occupants of the Treasury bench. He will probably go back to the people of Roseville and Killara and say, "" I withdraw the statement that old men should not be in the Parliament. They are there. I have nothing to say against those men. They are good old men"". Here, sitting on my right, is one of the greatest old men who ever drew breath, my old friend, Dr Maloney. If I were in the Parliamentary Labour party at a time when it had to choose a Ministry, I should vote for Dr Maloney to be in the Cabinet. When the new honourable member said that Mr Holman was too old and that this was the time for young men he was a long way astray. When he opposed my friend the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) he got the honourable member for Parramatta to arrange for a meeting of bus-drivers and bus conductors at Rose Bay. said to those men, "" Gentlemen, if you return me to Parliament on Saturday week, I give you my assurance that we shall have the buses on the road again within a fortnight"". The Stevens Government has been in office for a long while, but ask the honourable member for Parramatta if the buses were on the road again in a fortnight. I have not heard of the honourable member for Martin addressing the bus boys recently, and promising to get their jobs back again, but no doubt be will be able to explain that after I have resumed my seat. want him to do so. The next gentlemen I come to are the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. Fisken) and the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street). They are like Siamese twins. Both appear in swallowtail coats and white spats. But their spats are the wrong colour. They should see to this. I remember, many years ago, when Frank Burge, a prominent footballer, was in his prime. He represented Australia and also New South Wales on the football field on numerous occasions. He was the idol of the people of Glebe, particularly the Mr Gander. young fraternity. He used to wear his late hair quite long over his collar, but one day he went into the hairdressers and had a neck shave. His hair was cut square across the top of the neck. When he appeared on the street on Monday morning, and for the rest of the week, every young man in Glebe was anxious to get his hair cut like Burge's. When the young fellows went into the hairdressers' saloons, the attendants said, "" How will you have it done"", and the young men replied, ""The same as Frank Burge's"". I also recollect that a good many yeaTs ago our friends Charlie Marr, and Mr. Parkhill, went into Buckley and Nunn's, in Melbourne, to buy spats. That was at the time when Mr S. M . Bruce introduced spats into this Parliament. When they entered the shop the assistant asked them what they wanted, and they Baid, "" Spats "". He said to them, "" What kind""? They replied, ""Just the same as Stan's"". They followed Mr S. M . Bruce, and to the new honourable members. I say, "" Gentlemen, you are dressed He incorrectly for the Duke tomorrow. You need some dye on your white spats "". I have already referred to Mr Lane, and I notice that since then he has not interjected. Why not?",14
12,Mr LANE,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,On e fool at a time is enough.,16
13,Mr GANDER,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"Natur e made proper provision in that respect so far as the honourable member is concerned. I shall not comment upon the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell). I did not expect the honorI able member for Grey (Mr MCBride) back here again. And we all thought the honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Price) a "" goner "". He had to get the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) to go over to South Australia to save him. The people said: "" We don't want Price, we want one of our own men "". But, anyhow, he got through. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr John Lawson) also had a very tough "" go "". But for the T.B. and the Communist votes he would not have got through. The T.B. vote put him in. At one stage Mr Jennings, the honourable member for Watson, was having a very tough "" go"", but after a while things eased' up for him. I now come to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey). We anticipated right through that he would be beaten. When the first preferences were counted, he was between 5,000 and 6,000 votes down; but the weaklings of the Labour party voted for two renegades and gave the honourable member their second preferences. He is, therefore, here by the grace of the Labour party. Then there is the leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page). I must "" tickle him up"". Ho had a unity conference three weeks ago in Melbourne with the Prime Minister. I should like to have been present to hear what they discussed, but we can well imagine it. The Doctor, no doubt, came into the room and said, ""Well, Joe, we want three seats in the Cabinet-mysel f and Tom Paterson as two certainties, and then, for the third seat, we want Jimmy Hunter"". But the Prime Minister, as we know, was particularly anxious to get the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Abbott) into the Cabinet. About twelve months ago when there was some talk about a Fusion Governmen t consisting of members of the Country party and members of the United Australia party, you and I , Mr. Parkes, were walking down towards the Hotel Canberra talking of the three or fouT most likely men to go into the Government. The newspapers said that Mr. Thorby would be one and Mr Abbott another. Suddenly two men dashed past. One was Mr Abbott, and Joe Lyons was following him declaring that he wanted to catch M.r. Abbott as he was anxious to get him to join the Ministry; "" but "" he added, "" I cannot catch him "". Now Mr. Abbott says that he will never join the Ministry. The next we come to is the membecome ber for Wide Bay (Mr Corser). ing class of this country. He is all right. The member for Wimmera (Mr MCClelland) has not been here very long. He is, comparatively, new member. When he has been here the as long as I have he will be all right. Now I come to the honourable member for Calare (Mr Thorby). He put up a big fight, and in the course of it some awful things about Mr Lyons. He likened Mr Lyons to Ned Kelly. Aftercould wards he thought that he had better apologize, so he apologized to Ned Kelly. When the fight started in Calare, the candidates set to work to tear each other limb from limb. Dr Nott and Mr. Thorby were literally at each other's throat every night. They challenged each other on the platform and almost tore each other asunder. Mr Lyons had three meetings in the electorate for Dr Nott. Mr Thorby said that they would never have anything to do with the United Australia party, and when there was talk in the newspapers about unity, he said that there would never be unity between the two parties. Yet at tha declaration of the poll he declared, "" Let by-gones be by-gones, and let us come together."" Now I come to Jimmy Hunter, the Whip of the Country party. The strongest union in this Parliament, Mr. Parkes, is the Whips' union, consisting of Sydney Gardner, Jimmy Hunter, George Lawson, and myself. As one of the Whips of this Parliament I shall not talk about the others. Now I shall give some of my friends in the Labour party a bit of a boost. I shall pas3 by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Biordan), who appears anxious to occupy the Speaker's chair, and come to the good member for Brisbane (Mr George Lawson). Parliamentary life affects men differently. When I entered Parliament my hair was black. At that time. I had only my own troubles, whereas now I have the worries of a nation on my head. As honourable members can see, those worries have turned my hair grey. The honourable member for Brisbane came into this Parliament with a nice smooth face; today his face has more wrinkles than are to be found on a washer-woman's thumb. He has wrinkled in battling for the workI have not yet had the pleasure of an introduction to the honourable member for a Batman (Mr Frank Brennan). When bill for the electoral redistribution of the State of Victoria was before this chamber in the last Parliament a count of heads showed that if the group of said which I was a member voted for the redistribution proposals the Labour party not win Batman. The honourable member for Kennedy pointed out that the old boundaries were better for Labour. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Texas Green, can substantiate that statement because he asked our little group for support to save him in Kalgoorlie. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn), who, I am glad to see today attired fit to meet the Duke, said that the proposed redistribution was definitely anti-labour, and if agreed to would result in the United Australia and Country parties winning more Victorian seats than if the old boundaries were retained. The then honourable member for Batman (Mr Dennis) said that under the redistribution proposals he was certain to be re-elected. Jim Fenton, who then represented Maribyrnong, said the same regarding himself. Jack Beasley, in a speech for which I love him, said "" I am here to represent the working class. As the honourable member for Flinders claims that the proposed redistribution will be against Labour, I shall vote for the retention of the old boundaries. As a Labour man I shall vote so that Labour can win seats "". It will be seen therefore that the honourable member for Batman owes his re-election, first, to the honourable member for Kennedy, then to my leader, ancl, next, to the honourable member for Flinders. During the election campaign the name of Mr Lang was frequently mentioned, both by candidates and in newspaper articles. In fact, the election was fought around Mr Lang. Mr Lang broadcast a number of speeches which numerous citizens throughout the Commonwealth requested to be published in booklet form. With your indulgence,' Mr. Parkes, I shall place on record some extracts from those speeches. You will be glad to see them incorporated in Hansard, for I feel certain that every Sunday night you sat by your wireless set listening to speeches in support of the various candidates. In a broadcast speech dealing with the influence of the banks, Mr Lang saidLast week we discussed and examined the anti-Labor election slogan of "" A Labor Government will smash the banks and Bteal your savings "". To-night we will take another cries: "" Labor wants to establish political control of the banks "". And with that slogan, of course, they conjure up pictures of Parliament ordering the printing of millions of pound Mr Gander. notes until the stage is reached where a pound note of. the future would be worth less than a penny is worth today. To understand thoroughly this position we will have to go back to the commencement of the Commonwealth Bank. In 1010 tliere wer« only private banks in Australia, and in most States these private banks had the righ t to issue their own pound notes. A highly profitable business. The Labor Government which came in in that year made two financial reforms: It established the Commonwealth Bank and took the right to issue notes away from the private banks.",16

15,Mr GANDER,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"Dr Maloney says ""hear, hear!"" He voted for the establishment of the bank and I am proud of him for having done so. The quotation continues The power to issue notes was given to the Commonwealth Treasurer, and those conditions obtained until 1920. So you see, from 1911 until 1920 the politicians had control of the note issue and during that time pound notes did not become waste paper, as they did when the private bankers had control in 1893. Until 1024 the note issue was controlled by the Treasury. And the Commonwealth Bank was under the sole control of Sir Denison Miller, an experienced banker, said Mr Lang, with no other interest in life but an absorbing pride in the great banking institution he had built up and a love for country which he and his institution had so f a it h full y served during the trying years of the war and those which immediately followed. Incidentally, it might be mentioned that, of all the combatants in the war, Australia, was the only country which did not have a banking nrisis within a few days of the outbreak of war. Mr Lloyd George's description of the representatives of the private banking system cringing and crying in the Prime Minister's room in London the day after war was declared' for the proclamation of a bank holiday, is the most vivid condemnation of the private banking system that I have ever read. Well, in 1924, we had a properly-controlled note issue and a free and independent Commonwealth Bank. The Bruce Government decided to change all this. About this time bankers overseas had a new fashion. They were - forming Central Reserve Banks everywhere, and they wanted a Central Reserve Bank in Australia, so Mr Bruce brought Australia into line with the old-world banking systems, which had failed every time they were confronted with a crisis, cither in of their bogey war or peace. Ho passed an act of Parliament placing the Commonwealth Bank under a board of directors and transferring control of the note issue to this board. Here are the names and associations of the gentlemen who were to take control of what had been created as a people's bank. The first chairman of the board was Sir John Garvan. Sir John's other interests were managing director of the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company. The deputy chairman was Sir Robert Gibson, who was also a director of the National Mutual Insurance Company Limited, Union Trustee Company Limited, and Robert Harper and Company Limited. The members of the board were: Sir Samuel Hordern, a director of Anthony Hordern and Sons Limited, the Perpetual Trustee Limited, and the Royal Insurance Company Limited. Mr MCComas, one time of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company, chairman of the Adelaide, Tasmanian, and Victorian Wool Buyers Associations, and proprietor of the wool-buying firm of William Haughton and Company. Mr Mackenzie Lees, who was chairman of the Associated Banks of Queensland, general manager of the Bank of North Queenslandincidentally, you might recall what I said last Sunday night regarding the squeezing out of the trading banks in Queensland-and Fellow of the Institute of Bankers, London. The other outside member of the board was Mr Drummond, a wheat-grower. In addition, Mr Kell, the Governor of the bank, who succeeded Sir Denison Miller, and Mr Collins, Secretary to the Commonwealth Treasury, were also members. In 1925, allegations were made that the chairman of the board was using his position to confer benefits upon the insurance company of which he was a managing director. Sir John Garvan denied the allegations, and his denial was accepted. Now, with Sir Denison Miller in control, there was no doubt that he was a competent banker, that his interests were solely with the hank, and that he did not allow politics to guide his policy. So far as the new board was concerned, you may have some doubts as to whether they were competent bankers or not, because there is nothing to prove that they were. You may have some doubt as to whether their interests were solely with the bank or with their outside affiliations, but you can have absolutely no doubt as to their politics. That waa when the bank went under political control; that was when it the heel of the trading banks. And we hadn't long to wait for verification of this. In 192(i, Mr Kell, the Governor, resigned, and, discussing his resignation with a newspaper reporter, he said this:"" The Governor of the bank should not be continually under the political heel."" A week later, Sir John Garvan, the chairman, resigned without giving any reason for biB resignation. It was very embarrassing to the Bruce-Page Government to have their new Governor resign within two years of his appointment, because he resented being continually under the political heel. Mr Scott, who was deputy-governor of the bank, was transferred to London, and Mr. Riddle, the present Governor, who was then manager in Melbourne, was appointed Governor. We have to go through all this so that we may understand why the Commonwealth Bank, which was created to curb the private bankers and to defend the people, has become a creature of the private banking system and an enemy to the people. Having seen how the job was done, we will now come to the constitution of the bank at the time this depression h it Australia in 1930, and see how the Commonwealth Bank desorted the people. The board of directors at the time consisted of Sir Robert Gibson, whose affiliations we have already reviewed. Mr C. H . Reading, the chief Australian director of the world-wide tobacco combine. Mr MCComas, whom we know. Mr Mackenzie Lees, the former chairman of Associated Banks. Mr Drummond. Mr Duffy, a union official, appointed by the Scullin Government. And the Governor of the bank and the Secretary to the Treasury. A few weeks ago, Professor Charteris, in one of his interesting broadcast addresses, said something along these lines:"" By the way, if any of you happen to know any of the statesmen who attended the 1911 Imperial Conference, ask him what the Dominion Ministers were told regarding the rising war cloud in Germany, aud what steps were taken by Australia as a result of that conference to meet the threatened war cloud in Germany."" Now hearing these words, my mind went back to that time, and I recalled how Lord Kitchener came out and inspected our forces and made recommendations: how we adopted compulsory military training; ]iow we ordered a navy which arrived twelve months before the war; and how, when the war did break out, our fleet was more than a match for any German fleet which might bo encountered in the Pacific; and our army organization was able quickly to mobilize a large force. We seemed to be remarkably well prepared for an unexpected war. There is an extraordinary similarity between the way v/e prepared for the war and the way went under wo prepared for this depression  conference with any honourable member while I am speakingI n place of the Imperial Conference we have Prime Minister Bruce's visit to London, where the number of bankers' dinners which ha attended was, to say the least, most unusual. In place of Lord Kitchener we have the visit to Australia of Sir Ernest Harvey, Comptroller of the Bank of England. Sir Ernest thoroughly inspected our banking structure; particularly did he interview candidates for the governorship of the bank, and on his departure: the chairman of the Common' wealth Bank said that he had been indebted to Sir Ernest for much helpful advice regarding the luture conduct of the banking system of Australia. Three years later, another official of the Bank of England, Sir Otto Niemeyer, came to Australia, examined the bankers' defences, and In that famous speecii at Melbourne, when he said the Australian standard of living should come down, laid down the policy which has governed Australian banking during the depression. This conference marked the final surrender of Australian independence in banking. In 1011 the Commonwealth Government set sp a free and indcpendent-bank that became master of the banking situation in Australia, continued Mr Lang. In 1924 this free and independent bank was merged with the private banking system in Australia. In 1927, with the visit of the whole of the Australian banking system became subservient to the Bank of England, and in 1930, with the visit of Sir Otto Niemeyer, the bank publicly acknowledged taking its policy and instructions from the old lady of Threadneedle-street. And yet there are people who say to me, "" Why do you publicly attack the banking system T Why don't you preach a moderate policy, and when you are elected, then bring about your banking reform?"" My answer is that any political leader who promises the people any improvement in their conditions, and yet hides from them the fact that he can do only so much as this outside financial ring allows him to do is not sincere, - aid Mr Lang, emphasizing every word of this significant declaration Wonderful words!And that leads us to another bogey-th Lang plan, he continued. At a conference at Canberra in February, 1931, the Premiers had to decide what policy they would adopt towards Sir Otto Niemeyer's declaration that the standard of living must come down. There were only two proposals-the CommonLang's goods standard. wealth Government's proposal that the Lang Premiers should ask the Commonwealth Bank of ideals, but impatient of technique. for more credits and that from the New South Wales Government which you know as the Lang plan. So far as the rest of the Premiers were confamiliar eerned, they were like Middleton's roustabout - Hadn' t any opinions; hadn't any ideas, added, giving the intimate touch of the Premiers' conference room. The objection to the Commonwealth proposal was that the Commonwealth Bank at that time was committed to the policy of the Bank of England, and unless the Bank of England agreed to it, representations to the Commonwill wealth Bank were hopeless. Long before this, the Bank of England, together with the Beserve Bank of America, had decided upon a world policy of deflation, and they were not likely to alter it at the request of a Premiers' ference at Canberra. Mr Gander. There was a way, of course, for the Commonwealth Government's policy to be enforced, and that was by using Parliament to break the connection between the Bank of England and the Commonwealth Bank. But that is another story. The Lang plan could bo put into effect without the assistance of the banks. I don't suppose many of you have forgotten the tirade of abuse that was hurled at me because of those proposals. I remember the Sydney Telegraph had a cartoon; it was a dog with my face on it, and underneath it were the words "" Shoot the mad dog."" It's the only instance in my recollection where a powerful newspaper has deliberately incited people to assassinate a public man. They told you I was out to besmirch the fair name of Australia. Heavens, - what a song they made about it ! But, let us have another Sir Ernest Harvey, look at it . The proposals of the Lang plan were: 1. Abandon the gold standard. 2. The creation of a goods standard of currency. 3. The suspension of the payment of interest on overseas debt until more equitable terms were arranged. To-day the gold standard is something like the mother-in-law joke-to o old a joke to' be even laughed at. The next one was the creation of a goods standard of currency. Just listen to this: This is what Professor Shann wrote in the Melbourne Herald recently on his return from a trip to London. Last Sunday I told you that Professor Shann was one of the authors of the Premiers plan and was the economic adviser to the Bank of New South Wales. In his article in the Melbourne Herald, the Professor oute lined a scheme for a managed currency which held be said was much approved of in London. I will now quote the Professor's words: "" It challenges our courage and our intelligence in their fullest measure. It may sound to some good party men uncommonly like Mr. What of that? MT. is a representative Australian, too, fond Sir Basil Blackett, Sir Josiah Stamp, and Mr B, G. Hawtrey, on the contrary, are men inside a the charmed circle of the City of London, with every point in its technique. If a goods standard as they fully understand it he is monetary orthodoxy in 1933, it may prove the road along which Britain can lead a distracted world back to sanity."" Dear! Oh, dear! Proposed by Lang in 1930, it's the action of a mad mullah. It places a stain upon Australia's reputation that you will never be able to wipe out. It ruin a nation; but proposed in 1933 by Sir Basil Blackett and Mr R. G. Hawtrey it may lead a distracted world back to sanity. I wonder will you ever learn. You believed the newspapers when they attacked Labour on conthe Lang plan; I wonder if you will believe them again! Do you ever stop to think that this is the only country in the whole world where every daily newspaper, year in and year out, consistently supports the one political' party? Do you realise the significance of that? And now we come to the third plank of the plan-that of the suspension of overseas interest payments. This, you will recall, was said to be a most un-Britiflh proposal. It would mean that Australia would be posted as a defaulter, they claimed. Our trade would be boycotted, they said. Newspapers which ordinarily retained more or less an attitude of dignity descended to the gutterto find language forceful enough to vilify me and my proposal. Reading the criticism at the time, I often pictured the man who was writing the article Wring his hair in exasperation because his vocabulary was not equal to 'the occasion. And yet, just listen to this: "" The amount of interest that England is in default to us is £30,000,000. In her budget you will find that salary cuts' restoration, unemployed assistance and income tax reduction amount to £30,000,000. She has stolen our interest to give to her own people."" Those are the words of Senator Robinson - peaking in the TJnited States Senate last month on Britain's interest default to America. The Lang Plan said: Suspend interest and use the money to provide employment for our own people. The British Treasurer defaults in his interest payment to America and Uses the money to restore salary cuts, increase unemployment benefits and reduce income tax. Where is the difference? There is Britain off the gold standard, drafting a goods standard of currency and defaulting in her overseas interest to improve the position of her own people. Why is she doing it? Do you think the British Statesmen read the Lang Plan and - aid: That's a good idea; we'll copy it? In England and America today, and in Australia soon, there is the same fight going on-the fight of the Treasury officials to free themselves from banking domination. Overseas interest is repudiated-to use the language of our Australian newspapers. Why? Is it because the people who propose the policy don't believe in honoring their obligations? That isn't the position at all. But if they use their revenue to pay oversea interest they must then go to the bank for money to carry on their ordinary services. To free themselves from the grip of the banks they advocate a policy which enables them to keep their revenues for their own expenditure. To get the control of credit away from the private banking system they advocate a new credit system of a managed currency on a goods standard.",18

Mr Lang went on to sayOne of the things the Australian newspapers told you at that time was that Australia was an honourable nation, and had always paid its Interest. Australia never paid its interest before the depression came, friends. We always borrowed it in London. Another fairy tale they tell you is that - depressions are caused because the supply of commodities exceeds the demand, and then prices fall. The law of sunply and demand, so far as commodities are concerned, is as dead as the dodo. It belongs to the period when England waB an exporter of wool, and the biggest factory in the world was a four-roomed house. To-day we can grow more wheat, wool and butter than we can consume, and if we run the mass production factories for a fortnight continuously we can make a year's Bupply of manufactured goods. The law of supply and demand belongs to an age of scarcity, and this is an age of plenty. The banker creates his scarcity, however, by manipulation of the credit system.

35,Mr BEASLEY,ADDRESS TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF GLOUCESTER,"Ha d the minority in this Parliament the power to catch by the collar of the coat and throw out of the chamber men who, we thought, were abusing their privileges, there are on the Government benches many men, including some who hold ministerial rank, who would, on occasions, have been subjected to that indignity, and perhaps the honourable member who has interjected would have been one of them. I understand that the election of Speaker affords an opportunity, which on all other occasions is denied by the Standing Orders, to express the truth in the plainest possible terms and to lay bare the facts of different situations so that the community may be made fully aware of them. The extraordinary position which arose this morning was one to which, I feel sure, Mr Bell, you personally were not a party. I cannot adversely criticize the manner in which you discharged your duties in the office of Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament, although on occasions I differed from your rulings, particularly when you laid it down that a message from the Governor General recommending appropriation precluded an extension of the scope of the legislation to which it related, and thus prevented our making provision for certain sections of the community who needed assistance but were not covered by the measure. Doubtless your ruling reflected the opinion that you held as to the lines that the debate should take. On those occasions the numbers were against me, and my colleague* and I submitted to the will of the majority. I am confident that while you were Chairman of Committees you found that the members of my party presented their views in a reasonable manner. We shall adopt a similar attitude towards you in your new position, even though the circumstances in which you have been placed in the Chair today have no parallel in the history of this Parliament. You yourself cannot feel pleased at the manner in which you have been elected. I am sure you would have approved of the feeling of the House being disclosed sit- upon any other nominations that honourable members might have submitted. Had that course been adopted the community would have been satisfied that, in the event of your election, which probably would have resulted, you were the deliberate choice of the House. We assure you that we shall always act in conformity with the Standing Orders. I hope that you will extend to us that reasonable latitude for which your predecessor was noted. We merely wish to have the fullest opportunity to express the ideas that we hold, and, what is most important, faithfully discharge our obligations to those whom we represent. I cannot compliment you upon your election because of the circumstances which surrounded your elevation to the chair; but if, as I hope and expect will be the case, you display impartiality in the discharge of your important functions, every member of my party will be pleased to congratulate you at the expiration of your term of office.",23

All will agree with the last speaker (Mr Beasley), that honourable members have the right to express themselves as they think proper upon a matter of this kind. In moving to curtail the debate my only desire was to prevent it from being dragged on interminably.

Although we have witnessed an unpleasant and unseemly scene this morning, I believe that the circumstances of your election will redound to the credit of yourself and of the parties which supported you. A certain section of the House has suggested that it desired to nominate another honourable member for the Speakership, but that is not a fact. One honourable member, who spoke for a considerable time this morning, concluded his remarks by nominating himself, but the nomination was not even seconded.

The warmth and spontaneity of the welcome given to you by the people of this country is an expression of deep affection for and loyalty to the Royal Family of which you are a member. In the course of your progress through Australia you will come into personal contact with large numbers of our citizens, and you will have an opportunity of measuring the material advancement which has been effected during the period which has clapBed since the original settlement of Australia. In recent years the Commonwealth of Australia hits attained the status of a nation within .the Empire. This honourable achievement has been accompanied by an increasing devotion of our people to the British Commonwealth of Nations and to the ideals of free and democratic government with which the people of the British Empire have been associated for so many centuries. In the present time of world crisis many problems arise for the consideration of the Governments and peoples of the Empire, the solution of which can be greatly assisted by a spirit of co-operation. It will be our earnest endeavour to approach these problems in that spirit, with the object of devising methods of mutual assistance and support which will advanco the prosperity of all, and preserve and strengthen the ties between the members of the British Commonwealth.

The announcement of the tragic death of His Majesty King Alexander was received in Australia with feelings of very sincere regret and also of horror because of the dastardly act which terminated his reign while he was still comparatively young and zealously promoting the interests of his country. Immediately after hearing the sad news I requested His Majesty^ Ambassador at Belgrade to be so good as to convey to the Government of Jugoslavia the deep sympathy of the Government and the people of Australia in the great national loss which that country had sustained. As a tribute to the memory of the deceased ruler, flags were flown at halfmast on Government buildings throughout Australia on Thursday last, 18th October, on the occasion of King Alexander's funeral. The sympathy of the members of this House will go out to Queen Marie and family, and to the Jugoslavian Government and people in the death of King Alexander.",29

83,Mr LYONS,DEATH OF KING," by leave- I move That we, the members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, express our profound sympathy with the people of France in the death of Monsieur Raymond Poincare, a former President of the Republic of France and one of her most eminent statesmen. The death of Monsieur Poincare occurred early last week, and I immediately conveyed through His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris a message of sympathy from the Government and the people of Australia. Monsieur Poincare was one of the foremost statesmen in the history of France. He was President of the Republic for a period of approximately seven years, commencing in 1913. His name will always be associated with the heroic sacrifices of France in the great European War during which time a tremendous responsibility, indeed, devolved upon the occupant of the office of President of the Republic. For many years before and subsequent to that period he served his country devotedly and with outstanding ability as Prime Minister, and in several other ministerial offices. As a tribute of respect, flags were flown at half-mast on government buildings throughout Australia on Saturday last on the occasion of the funeral of Monsieur Poincare. We extend to the people of France our deep sympathy in the demise of one who rendered such distinguished service in the interests of his country, and whose high reputation as a statesman was acknowledged throughout the world.",29

85,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEATH OF KING," The members of the Country party also wish to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), and with other members of Parliament, in carrying this resolution of sympathy, and in expressing our regret at the death of a great statesman. Monsieur Poincare demonstrated his courage and patriotism by coming back to the hurly-burly of politics after the strenuous war years, and though many may disagree with the solutions that he attempted of European problems, none will deny the sincerity of his efforts.",30
86,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OF KING," On behalf of the members of my party, I express our deep regret at the death of Monsieur Poincare, and we offer to his sorrowing relatives and friends our deepest sympathy. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. DEATH OF M. LOUIS BARTHOU.",30
87,Mr LYONS,DEATH OF KING," by leave- I move That an expression of the deep sympathy of the House of Representatives of the Parliaat ment of the Commonwealth of Australia be convej'ed to the Government of France in the death of Monsieur Louis Barthou, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Honourable members are aware that Monsieur Barthou had just met, on his arrival in France, His Majesty King Alexander of Jugoslavia, to whose regretted death I referred a few moments ago, and whose tragic fate he shared at the hands of the assassin. An expression of sympathy was immediately telegraphed by me on behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth. Monsieur Barthou, in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs, was actually engaged in duties connected with his important office, at the time of the sad occurrence. To the Government and the people of France the sympathy of the members of the House of Representatives is extended. The late Minister had been engaged in the public life of France for a period of 45 years, and had devoted himself wholeheartedly to the service of his country.",30
88,Mr SCULLIN,DEATH OF KING," I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), and with the other members of the House, in expressing regret at the assassination of Monsieur Barthou. I also profoundly regret that there are still, in this enlightened age, persons who deem it necessary to take human life in order to express their opinions. Fortunately, Australia has always been free from occurrences of this kind, and I trust that it will continue to be so.",30
89,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEATH OF KING," The members of the Country party desire to be associated with this motion of sympathy, and to express their horror at the assassination of this prominent Minister of State.",30
90,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OF KING," My party also desires to express its sympathy with the people of France in the death of Monsieur Barthou. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. DEATH OF HON. F. W. BAMFORD.",30

It is with feelings of deep regret that I refer to the death of Mr Bamford, which occurred in Sydney on the 10th September last. The late gentleman was a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament, and represented the division of Herbert continuously from 1901 until the expiration of the Ninth Parliament in 1925. He was Minister for Home Affairs for a short period in 1916-17. He served as a member of several royal commissions and parliamentary committees, and was Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker during his last two a half years of parliamentary service. places.

92,Mr SCULLIN,DEATH OF KING," I join with other members of the House in expressing my regret at the passing of the late Frederick Bamford, whom I had the privilege of knowing for many years. He was a member of this Parliament when I was first elected to it in 1910, and I can endorse everything that has been said regarding his genial personality. He was one of those who always preferred to do a kind action rather than offer an injury. Ho was attentive to his duties, and I can remember that, as Chairman of Committees, he carried out his work impartially and efficiently. I sincerely regret his death, and offer my sympathy, and that of my colleagues, to his widow in her loss.",31
93,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEATH OF KING," I desire to express the regret of members of my party at the death of the Honourable F. W. Bamford, and to join in the motion of sympathy with his family. He was a familiar figurein the public life of Australia ever since federation. Although a fearless exponent of what he believed to be right, the late honourable gentleman always expressed himself with such kindliness and good humour that he had scarcely an enemy. He was Chairman of Committees when I first entered this Parliament as a young man, and I was indebted to him for his advice on many matters of procedure.",31
94,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OF KING," The members of my party also desire to be associated with the motion of sympathy with the widow and relatives of the Honourable F. W. Bamford, and with the expressions of regret at his death. was not my privilege to know him perI sonally, but I have read of his career, and I believe that he was associated the Australian Labour party in its years. Question resolved in the affirmative, and honourable members standing in their and DEATH OF MR. JAMES MATHEWS.",31
95,Mr LYONS,DEATH OF KING," by leave- I move That this House expresses its great regret at the death of Mr James Mathews, a former member of the House of Representatives, records its appreciation of his zealous public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow in her bereavement. I regret to announce that Mr Mathews died in Melbourne on Tuesday last, 16th October. He, like the late Mr Bamford, was a member of the Commonwealth Parliament for a considerable period, having represented the division of Melbourne Ports, Victoria, in this House, from 1906 until the expiration of the Twelfth Parliament in 1931. He was Chairman of the Committee on the Causes of Death and Invalidity in the Commonwealth, in 1916-17, and a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works from 1917 to 1925. Mr Mathews was a very active member of th© House, and devoted 'himself most zealously to the discharge of his parliamentary duties. During the closing years of his parliamentary career, his health was considerably impaired, and those who were members of this House during that period are well aware of and admired his courageous efforts, despite his diminishing physical strength, to continue to carry out his duties as a representative of the electors. The late Mr Mathews was a man of high personal worth, and during a long parliamentary career he served Australia faithfully and well. To his widow we extend our deep sympathy in her loss.",31
96,Mr SCULIIN,DEATH OF KING," I support the Prime Minister in the motion expressing the regret of this Parliament at the passing of one of its former members. I sustained a great personal loss in the death of Mr James Mathews, who was a member of this House for 25 years, and with whom I was closely ""associated It for many years. In the course of my life do not think I shall ever meet a man for whom I shall have a higher regard. For with fifteen years the late Mr Mathews early suffered acutely without a murmer, courageously attending to his duties in this Parliament and outside of it, always suffering and always in pain. In extending our expression of sympathy to his widow, it would not be out of place for me to say that the devotion shown to him by his widow during the years of his illness has filled me with admiration.",31
97,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEATH OF KING," On behalf of the members of the Country party I desire to support the motion of sympathy moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons). When I first came into this Parliament the late Mr Mathews was a hale and hearty man, one of its foremost debaters and a shrewd interjector. We saw him bear a long and painful illness uncomplainingly and with the most gallant heroism and courage. I am sure that the sympathy of every member of this House must go out to his widow in her loss.",32
98,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OF KING," It is perfectly natural that we approach a discussion of this motion of sympathy perhaps more feelingly when it is able extended to the relatives of a man whom we have known personally. In this case it was my privilege to know the late Mathews. When I first came into this House it was a pitiful sight to witness his sufferings. His illness was, I think, the result of the toll which the ance of his duties exacted from him, and of the nervous strain imposed upon him over a long period of years in this Parlialate ment. His time has come, and he has now gone into the Great Beyond. He will remembered by many for the part he took in the fight in the interests of struggling humanity. We desire to associate selves with this motion of sympathy his sorrowing widow.",32
99,Mr MAKIN,DEATH OF KING," I desire to express my regret at the passliamentary ing of one of the dearest and best esteem friends I have ever had. The late Mathews was a most genial, generous kind-hearted man. As the recipient of many kindnesses at his hands, when I first became a'member of this House, I parwas ticularly desire to pay a personal tribute to one of the very best men it has ever been my priviNo lege to meet as a colleague in public life. I shotild also like to say that, during long illness, the late Mr Mathews derived the greatest comfort from his knowledge of the high esteem in which he was held by the members of this Parliament, with which he had been so actively associated. His public life was the exemplification of the highest standard attained in politics. With other honourable members. I join in expressing my very deep regret at the passing of one who proved himself worthy of the greatest esteem, and we extend to his widow and other relatives who mourn his loss our deep sympathy.",32
100,Mr LAZZARINI,DEATH OF KING," I desire personally to associate myself with the motion of sympathy moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), at the death of the late Mr Mathews. In my early association with this House, as a young man, I found Mr Mathews always ready to help a new member and to show him "" the ropes."" He was one of those kindly, genial souls who endeared himself to all who knew him, and Australia suffered a great loss when his health became so impaired that he was no longer to attend the sittings of the Parliament. My most pleasing memories of my early political life in this Parliament Mr surround my associations with the late honourable gentleman. I join with the motion expressing the deepest regret at his passing, and sympathy with those who performare left behind to mourn him.",32
101,Dr MALONEY,DEATH OF KING," The Mr Mathews was my friend, mate and comrade from the time he first came be into this House, and for many years before he entered it. He never broke a pledge, nor did he refuse to give help ourto another if he were able to with give it. He was steadfast and true to every plank of the platform of his party, never failing to respond when he was called upon. No man in parlife was ever held in higher by his constituents and his friends Mr than was the late honourable member and for Melbourne Ports. His constituents knew ful l well that he would carry out his duties, and did not fail him when he no longer able to take his seat in Parliament owing to the contraction of a most unfortunate and painful disease. woman could have nursed an invalid with greater care, and no one could have his been. more assiduous in her task than the widow of the late honourable member. He has gone down to the deep dust preferring the ashes of cremation to the mouldering of the clay. I believe if there is another world he will be there to welcome his friends, for he had the capacity of making many friends, who not only loved him, but also held him in the highest esteem.",32

Sir Edgeworth David, a notable figure in Australia, passed away in Sydney the 28th August last. He was widely known-indeed , far beyond Australiafor his eminent services in the cause science and of exploration. Despite advanced age, he volunteered for service in the Great War, and during his active service in Prance his special knowledge and great experience were invaluable to the Australian and British forces. He was a man of outstanding intellect, charming personality, and his remarkable record of scientific achievement entitles him to rank high among those who rendered very distinguished service to Australia. As a tribute to Sir Edgeworth David's great public services, the Commonwealth Government associated itself with the Government of New South Wales in the State funeral which was accorded him. To his widow and family we tender our - I deep sympathy in their bereavement.",33
104,Mr SCULLIN,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH, On behalf of the Opposition I support the motion that has been moved by the Bight Honourable,33
105,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH," I am glad to have the opportunity to assomyself with the motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister, expressing regret at the passing of my old teacher and personal friend, Professor with David. Probably no person in the Commonwealth has done more for the Sydney University, for New South Wales, and for Australia, than the late Professor on David. The knowledge that he possessed of the subjects which he taught, and the very practical interest that he displayed in all his students, made him an ideal teacher. He afterwards stimulated many famous men into doing wonderfully good work. When he first came to Australia he carried out a geological survey of New South Wales, which resulted in the discovery of the great seam of coal that brought into being the mines at Maitland and Cessnock which today are maintainthe coal industry of Australia. Subsequently he carried out in the Pacific and disat the South Pole very extensive work which is of invaluable scientific interest. When well past middle age he helped to organize in the ranks of engineering students throughout Australia, a tunnelon ling corps which saw active service in France. On the battle front he was an of inspiration to every one who came into his contact with him. During the whole of his lifetime there was no physical or moral evil that he did not endeavour to combat. He also found time to take an interest in every philanthropic work that lay close to his hand.

109,Mr BEASLEY,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH,"What stage has been reached regarding the royal comfields, mission's inquiry into the oil and petrol industry? Is the Government prepared to allow the commission to continue its inquiries, seeing that it has occupied very considerable time already, and not arrived at its decision, or has the Government any information to convey to the House?",34
110,Mr LYONS,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH,"The Government, havthe ing set up the royal commission, and given it certain powers to investigate matters which have been referred to it, cannot dictate as to when it shall conrepresentations clude its sittings', but we are anxious that its report shall be furnished as soon as possible. We are somewhat disbefore appointed that the report has not yet been received, but we hope that it will come to hand in the near future. TRADE TREATIES.",34
111,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH,"In view of the disturbed condition of the wool market, as indicated by the great withdrawals wool from offering, will the Prime Minister indicate with what countries the Government is at present negoperiments tiating trade treaties, and whether there is any prospect of finalizing the treaties during the present wool season?",34
112,Mr LYONS,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH,"I think that it is fairly generally known that the Government is negotiating at the present time with the object of securing trade treaties with Belgium and Italy, but we intend to continue our negotiations with other countries also. As indicated in the Governor General's Speech, an outstanding feature of the policy of the Government is the establishment of trade treaties with the object of increasing, if possible, and, at any rate, maintaining, the markets that exist for our primary products. It is imthe possible for the Government to indicate any particular time when it is hoped that these treaties will be concluded. We are pushing on with the negotiations as rapidly as possible, and I hope in regard to one of these countries, at any rate, to to be able in the next few days to make an I announcement that satisfactory trading be arrangements have been completed. OIL FROM COAL.",34
113,Mr JAMES,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH,"In view of the Prima Minister's promise in March last, when he visited the northern coaland the reiteration of that promise in his policy speech, that immediate steps would be taken to erect a hydrogenation plant for the extraction of oil a from coal, is there any truth in the pubhas lished statement that the Government does not now propose to proceed with the erection of that plant for twelve months ?",34
114,Mr LYONS,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH,"I have never stated that Government would immediately proceed with the erection of such a plant. I the pointed out-and I think that'the honourable member knows it-afte r hearing the of deputations from the coal-fields, that certain experiments had to be carried out by an English company we would be justified in setting up such a plant in Australia; but I indicated that I would be prepared to consult the other members of the Ministry, particularly the Minister controlling the department, and the department itself.",34
115,Mr GREGORY,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH,And the Parliament ?,34
116,Mr LYONS,DEATH OP SIB EDGEWOBTH,"The matter will have of to come to the Parliament finally. It was necessary to consider whether it would be possible to carry out such exin Australia simultaneously with those undertaken in England. I find that the cost of such a proposition precludes its adoption; but we are not losing any time so far as the investigations are concerned, and I can assure the honourable member that all possible steps will bo taken in order to attain success, which we hope will lead to the employment of, at any rate, a number of men on the coal-fields, where unemployment now so severe. NA AUSTRALIA. Mr M : AKIN - Will the AttorneyCurrency General state whether the Commonwealth Government has made a reply to the case that has been submitted by Western Australia to the Privy Council on the subject of its secession from the Commonwealth? Does the Government intend to present a case from its own point of view, and if so, who is likely to repreter sent Australia at the hearing ?",34
117,Mr MENZIES,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"The honourable ber's question raises matters of policy which have yet to be finally determined by the Government, but which will no doubt be decided at the earliest possible moment. DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIA. Mr E. F. HARRISON - Will the Prime Minister inform me whether the Government will take advantage of the presence in Australia of Field-Marshal Lord Milne and Sir Maurice Hankey to consulted; seek advice from them in regard to a suitable defence for Australia?",35
118,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Subjec t to the right of the Australian Parliament and Governbe ment to decide what would be adequate defences of Australia, the Government will, without any hesitation, consult with the gentlemen named because of their wide knowledge of the subject. POLL OF DAIRY PRODUCERS.",35
119,Mr R GREEN,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Is the Minister for Oommerce in a position to make an official announcement of the result of the poll of dairy producers taken on the l l t instant, under the provisions of the Dairy Produce Act 1933? If he cannot give the final figures, is he able to make announcement whatever respecting the poll?",35
120,Mr STEWART,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"The figures are available, and disclose an overwhelming majority in favour of the continuation of the existing legislation. "" FIAT "" MONEY.",35
121,Mr LAZZARINI,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Will the Prime Minister inform me under what authority is or statute, the Commonwealth Bank issues "" fiat"" money in Australia 1",35
122,Mr CASEY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"If I understand the honourable member's question aright, the action is taken under the Banks and Act; but, if he will be good enough to place his question on the notice paper, preferably with a little more detail as to what he desires to know, I shall furnish him with a fuller reply. MIGRATION.",35
123,Mr MAKIN,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Will the Prime Minisinform me whether it is the intention of the Government, as has been reported, memto consult Mr Malcolm MACDonald, Under-Secretary for the Dominions, on the subject of migration while he is in Australia? If so, will the Government give the House a full opportunity to review any agreement or suggestion that may be made in connection with the matter, in view of the very great number of unemployed people in this country?",35
124,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I say without hesitation that, if any agreement were proposed on this subject, Parliament would have to be but I also say, quite definitely, that the Government has no desire whatever to encourage migration while unemployment is so severely felt in Australia. Further than that, even though we might prepared to discuss this subject with Mr MACDonald, he has made it perfectly clear, in a public statement, that, in view of the existing conditions, he has no proposition of any kind to make on it. The Government has no present intention of entering into any arrangement of the kind referred to by the honourable member; but I hope that at some time in the future it will be possible, in the interests of Australia, to provide once again for h migration by people from the other side of the world to Australia. In the immediate future there is no intention of any encouraging anything of the kind. WHEAT COMMISSION.",35
125,Mr HAWKER,SECESSION OF WESTERN,Can the Prim« Minister give nve any indication of when he expects to receive the final report of the Wheat Commission?,35
126,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I understand that certain information in regard to the suggested allocation of the amount to which the Parliament is already committed in respect of the coming season's crop should be available about the middle of November. The final report of the commission may be expected in January, or early in the n'ext calendar year. GALVANIZED IRON.",36
127,Mr NOCK,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Will the Minister for Trade and Customs state the reasons why discrimination has been shown against certain persons in the granting of licences for the importation of galvanized iron? Some persons have been allowed to import under licence, and others have not been allowed to do so during the present short- investigated. age of supplies.",36
128,Mr WHITE,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Owing to labour troubles and renewed building activity, there is a shortage of galvanized iron in Australia, and for that reason importations to ""the extent of approximately 13,000 tons have been permitted under by-law. Persons who were known to be regular buyers of galvanized iron were granted licences. If the honourable member knows of any persons previously regular buyers of galvanized iron who have been refused licences I shall be glad if he will bring their names under my notice.",36
129,Mr JAMES,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"In view of the fact that the duty on galvanized iron was lifted, due to industrial troubles in the Newcastle district, and as that trouble is now over and normal supplies of iron are being made available, is it the intention of the Minister to re-impose the duty on galvanized iron entering Australia?",36
130,Mr WHITE,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"The duty on galvanized iron was not lifted. A quota of approxition, mately 13,000 tons was permitted to imported under by-law until the 31st honourable members. January, in order that the rural industries and the building industry would not be further inconvenienced. Production in Australia has not yet overtaken the demand, but new works will shortly be entering into production and it is hoped that this increased production, and the overseas supplies of galvanized iron, will result in overcoming the present shortage.",36
131,Mr NOCK,SECESSION OF WESTERN,I do not think the Minister understood my last question. He said that permits to import galvanized iron had been issued to regular trading persons. I desire to know why have permits been refused to persons other than those who buy their iron from regular trading persons? Every member of the community expects to receive equal treatment from the Government.,36
132,Mr WHITE,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Surely the honourable member does not wish me to believe that the ordinary farmer imports his iron from overseas. It is the wholesale merchants who have bought from overseas. If any merchant has not obtained his quota of the quantity permitted to be imported, and the honourable member will place the facts before me, I shall have the matter FARMERS' DEBT ADJUSTMENT.",36
133,Mr CURTIN,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Will the Prime Minister inform me whether a special committee has been sitting, and has furnished a report, confidential or otherwise, to the Government in regard to the problem of farmers' debts in Australia? If such a committee has been sitting, what are the names of the members of it ? If such a report has been presented to the Government, will it be made available to honourable members before any matters arising out of it are placed before the House for consideration ?",36
134,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"No special committee has been set up to deal with this subject, but the Government has sought advice upon it from those whom it felt to be competent to give such advice. This advice was obtained for the benefit of Cabinet, and no formal reports on it have been submitted. When the subject is placed before Parliament for considerasuch information as the Government be has upon it will be made available to SALES TAX BONDS.",36
135,Mr THORBY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,Is the Prime Minister prepared seriously to consider the advisableness of introducing legislation to amend the sales tax acts with the object of eliminating the unnecessary provisions for the furnishing of sales tax bonds?,36
136,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I cannot give the honourable member any assurance in regard to this subject, which he has raised on previous occasions. When consideration is 'being given to sales tax legislation, the Government will discuss the advisablenesa or otherwise of retaining the provisions relating to bondsThat is the only assurance I can give the honourable member on the subject. RURAL REHABILITATION all SCHEME.",37
137,Mr FORDE,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"In view of the large number of anxious inquiries being made by primary producers in straitened circumstances as to when they are likely to obtain assistance under the promised £20,000,000 rehabilitation scheme which the Government has undertaken to set in operation, and in regard to which promises were made before the last election, will the Prime Minister make a statement on the subject, and indicate when definite relief measures will be taken?",37
138,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I have never committed the Government to any particular sum in this regard. We have admitted the necessity for giving real and substantial relief to - primary producers who are in difficulties, and, as indicated in the Governor General's Speech, we shall lose no time in dealing with the subject. It will be necessary to consult each State overnment in regard to the matter, ecause each State will have its own peculiar difficulties. The Government has no power to deal with the subject without consultation with the State governments. The Loan Council will meet on Mondav and Tuesday, and possibly on Wednesday of next week, in Canberra, and this opportunity which is the earliest available will be taken to consult with the State governments on the subject. WAR SERVICE HMS.",37
139,Mr JAMES,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Is the Minister administering War Service Homes aware of the harsh treatment that is being meted out by the War Service Homes Commission to returned soldier occupants of homes who are being evicted because of arrears in their payments, and is he aware of the persecution and prosecution to which these people are being subjected after they .have been evicted? If be is aware of these things, will he state whether it is the intention of the Government to allow such an iniquitous policy to be pursued ?",37
140,Mr FRANCIS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"No housing scheme in any other paTt of the British Empire is as liberal as that devised by the Commonwealth Government to assist the occupiers of war service homes. From the date that the report of the committee of inquiry was presented to this House, that a soldier has had to do has been to pay such sums as his income permits him to pay as recommended by the Committee of Inquiry. Any person who complies with those liberal terms can remain in his home in complete security until August of next year subject to recommendation 4. From all branches of the returned soldiers' organization throughout Australia, expressions of appreciation have been received by the Government regarding the manner in which the War Service Homes Department is being administered. TOBACCO-GROWING INDUSTRY.",37
141,Mr THOMPSON,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Seeing that the Minister for Trade and Customs visited my electorate during the recent election campaign and met a large number of tobacco-growers from whom he obtained first-hand information regarding the case for Australian tobacco-growers, is he now prepared to meet representatives of the Australian Tobacco Growers Association to discuss proposals for placing the tobacco industry on a sound footing?",37
142,Mr WHITE,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I am very glad that the honourable member asked that question, because, when I visited Tamworth, the honourable member was not present, so that I had to give to the growers whom I met there the information which I am about to disclose, instead of giving it to him. The growers, including representatives of the Australian Tobacco Growers Association, of which the honourable member is president, were represented at a conference held in Melbourne to discuss the needs of the industry, and at that conference a resolution was carried conveying a vote of thanks to the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company for its generous buying policy, which was far better than the growers expected, and, on behalf of the growers, the mover wished to express their keen appreciation. That conference was arranged at the wish the honourable member, as expressed in this House. The fact that the growers are able to sell good tobacco, this year a reasonable price, and that there is gradual turnover from the production poorer grades to better grades, indicates that the policy of the Government is at some time or other? sound. If the honourable member would like a further conference to be heldand there bave already been two or three at his request,- I shall be delighted meet the representatives of the growers if he will bring them together.

I now ask a the Prime Minister whether the matter of is still merely under consideration, or whether it is proposed to take some action",38
150,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"It would be easy to take some action, but that would not be the to same as guaranteeing a beneficial effect as the result of it. The matter is still under consideration. It is essential, if we are to take action of an effective kind, that there shall be co-operation between the governments of Great Britain, New Zealand, and the Commonwealth. We have been in consultation the governments of Great Britain and of New Zealand for a considerable time. Only recently we received an intimation from the Government of New Zealand that two Ministers would visit Australia in a few days' time to confer the Commonwealth Government on various matters, and this subject of - foreign subsidized shipping will then Governreceive urgent consideration. indiINTERFERENCE WITH WIRELESS RECEPTION.",38

154,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I with that. Efforts have been made alleviate the position by conciliatory means. Departmental officers have been sent out to ask that steps be taken to abate the interference. The department has been reluctant to suggest that legislation be passed, because such legislation would have a far-reaching effect upon matters other than broadcasting reception. I shall bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the complaint voiced by the honourable member, and I can give him an assurance that further consideration will be given to the matter, because I know that it has been constantly under the notice of the department.

178,Mr GREGORY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Swan) [5.52] - I move That the honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) be appointed Chairman of Committees of this House. The occupant of this office requires a great deal of parliamentary experience, and an even temperament, as well as a good knowledge of the Standing Orders. The honourable member for Forrest has been a member of this Parliament for the past fifteen years, and for over twelve years has been a Temporary Chairman of Committees. I think it will be admitted that he is eminently fitted for the position, and would act most impartially. I can commend him to the House with a good deal of confidence, for he has all the necessary attributes of a successful Chairman. I am sure he will endeavour, if chosen, to do justice to every section of the House.",42
179,Mr THOMPSON,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"New England) [5.54] - I have pleasure in seconding the motion. The honourable member for  known to all of us. Apart from his long parliamentary experience and his knowledge of parliamentary procedure, he has the greatest of all qualifications for a judicial position- a calm and placid temperament. He is not likely to be bustled by any scenes that mav take place, and I think every honourable member will agree that he will 'be fair and impartial in his decisions, being uninfluenced in them by his political views. The House would make a wise choice in choosing the honourable member for this position, and, perhaps, next to yourself, Mr. Speaker, be will prove, I feel sure, our most distinguished Chairman of Committees.",42
180,Mr ROSEVEAR,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Dalley) [5.56] - We have heard the merits of the honourable  extolled; but I think that the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) would have entertained us better if he had referred to the merits of the pact as the result of which the honourable member for Forrest was selected as the Government's nominee for this position. This office is usually the gift of the Government to one of its favoured supporters; it is one of the perquisites that are l'egarded as spoils to the victors. On this occasion the Government has been returned with a following of 32 in a House of 74 members. Therefore, at the moment, we have minority government. If it had not been for the fact that the Government feared an embarrassing situation over the Speaker ship and the - Chairmanship of Committees, I have not the least doubt that the splendid qualities of the honourable member for Forrest would have been unnoticed and remained unsung. But the Government has formed a pact with the Country party, and the position of Chairman of Committees is one of the gifts that permitted the bargain to be struck. I give the honourable member for Forrest his due. I say nothing against his qualifications for the position, nor do I question his fairness. In the last Parliament he occupied the position of Temporary Chairman of Committees as well as did any other honourable member. Nor do I doubt his honesty or political sincerity; but it is evident that the Country party is making preparations for stormy scenes on tariff questions since it submitted the name of the honourable member for Forrest as its nominee for this position. Presumably it is desired that his well known fiscal views shall be stifled when tariff matters are under discussion in. committee. This is another pact such as that entered into in December, 1931, when the Country party and the Government formulated a common policy upon which they were to fight the [3] elections. They won a majority of seats in this House, and for months afterwards they charged one another with a breach of faith and with treachery to the pact. There was open rivalry at the last elections between the aspirants for seats between the Country party and the United Australia party.",43
181,Mr SPEAKER,SECESSION OF WESTERN,Hon. 0. J. Bell) The honourable member's remarks have no reference to the motion before the Chair.,43
182,Mr ROSEVEAR,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I was leading up to the point that the proposed appointment of the honourable member for Forrest to the position of Chairman of Committees is more a matter of convenience than a desire to recognize his personal merits. Since the elections further negotiations have taken place, and a sordid struggle behind closed doors has occurred between the leaders of the Country party and the United Australia party for positions in the Cabinet. The whole of the press was able to tell the people, before this Parliament had assembled, that these negotiations were proceeding, and that the only serious difference of opinion was due to the ""snavelling"" for ofiice, the Country party trying to obtain more portfolios than the United Australia party was prepared to concede. Yet the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) declared that his party was placing principles before place I No sooner had the negotiations broken down than the imminent meeting of Parliament, indicated the possibility of an unpleasant situation arising, in which, by a combination of parties, the United Australia party candidates for the speakership and the chairmanship of committees might be defeated. Consequently, another secret conference between the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) and the Leader of the Country party was arranged, with the result that last night, before this House had an opportunity to discuss the merits or otherwise of the honourable member for Forrest, or, indeed, of any other honourable member for the position of Chairman of Committees, the Sydney Sun was able to announce that the way was clear for the election of a Speaker and a Chairman of Committees. That newspaper statedI t is now certain that Mr O. J. Bell will be the new Speaker in the House of Representatives. Following the Country party'a decision today not to nominate a candidate, the Leader (Dr Earle Page) had a conference with the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons). It was agreed that the Country party would support the United Australia party nominee who will be Mr Bell. He was Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament - The Country party will nominate Mr J. H. Prowse as Chairman of Committees, and this will be supported by the Government party. The two parties together can outvote a Labour nomination in either case. The question before the House is not the merits of the honourable member for Forrest, but rather how best to save the Government from an embarrassing position. The press tells us that the way is now clear. We in this House are concerned to know how the way was made clear; we should know what transpired at the secret conference held behind closed doors. Are we to understand that the compromise in regard to the Speakership and the Chairmanship of Committees is only the first step towards a pact by which the Country party will sell the primary producers of Australia to vested interests represented by the United Australia party? It is idle to attempt to make the House believe that the two gentlemen who have advocated the claims of the honourable member for Forrest for appointment as Chairman of Committees have done so because they were impressed by his outstanding qualifications for the position. Rafher is it a case of political expediency in which the fitness of the nominee weighs not at all with the Government or those who support the nomination. The Country party is not game to share the responsibility of government by entering into a coalition with the United Australia party. It wants pickings without responsibility. Knowing that trade crises are likely to arise, it is afraid to accept the responsibility associated with them, yet is prepared to share the pickings of office. In the light of what has happened, what are we to think of the professions of the right honourable member for Cowper, who indignantly left a previous conference with the Prime Minister declaring that the Country party was concerned only with policy, and was looking not for office, but for principles ? To-day, the right honourable gentleman sells the Country party by compromising in regard to the Speakership and the Chairmanship of Committees. In making Mr Rosevear. these remarks, I do not desire to reflect on the qualifications of the honourable member for Forrest for the position for which he has been nominated. But I shall not allow to pass unchallenged the suggestion that he had been nominated solely because of his fitness for the position to which he will doubtless be elevated. I do not know that theTe will be any opposition to his nomination. Such opposition would be futile. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that members of this House should say whether the nomination is based on the qualifications of the nominee or is merely a case of political expediency.",43
183,Mr BRENNAN,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Batman) [6.5] - I do not desire to say anything in opposition to the appointment of-the honourable  Chairman of Committees, the more so as I apprehend that the chances of my appointment to the position are almost incalculably remote. Looking about me, I see in this chamber a number of men who, by some means, entered this chamber during my furlough. One member, who is, however, not new to me is the honourable member for Forrest for whom I have only the friendliest of feelings. On one occasion in my callow youth-no t recently- I made a speech on the tariff, of which the honourable member for Forrest approved. That was many years ago, but I feel there is some connection between the circumstances of that time and my defeat at the poll. In my felicitations to the honourable gentleman,. I am concerned only with his pronounced views on tariff matters. It would appear somewhat difficult to reconcile those views with the Speech which we heard today from the representative of the King. That being so, inasmuch as he is the chosen of this protectionist Government and party, I would like to know, for the security of the country and the peace of mind of honourable members generally, whether an undertaking has been obtained, under bond and seal, that the honourable member will not, during this Parliament, make any further speeches upon the tariff. If that practical course has 'been taken, I can conceive of some real service being done to the country by this election, and such a service done to my electors and to me as will greatly benefit my electors and make further secure my seat in this House. I congratulate the honourable member in intelligent anticipation of his speedy and painless election.",44
184,Mr LAZZARINI,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Werriwa) ([6.8] I , like other honourable members who have spoken on this motion, have nothing whatever to say against the qualifications of the honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), or his capabilities for filling the position of Chairman of Committees. But it is too much to ask honourable members to accept, as just one of those bolts from the blue, a proposal by the strongest and most uncompromising free trader in this Parliament, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), that an almost equally strong free trader, the honourable member for Forrest, shall be appointed Chairman of Committees-for if he is put in the chair he will be isolated from the discussion, of the tariff, most of which will take place in committee under his chairmanship, and he will not be able to vote upon the issues raised. There is somethinig moTe in it than that. When the position is analysed it seems to me that this action, involving a member of the purely free trade and uncompromising Country party, following as it does upon the uncompromising attitude of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), is nothing more than an opportionment of the loaves and fishes. If this is done, the big guns of the Country party will have turned out to be guncrackers in some cases, and squibs in others. If it is an indication that the alliance that has already been spoken of will actually take place it is an example of coming events casting their shadows ' before them. I contend, Mr. Speaker, that it cannot be reconciled with the action of certain honourable gentlemen in their adherence to party alignments right up to this moment. When we recall the political history of this country in this our National Parliament and in the State Parliaments, we find it has always been recognized by all parties that one of the greatest acts of political treachery a member of one party can commit is to accept office under another party.",45
185,Mr SPEAKER,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Hon. G. J. Bell) Order. The honourable member's word "" treachery "" is not in order.",45
186,Mr LAZZARINI,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I withdraw that word. I said that this principle has always been recognized, and if you say that I am out of order, I withdraw it. We know that the Parliament of New South Wales was almost torn asunder, and the sittings of that House made impossible because of an action similar to this. It has always been recognized that a member allies himself with the party under which he seeks election. In my opinion, such an action as this goes very near to causing the people to lose faith in the honesty and integrity of their representatives in Parliament. A man goes to the country and swears by all the gods in heaven that with the party to which he is then allied he will destroy the other faction should his party get the opportunity to do so; but when he is returned, and is offered a position involving extra pay or privilege or standing, all his pledges are thrown overboard, and his promises to the electors forgotten. He no longer cares whether the Government carries out its policy or not. It is clearly the intention of the Government to take the honourable member for Forrest off the floor and put him into the chair so that he will be unable to exercise his vote in furtherance of the promises he made at the election. Honourable members should not countenance such action as the Government has taken in this matter. If I had the opportunity, I would show my disapproval by my vote, .but as I have not such an opportunity, I am doing it through my voice. The action taken by the honourable gentleman indicates a complete surrender on his part, and, so far as the members of his party are concerned, it is only one more of their sham fights. Another big gun turns out to be not even a gun cracker, but a squib.",45
187,Mr GARDEN,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Cook) [6.12] - I do not agree with the statements made by my colleagues for I am fully convinced that the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), since the election, after making his declaration before the people that the world-wide markets for the primary produce of this country had materialized at last, has found out that his message of salvation for the farmers along that path was wrong. He and his party are now converted, and they have joined hands with the United Australia party because the problems facing the 'primary producers of ' this country exceed their intelligence. They ate unable to cope with them. I understand from the remarks of honourable members that the honourable member who has 'been proposed as Chairman of Committees will make one of the ablest chairmen who have ever been appointed; but that does not justify those who pose in this House as the saviours of the primary producers in selling their constituents to the very interests which have been farming the farmers all their lives. No doubt, these elected representatives of the primary producers who have taken 'part in the making of this bargain will later go out and tell the same old story to the farmers once again.",45
188,Mr THOKBT,SECESSION OF WESTERN,Is that what the honourable member did at the Bathurst conference?,46
189,Mr GARDEN,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"No , at the Bathurst conference I put forward a constructive policy for the wheat-growers, the wool growers, and the citrus fruit-growers, and, at the conclusion of the conference, the representatives of those industries placed on record in a hand-book dealing with the work of the conference an expression of opinion that J. S. Garden should be thanked for the information, which he had given them. The resolution, as moved by the vice-chairman of the Country party in New South Wales",46

197,Mr JAMES,SECESSION OF WESTERN,Yes . Mere courtesy should dictate a more considerate policy in regard to the hearing of a speech by a new member. I think that the protection of the Chair should be extended to him.,46
198,Mr SPEAKER,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Regardin g the point of order raised by the Prime Minister, the remarks of the honourable member for Cook appear to me to have no relation to the question now before the Chair, and I must ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the question that  mittees.",46
199,Mr GARDEN,SECESSION OF WESTERN,I bow to your ruling. I am aware that the Prime Minister has no desire that I should reveal the nature of the pact entered into between himself and the leader of the Country party.,46

208,Mr GARDEN,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I believe that the country people of the Commonwealth will be staggered at the sudden and complete conversion of the honourable member for Forrest. A pact has been entered into whereby a man, whose expressed opinions have always been directly opposed to the principles enunciated by the Prime Minister, has been elevated to a position of dignity by favour of the Prime Minister and his followers. To me the conversion of the honourable member for Forrest is welcome, because, if it is real, it indicates that he is on the right track at last. It indicates that, in his opinion, Australia must look after itself, that it must protect its primary and secondary producers even to the extent of completely prohibiting those things",46

His election reminds me of a man who said his horse had won a race oasily; it was the only horse entered. I hope that the honourable member, in the exercise of his powers as Chairman of Committees, will be merciful to honourable members on this side. I have listened to the eulogies expressed regarding his capacity as a chairman, and some of the virtues to which reference has been made. I have not hitherto discovered; yet I believe that he has the qualifications necessary for the office to which he has been appointed. The honourable member has been chosen for an important position, and I sincerely congratulate him.",49

The members of the Country party generally join in the congratulations, and assure the honourable member of their support.",49
228,Mr BEASLEY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"West Sydney) [6.44]. - I approach this matter from a different angle from that chosen by previous speakers. Their congratulations are centered upon what has happened in this chamber, but I consider that the straight course to take is to congratulate the honand orable member on being the successful candidate inside the Country party room, following the pact entered into with the ability. Government, for that is where the decision was made. So far as this House was concerned, the election was a purely formal matter; honourable members had little or no voice in determining it. I am of the opinion that the time is ripe for those outside Parliament to know Wednesday, exactly the nature of the negotiations, influences, and pacts which control the business of this House, for then they would be better able to appreciate the measure of democracy which exists in this country. I congratulate the honor on securing nomination within the party room, following the - arrangement successfully negotiated by his leader with the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons). I have no criticism to offer regarding his fitness for the position of Chairman of Committees; on the contrary, I freely admit that, when on previous occasions he occupied the chair temporarily, he exercised commendable impartiality. I have no personal animus against the honourable gentleman, for I believe that he will fill the office with credit to himself and to the Parliament, and that he will exercise sound judgment when dealing with those who in this place desire to express their views. I hope that during his occupancy of the chair the honourable member will not be influenced by any arrangement or pact which may yet be entered into. I do not think that he will be so influenced, for I believe that he has sufficient strength of character to follow the course which he believes to be right. If he does that, there will be no cause for complaint when his term of office expires.  I would like to congratulate you, sir, on your elevation to the Speakership of this House- a position which you well deserve, and one which I am confident you will fill with credit to yourself and to the Parliament. I thank the mover and the seconder of my nomination as Chairman of Committees, and other honourable members for their congratulations. I appreciate the confidence which my fellow members have placed in me, can only say that, in the exercise of my duties, I shall endeavour to act with strict impartiality and to the best of my SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT.",49
229,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [6.48] - I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until the 31st October, at 3 o'clock p.m. The object of the adjournment is to provide that there shall be no formal sitting of the Parliament during the presence in Canberra of His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester - It is true that tomorrow an address from both Houses of the Parliament will be presented to His Royal Highness, but it is thought advisable that Parliament should not sit for. the transaction of ordinary business until Wednesday week.",49
230,Mr BEASLEY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"West Sydney) [6.49]. - Honourable members would be assisted in their work if the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) would indicate the nature of business to be transacted when Parliament resumes. According to press reports, there is to be a further adjournment after that now proposed, following which Parliament will sit four days instead of three days each week, until the business of the first period of the session has been completed. If we can have an indication of that character it will help us arrange our own personal affairs approfrom priately.",50
231,Mr GREGORY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Swan) [6.51] wish to say a few words in regard to recent methods of doing the business this chamber. When I look back on our experience of the last two years, I am filled with the greatest distaste for repetition of them. We have had long adjournments of Parliament followed periods of rush business when honourable members have had to sit here night after night for unreasonably protracted hours to get through the business programme. In view of the fact that within the next few months we shall have to deal with vitally important questions affecting agriculture in Australia, I urge that should take up the business in a reasonwhom able way. I shall offer no objection to an adjournment of the House until next Wednesday, but from that time the tice, sittings should be continuous until have dealt with at least the most importhere tant items of business that await our consideration. There is no justification for an adjournment of Parliament for whole of the week after next.",50
232,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,SECESSION OF WESTERN,Wha about those who wish to join in the bourne centenary celebrations?,50
233,Mr GREGORY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,Shal l we have similar adjournments for the centenaries of the other States?,50
234,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Yes , when they come round.",50
235,Mr GREGORY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"I contend that the excessively long hours of numerous parliamentary sitting days in the last year or two have been absolutely discreditable. I do not wish to see any more such sitting days if they can be avoided. I trust that if the Government has decided to ask Parliament to adjourn for the whole of the week after next it will reconsider its decision, and make provision for us the to proceed without unnecessary interruption with certain work that should be done as speedily as possible.",50
236,Mr MULCAHY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Lang) [6.53] - Per sonally, I object to any adjournment of the sittings of this House while important business awaits our attention. There are, throughout Australia, hundreds of to thousands of people who do not know where their next meal will come, and the Government has given us no indication that it intends to provide work I for these people who are today unthe employed. During the election camof paign, many promises were made to old age and invalid pensioners, and in view of the fact that the festive season is rapidly a approaching the Government should take immediate steps to give effect to those by promises. Consideration should also be given to the needs of many returned soldiers who before they went to the war were promised the earth by certain honourable gentlemen now sitting on the front bench opposite. There are, in my electorate, between 3,000 and 4,000 returned soldiers, nearly 80 per cent, of whom are we out of employment, and 40 per cent, of are suffering from the effects of their war service. These men are looking to the Government for a measure of jusparticularly through the repatriation we and pension departments. I suppose is scarcely 1 per cent, of the men who saw four or five years' service overseas who are not suffering in some way the from the effects of the war. These men also are entitled to special consideration from tha Government. It is at fact- I have had several cases submitted Melto me which have been substantiated by medical evidence-that these men are entitled to pensions, but because the Repatriation Commission has been so heartless, apparently carrying out the policy laid down by the Government, they have no redress. While those conditions exist, I say that it is the duty of the Government to carry on and to attend to the immediate cares of those people who cannot help themselves.",50
237,Mr JAMES,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Hunter) [6.56] - I canthat not let the motion go without entering my protest against it. The honourable member for Lang (Mr Mulcahy) referred to certain cases. Tbere are also many in my own electorate. With all respect to the answer given by the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) to a question asked by me this afternoon, I want to say he did not indicate very clearly that it was the Government's intention to do something to relieve the position on coal-fields. In my electorate he met approximately 1,500 youths, whose ages ranged from fourteen to 21 years, who had never done a day's work. He certainly indicated to a deputation that he was sympathetic with these boys, and that the Government would do something with the object of relieving the position, particulatitude larly on the coal-fields. But all that been done has been the appointment of committee, and that committee has made a preliminary report in which it has cated that it is necessary for a hydrogenapropose tion plant to be set up in Victoria in the brown coal-fields. The tremendous influso ence which can be brought to bear Victorian interests on the Government these matters is evidenced by the that they can hold up the erection of plant in the northern district for pose of considering whether Victoria not a more suitable place for such a plant. Analyses show that there is more oil content in coal procured in northern New South Wales than there is in coal procurable in any other part of the that world.",51
238,Mr SPEAKER,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Order ! The honortbat able gentleman has scarcely given any reasons why there should not be in an adjournment to a certain date, which is the question now before the House.",51
239,Mr JAMES,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Whil e there is so much business to be done by this House, and while there are so many people in dire 1.4] distress, this House should not adjourn. If we are to believe press reports the Government intends to meet for only five weeks and then adjourn for a period of six months while the Prime Minister and others have a pleasant jaunt overseas, and while the unemployed are left to remain workless. Promises were made to the unemployed people of this country a prosperity loan would be raised for the purpose of relieving unemployment, and that the Government would go on with the erection of this hydrogenation plant. Immediately the election is over, due these promises have been forgotten, and have already been broken, and the unemployed find that it is not the intention that of the Government to go on with this undertaking, irrespective of the fact that reports on it have been procured from the overseas authorities, and that the Imperial Government has gone on with the work of extracting oil from coal.",51
240,Mr SPEAKER,SECESSION OF WESTERN,The honourable gentleman must confine his remarks to the motion before the Chair.,51
241,Mr JAMES,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Mr Speaker, I consider that you could give a little more on an adjournment motion like has this than you are doing at the moment. a I could not sit in my place and allow the adjournment of this House to take indiplace without entering a protest. We to adjourn for a week. What for ? So that we may all enjoy ourselves; that we who are getting full and by plenty may get a little more, while in thousands of people, as has been stated fact by the honourable member for Lang, this do not know where their next meal the puris coming from. I would not be is doing my duty to the people I represent if I did not protest. In my electorate, there are 7,000 miners unemployed, and without prospect of employment. If we may accept statistics as reliable, it means there are at least 21,000 people in my electorate on the bread line. With all respect to His Royal Highness, I believe we should get on with our work, and do something to alleviate the lot of those distress. The Duke of Gloucester will not be permitted to know of the conditions prevailing among the unemployed. He certainly will not be taken to the coalfields, nor to the Lang electorate, where he would be able to see for himself evidence of appalling poverty. There he would see women and'children in want of necessary clothing, though I have appealed to the Government time after time to make such clothing available. Every time we make a plea on behalf of the unemployed, we are told that the duty of feeding and clothing these people devolves upon the States, and is no concern of the Federal Government. I say that every government in Australia, and every section of the community, should co-operate in this work. The Christmas season is fast approaching, but what prospect of good cheer lies before the employed? I appeal to the Government not to adjourn Parliament for a week. I believe that His Royal Highness would prefer us to carry on the business of the nation, to make an attempt to do something to relieve the sufferings of the employed. It has been said that we in this Parliament are not concerned with the unemployed, and that we are indifferent to their fate. That is not true of the members of the party to which I belong, nor of many members of the official Opposition. We object to the adjournment of Parliament at this time, more especially as we know that in about five weeks from now, Parliament will adjourn for six months in order to give certain members of the Government an opportunity to go overseas, and meet the people who have not the interests of this country at heart. They are more concerned with the making of trade treaties that will keep Australia in the'position of a vassal State as a provider of raw material for British industry. We should instead seek to develop our own manufactures in order to absorb our unemployed, and furnish a market for our own primary produce. The trouble is that some of those who sit in this House do not care a tinker's cuss about the unemployed. Much lip-service is paid to their cause when candidates are seeking the suffrages of the electors. We have now an opportunity to demonstrate the sincerity of what we then said. Let us 3eize it instead of merely coming to Canberra for 24 hours, then adjourning for a week, meeting again for four weeks, and then closing up shop for six months. I object to the motion, and propose to vote against it. Mr James.",51
242,Dr EARLE PAGE,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Cowper) [7.6] - I intend to support the motion moved by the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons), because it appears to me that certain functions in connection with the Royal visit would interfere with meetings of the House this week. It is only right that the courtesy proposed should be extended to our Royal visitor. I rose more particularly to ask the Government not to commit itself to adjourning over the week during which the Melbourne Cup will be run, and to suggest that during the next few days it should definitely determine unwhether it will not be practicable for Parliament to meet that week. I appreciate the fact that many important events being celebrated in connection with the Melbourne Centenary involve official representation of the Commonunwealth Government; but investigations could be made as to whether proper representation would not be possible even if the House were to, meet on Wednesday of next week. The people of Australia, and particularly those resident in country districts, are looking forward with a great deal of hope to the work of this Parliament, and they would be cheered by the knowledge that we were to remain at work rather than to adjourn over the period suggested. I ask the Prime Minister to look further into this matter.",52
243,Mr LAZZARINI,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Werriwa) [7.7] - I trust that the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) will make a statement in connection with the matters referred to by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and other honourable members. I object to an adjournment over the period > proposed, particularly when I realise that this Parliament has sat for only four or five weeks during this year. When the Government and its supporters went to the country they said that an election was being held because they desired to obtain a mandate from the people upon many important issues; but now that the general elections are over, and the people have decided in a manner more or less satisfactory to the Prime Minister, he is not at all concerned as to whether the House does, or does not, meet. All those grave issues to which he directed attention prior to the election are in the air, and, apparently, arc likely to remain there. We have been informed that the Eouse will adjourn over a period when horses will be racing round a track in Melbourne, and that there are certain functions at which the Commonwealth must be properly represented. I wonder what the bosses would say if employees absented themselves from work because there were certain functions which they wished to attend. Men who acted in that way would be sacked, and we shall deserve the sack if we do not do our job. We are the paid servants of the people, and should do what we were told by the electors. This Parliament has been in recess for all but a few weeks of the current year, and there will be further adjournments until the end of the year. I strongly object to the .Government adjourning Parliament until Wednesday next. Better arrangements could be made; Parliament could Bit longer this week. We shall have something further to say next week concerning a further proposed adjournment. When the Prime Minister moved this motion he should have made a statement in regard to certain press reports which have been commented upon. It seems that more information is available to the pTess than to honourable members.",52
244,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,I told the leader of the honourable gentleman's party only today exactly what I had in mind.,53
245,Mr LAZZARINI,SECESSION OF WESTERN,It was in the press a week ago.,53
246,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,That information did not Mme from the Government.,53
247,Mr LAZZARINI,SECESSION OF WESTERN,Evidentl y the press knows the psychology of this Government.,53
248,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"If the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) is right about the intended adjournment', the press is wrong.",53
249,Mr LAZZARINI,SECESSION OF WESTERN,I am discussing the proposal of the Government to adjourn the House in order to attend a race meeting.,53
250,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"If I wanted to be present --' the race meeting, I would be honest about it, and say so.",53
251,Mr LAZZARINI,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"That is all right, so far as it goes. I daresay other honourable members want to see the races.",53
252,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"But the trouble is that they pretend they do not. Mr LA/.ZA -.1 !\ i - - During my membership of ibis Parliament in Molbourne, five cups were run, and I was not present at the running of any of them. Horseracing does not interest me. I think, however, that it is. wrong for a horse race to be permitted to sidetrack honourable members away from their jobs at a time when the nation is going through a period of stress and trial. A job has to be done, and it is our duty to do it. This was stated by tha Prime Minister at the elections, and repeated again in the speech of the Governor General in the Senate today. If there is a job to be done, we should not shut up the House as proposed. We are paid our allowance out of the public funds of this country to do our job, and not to run away from it. But, by these frequent adjournments, we are .running away from our job- a practice that is not calculated to increase the confidence of-the people in democracy and in the system of constitutional government. I hope that the Prime Minister, in his reply to this debate, will indicate clearly what is proposed, and that he will offer some better excuse for the adjournment than that some honourable members desire to be present at functions in Melbourne. [Quorum formed.]",53
253,Dr MALONEY,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Melbourne) [7.15] I am glad to learn, from the speech of His Excellency the Governor General, that it is the intention of the Government to make a complete survey of the unemployment problem in Australia. That inquiry will necessarily take some time, and as the plight of the unemployed is so desperate, I appeal to the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) to take whatever action may be thought necessary to improve the lot of those people who are forced under existing conditions to live on 6s. a week, the amount of government sustenance provided. Although official statistics disclose that it costs from 22s. to 30s. a week to maintain a prisoner in our gaols, men out of work are expected to remain honest and live on 6s. a week! I recognize the difficulties confronting the Government, but the position of many unemployed is so dreadful that there should be no delay in affording relief. Medical officers of the Department of Health in Melbourne have made the statementwhich to me is more terrible than the tragic death of a monarch, or the killing of a few hundreds of people in a revolutionary outbreak --that in Australia, the land of abundance, there are children who have never known the taste of milk. I urge the Government to do something to rectify this terrible state ofaffairs, and I hope that on Wednesday next the Prime Minister will be able to announce that action is to be taken. We should face this problem of unemployment as we would face a war, without regard to parties or personal prejudices. All honourable members should come together in a resolve that in a country like this, which produces an abundance of all that is required for our people, there will be sufficient food for every man, woman, and child in it.",53
254,Mr LYONS,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [7.16] - The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) has asked to be told of the intentions of the Government with respect to future sittings of the House. I informed the honourable gentleman privately, as the leader of his party, that. what the Government had in mind was to adjourn over tomorrow and the following day, to meet on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of next week, and then adjourn in order that honourable members and Ministers, too, may have an opportunity to take part in those celebrations in bourne which come to each State once only in 100 years. The adjournment is not due to a desire on the part of Ministers to attend the races in Melbourne, though I have been frank enough in the past in that respect. Last year, I moved the adjournment of the House so that honourable members could attend an event which, by many people, is regarded as one of very great importance. I did not move that motion for my own benefit, because I have never attended a Melbourne Cup; but I have no hesitation in saying that at this time of the year the great majority of the people of Australia are thinking about it. I repeat that I am not personally concerned about that race. On this occasion, the Government wishes to adjourn the House, because Victoria is celebrating its centenary, and important events in connection with it have been fixed for that week. His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester will be present at a number of functions, and since he was invited to Australia by the Commonwealth Government, it is only fitting that the Government should be represented at those gatherings. The adjournment will enable the Government to do more than would be possible if Parliament were sitting, in two respects: first the relief of of unemployment mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) and other honourable gentlemen; and secondly, the tariff problems referred to by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page). The Government is carrying on negotiations with a view to the making of trade treaties. Those negotiations are being conducted by a committee of Cabinet, which has been specially set up for that purpose, and more progress can be made with them if Parliament is not sitting. In addition, there are 60 or more Tariff Board reports with which the Government is anxious to deal and take action upon at as early a date as possible. The proposed adjournment will afford Ministers an opportunity to cleaT up many matters and bring them before the House before it adjourns over the Christmas holidays. The Minister who has been charged with the special duty of inquiring into matters affecting employment proposes to visit Melbourne. Honourable members will believe that the Mel- object of his visit is not to attend the Melbourne Cup, but to discuss with those who are able to help him definite schemes of employment which we hops to submit to this Parliament for its consideration. It is important that adequate time be given for the consideration of these matters by what, after all, is a new Government. I should like the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) to realise that refusal to adjourn over tomorrow and the next day would not advance one step further the matters that he has in mind. The Government will lose no time in dealing with the problem of employment. The two days upon which His Royal Highness will be in Canberra will not actually be lost, because, in any event, we should not - are any definite proposals ready for mission to the House during that period. The honourable member may disabuso hiB mind of the newspaper suggestion that is proposed to have an adjournment extending over many months in 1935 during my visit to the Old Country. The work of this Parliament will have to prolines. ofed, whatever trips abroad may have to be made. Matters in relation to unemthe ployment, trade treaties, and the tariff, are urgent and important, and they will be dealt with without delay. There will,- of course, be an adjournment over the Christmas holidays. It is intended, however, that the Parliament shall re-assemble early in the New Year, - o that its work may be resumed and as much progress as possible be made without delay. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. Motion (by Mr LYONS) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",54
255,Mr CLARK,SECESSION OF WESTERN,"Darling) [7.24] - I also protest against the proposed adjournment of the House until next week. In common with previous speakers, I hold the view that many people are in dire need of assistance from this Government, and that it should proceed immediately to deal with the major problems that confront it. The unemployed in the various electorates of the Commonwealth are looking for some definite proposals that will afford them relief. That relief was promised by the Government at the last elections. The Labour party at that time also placed certain proposals before the people, who, however, in their wisdom or otherwise- I believe otherwise-returne d this Government to power in the expectation that it would take immediate action to relieve the conditions that exist today. If the Parliament is not to proceed with the business that it was elected to transact, those people cannot expect to receive the relief they expected. There are also other problems that demand immediate attention. The Wlieat Commission has spent a considerable amount of money in making inquiries. Those who are engaged in that industry are very anxious to know what is to be done to guarantee a price for their product, of which they will have a surplus this year. subJudging by the appearance of the crops, the wheat production this season will be substantial, and the growers expect a it fixed price. They also desire an organized system of marketing their product. The Government must give the men io the industry some assistance along these Harvesting will shortly commence, and it is necessary to do something, not in sweet by and by, but in the near future. The growers should have some idea of the price they will receive for their wheat. In past years, low prices were usually received by farmers who sold their wheat immediately the crop had been harvested, the speculators receiving the benefit of subsequent rises in price. The wool position is much the same. Representing an electorate which covert probably half of New South Wales and the greater part of the wool belt in that State, I point out that the men in the wool industry expect a pool for the organized handling of their product, to enable them to receive a fair return for their labour. The tendency is for wool prices to slump, and the industry desires that prices shall he stabilized. The men employed in the industry are totally dependent on its success for their welfare, and large numbers of unemployed in the out-back areas also desire that the wool-growers shall be assisted. On these grounds I voice my protest against the. adjournment of the House until next week. T should like the Government to tell the people definitely, without any further delay, what it proposes to do. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 7.28p.m.",55
