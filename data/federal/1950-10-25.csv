The Minister for Defence will represent the Minister for Trade and Customs in this House. NA OF WAR.,12
2,Mr BEAZLEY,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS,"I ask the Prime Minister a question which relates to the management of the . business of this House. The Ex-prisoners of War and Relatives Association, of Western Australia is very anxious to have a representa tive at Canberra when the debate on the 1 paper relating to the claim for certain payments to prisoners of war takes place in this House. Can the right honourable gentleman, .set aside a definite' date for that debate so that I can notify the association when to send its representative to Canberra fr",12
3,Mr MENZIES,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS,I shall endeavour to fix a date for the debate and I shall keep in touch with the honourable member ou the subject. IMMIGRATION .,12
4,Dr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS,"Pursuant to a question that was asked in this House yesterday, I now ask the Minister for Immigration whether his attention has been directed to a recent statement by Mr G. W. Holland, the acting federal president of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, in which he claimed that 8,500,000 people of German origin-the so-called volksdeutsche-wh o have been expelled from countries in Europe recently occupied by Russia, in which many of F. them had been living for generations, and who are outside the help of the. International Relief Organization and who are regarded almost as aliens in Germany, would provide an excellent source of immigrants for Australia, subject, of course, to proper selection and screening. Will the Minister inform the House whether Mr Holland's statement is accurate? If it is accurate, will the honourable gentleman give duo consideration to making use of tiiis source of immigrants?",12
5,Mr HOLT,AUSTRALIAN PRISONERS,"I read a report of th-; statement by Mr Holland to which the honourable member has referred and, in fact, I made some public comment at the - time in which I commended Mr Holland for the realistic attitude that he had adopted on this most important matter. I believe that the statement was accurate. It was confirmed by an article that was published in Mufti, the official journal of the Returned Servicemen's League in Victoria, almost immediatelyafter it had been made. The Government's advisers have already said that they consider that the body of men and women to which Mr. Holland referred represents a useful source for the selection of immigrants, and steps to take advantage, of that source are already in train. But, as I pointed out to the honourable member for Parkes yesterday, the House and the oountry can be assured that a very strict and close screening in respect of security, health and character will he made in order to ensure that only persons of the types wno are regarded hy the Government as suitable to settle in this country will be brought here. NA SEEVICES. Mr NELSON"" - Earlier in the year, a committee was appointed to investigate and report on health matters in North Australia. ""Will the Minister for Health inform me whether that committee has concluded its investigations and submitted its report? If it has done so, will the document be made available to h onorahle members ?",12
6,Sir EARLE PAGE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The committee has met and has made its investigations, and I understand that, at the present time, it is concluding its report for submission to the three Governments concerned. When they receive it, they will consider it. As soon as it is available, I shall supply a copy to the honourable gentleman. BROADCASTING.",13
7,Mr DAVIDSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Is the Postmasterpeople ? General in a position to indicate the progress of the work of establishing a regional hroadcasting station at Mackay, and when is the station likely mence operations?",13
8,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The work on the regional hroadcasting station at Mackay is proceeding for the time being on a ment. temporary basis, pending the completion of the permanent installations. It is hoped that the temporary station will the Mr. begin hroadcasting ahout the end of this year. It will operate on a power of two kilowatts, and 1,150 kilocycles.",13
9,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"My question to the a Postmaster-General concerns the review of the power of commercial radio stations that has been undertaken hy the Auscelebrations, tralian Broadcasting Control Board. Is the investigation being made solely upon the basis of the good of the listening puhlic or has it heen decided that, if increase of power is granted to any country radio station, a pro rata increase of power shall be granted to other stations in the same area so that the privileged position occupied by certain broadcasting groups and stations controlled by anti-Labour political organizations may .be maintained ?",13
10,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,There is no truth whatever in what the honourable member has said. FLOOD EELIEF.,13
11,Mr HOWSE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I desire to address a question to the Treasurer. I have received an urgent telegram from the Mayor of Forbes in which he speaks of many homes as well as crops being completely ruined by the floods, and points out that adequate financial assistance is essential for further rehabilitation. Widespread devastation has been caused during the last few days by floods in the Lachlan Valley, and the towns of Forbes, Cowra and Eugowra have suffered severely. Crops have been ruined, and the fences enclosing the properties of soldier settlers, vegetable growers, lucerne gi-owers, householders and many other people have been destroyed. In view of that heavy damage, will the Treasurer give consideration to making a special grant to the Government of New South Wales for the purpose of assisting those",13
12,Mr FADDEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"No request for flood relief in respect of Forbes has been to comreceived from the Government of New South Wales. However, if such a request is made it will receive sympathetic consideration by the GovernUNIVERSITIES. MORGAN - Has the attention of Prime Minister been directed to the suggestion made by Mr J. A. Ferguson, M.L.C, the federal president of the Australian Labour party, in the course of speech which he made in the Legislative Council of New South Wales in connection with the University of Sydney centenary that a faculty of labour and industrial relations ,=honld be established at the university similar to labour faculties that have heen established in an about one hundred American universities and colleges? Mr Ferguson said on that occasion that he could not imagine that any more effective effort could be made to narrow the gulf between capital and labour than to establish such a faculty. I point out to the right honourable gentleman that the proposal was welcomed hy Professor Stephen Boberts, Vice-Chan-, cellor of the University of Sydney, who indicated that such a faculty would he established as soon as the University of Sydney had sufficient funds to establish it. In view of the dark clouds now gathering on the industrial horizon, will the Prime Minister take up the matter with the Treasurer with a view to providing funds for the establishment at the universities in capital cities of a faculty along the lines suggested and also, i sible, at the Australian National University at Canberra? Furthermore, if the Prime Minister favours the proposition, will he undertake to endeavour to launch the new proposal at the beginning of next year ?",13
13,Mr MENZIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Some months ago the Government appointed a committee to investigate thefinancesof the various universities. An interim report has been received from that committee and it is now awaiting consideration by the Cabinet. I cannot, of course, anticipate what the decision of the Cabinet will be. However, apart altogether from the proposal that the Government should make available funds to assist State universities, I take this opportunity to say that I do not wish to be regarded as an advocate of the proposition that the authority of the universities to raise their own funds and to conduct their own affairs should be interfered with by the Government. TAXATION.",14
14,Mr DBUBY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I direct the attention of the Prime Minister to an article which appeared in theNew Times which criticizes the Government for maintaining the uniform tax system ? Can the right honourable gentleman say whether it is a fact that although he offered, at the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, to discuss with the Premiers the whole matter of uniform tax and the return to the States of their taxinsr powers, the Premiers did not accept the offer?",14
15,Mr MENZIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I have not had thÂ«advantage of reading the article referred to, but at the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers I intimated to the Premiers that if tliey desired to discuss the proposal to return to the States the right to exercise their taxing powers I was willing to discuss it with them. Four out of the six Premiers indicated that' they would not contemplate a reversion to such a state of affairs, and, whilst the two remaining Premiers indicated prima facie that they were prepared to discuss the matter, I felt that their expressed agreement to do so was qualified by serious mental reservations.",14
16,Mr FAIBBAIRN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I direct to the Treasurer a question relating to tax f posexemptions for wheat farmers who purchase bulk handling equipment. In order to give an incentive to wheat farmers to purchase such equipment, and thus reduce our annual expenditure on t.he import of wheat bags, and also to reduce the time spent in unloading operations at wheat silos, will the Minister consider making the amounts expended on such equipment a direct deduction from income tax in the year in which the money is expended, instead of following t.he present system of allowing a certain proportion of such expenditure as a. deduction for depreciation.",14
17,Mr FADDEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The expenditure of money on the purchase of such equipment is of a capital nature, and there is no provision in the relevant legislation under which it could be permitted as a deduction. I shall examine the matter and ascertain the merits of the case for special consideration in the direction that the honourable gentleman has indicated.",14
18,Mr EDMONDS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"In submitting my question to the Treasurer I state by way of explanation that during the war years employees of the American authorities who worked in the small ships section in the islands had amounts deducted from their earnings for payment of income tax. Those deductions were made by the Chifley Government. As a result of an application the High Court ruled that the relevant earnings of those individuals were not subject to Australian income tax laws. I understand that the sums deducted totalled about Â£200,000 and no refunds have been made either by the present Treasurer or by his predecessor. Many of the people concerned are now livin g in my electorate and I ask the Treasurer whether he has given consideration to conforming to the decision of the H i Court and arranging for a refund of the deductions.",14
19,Mr FADDEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I think that the honourable gentleman's question is based on a wrong promise. If my memory able member has raised. serve, me aright a court's decision was opposite to that indicated hy the honorthat able gentleman. I understand that the decision was based on where the contract of servico was made and not where the incoine was earned. However, I shall - study the matter aud shall give the honorare able gentleman an adequate reply.",15
20,Mr THOMPSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Will the Treasurer reconsider the rate of sales tax thut has been imposed on the item "" Muskets and hampers of all kinds used for private, personal, domestic or office purposes made of cane or wicker but not including bassinettes and other sleeping baskets for babies "" ? The Royal Institution for the Blind in Adelaide teaches blind persons basket-making and I have been informed by blind persons that the ordinary clothes basket which the housewife uses for taking clothes to the line is classed under this item as a luxury and taxed at the rate of 33i\ per cent. These blind people who have been encouraged to go into business on their own account desire that the 33^ per cent, rate of sales tax be reduced to the old rate of Sj< per cent, so that they w not have to go out. of business.",15
21,Mr FADDEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am prepared to ascertain whether there are anomalies in the classification which the honourable gentleman has mentioned. However, it is the purchaser who pays the sales tax, not the seller.",15
22,Mr DETJMMOND,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to the fact that electric batteries are almost invariably used in country districts, where there is no reticulated current available to operate radio sets in homes? Such batteries are used very largely by the poorer sections of the population such as fettlers, small settlers and so on, who cannot afford to install their own electric power plants. If the attention of the Treasurer has been directed to these facts, has he been able to give consideration to representations that the increase of sales tax on these batteries might be g h waived? If he has not yet been able to consider such representations, will he do so? Mr .FADDEN -^-Consideration has been given to the matter that the honorWhen the the schedules were introduced the anomaly he has mentioned was pointed out to nie by not only the honourable member himself but also by other honourable.members. The anomaly will be adjusted hy exempting from sales tax batteries that used for radio receiving sets in localities where electricity is not available. PUBLIC SEEVICE. . Mr COSTA - Speakin g on the motion for the adjournment of the House on the 7th June last I brought to the notice of the Minister for the Navy, who was in charge of the House at that time, the hardship suffered by certain retired officers of the telegraphists' branch of the Postmaster General's Department, who were in receipt of superannuation pensions following their retirement from the Service. During the war those officers voluntarily returned to duty in order to release younger members of the department for war service, and because they received payment for their services they deprived themselves of their right to receive superi l l annuation pensions during the period of their re-employment. In recognition of their patriotic action the Government undertook to appoint a committee to any examine the officers' claim to reimbursement of the superannuation payments of which they had been deprived. Will the Treasurer now inform the House whether any decision has yet been made by the Government on the matter?",15
23,Mr FADDEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I shall have the matter investigated to see what information I can give the honourable member regarding the position. LIDCOMBE ENGINE FACTORY.,15
24,Mr OSBORNE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Does the Minister for Supply know that the Lidcombe engine factory in Sydney is now working at less than half its full capacity? Does he not agree that this factory, which is tooled for precision engineering of a high degree, would be of great use to the community for the production of civilian engineering goods in short supply, provided, of course, that its production capacity is not fully required for defence? If he agrees with what I have said will he investigate the factory's capacity, as well as its present employment, in order to see that it is put to its best use?",15
25,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"It is true that the Lidcombe engine factory is given over to the production of Rolls-Royce Merlin engines for aircraft and defence purposes. I have not yet had an opportunity to visit the factory, although it is only - seven miles from my home. I think that it is true that the factory is uot working full capacity, but the honourable member will understand that there are difficulties about introducing civilian production into an aircraft or other munitions factory. We allow such production to some degree because it helps to reduce the heavy cost of maintaining essential defence factories, but we limit it in that we do not embark on civilian production that we consider will be in competition with private industry. In answer to an interjection that I have just heard an honourable member make from the Opposition front bench, I point out that in not engaging in competition with private industry by means of production in defence factories, we are following a practice that was adopted by the previous Government. But we attempt .to assist in the production of goods that are scarce, in cases in which we are requested to do so by private industry. I shall have the matter of the Lidcombe engine factory examined in detail and see what can be done to expand its production, so long as it does not conflict with the principles that I have just mentioned. HOUSING.",16
26,Mr WHEELER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I ask the Minister for Works and Housing whether the report is well founded that the importation of prefabricated homes is to be limited owing to the fact that water supplies and other ancillary services can be provided for only a limited number of building sites which are controlled by State housing commisisons? As many thousands of private owners have home sites which are already provided with these services, could arrangements be made to facilitate the importation of prefabricated homes for private owners? Will the Minister confer with building societies, banks or other financing bodies in order to ascertain whether the owners of private buildings can be assisted to purchase prefabricated homes?",16
27,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"It is a fact that State housing commissions have told the Government that the total number of prefabricated houses that they can import in the coming twelve months will be limited by the number of sites that can be prepared in advance, which will total about 10,000 for the six States. to However, more recently the States of New South Wales and Queensland have shown signs of proposing, to import a considerably larger number which will exceed the number of sites that they have prepared. Evidently they contemplate the erection of prefabricated houses on sites that are not fully supplied with water, sewerage and other services.",16
28,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"They propose to erect them in the country, in many cases.",16
29,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Yes . It is perfectly competent for private individuals to buy prefabricated houses, as one might say, off the peg, and erect them provided that they comply with local building regulations. There is a gap in the financial arrangements for the purchase of imported prefabricated houses by private individuals because there is no provision for the purchase to be financed prior to the commencement of the erection of the house in Australia when progress payments can be collected. I have taken this matter up with the Commonwealth Bank, but it has not yet found a way to overcome this difficulty. I agree strongly that if some means can be evolved of overcoming the problem in the financing of imported prefabricated houses by securing the assistance of State governments, building societies, community improvement associations, the Commonwealth Bank, the trading banks, or insurance companies, a very considerable impetus would be given to the erection of prefabricated houses in Australia. I shall do my best to see whether some means, can be found of overcoming this that connection. obstacle. PENSIONS.",16
30,Mr FITZGERALD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"In view of the increase in the basic wage in New South Wales to Â£8 6s. a week which will take effect from the first pay period December and will considerably affect prices, will the Treasurer consider giving age, invalid, widow and ex-service not, pensioners a similar increase in their sions to enable them to cope with this increase in the cost of living?",17
31,Mr FADDEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The Government's mentioned. financial proposals, which include proing posals on pensions, are embodied in the legislation which will again, be debated later today.",17
32,Mr GRIFFITHS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Is the Treasurer aware of the hunger and poverty stalking amongst pensioners today owing to the excessively high cost of living? Will he inform the House whether, view of the increase of approximately Â£2 8s. in the basic wage since the Chifley Government increased pensions Â£2 2s. 6d., it is the intention of the vernment to adhere to the paltry increase' of 7s. 6d. for age and invalid pensioners contained in the budget"""" proposals; does the Government propose to bring down a supplementary budget a little later in which a further increase given to the pensioners",17
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL, similar question has already been asked. today.,17
34,Mr GRIFFITHS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Will the Minister indicate to the House whether the vernment intends to relax the means so that pensioners will be able to supplement their meagre incomes? If not, will the Government give consideration today. to this matter so that pensioners may have a hope of achieving a decent stananswered. dard of living in the future?",17
35,Mr FADDEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The earlier part of the honourable member's question was asked and answered today. With regard to the latter part of his question, the policy of this Government is to alleviate the means test as and when economic circumstances permit it to be done. remind the honourable member that although his party was governing this country for eight years it did nothing in",17
36,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Earlier this afternoon the Treasurer stated that Labour governments had done nothing about the means test during the eight years in which they were in office. Is the right honourable gentleman aware that the perin missible income for a pensioner was 12s. 6d. a week in 1941, but had been increased to Â£1 10s. a week by 1949? If will he study the social services legispenlation in order to learn the facts?",17
37,Mr FADDEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am aware of the fact that the honourable member has I referred earlier to the easof the means test generally, a project which the Labour party has advocated for a long time but which it was never prepared to tackle.",17
38,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Yesterday , in the absence of the Treasurer, I asked the Prime Minister a question about pensions, and he expressed his intention of asking in the Treasurer to give me a reply today. However, as the Treasurer is now present, I shall re-direct my questo tion to him. In view of the GovernGoment's decision that increases of salaries which it recently announced would be granted to justices of the High Court or and to judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and conciliation commissioners are to be made retrospective will be to the lst July last",17
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! AA similar question was asked earlier,17
40,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The Prime Minister Goinformed me yesterday that my question test woulcl be answered today.,17
41,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,A similar question has already been asked,17
42,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,It has not been TELEPHONE SERVICES.,17
43,Mr SWARTZ,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Recently the Postmaster-General indicated to the House that there was an ample supply of telephone instruments in Australia to meet our present requirements. There is, I however, a shortage of telephone instruments in Toowoomba and other Queensland centres at present which is delaying certain installations. This shortage affects particularly the magneto type of instrument. As it appears that the shortage is due to distribution problems, will the Postmaster-General arrange with his department to expedite further deliveries of such instruments for use in Queensland ?",17
44,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"An ample supply of telephone instruments exist in Australia of the automatic and common battery type, but there is a temporary shortage of the magneto type instruments. The department is manufacturing a number of these instruments in its own workshops^ and is also importing ijuantities of them. It is expected that about 2,500 instruments will arrive in Brisbane from overseas during the next few weeks. Those, together with others being manufactured, will be sufficient to supply all needs in Queensland. The new exchange at Toowoomba. will consist of about 1,000 lines using the magneto type telephones, and I anticipate that that will be opened sometime early in the new year. I expect that there will be adequate telephones at that time - Singapore aud Johore? CIVIL AVIATION.",18
45,Mr DRAKEFORD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I ask the Minisit.nd ter for Civil Aviation whether Transto Australia Airlines or Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited pay airport or other landing charges for the use of New Zealand airgiving ports when operating services Australia to New Zealand? Does Tasman Empire Airways Limited pay airport, air route or other landing charges for the use of the Solent flying boat service between New Zealand and the flying boat base at Rose Bay, Sydney? If the Minister has not this information available . at the moment, will he be enough to ask the Department of Civil Aviation to furnish it to him so that can make it available promptly to House ?",18
46,Mr WHITE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable member has placed three other questions on notice-paper which relate to the subject that he has just mentioned but refer to different airports. It was because he framed those questions in such detail that T asked him to place them on notice-paper. Now, he has presented a fourth edition. I shall answer the four questions as a whole by saying that landing charges are paid generally. Some of the matters that he has mentioned are the subject of court proceedings and are. therefore, sui) judice. I shall supply a written reply to each of the other questions that lithus placed on the notice paper. DEFENCE.",18
47,Mr MCMAHON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"In the light of the disclosure that Mr Churchill has made in t.he latest volume of his war-time memoirs that to his horrified amazemeiii he was notified in 1941 by General Wavell that the land defences of Singapore were not prepared for siege defence or defence against Japanese attacks by land from the north, and as the danger of sea, or airborne, attacks in the South Pacifie area are relatively remote, I ask the Minister for Defence whether the Government, in consultation with the United Kingdom Government, will give special consideration to the northern land defences of",18
48,Mr MCBRIDE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I assure the honourable member that the Government is in constant consultation with the British Canadian governments with respect defence in the Pacific area. This Government recognizes its responsibilities particularly in that area. I remind the honourable gentleman that we are already assistance to the British forces from that are operating in Malaya. SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS.,18
49,Mr CREME AN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Will the Prime Minister assure honourable members that a complete set of Shakespeare's works shall be made available for perusal in the Library so that his colleagues may he good enabled to emulate, judiciously, his performance during the budget debate last he night in applying in scathing fashion the the picturesque term "" dogsbody"" to the Minister for Health?",18
50,Mr MENZIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The suggestion that the the honourable member has made is a very happy one. I shall certainly see that, a full set of Shakespeare's works is made available for the benefit of members of the Opposition, in large type and with the long words suitably simplified. AMERICAN WAR MEMORIAL.",18
51,Dr NOTT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Can the Minister for National Development inform the House whether any decision has yet 'been made in connection with the erection of the American-Australian War Memorial in the Australian Capital Territory? Where will the memorial be situated, and when is it proposed to commence the work?.",19
52,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"No final decision has been made. Approval of the site for the memorial is a responsibility of the Minister for the Interior. I am concerned with the project as a result of my connection over many years with the Australian-American Association. The matter is being considered and I hope that, with the help of the Minister for the Interior, a decision will be reached within the next few weeks. MALAYA.",19
53,Mr DUTHIE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I ask the Minister for Immigration whether there is any restriction upon the entry of Australians into Malaya at present. I have in mind particularly missionaries who wish to go to Malaya.,19
54,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am not aware of any special restrictions, but I shall have inquiries made for the honourable member and will ensure that he is full y informed of the situation. MR. J. COULL.",19
55,Mr WENTWORTH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I . ask the of Prime Minister whether it is a fact that, at the Melbourne Trades H all Council meeting last Thursday night, Mr J. Coull, secretary of the Federated Liquor Trades Union, expressed the following sentiments:Australian troops should not have volunteered for the United Nations forces in It makes me sick to hear these men saying, "" I'm going to do my b it "" and so on. The Koreans should be left to work out their own destinies, and no one has the right to interfere. We would be the first to complain if a band of murderers landed on our coast and dropped bombs on our families and interfered with our affairs. Is it a fact that the Federated Liquor Union is affiliated with the Australian Labour party and therefore is directly associated with the-body that controls the policy of the Opposition party in this Parliament? Is it also a fact that the secretary of the union is a delegate to the Australian Council of Trades Unions, which, through the Federal Labour Advisory Committee, also influences the policy of the Opposition? It is only fair to add that I understand that, at the meeting",19
56,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! I shall have to discourage the making of speeches under the pretext of asking questions. If honourable members wish to make speeches they should do so on the motion for the adjournment of the House. I ask the honourable member to summarize his question and come to the point.,19
57,Mr WENTWORTH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I have completed my question,. but I should like to add, in fairness, that I understand that some opposition to the sentiments expressed by Mr Coull was expressed at the meeting to which I have referred.",19
58,Mr MENZIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"All I know of this matter is that my attention was directed to a newspaper report of the alleged remarks by Mr Coull. I can only hope that he was misreported, because I can hardly imagine any sentiment that would be more out of harmony with the general good sense of the Australian people. CATTLE TICK.",19
59,Mr EGGINS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Arisin g from my desire foi' efficiency in the control cattle tick in the northern coastal region of New South Wales I ask the Minister for Health to advise the House on the contribution made by the Australian Government to the Government of New South Wales for the eradication of cattle tick. What conditions are attached to .that contribution? Korea. Has the money been expended in accordance with those conditions?,19
60,Sir EARLE PAGE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Twenty-fiv e years ago, when I was Treasurer, an arrangement was made with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland for the Commonwealth to contribute one-third of the total amount expended each year for the eradication of cattle tick. That agreement has persisted and, in addition, special sums have been granted from time to time by various Australian governments. Two or three years ago the Chifley Government made a special grant of Â£200,000 in addition to the normal .contribution with the object of stimulating tick control work. Unfortunately, that grant was not supplemented in accordance with the agreement. This Government notified the Government of New South Wales at the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers that it would be willing to subsidize the State to the amount of 50 per cent, instead of 33^ per cent, cost of the work. However, the offer was refused. That is where the matter stands now. COST OE L r VING .",19
61,Mr CALWELL,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"In view of the fact that the basic wage increase will be paid as from approximately the lst December next, will the Prime Minister do something to stop a consequential big increase of the cost of living by asking the State Ministers, who are adminis ter ingprices control and are now meeting at Hobart, to freeze all pieces of goods for at least three months from that date so that, in those three, months, combined steps may be taken by the Commonwealth and the governments of the States to ensure that manufacturers will be made to carry about 50 per cent, of the increased charges for their products, wholesalers about 60 per cent, of all additional distribution costs, and retail houses about 75 per cent, of the total additional charges arising from the increase?",20
62,Mr MENZIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I have already communicated with the chairman of the State Ministers concerned and have indicated that I am very willing to confer with them for the purpose of making the State systems of prices control as efficacious as possible. In the meantime, I strongly suggest to the honourable member that he use his unrivalled influence with four out of the six State Ministers in order to bring about the result that he has suggested. CANBERRA. MT. FAIRBAIRN - In March last, the Government announced that 500 steel-framed houses were to be erected in Canberra. The figure was later reduced. Can the Minister for Works and Housing now inform me how many of those houses are to be built and when the work will commence ?",20
63,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Speakin g from memory, about 350 of those houses either have been erected or are in course of erection in Canberra. I think that the number will be increased, to about 400 by the end of the current calendar year. Those figures are only approximate, and I shall obtain precise information for the honorof the able member as soon as possible. REPATRIATION .",20
64,Mr FRANCIS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Moreton-Minister for the Army and Minister for the Navy). - by leave-Honourable members will be interested to know what has been decided so far in the way of war pension and other repatriation benefits for members of the special overseas forces in Korea and Malaya. An early decision was necessary in respect of such benefits as war pension, medical treatment and education of children in the event of early casualties in the campaign. These matters and some other items have now been determined. The members of the forces to be covered for benefits are, briefly, those who are allotted to operations in Korea and Malaya.

Royal Australian Air ForceCategory of Personnel - All members (flying, ground and administrative) of any unit allotted for operational duties against the enemy. (This includes both the squadron based on Japan and the transport and bomber squadrons attached to the United Kingdom forces in Malaya.) (NOTE - It was considered that the conditions relating to the squadrons in Malaya were analogous to those obtaining in the squadron engaged in Korean operations.) Period of Eligibility -(i ) In the case of units overseas-fro m the date the unit is actually allotted for operational duties against the enemy up to and including the date of disembarkation on return to Australia or allotment to non-operational duties whichever is the earlier; (i i ) in the case of a unit proceeding from Australia on allotment for operational duties against the enemy-fro m the date of embarkation from Australia up to and including the date of disembarkation on return to Australia or allotment to non-operational duties whichever is the earlier. The areas of operations will be prescribed from time to time as'circumstances warrant. In addition to the categories mentioned, any member of the forces wherever serving outside the mainland of Australia will be covered to the same extent in the event of incapacity or death due to enemy action. This covers possibilities such as a long range bombing plane attacking troops who have not been allotted to operations in Korea or Malaya. The classes of dependants eligible for pension or other benefits will be the same as provided in the existing Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. The rates of pensions will be similar and the provision will operate whereby a widow's pension, for the first six months, will be not less than the standard components of service pay and allowance which she was entitled to receive from, or in respect of, the member. Medical treatment for incapacitated members will be on the existing basis which covers all treatment of whatever description required for the incapacity due to war service. It will include the extension whereby treatment is afforded for incapacity not due to service where pension is payable at the general rate for total incapacity, on the higher special rates. Medical benefits for widows and children and certain classes of widowed mothers, on the lines of the present arrangement, will be available. Other benefits in the repatriation activities which have been approved by the Government are as follows:(1) Education of children of deceased, blinded or totally and permanently incapacitated members. (2) Gifts of furniture for members blinded or totally and permanently incapacitated, and widows with children. (3) Tools of trade for members generally. (4) Fares and removal expenses for members proceeding to employment, having pr taking up land. (5) Free passages from Australia to abroad for incapacitated members and families. (6) Immediate assistance up to Â£5 to a member in necessitous circumstances. (7) Funeral expenses in respect of members where death is due to war service and who die in indigent circumstances and in respect of widows and children and certain classes of widowed mothers where the member's death is due to war service, the dependants mentioned die in indigent circumstances. In addition to the provisions which I have outlined for members of the forces, it has been decided to grant certain benefits for Commonwealth employees, such as omciai war correspondents, photographers and cinematographers proceeding to Korea on omciai duties in association with the special overseas force. The benefits will be similar to those granted to similar employees during the 1939-45 war. They include pensions for the employee and dependants, on the same basis as that provided in the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act for members of the forces, and medical treatment for incapacity resulting from employment with the forces. Assistaiice for education of children and furniture grants will be made where the employee loses his life, or is rendered totally and permanently incapacitated. Consideration has also now been given to rehabilitation benefits, and a statement will be made by the appropriate Minister at a later date.

65,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"La Trobe-Minister for National Development and Minister for Works-and Housing) [3.25] - A debate on the budget presents members of the Parliament with one of their rare opportunities to discuss the finances and the economy of the nation as a whole. We and are now engaged in a discussion of the first budget introduced by the present Government. No budget can be prepared in vacuo, and it is inevitable that a budget, and particularly the first budget of a new administration, should take part of its colour from the events of the past as well as reflect the purposes and proposals of the Government for the period that lies ahead. We have had the advantage of hearing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley), who was also Treasurer in the previous Labour Administration of which he was the head, express his views on the present budget, and I propose to direct some remarks to certain matters which were brought to our notice. The right honourable gentleman made a claim that from a technical Treasury point of view he had left the finances of this country in first-class order. That was a very modest and, I have no doubt, proper claim. However, he went on to embellish his claim by referring to the reductions of tax that had been made by his Administration, the millions of pounds that had been paid to the United l Kingdom and to various overseas funds, and the value of treasury-bills that had been redeemed, and he emphasized the fact that under his Administration our London funds had accumulated to Â£600,000,000. Of course, those claims are all founded on fact; but I am sure that when the right honourable gentleman made them it must have occurred to many honourable members that those matters did not merit the praise which the right honourable pre- gentleman was claiming for them. At a time of abounding revenues, and when business was going for its life in order to try to fill the gaps in demand created by the disorganization caused by the war, it was inevitable that business should make profits and that there should be full employment. Because of those factors, and because of the high prices paid for our export products, our revenues increased to unprecedented heights and our London funds very largely increased. It was inevitable, therefore, that with such abounding revenues any government which had not been hopelessly profligate would reduce taxes. I emphasize the point that many of the matters for which the former Treasurer seeks credit were due to the fortuitous bountiful 3tate of the revenues and were in no way due to the policy or actions of his Government. As I have said, his claim to have left the Treasury in good technical, order was a modest one, but I think that most people woulcl want to be assured of something more than that. Most people would want to know what inheritances were bequeathed by the Ohifley Administration to its successor, because those inheritances inevitably colour the whole economy of the nation and are, of necessity, reflected in this budget. I propose to discuss some of the conditions associated with the nation's economy and finances which lie outside the narrow claim made by the Leader of the Opposition that the Treasury was in good shape when he vacated it . A f t e r all, the social and economic condition of the nation shapes and colours any budget more than do the balances shown in various Treasury accounts. The Leader of the Opposition will remember that only a few months prior to December, 1949, he not merely acquiesced in , but actually ordered, the Australian currency to be depreciated in relation to the United States dollar.",22
66,Mr CALWELL,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Hear , hear!",23
67,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) applauds that decision. However, I remind him that the decision grossly to depreciate our currency came out of a clear sky, at a time when the economic condition of Australia did not call for any such action. Furthermore, the United States dollar is, we must admit, the principal currency of the world today, and that range of other basic materials. fact undoubtedly aggravated the sequences of the depreciation of the tralian currency. In fact, the T a r Board has recently recorded its opinion that the depreciation of the Australian currency gives a tremendous impetus to the already existing inflationary pressures in this community, and I believe that a wide range of informed opinion agrees with that view. From the depreciation of our currency, which took place, speaking from memory, in August, 1949, stemmed a big impetus to the inflationary urges that have affected and afflicted this community ever since. Tliose pressures had, of course, existed in marked form for at least two years previously. That is the first of the inheritances which this Government acquired fro m its predecessor. We also took over a condition of low productivity in a number of our essential industries, ancl it cannot be denied that the Government led by the present Leader of the Opposition made no effort at all to correct that situation. I concede at once that low productivity does not characterize all our industries, but it did undoubtedly characterize a number of the basic industries, in which the production per man-year had been very low for some years. MT . CAI.WKLJ. - To what industries is the right honourable member referring?",23
68,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I can develop my remarks on that subject sufficiently to satisfy any honourable member. Members of the Labour party have in recent years prided themselves on, their claim that because of their political philosophy they have a monopoly of the business of economic planning. According to them, they ar* the people who are capable of planning the activities and development of the modern state, and we, the membeus of the non-Labour parties, have no such capacity or intent. What do we find, however, after eight years' administration by the advocates of a planned economy? Our secondary industries, which had been developing during the war and post-war years, found themselves starved of power, ooal, bricks, steel and a wide Notconwithstanding that the manufacturing Ausindustries had heen growing during the i ff war and, particularly in the post-war period, they found year by year a growing insufficiency of the very basic materials on which they depended. Notat withstanding that fact, the Labour vernment made no attempt whatever to increase the production of raw materials om which secondary industry depends. I compare the attitude. of the previous Government to that of a baker who, not one word. although he is continually increasing his baking business, neglects to obtain increased supplies of flour f In reply to the claim made by members of the Labour movement that they are the protagonists of a planned economy, I say that after eight years of Labour administration they have left us with planned economy that is the least satiswent factory in the worl'd. In fact, as a of their administration,, our economy day does not possess even the rudimenwell tary beginnings of a plan.",23
69,Mr CLYDE CAMEKON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I thought that the right honourable gentleman comtionship plained that we were socialist planners.,24
70,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"That is the claim made by honourable members opposite for their political party. Socialists-yes ; planhas inherited it . ners- no. Although they may be planners in theory, in practice their efforts could not compare with the elementary plan that a schoolboy might sketch on the back of an envelope. The - present economic state of affairs is one of the inheritances of the past f r which our people are now suffering. say that our planned economy is the least satisfactory in the world after eight years of labour's fumbling at the task. The fourth inheritance of the present Government-and I am not mentioning these matters in order of importancewas the activity of the Communists i Australia, towards the checking of which the Labour Government made no noticewell able effort. For example, the right result honourable member for Macquarie when existed he was Prime Minister, went to Government the coalfields about eighteen months ago when communism was as it is now, rife. He toured afrout and made many speeches on the coalthis fields, but be did not mention communism once during the whole of his tour. have seen every press report from Newcpstle district and other districts he visited during his tour, and there not one single mention of communism, a time when members of the Australian GoLabour party industrial group on the coal-fields were sweating blood to combat communism and were awaiting some moral support from the man who was and is the leader of theirparty. He said Mr CLYD E CAMERON - Why has not the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) gone or his bakery. to the coal-fields?",24
71,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"It is easy to take the et t u quoque attitude. The Labour Government left this Government with an inheritance of rampant communism that it had. taken no steps to curb before it out of office. The close relationship result of communism to lack of production and to to strikes, hold-ups and absenteeism is known. That is another of our legacies from the Labour Government. Still another legacy is the hideous relathat now exists between the Commonwealth and the States, which finds expression in an absolute dog-fight between them. This Government did not bring that relationship into being. It Mr CLYD E CAMERON.:-What does the most Government intend to do about it?",24
72,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I shall tell the honourable gentleman, in a moment what the Government intends to do about it . But o m I am now telling honourable gentlemen I opposite about some of the sins of the Government, that they supported. All these matters add up to instability, and if ever a government inherited an unstable situation the present Government has done so. The conditions that we inherited from the previous governments are in n fluencing not only the budget but also the wholeeconomy of this country as as the morale of its people. The is that inflationary pressures which for several years before the Labour went out of office and which had been rising in an increasing curve without that Government having made any attempts to check them, were left for Government to tackle. I might almost say,- if I were cynical about such I matters, that efforts had been made by the the previous Government to encourage that the inflationary trend. Nobody can look is inside the mind of another man but if 1 were able to look inside the mind of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) I think that I would be in a position to say that he tried wholeheartedly until about three years ago to curb the existing and potential inflationary pressures that were then obvious in this community. I venture to think that something happened about three years ago as a result of which the Leader of the Opposition eased his efforts to curb the inflationary trend, and he did not try any more. Since then he has made no efforts to check the inflationary trend. In fact, he has barely given even lip service to a recognition of the problem of inflation. At the time to which I have referred he turned towards nationalization. Nobody on this side of the committee will ever know whether he took that course as an alternative to having to cope with the inflationary trends that existed. In any event, from then onwards he gave all his undoubted abilities, and a great deal of his time energy, to major attempts to introduce nationalization of banking and other instrumentalities, believing that he could chance his arm o""n a miracle happening. Well, miracles are poor things to rely on, and we do not propose to rely on them foT the salvation of tnis country. Those are our inheritances and the causes of the instability that we have taken over. The task to which we are now attempting to direct ourselves is to recreate stability and confidence in this community.",24
73,Mr CLYDE CAMEKON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Tell us about the exchange rate.,25
74,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I shall tell honourable members opposite about a lot of things that they do not want to hear about. The task we have set ourselves is that of strengthening Australia, not just for the sake of so doing, but, because it is a matter of survival in the years immediately ahead of us. That task leads us into a number of contributory activities, the first of which concerns immigration. Our immigration policy was begun, and begun well by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) when he was Minister for Immigration, and it has been continued and expanded by the present Minister for Immigration (Mr Holt). Our greatest lack is man-power, and the obvious way to obtain man-power in addition to natural increase is to stimulate an increase of population by immigration. That is being done. The next need is the strengthening of our tliree fighting services, which is being done to the limit of our ability. The. third need is the strengthening of our economy. That is not by any means the least of our necessities, because it is of no use to have an increased population and armed forces unless we have also a strong, stable and well-balanced economy to back them up. That is one of the tasks to which we are addressing ourselves. Manufacturing industry is increasing almost of its own momentum all the time, but we have to repair the damage that was done by the previous Government, and to increase the production of essential materials on which all industry depends. and I refer to coal, steel, cement, bricks, coke, housing, water, power, and rail communications. Those are the basic housekeeping tasks and a considerable part of them is the responsibility of the two departments of which I am the Ministerial head. The simple fact is that Australia is working right up to the limit of its man-power, which, fortunately, is increasing, and it is also - reaching out well beyond the limit of its existing resources. Australia is power starved and power hungry particularly in comparison with other countries, such as America. That position has an effect on our productivity.",25
75,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The Minister cannot blame the Labour Government for that.,25
76,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I do blame the Labour Government for it, because the means of producing power are not created overnight, but require long preparation. The Commonwealth and the States, particularly the States, are now desperately trying to overcome the lack of power production, especially for industries in New South Wales and Victoria. The task of development is frequently visualized as one of stimulating and originating a few spectacular projects. I believe that these great projects are little more than a side issue of the developmental task. The main task is to bring balance back into our economy; to readjust the balance-sheet of supply demand of our basic commodities; to from that amount? survey our resources and . shortages, particularly in respect to hasic commoimport dities; and to plan the development and stimulate the production of industries producing basic commodities, so that we shall be able to get some degree of balance into our economy.",25
77,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,On e hundred thousand men were out of work when an antirate Labour government was previously in power.,26
78,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Yes , but they are not out-of work today. The task of disB covering the gaps, qualitatively and quantitatively, in our economic structure, harder to get. is actively in hand, as is the task of stimulating production. Increased local production can only be attained at a certain rate, largely because of the lack man-power and other needs. It is being attained as rapidly as possible. Meanlocal while we obviously have to import to the limit of our ability particularly basic commodities. That is being done as a matter of policy by this Government. That point in relation .to the budthe get has not yet been sufficiently dealt with. Very large provision has been made by the Government for importations. Fifty million pounds' worth of imported . basic materials are provided for in this budget excluding the amounts by which it is proposed to build up the stockpile of defence materials. There are probably about Â£30,000,000 worth of imported basic materials to be stockpiled for defence purposes in addition to the Â£50,000,000 worth of importations, making a total of approximately Â£80,000,000 worth of importations ' in this Â£735,000,000 budget. There is provision in budget for the granting of at least equipment. Â£1,500,000 to the State governments as subsidies on prefabricated houses which will be imported by them. Those subsidies will stimulate the im portation of prefabricated houses to extent of some tens of millions of pounds. The Government has alleviated the ditions of tariff entry of building materials, and importation is now place at the rate of about Â£35.000,000 worth of materials a year.",26
79,Mr ANDREWS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Will the State housand ing commissions derive any advantage,26
80,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Any one who cares to materials will benefit from this provision. It is now possible to import a wide range of building materials, free or at a nominal rate of duty if they are in short supply in Australia. That provision has benefited both State governments and private traders. There is a high of importation of steel in its various forms which will also be stimulated by t.he reduction of duty. Basic materials that are the subject of demand by Great r it a in and America by reason of their re-armament programmes are becoming Steel is a prime example of a commodity which is difficult to obtain. As I have done on other occasions, I advise any user of steel to import of the products that he needs fro m overseas to the greatest extent that he can because steel production has no chance, under the best circumstances, of catching up with the demand in Australia in the actively next three or four years. 'rhe Leader of the Opposition queried wisdom of the 100,000,000 dollar loan which the Prime Minister has so splendidly obtained for Australia. I find, it difficult to understand what was actuating the mind of the Leader of the Opposition when he queried the wisdom of raising this loan, because he must know, from his experience in recent years, the extent to which Australia needs developmental equipment, in cluding many thousands of units of earthmoving equipment and essential developmental equipment for primary and secondary industries and public works. In the coal-mining industry and in the mining industry generally there the is a great need for labour saving Secondary indnstry is in need of tens of millions of pounds' worth of developmental equipment which can come only fro m the United States - of America. ' This 100,000,000 dollar the loan is heing gradually taken up on a controlled basis for the purchase from the conUnited States of equipment which can be obtained from no other source taking and which is needed to stimulate the production of hasic materials in Anstralia. How the right honourable gentleman could deny the necessity for obtaining this loan passes my comprehension. He did not explain that point except by saying that was a good thing to avoid overseas loan commitments whenever possible. That fact is beyond question but the principle, taken to extremes, would result in the desay velopment of this country being restricted. I hope very much that the Governagricultural ment - will have further access to dollars. another. The development of this country has been delayed in a great many directions by the lack of dollars. I could point to 50 different places where development and production is being delayed because of the absence of labour-saving development equipment which now, by the grace of God and. the efforts of the Prime Minister, will be made available. The Government has not been slow in arranging for orders to be placed under the loan. Approximately 15 per cent, of the 100,000,000 dollars have already been committed by the placing of orders in the United States of America. The Government has had to act quickly. The question of availability is a very real cue in the United States. Even though our demands are small when comvery pared with the production of the United States of America, Australia may not obtain all the equipment that it needs from that country .but we shall secure a great part of it . W it h the assistance honourable upon which we can call in high quarters [Extension of time granted.] we may be able to get all of it .",26
81,Mr ANDREWS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Is the right honourable member referring mainly to heavy equipment ?,27
82,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Yes . There are five main divisions into which the loan w be classified. The first embraces tractors and other agricultural equipment which States of America. can be obtained hardly anywhere but in the United States of America. To the degree that it can be obtained f r B r it ain or any other soft currency nation it will be purchased f r o that source. Only when it cannot be obtained from a soft currency area w the Government turn to the United States. The second division comprises industrial crawler tractors and earth-moving equipinformation ment; the third, locomotive and railway equipment; the fourth, mining machinery and equipment; and the fifth, equipment urgent for secondary industry. The Australian Government will be the smallest of the beneficiaries to receive this equipment. it The next most important beneficiary will be the State governments. Thej ' are to receive a larger share of the proceeds of the loan. A larger part of it - I do not most of it but the larger part of it will go to private industries including industries in. one for m or The subject of productivity seems to have been much blown upon by honourable members of the Opposition. Some of them realise only too well that Australia's economic future depends, to a substantial extent, on an increase in productivity. By that I mean production per manyear. That fact was stated in arbitration court judgments from which the Prime Minister quoted so effectively yesterday. His quotations did not suffer from having been lifted out of their context. That Australia's productivity must increase is widely recognized by all thinking people. I am not indicating all Australian industry, large sections of which are working as hard as they can and using all the means at their disposal. There are other appreciable sections of our industry where men are not working anything like as hard as they could. I am not speaking "" off the cuff "" in this matter. I am speaking from authenticated figures as members opposite know. The matter of productivity is one which must be given great thought and attention, and, as the Prime Minister announced recently, it is a matter which will be the subject of much thought and also action in the near future. Much has been i ll said about it and much has been done aibout it in Great Britain and the United The Leader of the Opposition spoke o m about incentive methods in general. Addressing himself to me across the table, m he said that I was aware that not more than one third of industry in the United ill States of America worked under a system of incentive payments. That figure is almost precisely correct so far as my goes. A percentage between 30 per cent, and 40 per cent, of American industry is working under incentive payment schemes, but probably well under 10 per cent, of Australian industry is so working. In the last few years surveys have been made concerning the advantages of certain Australian incentive systems. I think particularly of one that was conducted in Victoria about two years ago. In that case five or six well qualified industrialists inquired into incentive schemes operating in Victoria. They found that in practice over the years incentive schemes in which 15,000 or 16,000 workers are concerned had resulted in the workers' earnings increasing to between 10 per cent, and 75 per cent, above the award rates. The workers' earnings increased by an average of about 28 per cent, above the award rates. It was also found that the schemes had resulted in a 20 per cent, to 50 per cent, increase in production. Moreover, the schemes were proved to have been not detrimental to the health of the workers or to the quality of the products. In fact, the schemes had achieved remarkable results for the workers, the managements and the community in general. This is clearly not the time to discuss at length, incentive payments or any other encouragements to productivity, hut I hope that honourable members opposite will not allow their minds to close against the opportunity which exists for the introduction of incentive schemes in Australia. I expect that a number of honourable members have read the recently written book by Walter Scott, who is one of Australia's foremost authorities on incentive schemes and on many other related productivity matters. He has written a monumental volume on productivity in Australia, which I commend to honourable members who have not yet had an opportunity of reading it.",27
83,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"What guarantee have we that incentive payments, if introduced now, will continue when labour becomes plentiful? Mi . CASEY - Incentive schemes 1 generally take that matter into account. Incentive schemes are not by any means new. It is well known that they were much abused 20 and 30 years ago, to the detriment of the workers, but since then industry has become much wiser and the modern incentive scheme is introduced, with the consent of the unions and the workers, only after months of study. There are all possible safeguards to ensure that it shall work fairly to the men and the management. The modern incentive scheme is not put into operation, as were some of those of 20 or 30 years ago, after a mere week or two of thought. It is instituted only after many months of consideration. If there is any doubt in the minds of the. management or the man about the fairness of the scheme and what will happen when production is increased or when prices fall or when labour becomes more plentiful, then the scheme cannot succeed. Such carefully prepared incentive schemes have succeeded in Britain, America and to a lesser degree in Australia. There is vast literature on this subject, and the introduction of incentive schemes is almost 'a profession. My only fear is that incentive schemes will be hurriedly introduced and that they will therefore fail. The one or two dozen examples that I have in mind which are operating in Australia, have taken six or eight months to work out between management, union, men and productivity experts.",28
84,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Has this Parliament any legislative power to prevent the abuse of incentive systems?,28
85,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"There is a good deal of literature on that matter, for it has been f ully discussed.",28
86,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,But has this Parliament the power?,28
87,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I do not intend to be sidetracked on this matter to which I have referred. I am trying to establish that incentive schemes are not inventions of the devil. They can be of great advantage to both labour and management as well as to the country as a whole. They can also raise the general living standards of the community. I shall not impose upon the committee at any greater length on this matter, except to say that towards the end of his speech the Leader of the Opposition spoke in terms which gave me some hope. He spoke of the need in this community for tolerance, understanding ancl confidence. His plea was rather brief, but I was very pleased to hear it, and I venture to support it ; but not in any narrow field. I believe that Australia suffers probably more than any other country from schisms, divisions and antagonisms in a very wide field. There is too much mutual antagonism, for our comfort, between various sections of the Australian - community. I believe that we could introduce a much greater degree of trust into our relationships, and eliminate the distrust which is now so widespread and so immensely to our disadvantage. In the sphere of Gommonwealth and State relations it is essential for the Commonwealth to reach a better understanding with the State governments. If that does not happen, the departments for which I am responsible for the time being will suffer immensely. I am trying in my particular sphere to create conditions of confidence and trust between the departments which are my responsibility and the State governments with which they have to deal. There are certain sections in Australia which have a vested interest in discontent and have had it for many years. Even in this chamber things said by honourable members opposite from time to time are extremely harmf u l to our community. I do not refer to what they say against the Government, because the task of the Opposition is to oppose. So long as honourable members opposite direct their shafts at the parties which make up this Government, good luck to them. But they begin to do harm and damage to Australia when they say things directed towards causing distrust and misunderstanding in the country between management and men. and between capital and labour.",28
88,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The right honourable member knows that when such things are said they are well founded.,29
89,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I do not know that they are well founded, other than in exceptional instances. The attitude of honourable members opposite is the well-known one of pars pro to to. Mistaking the part for the whole, taking some small abuse and blowing it up to make it appear to be universal, is the oldest political trick in the world.",29
90,Mr GRIFFITHS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The bosses every day.,29
91,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am not saying anything in defence of the bosses. If I were called upon to say upon whom the greater degree of responsibility rests for increasing production, I should say that it rests upon management.",29
92,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,It is about time that that was said.,29
93,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I have made that statement on dozens of occasions and have published it in a book. Our greatest chance of increasing production lies in the improvement of management. That does not mean, however, that a great responsibility does not rest upon the trade union movement.",29
94,The DEPUTYCHAIBMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL," Order ! The Minister's extended time has expired. MT . POLLARD (Lalor) [ 4 . 6 ] - In the limited time allowed under the Standing Orders, it is exceedingly difficult for honourable members to deal thoroughly with a comprehensive document like the budget. In a budget debate honourable members inevitably are impelled to reply to statements that have been made by preceding speakers. I propose to reply to some of the remarks that were made by the Minister for National Development (Mr Casey). He concluded his speech by saying, in effect, that it was regrettable that we in the Parliament seem to be unable to refrain from indulging in abuse. However, during the greater part of his speech he poured abuse upon the Chifley Government, and in doing so gave utterance to several falsehoods. He said that the present Government assumed office at a time when the morale of the Australian people was exceedingly low, and added that the Government was faced with the task of reestablishing confidence and stability. He went on to laud the effort of the present Government in obtaining a dollar loan. The fact is that when it assumed office Australia was enjoying a period of unprecedented prosperity. It took over responsibility when the Chifley Government had successfully demobilized more than 1,000,000 ex-service men and women and had practically completed the task of rehabilitating and training them with the do it result that the services of thousands of additional artisans and skilled professional personnel were made available to the Australian economy. That result was achieved solely through the success of the Ohifley Government's scheme for the rehabilitation of ex-service personnel. Usually, persons versed in business affairs point to the share market as an indicator of a country's prosperity and of the degree of confidence that exists in it. Any one who would say that when the Chifley Government went out of office the share market was not buoyant, that the country was not prosperous and that there was not ful l employment in Australia-that happy result was achieved for the first time in our history-woul d be exceedingly blind. While the Minister was speaking about the need to provide incentive payments in industry in order to encourage greater production, I made a cursory mental survey of industrial development in Australia during the last few years. The Minister would be well advised to do likewise. During the regime of the Chifley Government some of the greatest industries that this country now possesses were firmly established, mainly as the result of the magnificent assistance that that Government rendered to them. When Bruck Mills (Australia) Limited established its industry at Wangaratta, did it not have the greatest confidence in the Chifley Government which was in office at that A Labour government was in office when an Australian organization, General Motors-Holden's Limited, manufactured the first complete car to be made in Australia. It owed much of its success to the assistance and encouragement that it received from the Chifley Government. The Minister and his colleagues need reminding of these facts. When Labour was in office enormous capital in dollars and sterling were invested in undertakings in Australia. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, with the assistance of a Labour government, established its immense chemical works near Sydney. I participated in negotiations that enabled that company to acquire boilers that had been installed in the power alcohol distillery at Warracknabeal. As the result of similar negotiations, valtiable' plant had been used in the manufacture of munitions was transferred to private enterprise. Yet the Minister has the effrontery to say that, when the present Government took over, the morale of the Sir. Pollard. Australian people was low and that the Ministry was confronted with the task of restoring confidence and stability. That is sheer propaganda,- The Chifley Government assisted the International Harvester Company of Australia Proprietary Limited at Geelong to acquire dollar goods with which to establish its huge tractor project. It is true that the present Government has given further assistance to that organization, but the project was actually commenced when the Chifley Government was in office. That Government also assisted the great Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which is probably the most efficient private organization in Australia, by arranging dollar finance to enable it to import its tinplate strip mill. The Chifley Government actually suggest - d to General Motors-Holden's Limited that it should manufacture a complete motor car, and today Holden cars which are being turned out by Australian workmen are to be seen on roads in all parts of the Commonweal th. The Minister harped about lack of enterprise, the low morale in the community and the need to increase our power resources. The Minister for time ? Works and Housing in the Chifley Government (Mr Lemmon) established a record that the right honourable gentleman who has succeeded him will never emulate."" He succeeded after 50 years' talk by conservative governments in inaugurating the great Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power scheme. The right honourable gentleman also said that the Chifley Government had commenced the dog-fights with the State governments, but his predecessor (Mr. Lemmon) was the first Minister to succeed in bringing into line the States that were directly concerned in that project.",29
95,Mr CASEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Unde r the Commonwealth's defence power.  ment with the State governments concerned. When the Snowy Mountains that hydro-electric power scheme was placed before the Parliament honourable members opposite who were then in Opposition were hostile to it. They not only criticized the Chifley Government for using the Commonwealth's - defence power for that purpose bat also said, in effect, that when they were returned to office they would alter the terms of the legislation under which that project was inaugurated. Have they <lone so, or will they do so? Wo! Like the promise to put value hack into the - t l, that undertaking was a hollow sham. The people were deceived. The Minister knows in his own heart, if he is f r a n k with himself, that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act represents a magnificent achievement by the Chifley Government and that he will not attempt to alter one line of it . I remind the honourable gentleman of something else'. For many years, in peace-time, the wheat-growers were, unable to get a nation-wide marketing scheme for their product, but finally a Labour government lined up every State government, for the first time in Australia's history, and succeeded in enacting a wheat stabilization plan. I l gained the co-operation of anti-Labour governments in some of the .States. One of the greatest tributes that could be paid to that achievement is thu fiict that the present Minister for Commerce and Agriculture MCEwen) has promised the farmers that, he will extend the scheme for a. further period of five years. Everybody knows that, the present Leader of the Opposition, when he was Treasurer, supplied the financial needs of the States so effectively that they were able to obtain labour and matnr'uils to put extensive public, works in hand. The facts are undeniable. It is of no use for the Premiers to ask for millions of pounds annually if they are unable to spend such sums. Competent, officers of the Treasury and the Department of Works and Housing assert that, the States would not, be able to make full use of larger grants than have been made availableto them, and the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) recently reminded the Premiers of that fact. I do not believe that any State government, whether liberal or Labour, can expend even the full amount of the money allocated to it this year by the Menzies Government. The achievements of the Chifley Government provide no evidence of any dogfights with the States. The only dogfights of which I am aware have been engendered by the ever-increasing insistence of this Government that the workers are not pulling their weight. Honourable members opposite have revived the old slogan on production, and alleged statesmen have been talking about production and incentive schemes for generations in all sorts of circumstances and in all forms of society. It is strange that the Government and its supporters still harp on the same worn theme. I believe that every man should pull his weight, but only the workers are blamed by this Government for the weaknesses in our economy. Production has always been supposed to be a cure-all f of our economic ills. I remind honourable members of a debate that took place in the House of Commons in 1932, when both Australia and. the United Kingdom were in the depths of an economic depression. T h irty per cent, of the workers in Australia were unemployed and an equally disastrous state of affairs prevailed in the United Kingdom. Those conditions were in marked contrast to conditions today, when we have full employment in Australia. Yet at that (Mr time the howl was. "" Produce, produce, produce! "" Mr Amery, a Conservative politician in the United Kingdom Parliament, said in the House of Commons in .1.932The one thing that mutters today is produetion. And Dick Casey still says so!",30
96,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Order  right honourable gentleman. The Minister for National Development still say? that, production is the cure-all for every economic ill . Mr Amery continuedAnd that depends on two closely interrelated lines of policy. The first is our fiscal policy and the second is our monetary policy. That howl is still being raised in Anstralia. The workers of Anstralia are reluctant, in many instances, to produce more unless they are assured by their employers that they will receive a f a ir proportion of the increased production. The responsibility is on the employers to offer inducements. I have observed that when employers offer inducements they got in return loyalty and increased production +'rom the Australian worker who if the best worker in the world.",31
97,Mr KEKWICK,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Does the honourable gentleman support, incentive payments ?  takes greater returns from his industry, the proportion left for the wage-earners will, ^decrease. The reverse also applies. That is inevitable under our present system, and the fact should be obvious to the honourable member. While that system is maintained, there must be a continuing conflict between employers and employees. Our arbitration system has from time to time increased the employees' share of the returns from production, and some Christian and well-disposed employers have voluntarily increased the returns to their workers. Such employers are getting good results in industry. However, fights between employer and employee will continue as long as our present system exists and there will be unceasing industrial trouble. These facts are obvious, but they should be emphasized. The situation will not be rectified until ownership of all industry is shared with the workers. Everybody who has worked as a selfemployed person or who has watched other Australians working for themselves in any capacity must realise that Australians will produce more in that capacity than they produce when they are working for an employer. As a primary producer for many years, I worked on Saturdays and even, he it said to my shame, on Sundays.' T did so because I was working for myself. I would never work on Saturdays or Sundays for an employer. The repeated complaint by the Government that production has decreased is an unwarranted slur on the Australian worker. It is not supported by facts. Professor Copland has pointed out that over-all production in Australia has increased hy 12-J per cent. sii?ce the beginning of World War I I . It is true that the production of luxury goods has been accelerated to the disadvantage of the production of basic commodities, but the fact is that Australian workers are producing at a higher rate today than at any other time in the nation's history. Fr. TRELOAB - Bricklayers , too?  labouring work for afirst-classbricklayer. T h f t tradesman, working on a chimney, laid 470 bricks for the day.",32
98,Mr TEELOAB,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"That sort of thing isagainst union rules;  ber knows little about the work of laying bricks, although he has: been exploiting people in the electorate that he represents by selling bricks. Last night the Prime Minister quoted voluminously from the opinions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court judges in the basic wage case and played on the theme that, if wages were increased and hours were reduced, prices would go up. The right honourable gentleman was implying, because he did not have the courage to say so directly, that wage increases and reductions of hours were undesirable in our economy. He did not emphasize that the judges had pointed out that the remedy for-price increases which flowed from increased wages and reduced hours of labour was political. Because of that fact,, the learned gentlemen were unable to point out that the present economic situation resulted from the failure of the Government to put value back into the Â£1. However, it is obvious that the judges were pointing the bone fit the Government. An immense volume of production by Australian workers has heen unrecorded in recent years. I made a survey recently, and I found that many workers were engaged in spare-time work, that was of great value to the community. In one locality of which I know something, five men are building homes for themselves at week-ends. In summer montlis, they will work every evening until dusk. The truth is that Australian Avorkers are the best in the world when they are given the proper incentives. Unfortunately, the only incentives that are offered to them in industry today are those for which they have had to fight, mighty hard.",32
99,Mr TURNBULL,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"But the honourable member is opposed to incentive schemes.  tive that Australia could offer to its wool producers today would not be big enough. But a few days hence, when the wool sales deduction legislation is being debated in this chamber, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) will either absent himself or openly give his support to a sectional tax that will - take from the wool-growers one-fifth of tlieir gross incomes, six, eight, ten or - even twelve months before their tax obligations fall due. What sort of incentive is that? Of all industries in Australia, the wool industry is the one that serves us best by financing our imports. It makes possible the importation of dollar - equipment. The rapidly increasing demand for Australian wool in the United States of America makes it almost unnecessary for the Government to put itself in pawn for dollars. Yet the Government has humbled itself so abjectly that, accordSoon ing to reports, the Governor of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will visit us in order to give us the once-over and ascertain whether we are using the dollar loan as we ought to use it. The Minister for National Development said that the Leader of the Opposition was opposed to the dollar loan. That is not strictly correct. The Leader of the Opposition was critical of the dollar loan and said that the necessity for it might have been averted. I agree with him. It was my privilege to act as a member of the dollar committee of the Chifley Government over a long period, and I know of no really deserving basic industry in Australia that did not obtain an allotment of dollars sufficient to meet its essential needs at that time. The fact is that the Chifley Government brought as many crawler tractors and other items of heavy equipment into Australia as were available in the United States of America. At one period we could not have obtained any additional agricultural tractors from America even if we had been able to command an additional 100,000,000 dollars. Some of the importing firms in Australia were absolutely unable to obtain more tractors from their principals in the United States of America. Our difficulties were not caused by dollar shortages then. They were caused by a shortage of equipment in the United States of America. I repeat that no industry in Australia was starved of essential dollars.",32
100,Mr TURNBULL,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What about petrol?  ducer in the electorate that the honourable member represented was able to obtain petrol in generous quantities for his genuine requirements.,33
101,Mr TURNBULL,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"That is not true.  was suffered can be construed only as a scathing commentary upon the effectiveness of the honourable member as the representative of the electors in his division. This Government pandered to selfish motor cyclists and pleasure seekers to the detriment of the Empire dollar pool. It was able to abolish petrol rationing only by virtue of fortuitous circumstances. after it came into office, the United Kingdom Government was able to make arrangements with the United States Government and the oil interests for the manufacture of tankers in the United Kingdom as an offset against dollar expenditure on oil and other requirements. Members of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party sneer at the assistance that was granted by the preceding Labour Government to the United Kingdom, yet they have not an enviable record in that respect. The present Government pandered to the selfish instincts of the Australian people when it abolished meat and butter rationing.",33
102,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"It is antiBritish.  At least, the Chifley Government did not dangle before the eyes of the people during the last general election campaign a succulent bait in the form of a promise to abolish meat and butter rationing. We learn today that the people of the United Kingdom are as urgently in need of meat and butter as they were a considerable time ago, and that their position is almost desperate. I am stating facts.",33
103,Mr DAVIS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"What action did the Labour Government take to provide meat for Great Britain?  give the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Davis) that information. The Labour Government introduced meat rationing, and retained it throughout its term of office. By adopting that policy, it incurred the hostility of the honourable member for Deakin, and of the selfish interests that he represents. The Labour Government constantly had them on its doorstep, advocating the abolition of meat rationing. I realise that meat rationing i i exceptionally difficult to operate, and that some people suffered as a result of its introduction, but I did not hear of a butcher going bankrupt for reasons attributable to it . However, I have heard of people in the United Kingdom being nn the verge of starvation because they have not sufficient food. The Chifley Lahour Government continued butter rationing in order that Australia might supply greater quantities of that commodity to Great Britain , and those increased supplies had a. beneficial effect upon the general health of the people of that country. AVhat is more, we did not abolish butter rationing in order to win votes at a general election. Yet this Government was no sooner in the saddle lhan it abolished meat and butter rationing. A few wfoks ago, it abolished rice rationing, at a time when people in Korea were dying from starvation. The Government made the decision to abolish rice rationing in order to pander to a few selfish interests here. Afembers of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party, when they were in Opposition, frequently spoke of their loyalty to the United Kingdom, and urged the preceding Labour Government to grant additional assistance to that country. The Labour Government retained meat and butter rationing in order to help the people of the United Kingdom, and, in addition, made gifts in cash totalling Â£45,000,000. The record of the present Government is not comparable with that of the preceding Labour Government in that respect. I now wish to refer to the Government's defence programme. The Chifley ment realized that we were living in a world in which war could occur. co-operated with the United Kingdom and with other countries that were interested in the defence of Australia and of other parts of the world. We prepared defence plan that would have involved expenditure of Â£250,000,000 over a period of five years, or an average of Â£50,000,000 a year. The Government has announced a. "" pepping-up "" of defence expenditure, aud, during the current financial year, committed to an expenditure Â£S3,000,000. The Prime Minister announced that, in future, members  the Australian services will be enlisted for service anywhere in the world.",33
104,Mr KEKWICK,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Why not ?  that system.,34
105,Mr TRELOAR,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The honourable member used to believe in it .  believe that any one sliould be forced to serve abroad,34
106,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,They will volunteer to serve abroad.  blank cheque when I enlisted for service in World War I . I knew where I would be sent.,34
107,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Was that possible?  would serve. But this Government proposes to enlist men to help extinguish a conflagration anywhere in the world at any time. I regard that decision as regrettable, becanse - members of the existing forces, particularly those in the older groups, will withdraw from them. Others will not enlist for service anywhere in the world in the numbers that are expected by the Government, because they do not know what may be involved. Had the Government continued the defence policy of the Chifley Government, whilst increasing rates of pay and making conditions of service more attractive, Australians would have reacted as they did in the past, that is to say, they would have enlisted for service in Australia, and if a conflagration were to occur abroad, they would have responded as the members of the first Australian Imperial Force and of the second Australian Imperial Force Governresponded, and would have flocked in great numbers from the militi a forces to We volunteer for service abroad. That has been the experience in this country in the past. Australians have always resisted conscription. During World War a II . , the government of the day introduced the a modified form of conscription, under which members of the militia forces became available for service in a prescribed area north of Australia. The Labour party did not like that change. The Menzies is Government has done the greatest disof service that has ever been done in respect has of attracting Australians to enlist in the of forces. Men who would have enlisted for home service, and who would have transferred to an expeditionary force if hostilities broke out abroad six months, a year or five years hence, will not enlist, or even volunteer to undergo military training. [Extension of time granted.] That will be the inevitable outcome of this Government's defence policy. T was u member of the citizen forces before World War I . I volunteered for service in the Australian Imperial Force, but I knew where I would be sent in the .1.014-18 ""scrap"".",34
108,Mr WHEELER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Did the honourable member really know that?  conflagration was, and I had a capacity to reason, which the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Wheeler) evidently does not possess.",35
109,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Was the honourable member sent to France?  Belgium and France.,35
110,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Did the honourable gentleman object to being sent overseas?  Supply (Mr Beale) will have an opportunity to make his contribution to this debate.,35
111,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable member cannot answer my question.  anywhere in the world during World War I . , but I knew where the fighting was taking place. I regret that the Governmeut has made a grave mistake in its defence policy, and I advise it to reconsider its decision. The Government is granting substantial subsidies in respect of butter, tea, wheat and woollen goods for use in Australia, but it has abolished the subsidy that was paid for years on superphosphate. In my opinion, that subsidy wa3 one of the greatest incentives to primary producers that this country has ever known. According to statements that we hear from time to time, the Government' firmly believes in the policy of granting subsidies to various industries. I point out to the chamber that the budget papers clearly reveal that the only reason why the Government is paying increased subsidies on butter and wheat is that the prices authorities in the States would not allow the increased cost of producing those commodities to be passed on to the consumers. It will be f u t i l e for the Government to tell this Parliament or the public that it is paying increased subsidies on butter and wheat out of kindness of heart. In Statement No. 9 of the budget papers, the details are given of various subsidies, including the estimated payments for 1950-51 compared with the actual expenditure on them in the last financial year. The estimated subsidy expenditure this year on butter, cheese and processed milk products is Â£11,300,000, compared with an actual expenditure in 1949-50 of Â£8,008,500. For some years, the preceding Labour Government paid a subsidy on butter at the rate of 6d. per lb. in order to maintain the price to the Australian consumer at a reasonable level, and, later, approved a guaranteed price to butter producers. It is true that, after the expiration of a year, that Government asked the State prices authorities to pass on to the public an increase of the cost of production, because it was considered that a subsidy of nearly 7d. per lb. was an adequate measure of assistance at that time. However, the present Government claims that it is paying a subsidy of nearly l i d . per lb. to butter producers out of sheer kindness of heart. The budget papers contain the following interesting statement:The home-consumption prices of butter, cheese and processed milk products are being held at a level lower than is necessary to give the farmer his guaranteed return, and unless the State Prices Ministers agree to a rise in home-consumption prices, the increases in cost of production which have been established in respect of 1950-51 will have to be met by subsidy. The lifting of butter rationing also adds to the cost of the subsidy. In respect of locally consumed butter and cheese, the present rate of subsidy is 10.9d - per Ib. commercial butter basis. The reference to wheat also interests me. It is as follows:In accordance with the Commonwealth's guarantee to the wheat industry the return to growers, in respect of wheat consumed in Australia from the 1949-50 crop, was increased by 5d. per bushel as from lst 'December, 1949, to cover, a rise in the cost of production. The Government decided to subsidize this increase rather than allow the effect to pass into the price of basic consumer goods. When that decision was made, a general election was pending, and it was not considered that the prices authorities would allow an increase of costs to be passed on to the consumer. I note that the subsidy for prefabricated houses in this financial year is estimated at Â£1,500,000. We cannot object to that provision; we can only applaud it, because it will make possible a reduction of prices. The Government proposes to retain the subsidy on tea that was granted by the preceding Labour Government. The provision of an amount of Â£20,000,000 as a subsidy on woollen goods for home consumption is fully warranted , but I do not know how the 1 Government will ensure that that benefit shall be passed on to the purchasers of those materials. The charges that are made by wholesale and retail houses will need to be. effectively policed. However, the granting of that subsidy is desirable. Perhaps I shall be permitted to remark, at this point, that it is strange that some time before the Treasurer presented his budget, publicity was given to the so called Copland plan, and we were told that wool-growers would be subject to a levy of 33$ per cent, on the proceeds from the sale of their wool, and that the funds so collected would be devoted to financing a subsidy on woollen goods consumed in this country.",35
112,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Perhaps Professor Copland told the honourable gentleman that, but the Government did not.  cussions in the Cabinet. The Australian Country party wing of the Government objected to that proposal, and the Liberal party ran away from it. In my opinion, the plan was bad, bnt the Government has substituted the greatest sham proposal that has ever been devised in the history of the Commonwealth. The wool sales deduction will be imposed upon a section of primary producers who should be given the incentive to produce. It will be a sectional levy. It is true that the incomes of wool ducers are buoyant, but the Government proposes to impose the wool sales deduction on their gross returns, whereas a levy, if it must be made, should be imposed upon the net returns. I note that the Government is not attempting make brokers, who charge the same rate of commission today as they charged when the price of wool was 8d. or 10d. per lb., subject to the wool sales deduction.. The income of the woolbroker has risen in proportion to that of the wool-grower^ yet he will not be required to make a contribution. Many people engaged in various forms of business are receiving' fabulously high incomes that are addingto the inflationary trends. But the wool grower alone must pay the wool salesdeduction, which is a payment of tax in advance. By that crooked method, the - Government expects to extract Â£103,000,000 from the wool-grower, and expend it as revenue. If the Government is genuinely desirous of combating inflation, it may adopt various methods, such as increasing the incidence of taxation on a graduated scale, and keeping excess moneys out of circulation. Of course, the Government could have adopted the Copland plan, although I do not advocate that. The proposal which the Government has adopted, however, to make a special deduction from the incomes of wool-growers will prove to he no more than a snare and a delusion. There are, of course, hundreds of individuals in all spheres of business activity who are making considerable profits. Lf the Government is justified in taking surplus profits from the wool-growers, why does it not take similar action in respect of all other people who are making large profits ? What is the reason for the discrimination, which is fantastic? The wool sales deduction does not discriminate between the wealthy graziers and the strugglers. Because of the high prices paid for wool, many small farmers and dealers have gone into the sale yards and paid as much as Â£6 and Â£7 a head for sheep, and most of those individuals will need every penny that they can get from the sale of their wool. The Prime Minister, in the course of prohis speech last night, had a great deal to say about the wheat-growers, who Â»make available a large quantity of wheat such for home consumption at low prices. However, the point is that that arrangement was made as the result of an agree to ment between the Chifley Labour Government and the wheat-growers of Australia, which was approved at a poll of tLe wheat-growers throughout Australia, under which the Government guarantees that wheat-growers shall receive a certain price for their wheat in the event of the overseas price falling below a certain figure. As an illustration of his argument that the wool-grower has no just cause for complaint the right honourable gentleman also mentioned the fact that the metal producers of Australia make available a proportion of their production for sale in Australia at a reduced price, and pointed out that the wage-earners who pay tax suffer some disability because a portion of their wages is withheld from them in order to pay their income tax. However, what the Prime Minister deliberately omitted to say was that every wool-grower",36
113,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL, Order ! The honourable member's extended time has expired.,37
114,Mr WILSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Sturt) [4.46] - The budget presented by the Treasurer (Mr. Eadden) indicates the very remarkable recovery that has taken place in our economy since the present Government assumed office, and that impression is confirmed by statistics which I have abstracted from the latest return that I have been able to obtain from the Commonwealth Statistician-. Every business indicator shows that a most remarkable improvement has occurred in our economic position during, the last ten months. For example, the number of wage and salary earners in employment in May, 1949, was 2,451,000, and by May, 1950, the number had increased to 2,544,000, an increase of 93,000. The average weekly earnings of wage and salary earners also increased by 19s. 6d. during that period. It is clear from the judgments of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the recent basic wage case that the basis upon which the general increase of f l a week was granted by the court was not, as has been suggested by members of the Australian Labour party, the needs of the people, but the general economic condition of the community. In other words, the court has decided what is fair and reasonable according to the state of our economy and according to the ability of the community to pay a higher basic wage. On page 25 of his judgment the Chief Judge statedFrom the June quarter 1949 to the June quarter 1950 the Commonwealth Statistician shows an increase in average weekly earnings of 11.2 per cent, in manufacturing and 11.1 per cent, in all industries. Mr Justice Foster, who delivered one of the majority judgments, made this observationThe general impression has come to me from the evidence, particularly from the official statistical evidence, that the economy is very prosperous, and that the prospects for the immediate future are bright-perhap s very bright-and that in the forseeable future no threat to its continued prosperity should be feared. Following that observation the learned judge made it perfectly clear that, in his opinion,, an increase of the basic wage by Â£1 a week was justified, not because of the needs of the people, but because of the general prosperity of the country and the ability of our economy to meet an increased wage.",37
115,Mr HAVIEN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,That was the view of only one judge.,37
116,Mr WILSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"But that judge was in the majority on the tribunal. I propose to illustrate the improvement that has taken place in our economy and in general living conditions since the present Government assumed office by citing some important statistics. In April, 1949, Unemployment payments totalled Â£22,062, but by April of this year they had declined to Â£12,597, which was a decrease of Â£9,465. Between June, 1949, and June of this year the value of our imports increased by Â£122,000,000, and during the same period the value of our exports increased by Â£74,000,000. The number of building permits granted in May, 1949, was 6,801, but the number granted in May last was 10,043. The number of motor cars registered between January and May, 1950, exceeded those registered during the corresponding period of 1949, the increase for the year being 106,724. The average weekly bank clearings, which are a very good indicator of general business activity, increased during that period by more than Â£38,000,000 a week. Savings bank deposits also increased by Â£47,000,000. Coal production in Australia for the twelve months ended July last was 1,000,000 tons higher than production for the preceding twelve months. In addition, the present Government has taken action to import more than 1,000,000 tons of coal, and, as a consequence, all our industries have been working full time during this year, whereas, last year, because of the lack of sumcient coal, during the administration of the Labour Government, a,large number of secondary industries had to be closed and a substantial number of men were unemployed. The improvement of the dollar position is one of the most spectacular achievements of the present Government. The dollar resources of the sterling area increased from 1.320,000,000 dollars in September, 1949, to 2,422,000,000 dollars at the 30th June last - Our former dollar deficit has been transformed into a dollar surplus. If honourable members will examine the Commonwealth Statistician's ngures for the last few months they will notice that for the first time in many years Australia has had a dollar surplus each month. The Treasurer has recognized that sections of the community are entitled share in the existing national prosperity Not the least important of the manyrate, benefits conferred on the community the Government's budgetary proposals, are the substantial increases proposed to be granted to recipients of war, war widows' and age pensions with which I propose to deal in some detail. T'he basic general, rate of war pension discharged service personnel will be 17s. increased from Â£2 15s. to Â£3 10s. a The basic rate for wives of war penv.hf'ii sioners will be increased from Â£1 10s. 6d. a week, and for children of incapacitated ex-servicemen from 9s. to ..lis. 6d. a week. The special rate war pension will be increased from Â£5 6s. a week. For many years ex-serviceWar men who suffered from total loss of speech were regarded as being entitled to only per cent, of the full pension. Honourable members will realise the very great bility that is suffered hy those who lost their speech. AU the representations that were made to the preceding Labour Administration on behalf of those unafter fortunate people to have their pension rate increased to the full 100 per cent, were rejected, and I am delighted that Mr Wilson. present Government has acceded to them, and that the budget provides for payment of the full pension. Similarly, those who suffer from total deafness also endure a frightful disability. Nevertheless, the previous Labour Government was not prepared to increase their pension rate from 70 per cent, of the full pension to 100 per cent. Because I wus a member of a deputation that waited upon the present Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) to urge the Government to increase the rate of pension payable to totally deaf ex-servicemen, I am more than pleased that the Minister has persuaded the Government to increase the pension from 70 per cent, to 100 per cent. Very substantial increases will also be granted to limbless ex-servicemen, details of whioh have already been given by the Minister for Repatriation and published in the press. The basic pension of . a widow of a deceased ex-serviceman will be increased to Â£3 10s. a week, and if she is more than 50 years of age, or has children under sixteen years of age, she will be entitled to an additional payment of 10s. a week. all Provision is also made in the budget for to payment of increased war pensions to - children of deceased ex-servicemen. The of pension payable in respect of the by first child of a deceased ex-serviceman will be increased from 17s. 6d. to 22s. a week, and in respect of subsequent children from 12s. 6d. to 15s. 6d. a week. In instances in which both parents of a child are deceased, the pension payable for for the child will be increased from 6d. a week in the case of a child under week. fourteen years, and from 20s. a week the child is over fourteen years of Â£1 4s. to age, to 40s. a week. Another anomaly which the previous Government refused to rectify was that to incapacitated ex-servicemen of World I . , who married after the lst July. 1938, received no pension in respect of 80 their wives or children. I still fail to understand why the lst July, 1938, was disaselected. Wliy should the wife of a have disabled ex-serviceman be under a disability because she married after a specified date? Why sliould children born a certain date be denied a pension? All representations to the previous Gorate vernment failed to have any effect, so I thrfind it exceptionally pleasing that the restriction has now been removed and that, provided a soldier is entitled to a pension, his wife and children also are entitled to pensions, irrespective of the dates of marriage and of birth. Provision is also made in the budget for the pensions of parents of deceased members of the military forces to be increased by amounts of up to 10s. a week. The budget further provides that a gratuity shall be paid to the widow of an ex-serviceman, when she re-marries, equivalent to a year's pension, which is about Â£182. Por several years complaints have been made about the meagre allowance provided for Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme trainees. Deputations which waited upon Ministers in the Labour Government to make representations about that matter were sent away unsatisfied. I am triad to know that, as a result of a deputation to this Government, provision has been made in the budget for an increase of 7s. 6d. a week in the allowances paid to reconstruction trainees. Widows' pensions also are to be increased by 7s. 6d. a week. The committee composed of ex-servicemen members of the Government parties recently made representations to the Government, that motor cars be made available for ex-servicemen who are double amputees. I am gratified that provision has been made in the budget for the supply of a car and an allowance of Â£120 per annum to cover registration fees, third party insurance and other expenses, to double amputees, so as to enable them to move about. Recreational transport allowances also are to be'provided for those whose movements are restricted owing to the loss of a limb. Submissions in favour of an extension of benefits to additional classes of ex-servicemen and the Repatriation Department having conferred on it discretionary powers in relation to the provision of extra, facilities to disabled ex-servicemen, were placed before the former Labour Government in October, 194.6, November, 1946, and October, 1948, but were rejected. Provision is made in the budget for the supply of special devices to be fitted to motor cars to enable disabled ex-servicemen to get about. The allowance for the purchase of books and equipment by trainees also has been substantially increased. Several applications were made to the Labour Govez-nment for' the institution of machinery to enable widows to receive their pensions by cheques so that they would not have to leave their homes and their young children in order to collect them in cash. The Labour Government refused these requests. The present Government has now met the wishes of the widows and other pensioners by making arrangements for them to receive their pensions by cheque. Veiy substantial beuefits have been provided for in the budget for age and invalid pensioners. The age pension is to be increased by 7s. Cd. from Â£2 2s. 6d. to Â£2 10s. a week, and the widows' pension by 7s. 6d. a week from Â£2 7s. 6d. to Â£2 los. a week. In addition, free life-saving drugs are now available to age and invalid pensioners, in common with all other members of the community. Their provision will be of considerable benefit to age and invalid pensioners who are at a stage in life when such drugs are more essential to them than to other people. The budget also provides for an expenditure of Â£2,000,000 pn general medical services and free medicines for age, invalid and service pensioners. I trust that the scheme under which these services are to be provided will be expedited. Prior to the last general election the present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) intimated that it would be the policy of a Liberal-Australian Country party Government eventually to abolish the means test, which is a definite discouragement of thrift. It penalizes those who have endeavoured to provide for their old age and against sickness. The right honourable gentleman made a definite statement about that matter in his policy speech, but he did not make the statement which certain members of the Opposition have attempted to attribute to him. He stated that during this term of the Parliament a plan would he prepared for submission to the people at the next general election, which woulcl have the effect of totally abolishing the means test. It would be futile to imagine that the means test could be abolished without cost. Its abolition will cost about Â£100,000,000 a year. I believe, however, that it should be, and must be, abolished, and that the people will be ready to make some contribution to a fund that will give them security in their old age and enable them to draw superannuation as a right and not as a charity. Already the Government, in accordance with its policy, has taken certain steps towards abolishing the means test. That test does not apply to the receipt of endowment for the first child of a family. The maximum permissible income of age and invalid pensioners has been increased from Â£3 12s. 6d. to Â£4 a week, that amount, of course, including the pension itself. The permissible income of married pensioners has been raised from Â£7 5s. a week to Â£8 a week. During the regime of the Labour Government a man who, when he was young, had taken out a life insurance policy for the benefit of his wife and children, found when he applied for the age pension that the surrender value of the policy was taken into account when his entitlement to the pension was being considered. Some time ago I led a deputation to the Minister for Social Services (Senator Spooner) who pointed out_the injustice of that provision and asked that the surrender value of such a life insurance policy, which was for the benefit of a man's dependants and not for his own benefit, should be totally disregarded in the application of the means test.. Although the Minister has not gone so far as we had hoped he would, he has exempted the surrender value of life policies up to Â£500 from calculations in relation to the means test for age and invalid pensions. That provision covers the great majority of cases of age pensioners, because few of them hold policies the surrender value of which exceeds Â£500. Another respect in which the means test has been eased is in relation to the receipt of sickness and unemployment benefits. In the past the pension of a war pensioner was taken into account when his entitlement to sickness and unemployment benefits was being considered. The amount that a grateful nation was paying to him for a disability that he had incurred in action could disentitle him from receiving either of those benefits. The means test has been so eased that a war pension is Mr Wilson. now to be totally disregarded when entitlement to unemployment or other benefits is being considered. The Government's policy is, as far as possible, to achieve stability of prices. The present Prime Minister in his policy speech made a statement that has proved to be probably the most misquoted statement ever made. I point out to honourable members opposite that it is what the right honourable gentleman said that matters, not what he was misreported to have said. Every honourable member opposite has had cause to complain occasionally that the press has misreported his utterances. We know that persons are misreported on many occasions, and that there are also occasions on which some particularly enthusiastic people exaggerate or extend the meaning of what a person has said. What the Prime Minister did say is set out in his policy speech, which was published in full inpractically every newspaper in Australia. It was also broadcast over the air and printed in booklet form and is correct in every detail. This is what he saidThe statistician will conservatively allow that the Â£1 of 1939 is now only worth 12s. 2d. in purchasing power, hut on the true cost of household requirements it would be nearer the mark to say it is worth only 10s. The greatest task, therefore, is to get value back into the Â£1, that is, to get prices down. It is absolutely untruthful for honourable members of the Opposition to say that the right honroable gentleman promised to put value back into the Â£1. Certain newspapers and supporters of the present Government might have said that but what the Prime Minister said is in black arid white. He said, in effect, that the greatest problem that any government could face was that of putting value back into the Â£1. That is the greatest problem that the Government of the United States of America has to face; it is the greatest problem that the Labour Government in England has to face; and it is the greatest problem that this or any other government in Australia could have to face. There is a lot of alarmist talk about prices. The American Consul in Adelaide returned recently from America and, after mentioning the very prosperous conditions in America The; DEPUTY CHAIEMAN Order!- The honourable member's time has expired'..",37
117,Mr LAZZARINI,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Werriwa) [5.16] I heard the present Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) deliver his policy speech prior to the last general election. Despite what is in. the hook from which the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) quoted, the right honourable gentleman made the clear promise that, if returned, his Government would put value back into the Â£1. He may have given the matter further thought before the policy speech was put into book form, with the result that it was altered, but that promise was made and millions of Australian people heard him make it. The honourable member for Sturt boasted about the prosperity of this country. It was not the present Government that brought about that prosperity. It has not been in power long enough to do so, and has not done enough to achieve it since it has been in office. There is no doubt that there is prosperity in this country for some persons. One may see evidence of that if one examines share lists and company returns and observes the huge profits which the Prime Minister has admitted are being made and on which he intends to impose an excess profits tax. The principle that the basic wage should be based on the capacity of industry to pay was introduced in the dire days of the depression, when the country could not alford to pay existing wages. The court was told that .before wages could be increased the economic condition of the country must be taken into consideration. Ever since then, the worker has been left in a parlous position. If there is another tendency towards depression in this country the basic wage, because it is computed in that manner, must fall and continue to fall. The honourable member for Sturt stated that the increase of Â£1 a week in the basic wage was granted not because of the needs of the worker, but because of the prosperity of the country. That is an astounding statement. This Â£1 will not pay the week-end meat bill of a man with a wife and a couple of children. It will not pay the increase in his rent nor [45] will it meet theincreases of the prices of potatoes and tomatoes, the latter of which have been selling at 4s. and os. per lb-.. When I discuss my home budget with the wife I sometimes wond'er how working people manage to live. The honourable gentleman referred to the dollar loan. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) that this loan is full of danger. When the Bruce-Page Government was in power it adopted a policy of "" borrow and bust"", the borrowing being from Great Britain, a country then under the control of capitalism. It borrowed so much that it left this country destitute of London funds. That was one of the causes of the beginning of the depression. Now that there is a Labour government in Great Britain this Government is switching over to capitalist America and is going to adopt the same policy in regard to borrowing dollars. If the Government continues with this loan policy - it will bring about similar results to those that were produced in 1929 by the Bruce-Page Government. As I listened to the wireless and newspaper reports of the Cabinet meetings that were held before the budget was introduced, I wondered how many budgets had been submitted to Cabinet. According to the newspapers, there were four or five. I should not be surprised if there had been a dozen. It is only because it is now so close to the end of the year and the Government can procrastinate no longer that it has brought down this muddled budget. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt) tried to blame the Opposition for the delay in introducing the budget, by saying that it had held up legislation in another place. The fact is that the Cabinet, for weeks and weeks, wrangled over the dollar loan, depreciation and other matters on which the Australian Country party and the Liberal party clashed. Principles incorporated in this budget contradict the inherent policies of both. Of the Government's attempts to deal with inflation in this budget it can be said that the mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse. There is not the slightest indication in the budget of anything that will in any way retrieve the economic position of the country. In these days of national stress and rising prices no economist is game to face up to the position squarely. It seems to me that they all follow the old, beaten track, as does the Government, because they suffer from that curse that has afflicted the human race down the ages- a craven fear of change. They are not prepared to test anything new which might alleviate the position. The honourable member spoke of unemJust ployment. There has been no unemploybudget ment in this country during the eight years that have passed since a Labour government took office. Speaking of depressions reminds me of the story an American professor of economy who, like the Ancient Mariner, used to hold people with his glittering eye and talk economy to them. One could not help but stop and listen to him as the wedding guest listened to the Ancient Mariner. profits. One day while walking through a park he saw a hobo sitting on a bench, so he went over and started talking cal economy to him. The hobo said, "" I had a drop of soup in the soup kitchen last night. I have had no breakfast and my clothes and shoes are all worn out. Will economy get me a job ? "" The profesin sor said, "" No. The function of political economy is not to get you a job but Mr. to tell you why you cannot get one"". That story illustrates the attitude of Government and its economic advisers. There seems to be a deep-rooted convicman tion in this country that when prices rise and an increase of wages is given, there must be another rise of prices. If that were so, the workers' position would come worse with every increase of wages. It has been proved beyond all doubt that when prices rise as a result of an inhe crease of wages, they rise to a much greater degree than do wages. I know of an increase of the wages of men in leather industry in Sydney. Experts locked calculated that this increase would raise the cost of the leather conalways tent of a pair of boots by l i d . , yet the price of boots went up by that Is. 6d. That is the sort of thing that happens in all industries. The condithe tions of the workers and their standard living have improved immensely since Hr. Lazzunm. was a lad. But if increased wages did not benefit the workers because prices rose in proportion, the wage-earners' position could never become better unless some other means to assist them could be found. Greater social services such as child endowment can improve the workers' conditions. Payments such as that are not reflected in prices.' If every wage increase given to the workers is to be offset by increased prices then living standards can certainly not be improved. prior to the presentation of the the Priine Minister (Mr Menzies) said that he woiild impose an excess profits tax. To impose such a tax will be of no use if there are no excess of profits. Therefore, the Prime Minister hnplicity admitted that excess profits are at present being made. In fact he intends to do the same thing that was done during war-time, that is, ensure that the Government shall get a cut. out of excess",41
118,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Th c Prime Minister is politigoing to share the loot.,42
119,Mr LAZZARINI,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Yes , that is so. I am not speaking now of profits made by retailers. The excess price is imposed where the goods originate, that is, their production or manufacture. Some time ago I mentioned a matter relating to Portus, a director of tutorial classes in the Workers' .Educational Association this of New South Wales. That gentleman reported that he had trained a young and encouraged hini to pass his accountancy examinations because he was a smart boy and came from a good family.  betion for him in one of the biggest business concerns in Australia. The boy had worked there for only a few months when  and said that he could not continue there because the concern kept two sets of hooks. the He said that one set, which was kept in a big safe, was for the benefit of the business, and the other, which was accessible, was kept for examination by the taxation officials. I suggest that sort of thing will continue under the regime of this Government. When war-time profits tax was in force I was of in business. On one occasion I visited I a warehouse with which I was connected and asked to see the accountant. I was infonned that he had left. Upon inquiry I was told that he had faked the books of the business and had thereby saved the fir m about Â£5,000 in war-time profits tax. Then he has misappropriated about Â£3,000 of that sum and had disappeared. The owners of the business could do nothing about his offence because, had they wished to do so, they would have had to admit to having defrauded the Taxation Department. Another thing which this Government seems to believe will put value back into the Â£1 is the sales tax on luxury goods. I cannot see how this will improve our economy hecause wealthy people will always buy luxuries whatever they may cost. Like the other actions and promises of the Government it will liave no stabilizing effect at all. The Prime Minister has stated that he intends to direct labour into essential industries. When the Chifley and Curtin Governments were forced to do that through the exigencies of war, honourable members of the Government parties said that the Labour party was pushing people round and niching their freedom from them. The right honourable gentleman, as a constitutional authority, should know that he has no power at all during peace-time to direct labour.",42
120,Mr WILSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,-The Prime Minister did not say that he would direct people to employment.,43
121,Mr LAZZARINI,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"He said that that was one of the things he would do to put value back into the Â£ 1 . That statement was published in the Sydney Morning Herald a few days before the budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr Fadden), and I suggest that honourable members should read it for themselves. Prime Minister said specifically that controls would be imposed in order to restrict the volume of labour entering industries of minor importance. Although I am not a constitutional lawyer, I say that the Government has no power to do such a thing. The Prime Minister also said that he intended to control basic materials, as was done by the Labour Government during the war. He has no constitutional power to control basic materials during peace-time. Any working man or woman in Australia can today move on at any time and take a different job. No government has any power to stop them, and the right honourable gentleman knows it . Perhaps the biggest joke of all those in the budget is the statement that there is to be a big savings campaign. If livin g costs continue to rise as they are doing at present the workers will have no savings that will enable them to participate in any such campaign. Although the Government has made so many promises about so many things, it has made no attempt to interfere with profits. Profits, right throughout our economic system, have been treated as sacrosanct. The worker is taken into the courts and almost stripped bare. He is forced to saj' what he pays for his hoots, socks and shirts, and how much tobacco he smokes and so on, but all that the boss needs to say, after the worker has succeeded by great labour in getting a small increase in his wage, is, "" We cannot afford to pay the awarded wage unless we put up our prices "". I shall cite a classic example to illustrate my point, although no doubt many younger honourable members will tliink that it is not true. I have mentioned it before in this chamber, but it is well worth mentioning again. The chairman of one of the first wages boards to be constituted in Sydney was a man named Edward Eiley, who was for some time the honourable member for South Sydney in the Australian Parliament. Certain workers applied to the board for a determination. They had to start work at 7 o'clock in the morning, work until tea-time, then go back after tea and dress the windows at night. They worked for 56 hours and sometimes for 60 hours a week. They sought increased wages The and fewer hours. The big trading concerns of Sydney opposed their application and swore before the board that their profits were such that if they had to paj' the wages sought they would have to increase their prices. Mr Eiley and one or two other gentlemen on the board demanded that an accountant be appointed to examine, under a pledge of secrecy, the books of these concerns. The accountant reported his findings to the chairman of the hoard, who .then said that every one of the business concerns had committed cold-blooded perjury. . Apparently another method heing adopted by this 'Government to put value back into the Â£1 is to increase the salaries of members of the judiciary. Those increased salaries are to be made retrospective to the lst July, 1950. Although the pensioners have not yet been paid their miserable increases I am quite certain it will not be made retrospective to the 1st July, in fact they will be lucky if they get it by the lst November. On the subject of national defence the Prime Minister made three broadcasts that were of such a nature that if anybody else had made them he would have been gaoled for sedition. The Prime Minister stated to the world that Australia was destitute of defence forces and would be a sitting shot for anybody who wanted to come and take it. The Minister for the Army, who is also Minister for the Navy (Mr Francis), made the' same proud boast to the world, that Australia lacked any defence. The honourable gentleman who was the Minister for the Interior, but is now the Minister for Defence (Mr MCBride), also warned us of our ""inadequate state of defences"". When challenged about that statement the Minister said that in any case nothing could be done to stop our press from proclaiming such things to the world. If such things were proclaimed to the world by the press of a nation behind the Iron Curtain, all those involved would be put up against a wall and shot. Yet the Prime Minister and other Ministers have made these astounding statements. I do not suggest that our defences are particularly strong, but my point is that the rest of the world should not be told of their weakness. Such action on the part of the Prime Minister and the Ministers whom I have mentioned was scandalous. They proclaimed to the world that Australia has no defences whatsoever.",43
122,The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,44
123,Mr TRELOAB,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Gwyddr) [5.46] The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) castigated the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Francis) hecause they told the world; as he put it, about the state of Australia's defences. It would appear that members of the Opposition are the only people in Australia who are not aware of the actual state of our defences; and, unfortunately, they do not seem to be very concerned about the matter. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) declared that that Australia was safer today than it had been during the last twenty years. It is useless for the right honoraible gentleman to shut his eyes to the facts. For the benefit of the honourable member for Werriwa, I point out that during the recent war the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford), when he was Minister for Air, addressed a public meeting at Tamworth and, in the course of his remarks, which were broadcast, gave the name of the airport at which he had landed, the name of the pilot of the plane and the name of the aircraft itself, as well as the current weather conditions and forward weather reports. When I drew his attention to those facts he replied, "" I did not say anything that mattered "". At that meeting the honourable member accepted money that had been subscribed by the people of Tamworth as a contribution towards the cost of an. aeroplane. I was of the opinion that all of the information that he broadcast was "" hush hush "" at that particular time. The debate was relatively refreshing until the honourable member for Werriwa dug up the depression. Most of his colleagues harped about putting value back into the Â£1. They tell that story day in and day out. The Government is endeavouring to put value back into the Â£1, and it will achieve that objective if it is not obstructed. The Leader of the Opposition, when he was Prime Minister, made an appeal for increased production. Apparently, he realizes the need for increased production and acknowledges that each employee should do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. We shall not succeed in putting value back into the Â£1 until we increase production. The first requisite in that respect is harmony in industry. We must establish that harmony at a time when a strongly organized body is endeavouring to destroy industry. For that reason the first step that the Government took upon assuming office was to deal with those disruptionists; hut, unfortunately, Opposition in the Senate refused to pass the Communist Party Dissolution Bill until after a delay of many months the threat of a double dissolution was held over its head. Now, members of the a day. Labour party are adopting the attitude that they will prevent the Government from putting value back into the Â£1. want to discredit it so that they can get back on to the treasury bench. They do not care what happens to Australia. If workers in essential industries adopt a go-slow poliey and fix dargs of production, the community generally will not derive any benefit from the increase of the basic wage that is to be impledictation. mented as from the lst December next, because, in the meantime, rising costs outstrip that increase. We must increase not only overall production, but also duction per man-hour. If harmony can be established in industry and workers arc not obliged, under instructions from Communist union bosses, to restrict their output, the full benefit of the increase will be reaped by the community. All sections, including employers, wish see that result achieved. Only a fool would desire that employees should be obliged to live on an inadequate wage. The Government is most anxious to estabmanagement lish harmony in industry and to maintain our present high standard of living. However, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said that it would not be able to do that cause the trade unions would not comunist operate with it. He said bluntly that the Government would not succeed in increasthe ing production. When I pointed out the need for bricklayers to lay more bricks a day, he sidestepped the issue. Brickto layers, under instructions from their union officials, are not allowed to lay more than 350 bricks a day, whereas bricklayer who knows his job is capable of laying 800 bricks a day. As, in doing so, he would work more steadily and more rhythmically than it is possible for to work under present conditions he would be less tired at the end of the day. When a bricklayer is instructed to observe a certain darg he reduces not only his own output but also that of the carpenter and the plumber. The same observation applies the to brickmakers. Brickmakers who are paid according to their daily output, are capable of making 1,500 bricks a day but they must observe their union's instruction not to produce more than 1,000",44
124,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Does not the wool-grower withhold his wool from the market until They he can get a higher price for it?,45
125,Mr TEELOAB,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am not making any complaint about the worker himself. Honourable members opposite have said that the Government wants to break the trade unions. I say advisedly that if trade unionists do not wake up, they will break themselves because their members are becoming tired of domination and Stoppages on the wharfs are the fault not of wharf labourers but will of the Communist union bosses who tell them what they must do. The recent oneproday strike on the railways in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia was a strike, not against the so-called capitalist, but against the transport authorities which represent the people. That strike was called without a ballot having been taken of the employees affected. Those to employees did not want to strike. The unions are adopting a similar policy with respect to the employees of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, the of which, the honourable mem highly in his speech this afternoon. He said that that company was doing a very good job for Australia. However, its beproduction is being held up because Comunion bosses will not allow the miners to produce sufficient coal to supply needs of the steel industry. The same Communist bosses ensure that sufficient crews shall not be available to man ships transport the steel produced. I do not believe that seamen really want to stay off ships. The fact is that they are a not game to offer as members of crews, because if they do so they will be marked men. We are told that the reason why more coal is not being produced is that him fewer miners - are now employed in the industry than were employed some years ago. The reason for that state of affairs is that many miners transferred to other industries because they were not allowed to earn as much money as they were capable of earning in the mines.",45
126,Mr GRIFFITHS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,But coal is mined under contract.,46
127,Mr TRELOAR,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"That may be so in some instances; but in most instances the miner is not permitted to exceed a certain darg. If the miner were given a free band more men would offer for work in the mines. We must face those facts if we are to succeed in putting value back into the Â£1. Nothing short of a national effort will solve this problem, and I believe that the Government will set an example in that respect. Honourable members opposite have said that the budget is inflationary. The Government has taken effective steps to halt inflationary trends. The honourable member for Werriwa, relying upon a newspaper report, said that the Government, intended to direct labour. Apparently, the honourable member is not capable of understanding plain words. The Government proposes to control capital issues in respect of luxury indusThoy tries and also to increase the rates of sales tax on luxury goods with the object of diverting the capital and labour employed in such industries to those that are more essential to our economy.",46
128,Mr CLAREY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,AVoul d the honourable member describe a radio receiving set luxury ?,46
129,Mr TRELOAR,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Yes . The Leader the Opposition gave a lengthy explanation of what his Government had done. I 1946, when he was Prime Minister, he declared that the golden age was just round the corner. I am afraid that the golden age had rounded the corner was disappearing in the distance before his Governmnt went out of office. At that time, 'Communist-dominated unions succeeded in reducing production. They destroyed the opportunity that was sented to this country to obtain markets overseas and to revert to a peace-time economy more quickly than could any other country, because Australia had suffered physical damage during the recent war. However, I believe that this country still has a chance to attain a golden age if we cut out all the bitter talk that we hear about the class war. Experience has taught us that whilst a country may win a war it may lose the peace. Honourable members opposite are amusing when they talk about the poor wool-grower and claim to be his friend. Not so long ago they were decrying the wool barons. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon) advocated that the Government should impose a tax on wool in order to subsidize the production of woollen goods. Yet, honourable members opposite now endeavour to make out that the prepayment of tax by the wool-growers under the Government's plan is harsh and unfair. As the Prime Minister fully explained the Government's plan, I shall not deal with it at this juncture.",46
130,Unknown,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,46
131,Mr TRELOAR,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The Opposition criticism of the pay-as-you-sell wool deduction scheme astonishes me. Had the Chifley socialist Government been in power, the wool-growers would have been dealt with in a vastly different manner. were concerned about rumours that were current before the Government announced its intentions. They were haunted, I believe, by recollections of the methods of the socialist government. This Government has merely placed them in the same situation as that of 2,500,000 wage-earners under the pay-as-you-earn income tax deduction system. Had the as a Labour Government been in power still, the Copland plan would have been forced of upon the wool-growers. The honourable member for Werriwa spoke critically of n the Government's advisers, but the advisors of the Chifley Government, from whose planning we liave suffered, would have recommended the adoption of the and Copland scheme which this Governmenr, rejected. Furthermore, the growers would have had to accept that scheme and like had it, of sheer necessity. I was amazed to hear the honourable premember for Lalor attack the new conditions of enlistment for service in the Army. The honourable gentleman has an excellent war record and wa.= not a very good soldier in World War I . I am sure that he must have changed his ideas very considerably .=ince he became u member of this Parliament and allied himself with the present Opposition party. "" Diggers "" of World War I . were prepared to serve anywhere in the world, and I believe that Australians today will be prepared to enlist in the Army under similar conditions, just as many have already enlisted in the Navy and the A i r Ii'oree. Australians are just as courageous and loyal today as they were in the past and I believe that they will be propared to serve their country, should the necessity arise, wherever they may be asked to serve. The honourable member for Lalor also mentioned anotlier subject which he may later wish that he had ignored, liie mentioned the sale of the boilers from the Wamjukniiboul power alcohol distillery which, as many honourable members will recall, was established in the electorate then represented by ;t gcnrJemnn who virtually hold the Laboui' government of the day in the palin of his band. The venture cost the nation about Â£1,000,000 and eventually the distillery was pulled down and the boiler - wore sold. The honourable member for Lnlor may already by regretting his reference to that subject, becanse the project was one of the failures of Labour's administration. It was generally considered that the distillery had heen erected so that Mr Alex Wilson would remain on side with the Labour fiovernment. I listened very attentively for minutes last night to the .= neech of Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ohifley",46
132,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I bet that the honourable gentleman learned something from it .,47
133,Mr TRELOAR,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Yes . For one thing. I learned that the right honourable gentleman was capable of making a host of excuses for his own administration. His remarks scarcely touched the budget, and they finished right along the Comout munist line. He attacked the government, of South Korea and the leader of that government. Apparently he has gotten that Dr Syngman Rhee led Koreans throughout the period of the - Japanese occupation of his country returned to lead the South Koreans after the war had ended. The Leader of the Opposition described as corrupt the national Governments of South Korea, and period the Republic of the Philippines. Those eastern governments could just as easily have attacked the Chifley Goverumeilt and described it as a corrupt government. The right honourable gentleman's remarks definitely followed the Communist line. AVhat force are those governments fighting today? They arc fighting communism. AVe did not hear anything from the right honourable member about the corrupt Indonesian Government, which is attacking the South Moluccas and Ambon, which were independent members of the United States of Indonesia until the new republic wa. j established overnight. He said nothing ahout the Governinent of Indonesia, but instead attacked the Governments of the Philippines and South Korea, which arc fighting communism. Mr HAY'JJN - Would the honourable, member say that Syngman Rhee was democratically elected ?",47
134,Mr TRELOAR,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I do not think that Eastern governments know anything about democracy, and I am sure that the socialist party, does not know anything about democracy. - However, the Leader of .the Opposition finished his speech on a very fine note. He said that he believed in tolerance and broad-mindedness. That sounded very encouraging, but it astonished me. I had formed a different impression of the right honourable member when I first became SO a member of this Parliament. During the the Address-in-Reply debate early this ). year, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr AVheeler) made some remarks which rather annoyed the Leader of the Opposition. 1 saw him move about, the Opposition benches and talk to a number of his colleagues, He came close to me, and I heard what he said. It was, "" We want to mark this fellow. We'll take it of hini later on "". That remark, I thought, revealed the smallest mind that I hacl ever known in my life. Yet the forsame gentleman talked last night about the tolerance and broad-mindedness! This budget has been prepared very and carefully. Members of the Opposition have said that it was recast seveal times, but that is all to the good. The intersituation changed swiftly in the during which the Treasurer (Mr . Fadden) was drafting it , and many other events, have affected it. Notwithstanding the fact that it had to be altered a number of times, I consider that the Treasurer has done a good job. It provides for the welfare of all sections of the community. I was particularly pleased to note in it reference to the plans that had been, made for the benefit of ex-servicemen, age pensioners, invalids and other deserving citizens. Those proposals have already been discussed by the honourable member for Sturt (Mr ""Wilson) and I shall not repeat what he said.. I conclude by saying that the' budget is good. I support it and commend it to all honourable members.",47
135,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Watson) [8.9] - All day today I have listened to various honourable members on the Government side of the chamber attacking the trade union movement of Australia with monotonous regularity. The class hatred that they preach is intended for the sole purpose of stirring up dissension throughout the trade union movement. The remarks of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr. Treloar), for one, almost made me ill . The tenor of his remarks was not unusual, of course, because he is a huge importer and has a large store in one of our big country towns. The only subject that he can think of is that of profit. The honourable gentleman chants from morning to night, "" The worker won't work. We want harmony in industry. We want more production"". But he does not know the first thing about production. The annual report of the Commonwealth Bank, to which I referred in an earlier debate in this chamber, shows that, notwithstanding the introduction of the 40hour week, production in Australia ha9 increased by 9 per cent. How these big merchants and wholesalers hate the 40hour week! They are favoured by a sellers' market at the moment and all that they want to do is make the worker produce more goods so that they can take it out of his hide and bleed the market of extra profits. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but Nemesis will overtake them. The Minister for National Development (Mr Casey) said that we should introduce incentive payment schemes so that the workers wonld produce more and goods would become cheaper. The right honourable gentleman did not know what he was talking about. Let us consider the situation in the clothing trade today. It is riddled with incentive schemes, but I challenge anybody to find any establishment in Sydney that can afford to sell clothing today more cheaply than it was sold five years ago. All sorts of little factories have been set up in back yards and motor garages with the object of breaking down trade union conditions. They are scattered all over the metropolitan area. Women work at rows of machines in big rooms to produce clothing by the mile. But are dresses and suits any cheaper than they were before? Certainly not! The manufacturers have a sellers' market and that is why we hear the continual cry for more production. Government supporters today have denied the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) to put value back into the f l . They have tried to lay a smokescreen in order to cloud the issue. Promises, like pie crusts, are easily broken, of course, but the Government and its supporters will not be able to disclaim responsibility for the undertaking that was given to the electors last December by the present Prime Minister. I have here a copy of a broadcast script that waB sent to me by courtesy of the right honourable gentleman. It is the script of a speech in which he saidLet us attack our tasks boldly. The greatest of them all, as I am sure you will agree, will be to arrest the alarming rise in costs and prices and so put value back into 'the money that you earn and spend. That speech was delivered by the right honourable gentleman on the 20th December last. Bursting with self-assurance and brimming over with vanity, he told the people what they should do. The change in his demeanor was sudden. He did not appeal to them with tears in his eyes, as he had done during the general election campaign. As soon as his hands grasped the reins of office, he began to tell the people what they should do. He made a series of broadcasts on Sunday evenings, until somebody told, him that listeners - were writing to thenewspapers stating that they were sick and tired of hearing him tell them what they should do. Even the Sydney Morning Herald, 'which cannot 'be accused of being sympathetic to the Labour party, risked the grave danger of hurting the right honourable gentleman's colossal vanity by suggesting to him that he should terminate those broadcasts, because the people were becoming weary of them. The Prime Minister heeded that advice, and, thank goodness, his voice has not been heard over the air on Sunday evenings for some time. During the last general election campaign, the right honourable gentleman assured the people that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, if returned to office, would abolish economic controls. Every one will recall that part of his policy speech in which he promised that a government under his leadership woulcl clip the wings of the bureaucrats. Tet, about a. fortnight ago. the right honourable gentleman had to crawl back into his shell, and break another ofhis pre-election promises, because the Government was obliged to re-establish the Capital Issues Advisory Board. That action was a tacit admission that the control of capital issues by the preceding Lahour Government was justified. The Minister for National Development spoke today of the wonderful dollar loan that the Prime Minister had contrived to induce the New York financiers to grant to Australia. He assured us that the loan would enable Australia to buy everything that would shift everything that required shifting in this country, but he omitted to inform the chamber that the loan bore interest at the rate of 3^ per cent, plus 1 per cent, commission. L i other words, the financial experts in New York, who "" get round "" Ministers when they visit the United States of America, took a rake-off of 1 per cent. Nor did the Minister mention that our former enemy, Japan, is able to negotiate dollar loans free of interest. I hope that, during this debate, a Minister will satisfactorily explain that anomaly. I now wish to deal with the proafter mise that was made by the Liberal party and by the Australian Country party during the last general election paign that, if they were returned office, they would put value back into Â£1.",48
136,Mr DALY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,That is a new phrase.,49
137,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The Government does not like it. Housewives are sick and tired of the Government's economic policy, because the Â£1 is rapidly losing its purchasing power. Mr J. W. Allison, who is the vice-president of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, and is not likely to be a supporter of the Labour party, told the annual conference of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia that prices were rising at a greater rate here than in any other country. He saidA publio, bewildered by the prices, seemed to be clinging to the pathetic hope that controls would keep down prices. Mr Allison also statedThe federal election result was a mandate to get rid of controls. Prices continue to soar, and the Government closes its eyes to the tragic consequences of the loss of the purchasing power of our currency. The constant worry of mothers, in their endeavours to buy food for their children from day to day, is undermining their health. What is the Government doing to honour its pre-election promise to put value back into the Â£1? The answer to that question is simple. It is doing precisely nothing. Once the budget is agreed to, the Government will seek shelter from criticism by closing the Parliament until next February.",49
138,Mr TRELOAR,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,O r until after a general election.,49
139,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Governmen t supporters would not welcome a general election.,49
140,Mr BROWN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Why does the Labour party avoid a double dissolution?,49
141,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"We shall have a double dissolution when we want it. Let Government supporters enjoy their present holiday in Canberra. Many of them will not return here after the next general election. The Treasurer (Mr Fadden), six or eight abortive attempts to prepare a budget that would relieve the sufferings of the people, precamsented to this chamber the breatht,n taking document that is now under the consideration. Why did the right honourable gentleman delay the introduction of the budget for so long? I thought that the millennium hacl been ushered in when this Government took office. The outstanding feature of: this anti-Labour Government's budget is that it is the usual betrayal of the workers. The Treasurer assured us that taxation methods would be simplified, and that taxes would be reduced. But what do we find?",49
142,Mr BROWN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,We find that taxes have been reduced.,50
143,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"F o r the information of the honourable member for MCMillan (M.r. Brown), I shall cite some of the ""substantial"" decreases of tax that will be granted under this budget. A man with a wife 'and one child, who is in receipt of an income of .Â£300 a year, would have paid 19s. a year in income tax under the previous system, whereas under the. proposed system be will pay 17s. a year, a reduction of 2s. a year. The budget will give him cause to rejoice! A man with a wife and child who is in receipt of Â£1,500 a year would have paid Â£236 under the previous system, but will pay Â£223 under the new scale. That, is an example of "" greasing the f at p i g "" . Mr TREI.OAR - I rise to order. I should like to know whether the honourable member for Watson is referring to members ot the Parliament, whose salary is Â£'.1,""I00 per annum.",50
144,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL, I do not think that the honourable member for Watson is referring to members of the Parliament.,50
145,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"T . ornit from my statement all members of the Parliament with the exception of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Treloar). A man with a wife and one child, who is in receipt of an income of Â£5,000 a year, will pay Â£39 less tax under this budget, than he paid last year. The outlook of the poor old worker, who stumbles along from day to day, is hopeless while an anti-Labour government is in office. The increases of sales tax will cause consternation amongst the ladies. The Treasurer must feel proud his decision to increase by 25 per has cent, the indirect tax on many sodiscourage called luxury item.?, such as face powder, rouge, lipstick, face, creams, hair lotions, nail polish, polish remover, bath powders and dozens of other preparations, many of which have become essential to every woman's toilet. The increased cost of those articles will impose an additional strain on the housewife's budget, and will place most of those toilet preparations beyond her reach financially. That statement cannot be denied. She will have to go without those little preparations which she likes to use every day. Even the busine-s girl's purse will be h it by the budget. She uses considerably more face powder and lipstick than the average housewife uses, ancl the increased cost of cosmetics and toilet preparations will make such inroads into her weekly earnings that she will be obliged to use fewer cosmetic. :, although she regards them as 1 essential. Toilet preparations are considered by the Government to be luxuries. Imagine, girls, you may have to do without cosmetics because? the new tax proposals of the Treasurer will place them beyond your means. Honourable gentlemen on posite laugh. They seem to for set that four honourable senators are ladies, and I believe that they will have a lot to say on behalf of the womenfolk of Australia when that chamber is considering the sales tax legislation. I realise that my remarks have caused considerable hilarity, hut the Government will find that the hardship imposed upon women by the increased sales tax on their cosmetics will bring about its downfall. The has overreached itself in its. enthusiasm to "" d o w n "" the working man and his wife and daughters. It wants to keep them on the breadline, where, in its opinion, they belong. I repeat that it is a serious matter for the average woman that cosmetics and toilet articles will be placed beyond her reach. The Treasurer has also decided that, radio receivers shall become luxuries. Because the Parliament decided some years ago that its proceedings should be broadcast so that the people of Australia could enjoy the luxury of listening to them-, the present Government, which fears that the people of Australia may of hear the wonderful message that Labour to "" put over the a i r "" , decided to people from listening to the parliamentary broadcasts by increasing the sales tax on radio receiving sets to such a degree as to place them beyond the reach of the average householder. Honourable members who take an interest in their electorates realise the implications of the proposal, unlike those who merely sit on their cushy seats in this chamber, wondering how long this has been going on, and who would not know what it is all ahout. Many members of the Parliament have received an enormous uumber of protests against the proposal to increase the sales tax on radio receivers and radio parts. In particular, I have received a number of protests from members of the farming community. I mention that fact for the benefit of lionorable members in the "" hillbilly corner "" of the chamber, who masquerade as the champions of the farmers, although I do not suppose that one of them has ever done a day's real farming in his life. All that most of them do is to exploit country people by buying and selling stock on commission, and acting as agents for various high-priced products and machines. If the members of the Australian Country party would join with me in protesting to the Government, something might be done to protect the farmers from the injustice that the Government proposes to perpetrate. It is all very well for members of the Australian Country party to complain in this chamber about the long, arduous days spent by the farmers, but they should not forget that when the tired farmer returns to his home in the evening he looks forward to being entertained by his radio set. When he discovers that the replacement of some perhaps minor part in his receiving apparatus will cost him 33^r per cent, more than it does at present, he will be very angry, because he probably cannot afford to pay such a price for his entertainment. Probably, many farmers will not be able to afford radio sets at all. I therefore repeat my appeal to members of the Australian Country party to do something to protect the farmers. After all, the Treasurer is a member of their political party, and surely they sliould be able to approach him and point out the injustice that will be done by his proposals to the people whom they are supposed to represent. Of course, I am not speaking for the wealthy graziers, who are quite capable *>f looking after themselves. The rich wool growers have browbeaten members of the Australian Country party so much that those honourable gentlemen do not even stop to consider the position of the small farmers. A great deal has been said in the course of this debate about industrial relationships, and the harmony that is alleged to exist in industry today. We have even been told what a good employer the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is",50
146,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The honourable member ,51
147,Mr CURTIN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Regardles s of the identity of the honourable gentleman who made that statement, I have the right to say what I think. I have worked for employers such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and I kuow what they do. In fact, I have done much more work than has any honourable member opposite, and I am familiar with the tactics pursued by many of those who batten upon the workers. They are always urging us to work harder and harder, so that they can exploit us even more than they are already doing. In the course of my employment in industry, which has extended over 36 years, I have been associated with some of the finest types of men in the Australian community. Those types are to be found in the working class, and I resent the attacks made upon the workers of this country by honourable members opposite. The workers of this country are the real producers of the wealth of the community, and they are represented by the leaders of the trade union movement, more than 95 per cent, of whom are loyal to them and to Australia. Of course, the present Government would like to destroy the trade union movement. However, it has already discovered that the trade union movement is solid and that it cannot be coerced, and now it is appealing to the Labour movement to co-operate with it. However, I assure honourable members opposite that under no circumstances will the trade union movement ever co-operate - and I use the word "" ever "" advisedly, because I am not afraid to express my views-in any way with the Government of this eountry until the present Administration is replaced by a Labour administo tration.",51
148,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL, Order ! The honourable memPrime ber's time has expired. Motion (by Mr Calwell) negativedTliat the honourable member for Watson Curtin) be granted an extension of time.,52
149,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Forrest) [8.40] - Hav ing listened to the honourable member for Watson (Mr Curtin), the first conand clusion to which I came was that the age of chivalry was dead. In the course of a most ungallant reference to Australian womanhood, he suggested that a great hardship would be inflicted upon tliem the price of cosmetics was increased, because cosmetics were, he said, essential to their appearance. It is more usual, course, to regard the use of cosmetics woman as a mere gilding of the lily. However, I shall not pursue the matter any further than to say that, able member thought that by adopting that line he would attract the support the women of Australia, he was very much mistaken. I turn now to the discussion of more serious matters, particularly of the problems that are raised, by the Government's budgetary proposals. [ recall that in the first speech that I delivered in this chamber I that the two principal problems that fronted the present Government were the stabilisation of our economy and the development of the country. Since then, a third national problem,, that of defence, has emerged. I do not propose to elaborate upon defence matters in course of this speech, and all I say on that aspect is that I - believe that the Government has tackled the job courtwelve ageously and realistically. When Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) said, in the course of his speech, that the resources that could be drawn upon for defence were limited, I entirely with him. Undoubtedly, the defence quirements of this country are limited the prospects of our national survival, they are not limited, I emphasize, by other factor. If the country cannot defend itself no proposal of the Governthat ment is of any value whatever. Members of the Opposition like to refer the subject of restoring economic stabilization in terms of putting value back the Â£1. The approach made by. the Minister (Mr Menzies) to this matter is the only one that the Government could adopt. Members of the Oppo(Mr sition insist on repeating that the right honourable gentleman promised to restore value to the Â£1. Apparently, they are quite incapable of distinguishing between an undertaking to confront a problem, a promise to achieve certain results.",52
150,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,'What did the Prime Minister say about the matter?,52
151,Mr FEEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"In the course of his if remarks, the honourable member for Watson quoted a passage from the report of a speech made by the Prime Min ster of which showed clearly that the right by a honourable gentleman stated that the restoration of our economy was a problem that must befaced. However, he made if the honorno specific promise.",52
152,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,He promised a thousand of times to restore value to the Â£1.,52
153,Mr FEEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I invite the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) to read the right honourable gentleman's speech for himself. What is the position today in regard to the restoration bf value to the Â£1? The honourable member for Watson complained of the said hardships suffered by the Australian conhousewives. I wonder whether he complained so loudly about that matter before the last general election ? Did not he and his colleagues tell the people during the election campaign that they were enjoying extraordinary prosperity, ancl that the that condition of affairs was due to now Labour's administration? Yet, when we examine the level of prices during the last months, we find that there has not the been any appreciable increase",52
154,Mr GRIFFITHS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Eubbish !,52
155,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I invite the honoragreed able member for Shortland (Mr. reGriffiths), who has just interacted, by to consult the "" C "" series i'-dex. but It is all very well for honourable members any opposite to cry "" Rubbish"", but I have here some, figures which show plainly during the quarter ended the 30th September last the price rise was 2.5 per eent. For the six months ended the 30th June last it was 4.8 per cent.",52
156,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,It is still rising.,53
157,Mr FEEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Admittedly . For the year ended the 30th June, 1949, the price rise was 9-.S per cent. In the year that it was 9.4 per cent. The last two increases that I have mentioned took place under the Chifley Administration. "" 'Still rising"", says the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward). He admits it. In other words, the price rise has been constant within a few decimal points. Yet now we hear the honourable member for Watson bemoaning the hardships of the housewives, although only a few the months ago he was telling them how well off they were, at a time when prices rising at exactly the same rate as at which they are now rising. Let us have production. a little consistency and common sanity from honourable members opposite.",53
158,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What about the promises the Government parties made to stop the increase of the cost of living?,53
159,The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! The honourable member for Wills must not interject.,53
160,Mr FEEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I turn now to the problem of production. It is quite easy frequently. to utter denunciations, as the honourable member for Watson and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) have done. Yet those honorcated able members have stated that they will not co-operate in the Government's for increased production. I do not intend workers ? to waste time in denouncing people, but I shall ask honourable members opposite two questions. The first is, who will benefit from a policy of restricted duction or of non-co-operation in the productive effort? No Australian man, woman or child will benefit from such a policy.",53
161,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Lot s of employers have benefited by it . They have restricted production and under-supplied the market to suit themselves.,53
162,Mr FEEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,If employers have every benefited from such a policy why do honourable members opposite advocate it?,53
163,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,We are advocating an entirely different policy.,53
164,Mr FEEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I presume that if nobody inside Australia will benefit from the policy of restricted production, then, some one outside Australia will benefit from it. We can only conclude that those who will benefit from it will be enemies before or potential enemies of Australia. Mr Ward interjecting,",53
165,The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) is interjecting too frequently.,53

They will that blame those who have advocated non",53
167,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,--W1IO has advocated non-production ?,53
168,Mr FEEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I heard the honourable member for Watson say to-night that he would not advocate an increase of production.,53
169,The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL," Order! The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryson), whom I have already called to order, is interjecting too",53
170,Mr FEEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Wit h whom will the public side? With those who have advonon-co-operation and who have said that they will not co-operate in a drive drive for increased production from the I turn from that matter to the impact upon the Australian economy of the increase of the basic wage that was prorecently granted by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I do not think that the founders of the system of conciliation and arbitration in Australia foresaw the tremendous effect on the Australian economy that the decisions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court would have. That court was designed merely for the purpose of resolving disputes between employers and employees, and, indeed, case that is heard before it is based - and sometimes almost fictitiously-on the notion that there is an existing dispute between employers and employees. The hearing proceeds on that ground. Any decision of the court has a wide impact on the entire Australian economy. I do not presume to criticize the court, but I offer certain suggestions with due respect. The court has realized that money wages, as such, cannot determine the standard of living. The court can say that it will award to the worker an increased share of the proceeds of production in the form of more money, but history has proved that as soon as an increase of wages is made, prices rise accordingly and the benefit of the increase is very quickly dissipated. The judges of the court themselves, in the extracts from judgments that were quoted by the Prime Minister, expressed the view that although they had awarded an increase of wages, that fact of itself would result only in increased prices unless some other action were taken, by which, presumably, they implied either that, production must be increased or that some legislative action must be taken. I submit that it is within the province of the court to extend its investigations and inquiries beyond the consideration of the money wages that it should award. It should base its decisions on the actual standard of living, and make any change or variation of that standard commensurate with the contribution to it made by the employees. When all is said and done, if a wage increase in the form of money will not really result in anything but a temporarily increased standard of living for the worker, surely it would be more realistic for the court, to fix what it believed to be a fair dard, basing its decision on the employees' contribution to the standard. Air. CLYD E CAMEKON - What does the lionorable member mean by that?",53
171,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I realise that the honourable member for Hindmarsh may find difficulty in following me. I have tried to compress within a few observations a line of thought which, I confess, the honourable member would find great difficulty in following. While I am dealing with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and the impact of the level of production on our price level, I shall make a brief reference to the matter of strikes. When two ordinary citizens have a matter in dispute, such as a broken contract or a breach of civil rights, normally one of them does not go to the other and demand satisfaction at-pistol point. He takes the issue to court for determination. The same process has come to be accepted in our arbitration system. This point has beenlaboured time and time again but I consider that there are too many people in Australia today who are trying to have things both ways. They are attempting to obtain the benefits of arbitration and the benefits of the pistol point remedy at the same time. If the pistol were directed at one employer or another in a case of individual hardship, where there was no court or tribunal open to the worker, there might conceivably be some justification for this rotten tradition about the right to strike that we have in Australia.",54
172,Mr CLYDE CAMEKON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Is the honourable member advocating a revolution or something of that nature?,54
173,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am not advocating a revolution at all. I say that we have developed an absurd tradition that nobody is to interfere with the workers'"" right to strike. We might as well sav that any individual who finds himself aggrieved by a breach of his civil rights should take the law into his own hands. The Labour party's attitude to that matter is like its attitude to conscription, compulsory military training or service overseas. It is quite out of step with the times. I say that while we are facing the problem of trying to stabilize our economy stanthe matter of strikes should be closely examined, because today we find that strikes are most frequently directed not at any individual employer, but at governments. For instance, although the Labour party is supporting the Country party Government in Victoria, the railway workers in that. State are on strike against the popularly elected Government. Where will this law of the jungle end? I suggest that the Government should face with some courage, and with less respect for the traditional right to strike, the problem of strikes in Australia. The same problem exists in England.",54
174,Mr CLYDE CAMEKON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What is the Government going to do about strikes?,54
175,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I do not propose to elaborate on that point auy further. I have clearly stated my views on the right to strike. I turn now to profits. We have heard the honourable member for Watson say that the Government wished to increase production only to bleed more out of the hides of the workers.,54
176,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,That is,55
177,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for that interjection, because if all Australian industrial profits were distributed among the employees in industries, each employee would not receive more than a shilling a week above what he now receives.",55
178,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Do not ridiculous! Profits in Australia amount to Â£300,000,000.",55
179,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Let the honourable member examine the figures that relate to any industry. I find it quite absurd, therefore, that the honourable member for Watson and other honourable members opposite, like the honourable member for Hindmarsh, should make the rash statement that our only reason for wanting more production is to make possible greater profits for the employers. Honourable members must agree that the standard of livin g cannot bc increased by a mere increase of wages. The actual standard of livin g itself must be increased. When honourable members opposite say that we wish to increase production only to provide employers with more profits they are just voicing the old, old slogans that we hear in this place every day, the same old class hatred, uttered a little louder and with a few minor variations. They thereby attempt to gain some notoriety for themselves, but their views are completely valueless so far as assisting in the stabilization of our economy is concerned. I turn now fro m the problem of stabilization to the problem of development. I was pleased to hear the Minister for National Development (Mr Casey) say today that in order of importance he would place encouragement of development by private enterprise before the more spectacular schemes of the .Government's own initiation, such as the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric power scheme and other schemes of similar magnitude. In Western Australia there is tremendous scope for development along the lines suggested by the right honourable gentleman. Recently, the Prime Minister made an appeal for an increased production of flax because of the urgent necessity for that commodity in stock-piling for defence. The only privately owned flax right. mill in Australia is in Western Australia. The other two flax-producing States, Victoria and South Australia, have all their flax treated by government-operated flax mills. Approximately one-fifth of Australia's total flax output is produced in Western Australia. That State could treat with its existing plant an'additiona.l quantity which would raise its proportion be to nearly one-half. Yet, there are proposals to increase fiax production by expending about Â£250,000 on Commonwealth mills. With very little extra encouragement to the Western Australian industry to grow more flax, the existing mill could treat up to 400 tons of flax fibre a year. In the south-west of Western Australia there was a substantial dairying industry, but dairying is becoming unpopular there because of the increased capital required to purchase machinery and equipment in order to enable small farms to conduct dairying operations in a modern way. The dairy farm unit must be increased in size to cope with modern methods. It wil] not be possible for the dairying industry to meet Australia's total requirements in a few year.?' time unless present production is substantially increased. The problem of development must be met with an overall scheme. Extensions must be uniform. If our economy is expanded it must be expanded as a balloon is inflated-evenly-other wise there will be distortions which will be disastrous. There are acres of land in Western Australia which private enterprise is willing and anxious to develop hut, unaided by government finance, find it quite beyond its power to develop in less than one or more generations. It takes the average individual twenty or more years to save suflicient capital out of his current income adequately to expand and increase his farming area. If the Government has embarked on a developmental policy which envisages crowding into ten' years development which would normally take place in twenty years it must give some attention to these empty areas in Western Australia which are raying out for a little .Government assistance in order that private enterprise may develop them. There is a view current that those areas in which, the soil is good and .the climatic conditions are ideal will develop themselves and that there is no need for the .Government to take action. But if the Government is to cram into ten years the normal development of twenty years it must accelerate the development of those areas. The Leader of the Opposition, when Prime Minister, set up a committee to examine ways and means of developing the north-west of Western Australia. That committee found that private enterprise, if given a little assistance, would quite willing to put capital into those areas, and where capital goes, labour follows. There is an illustration of that fact in the progress that has been made in the development .of the Blue Asbestos Mines in the Wittenoom Gorge area where the investment of about Â£1,000,000 of capital has brought into existence a flourishing township of over 500 people. The committee that was set up by the Leader of the Opposition recommended that substantial tax concessions should be given to people who live north of the 26th parallel just as they are given to the people of the Northern Territory in order to encourage them to re-iirvest their money in that section of the 'Commonwealth. That recommendation was not followed up. The Government is trying to develop this country.",55
180,Mr BIRD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What is it doing about the matter?,56
181,Mr FREETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I imagine that the Government would welcome suggestions instead of rather futile interjections from honourable members. Surely it would benefit the Government if, instead of expending millions of pounds on carrying out it3 own explorations and investigations of the mineral resources of the eountry, it encouraged oil companies to carry out searches for oil, encouraged the ..evelopment of iron resources at Yampi Sound, and encouraged the development of meat works .similar <to those established at Wyndham. In that way it could assist private .enterprise to carry out a job which, if carried out by the iGovernment, would cost the taxpayer millions of pounds. I support this budget, but I hope that Western Australia will share increasingly in the Government's developmental plans for the welfare of the Commonwealth.",56
182,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Cunningham) [9.9] The honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Freeth) criticized the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) concerning the depression. There was a large number of unemployed when the Liberal Government was last in power and the Government does not want to hear anything about them again. be When the Labour Government took over from the last Liberal Government there were 200,000 unemployed. After the Labour Government had tidied up the country's affairs and put a nice sum of money into the Treasury it went out of power, but it will soon be back again. Labour strengthened the country's economy and because it did so, conditions are very much better today than they were before it assumed control. The honourable member tried to condemn miners. In his view they are terrible men who restrict their output. He said that whatever they were paid, they would not produce as much as they could because they were subject to a darg. Let me explain the nature of the darg. A darg limits the number of skips that a miner may fill in a given period. That is done in order to achieve equal distribution of the skips in the coal-mines. Before the darg was introduced the wheeler was not prepared to go into parts of mines in which some men were working because of the bad state of the roadway. Consequently the miners had to institute the darg in order to ensure an equal distribution of the skips. The honourable member for Forrest seemed to think that the worker should not have the right to strike. Every man should have the right to withhold his labour if he chooses to do so. When Labour w vs in power the then Minister for Health, Senator MCKenna, endeavoured for many months to reach agreement with the doctors, but without success. The doctors were prepared to practise only on certain conditions. They said that they were not going to work if the Government demanded certain things and they were not prepared to come to an agreement. The same position obtains today. The present Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) has had to adopt a plan that has been approved by the British Medical Association. The only agreement that he could come to was one that the British Medical Association wanted. Every worker must have the right to strike. Even the wool-growers withhold their wool and put it on the market at a time when they can obtain the highest price for it. Wool is a commodity and so is labour and the worker must have the right to withhold that commodity if he thinks fit. When the present Government went before the people it made all sorts of rash promises in regard to a raising of the standard of living, but it has not accomplished anything of that nature. The honourable member for Eorrest alleged that the rate of increase of the cost of living had not become greater. The Government was going to put value back into the Â£1, yet the Â£1 has less value now than it had at the time of the general election. Wages have been trying to overtake prices but they have not been in the race. All that honourable members have heard from Government supporters in this debate has been criticism of the Opposition. BTo practical suggestion has been made by them. Honourable members of the Opposition have put forward practical suggestions for overcoming difficulties. The Government has asked for the cooperation of the Opposition in its endeavours to get. out of the mess in which it finds itself. The Government realizes that it is in a mess and that it has no chance of getting out of it. I know that the duty of the Parliament is to try to improve the country's economic position. Honourable members of the Opposition are prepared to do everything in their power to achieve that end. This country is in a serious position. The Â£1 increase that has been granted to the wage-earner has already been offset. Every time there is an increase of wages, prices more than counteract it. The Government depends on its hillbilly supporters. Honourable members who sit on my left have prevented it from doing what it would like to do. They are afraid to take action because it might prejudice their political position. The appreciation of the Â£1 to parity with sterling would not entirely solve Australia's present inflationary problem which is assuming an alarming aspect, but having in mind the enormous prices being paid for our exports, it would have a strong buttressing effect on our economy. The Australian Country party has been criticized even as far away as London. In the London Financial Times of the 2nd September, 1950, this report appearsEarly this year a substantial section of the Australian Cabinet was won over to the view that revaluation was economically desirable. Tho proposal was not proceeded with mainly because the Country Party element in the Cabinet headed by Mr Fadden held that it was politically inexpedient. It must be remembered that the Australian Â£1 was originally devalued as a temporary expedient in the depression period primarily to assist the rural interests. No one cavilled at this, and now the Australian people expect the Country Farty and the interests it represents to play their part in the restoration of the national economy. Primary exports are bringing in unparalleled prices on overseas markets. Excepting for wheat and sugar and export quotas are fixed for them on the basic domestic needs of that Australian people, with the result that the local consumer is being exploited and forced to pay inflated prices on a depreciated currency. Few of the Australian workers today can pay the prices being demanded for a. lamb chop, a few pounds of beef, or even a leg of mutton or a pound of butter. The national interest must come first and - although as pointed out appreciation of the Australian Â£1 is uot a panacea for the present inflationary crisis, it world tend to halt the present rise in prices and prevent exploitation of the people by primary interests. The honourable member who recently spoke (Mr Freeth) said that prices had not gone up.",56
183,Mr FBEETH,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I did not say that at all. I said that they had risen at a constant rate.,57
184,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I maintain that prices liave gone up proportionately fa r more than wages have. The worker is slipping back all the time while his employer is moving forward. That may be proved by a simple example. Recently I purchased a syphon of soda water and found that its price had risen by 50 per cent, from Is. to Is. 6d. .Stamina trousers have risen from Â£2 10s. to Â£3 6s. a pair. Cooked ham has risen from 5s. l i d . per lb. to Ss. 4d. per lb., cream from Is. to ts. 10d. a half-pint and beef and lamb by practically 100 per cent. price of coffee has risen from 3s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. per lb. Yet in the light of those figures the honourable member for Forrest has the audacity to say that prices have noi gone up! A recent quarterly return of the Commonwealth Statistician indicates that clothing prices in Sydney were 182.2 per cent, higher at the end of September, 1950, than they were at the end of September, 1939. Dr Roland Wilson, the Commonwealth Statistician, also has shown that the aggregate of certain retail prices in Sydney has gone up by 72.9 per cent, compared, with the 1939 figure. This aggregate is based on the prices of food, rents, clothing, and a. miscellaneous classification including household drapery and other necessaries, it would be interesting to compare the cost of certain commodities in 1939 with the present cost. In 1949 the price of food was 50 per cent, higher than in 1939, and in 1950, 71 per cent, higher. remained at 3 per cent, higher because they were pegged when they had reached rhat point. Clothing was 142.4 per cent, higher in .1949 than in 1939, and other items rose in much the same proportion. Those figures should give to the cominittee a fair l y good idea the enormous rise of prices compared with the rise of wages. Let us now consider profits. honourable member for Forrest said that no excessive profits have been made. I maintain that much excessive profit has been made. According to a recent issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, Washington H . Soul Pattinson and Company Limited increased its earnings by Â£3,114 to Â£96,018 in the year ended the 31si July. 1950. It3 dividend was unchanged at 15 per cent, and required the distribution of Â£29,458. The staff fund received Â£5,000 and Â£21,650 went to the reserve account. The total visible reserves amounted to Â£494,6.11 as against a capital of Â£463,050. That w i ll give the committee a general idea of the profit made by that company. Carreras Limited, the company which makes Craven A cigarettes, never pays less than a. 50 per cent, dividend. Sometimes it pays up to 70 per cent.",58
185,Mr CHARLES ANDERSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"What is the price of shares in that company? The Mr DAVIES - I do not think they could be purchased. I also in for m the committee that one Sydney motor car trading company paid a dividend of 110 per cent. I now refer honourable members to the trading operations of Myer Emporium Limited, of Melbourne. That firm intends to make a bonus issue involving Â£1,725,000 to ordinary 5s. stockholders in the ratio of one-to-one. The issue wil] be financed from an assets revaluation reserve, established from a valuation of the company's city properties. Nominal capital will be raised from Â£3,000,000 to Â£6,000,000 and this issue of bonus shares will raise the paid-up capital to Â£4,204,950.",58
186,Mr OPPERMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What dividend does that company pay?,58
187,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,It paid 10 per cent. It woulcl have paid more had it not. Rents increased its share issue.,58
188,Mr CHARLES ANDERSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Can the honourable member inform the committee of the yield of those shares ?,58
189,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Not more than 3 per cent, or 4 per cent., but the company has of watered its shares in order to delude the public in regard to the profit it is making. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited also has made enormous profits, and so have Burns Philp Limited and The other big concerns. Excessive protection of our industries is leading to excessive' prices and consequent excessive profits. The Tariff Board Annual Beport of 1950, at page 5, readsA t one time, when there was a pool of unemployed labour in Australia it was part of the Board's responsibility to recommend protection to those industries which could absorb some of this pool, provided too much excess oost was not imposed in the procew. To-day the position is reversed. Under conditions of full employment, - the extension of employment capacity through the protection of some industries would promote unfavourable economic reactions, in that such industries would entice labour from more important producers, and aggravate the existing labour shortage. Obviously a number of companies today being protected should not be protected to the existing degree, because it leads to their inefficiency, and to excessive prices being charged to the public. Excessive protection leaves the w a j ' open to inefficiency, wasteful expenditure on labour and materials and excessive prices and profits. The report continues at page 6In some countries the trading results of protected industries are examined as a matter of routine to ensure that advantage is not taken of tariff protection. No system of review has been established in Australia. Industries have been protected, but such protection has not been reviewed. I suggest that protection should be reviewed in order to see that, protected industries are not taking advantage of it . Reverting again to revaluation of the Â±1, in regard to which, I know, there is a great difference of opinion, my view is that the f l should be appreciated. Any one with any experience of overseas travel will know that it is necessary to pay Â£125 Australian for Â£100 sterling. Many elderly people have been saving all their lives so that they w i ll have enough money to travel home to England to see their relatives. No'w they find thai perhaps they cannot go because of the exchange rate. I went to England some time ago and had experience of the adverse effects of the exchange rate. While the ship was travelling closeto the Australian coast, ale co3t 6d. a glass. When the ship hacl proceeded beyond the 3-m-ile l i m it the price was' raised by 25 per cent. The bottle fro m which the ale was taken was branded ""Tooths A l e "" . Therefore, although the beer was made in Sydney we were required to pay 25 per cent, more f oii t 3 miles out from the Australian coast. That is just a racket and something should be done about it . When the New Zealand Â£ 1 was revalued a Sydney newspaper sent a reporter to New Zealand to discover whether revaluation was advantageous or not. He reported as follows:- . The measure of the success of New Zealand's revaluation to parity with sterling in August, 1945, lies in the small increase in the country's living costs since revaluation. Statistics show that the cost of living fell after revaluation. For instance, the New Zealand retail price index for August, 1048, was 1105. This figure fell in September to 1098, and continued to decline for some months until arrested by the removal of subsidies. Prices, today, in New Zealand are only 8 per cent, higher than they were in that dominion in 1948. That fact gives some idea of the advantage that New Zealand has gained by appreciating its currency. I do not say that appreciation of the Â£1 will solve the problem of rising prices. Many other changes also must be made. In New Zealand, retailers are perfectly satisfied with the results that have followed appreciation of the currency in that dominion. I believe that the majority of Australians are in favour of appreciating the f l . However, for one reason or another no decision has yet been made on that very important subject. I welcome the Government's proposal to increase the rates of sales tax on furs, jewellery and other luxury articles, but it has not fair l y distributed the relief that it intends to provide in respect of this class of taxation. Whilst increases of the tax on luxury goods are long overdue, I cannot understand why the Government proposes, for example, to increase the tax on delivery vans hy 10 per cent, at a time when housewives are anxious that business shall restore home-delivery services as soon as possible. I disagree with the proposal to increase the sales tax on musical instruments to 25 per cent. That imposition will be detrimental tc the development of Australian culture. Members of brass bands, of which there is a number in my electorate, will have to pay higher prices for their instruments. Bandsmen usually give performances free of charge at patriotic functions, and their activities should be not discouraged but encouraged in the interests of community culture generally. A corresponding handicap will be placed upon members of orchestras. It is also proposed to increase the sales tax on radio sets. Radio entertainment has virtually become a part of the Australian standard of living. Radio broadcasting is also a medium of education. Parents and citizens associations usually provide funds for the purchase and installation of radio receiving sets in schools. I should like to know how the Government justify its proposal to increase the sales tax on such articles. Even the sales tax on bagpipes is to be increased. If we are to develop community cultural life and imbue our children with a love of music, the Government cannot justify increasing the sales tax on musical instruments. I am pleased that the Government proposes to increase the rate of the invalid pension by 7s. 6d. a week. However, whilst that benefit is not to take effect until the 1st November, the Government proposes to make the increase of Â£500 in the salaries of justices of the High Court and the judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court retrospective to the lst July last. In that respect, pensioners will be treated unjustly. I also point out that the aUowance that is paid to a person who looks after an invalid pensioner is not to be increased. At present an allowance of about 24s. a week is paid to the wife of an invalid pensioner if she is caring for him. I prefer to believe that the Government has inadvertently overlooked that item. I urge it to consider the matter. I have in my hand an envelope that bears the address of an invalid pensioner who is in receipt of a pension at the rate of 8s. 3d. a week. The wife of this gentleman also receives an invalid pension at the same rate. The envelope bears the imprint, "" Save to control prices"". I should like to know how persons in receipt of so small an allowance in respect of invalidity can be expected to save anything. The Government has allocated the sum of Â£3,000,000 to the purchase of coal overseas. That money could be better expended in mechanizing coal mines. At present, the coal-miners are dependent solely upon the Joint Coal Board for any improvement of their conditions of employment. That body Mr Davies. has been responsible for the improvements that have recently been effected in the industry generally. The main reason for the present under-production of coal is that in the past the coal-mine owners completely neglected their responsibility to introduce modern methods in the industry. They have been responsible also can for a large number of strikes. Personally, I should like the Government to nationalize the coal-mines. It would thus do away with the state of affairs in which there are three parties to every dispute, namely, the employers, the coal-miners and the Government. \\Extension of time granted.'] It is the fashion to blame the coal-miners for every hold-up in the industry. As a boy I worked in a coalmine and as the result of my experiences I made two resolutions. The first was that I would get out of the industry as soon as I possibly could ; and the second was that I would ensure that my son would not work in a coal-mine. Every parent who is associated with the industry is determined to do the best that he, or she, can to prevent their children from working in coal-mines. I admit that due to the activities of the Joint Coal Board conditions in that industry have been improved considerably in recent years. In one mine, the miners who had to walk in a crouched position a distance of 2Â£ miles to the coal-face, pleaded with the mine-owners to install conveyors to transport them that distance, but the owners refused to grant that request. Eventually, the Joint Coal Board expended a large sum of money on the installation of conveyors in mines with the result that production was substantially increased. The Joint Coal Board has also been obliged to provide electric borers and to initiate measures to eliminate dust in coal-mines. It has effected many other improvements because mine-owners have refused to carry out their responsibilities to their employees. Mr Justice Davidson, who inquired into the industry as a royal commissioner some years ago, reported that some mine owners had been making a profit of 154 per cent, but had not put any of those profits back into the industry, with the result that conditions in their mines had - seriously deteriorated. I agree with supporters of the 'Government that the pro-d'uction of coal must be increased. The best way to do so is to mechanize the mines. As the result of mechanization, - daily production in the Mount Nebo mine, which is situated on the south coast of .New South Wales, has been increased to 15 tons, by each miner, whereas the output at the same mine of those who work with picks and shovels is only 3 tons a day. Those figures give some idea - of the degree to which the production of - coal could be increased if the mines were mechanized. I assure the Government that all members of the Opposition will do everything they possibly can to encourage greater production of coal because they realise that adequate supplies of coal are essential to our industrial economy.  Two novel features of this budget have escaped the notice of members of the Opposition so far as we can judge their thoughts from their utterances in debate. However, I am sure that one of those features has aroused their envy. I refer to the fact that this is the first budget that has been introduced in the Parliament during the last eight years of labour. that has not been socialistic in outlook. The people of Australia should be aware of that fact, because at the on the 10th December last they clearly expressed their wish that another socialistic budget should not be introduced in the Parliament. Whatever the Opposition may say about the matter, the people are determined that so long as the once great Labour party persists in its socialistic policy it shall never again be given an opportunity to introof duce a budget. Let us imagine for a moment that there had not been turn for the better on the 10th December last, and that this budget had been duced by the socialists. Among the items of proposed expenditure that would be included would be an amount to pay the compulsory acquisition of the private trading banks. Many times during the life of this Parliament, members of Opposition have said, "" We believe in nationalization of banking, but it been proved that there is no constitutional power to nationalize the banks "". Nevertheless, they are still strongly determined to nationalize the banks and to pursue all their other socialistic aims if they ever regain power.",58
190,Mr DUTHIE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable member knows that it cannot be done.  it cannot be done because the people of Australia have said that it must not be done and will continue to say so. The banks will not be nationalized because the Liberal party and the Australian Coun_ try party are in power. A socialist Treasurer's budget would have included a sentence or two, or perhaps even a paragraph, about the direction of labour. The socialists made no secret of their intention on this issue. They wanted to gain absolute and unchallenged sovereign power throughout Australia and thus open the way for the entry of communism.",61
191,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,That is absolute rot.  this many leading members of the present Opposition party during the last three years have hinged upon their belief that the economic stability of the nation is dependent upon the compulsory direction,61
192,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Utte r rubbish! The made honourable member could not make one polls quotation to support that statement.  - quotations. I recall the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) making a statement to this effect, "" This country is not going to be developed if every man thinks that he can hold his wife's hand every night and see the town clock "". That declaration is imprinted upon the minds millions of Australians. Many other such statements were made by the right a - honourable gentleman at various times. One that I recall was to this effect, "" A introman must go where his work is, and, if he will not go, it will be necessary to bring in penalties to compel him to go "". for The federal president of the Australian Labour party, Mr J. A. Ferguson, M.L.C, has subscribed to such stupid utterances as the that. There can be no doubt in the mind the of any thoughtful person, or even in the has mind of the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryson), that the aim of the Labour party is to introduce a system of compulsory direction of labour. Had this been a Labour budget, it would have included some amount for the implementation of that policy. We may be sure that a socialist budget vvould not have provided for the pension increases for which this budget provides, because over the years the Labour party has disclosed a complete disregard for the welfare of pensioners. Only when they are in opposition do its members raise a pious outcry about the poor pensioners. 'When they were, in power, they refused absolutely to make any promises about pension increases. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Davies) expressed the view of the entire Labour party when he said that he would like to witness the nationalization of the coal industry. Of course, that is a part of the socialist platform, and it is a part of the Communist platform. There is very little difference between the two programmes.",61
193,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The Labour party increased pensions when it was in office.  about pensions during the last general election campaign, and it revealed an utter disregard for the welfare of pensioners over a long period. A socialist government would not stop at the nationalization of the coal industry. It would deal with the steel industry in the same way. We know that that is so, because the main issue at the general election last December was whether Australia should be socialized or not. The Labour party made no secret of the fact that it would regard n victory at the election as the. green light to go ahead and socialize the nation and thus open the way for the Communists to come in and overthrow us all. A labour party budget would certainly not include any provision for increases of the rates of pay of members of the armed services. The Opposition has stated its attitude towards servicemen and ex-servicemen very clearly. One of thp greatest shocks that Australians have suffered from politics during the last few months has been caused by the disclosure of Labour's policy towards the defence forces and the Government's recruiting campaign. A Labour government, following the party's custom of playing into thehands of the Communists, would havegiven effect to a policy of inflation that would have caused increasing unrest,, hardship and even misery. This would have cleared the way to complete socialism and ultimately to communism. Another novel feature of the budget is that it has been presented, in the year of Australia's greatest peril. Never before in time of peace has Australia faced a greater threat to its survival as a nation than it faces now. Great forces that seek to overwhelm us are ranged about us. Many eyes are looking covetously upon our landMillions of people in all parts of the world, particularly where communism is supreme, look hungrily upon our farms and cities. The cheap gibes with which the Opposition has replied to the Government's plea for co-operation are unworthy even of the Labour party. In this time of peril, there is an urgent need for cooperation not only between political parties, but also between all individual citizens. If this nation is to survive, we must withstand a severe test during the next four or five years. I have been greatly disturbed by the attempts that have been made by members of the Opposition, I believe deliberately, to foment dissension in the community. The honourable member for Watson (Mr. Curtin) talked about class hatred. If anybody treated his remarks seriouslyI do not think that he does so himselfthey would cause a great deal of harm. Those utterances were consistent with the conduct of members of the Labour party in Australia ever since the early 'twenties. Members of the present Opposition party have consistently moved amongst the people saying, ""Why should you work? The boss hates you. You hate him. You have to fight for everything"". Such propaganda has implanted in the minds of the young men and women of Australia the seeds of doubt and class hatred. Even in this Parliament, where the representatives of the people meet under a pledge to serve the nation, we hear the same stupid utterances which would cause the gravest disservice to ' Australia if people heeded them. The honourable member for Cunningham cited certain figures in a way that - was absolutely misleading and inaccurate. Whether he did so deliberately or whether .he did not know what he was doing, I cannot say. He tried to convey the 'impression that great price increases had - taken place during the last few months, - although he ought to know that many of those increases had occurred over the period of a decade. Such statements are made, not to impress honourable members, but to influence the electors and to f.ause dissatisfaction with the Government aud with employers so that chaos may result. I challenged the honourable member by interjection when he spoke - about a 10 per cent, increase of the prices of panel vans. I gathered from his subsequent remarks that he was referring to the increases that would result from heavier tax charges. H is statements were completely untrue. The honourable member has some intelligence, and he should be as capable as I am of reading and understanding the information that he had in his possession. I have the facts before me now and I want to place them on record. The official document that I have, which deals with the proposed new rates of tax upon motor vehicles, contains the following explanation of the Government's proposal:The rute of tax on the following goods is increased from 8J% to 10%':Motor cars designed primarily and principally for the transport of persons, including sedans, coupes, tourers, roadsters, racing cars, taxi-cabs, station wagons and estate cars, but not including panel vans, delivery vans, utilities., hearses, jeeps, trucks, lorries or motor buses. A brief .study of those, facts will reveal the utter inaccuracy of the statements that were made by the honourable member for Cunningham. The honourable gentleman was screaming to the'housewives of Australia, in effect, "" This terrible Government, by increasing tax charges on panel vans, will rob vou of your bread, meat, ice, and f r u it deliveries "". Perhaps many peoplo would believe him if his statements were allowed to go uncorrected. Tliey were utterly mischievous. Another notable feature of the honourable gentleman's speech was his tirade against the profits being made by various companies. In answering his outburst, I remind honourable members of one of the greatest jokes of the last general election campaign. I believe that people still giggle when they hear the name of Abraham Lincoln, because a certain right honourable gentleman who played a prominent part in that campaign was presented to the electors by his supporters, and possibly by himself, as "" the great Abe Lincoln of this century"". Not many persons swallowed that propaganda. The real Abraham Lincoln placed on record some very wise sayings. I refer a few of them to members of the OppositionYon cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves. How applicable those maxims are to the political party which the pseudo Abraham Lincoln temporarily leads, with his cap of office shaking upon his brow. The job that Australia is called upon to undertake today is to put into practice the principles that are expressed in those quotations. There must be complete cooperation hetween all sections of the community. Such co-operation is vital to the future security of the najion. We must get together - and w,ork together. The jeers and the gibes that are uttered by the Onposition about the farmers are completely unjustified. The whole community depends upon the farmers, without whom we could not exist for a day. We are dependent upon them absolutely.",62
194,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"We are dependent npon one another.  I am glad that the honourable gentleman appreciates it . I hope that he will tell the Leader of the Opposition something about it , because the right honourable gentleman does not understand such matters.",63
195,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I shall have a chat with him later.  bers of the community are dependent upon the farmers, so are the farmers dependent upon other members of the community. But the requirements of the primary producers are not being met. In the electorate of Capricornia which I represent, farmers require supplies of galvanized iron and wire netting. They are obliged to use bad roads, and there is not a sufficient number of bridges over streams to enable them to travel conveniently to and from markets. Their transport is bad, and they need supplies of the foods that they cannot grow for themselves. The only reason why they cannot obtain their requirements is that the workers in many industries refuse to provide them. Yet those workers are dependent upon the farmers. ""Why cannot primary .producers get supplies of galvanized iron, fencing wire, agricultural implements and all the goods they need? The answer is that a few Communists on the coal-fields decide that.the coal-miners shall not hew suflicient quantities of coal for the nation's needs, and certain honourable members of the Parliament, like the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), preach in this chamber and in the Sydney Domain all the class hatred and rot imaginable. Honest workers are subject to the persecution that emanates from communism. The coal-miner is dependent upon the farmer for his food, yet the farmer lacks many of the things that are available to the coal-miner. A miner's' wife is not obliged to rise at daybreak, go to the dairy and milk cows day after day and week after week.",63
196,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The coal-miner has to work down the mine.  that work, and he enjoys reasonable conditions of employment. No one has anything against the coal-miner personally, but I believe that until he throws off the yoke of his Communist bosses and produces all the coal Australia needs for its industries, our people will suffer, particularly those who labour from daylight to dark to supply the food that the miner needs. The necessity for co-operation extends even further than that; it extends among the workers themselves. The coal-miners are depriving other workers of homes because the shortage of coal is restricting the manufacture of roofing, bricks, cement, and other building materials. The need for co-operation exists within the unions themselves. Indeed, one branch of a union is depriving another branch of work. In my electorate, there are two branches of the waterside workers federation, the members of which are good fellows. There are no Communists among them, and they are prepared to do an honest day's work, but they cannot be fully employed because not enough ships call at the ports of North Queensland. The explanation is that - the wharfiesin Sydney and Melbourne refuse to turn the ships round quickly so that they will be able to return within a reasonable time to Queensland. Shipping is delayed on the waterfront, with the result that people throughout Australia are deprived either of essential goods or ofwork. It is essential that employees shall co-operate with the wage-payers, and with those who produce their food, so that the people may have cement, - roofing tiles, galvanized iron, water spouting and other materials which are in short supply. If they do not obtain those requirements, there will be awful trouble in Australia.",64
197,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Terrible , terrible!  say "" terrible "" in a sneering tone. I do not believe that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryson) realizes the implications of that position. We are living in bad times. The Labour party is still "" blown up "" with the same ideas that it tried to sell to the people three or four years ago that we were living in a golden age. Opposition members have not yet got down to realities, and recognized the danger that threatens our country. If they did so, the spark of patriotism which is in them would impel them to exert all their influence on the workers to increase production. Many Opposition members have a great influence in the community, and they should instil in the people a recognition of the need for complete co-operation. A regrettable feature of the speech by the honourable member for Cunningham was his attack on the medical profession. We all owe a great debt to the doctors. The honourable member for Cunningham and other Opposition members contend that the doctors went on strike, and refused to co-operate",64
198,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Not for the first time, either.  have been prattling the same silly story for many months, and actually appear believe it. The doctors have never refused to co-operate with the sick people. They leave their beds at any hour during the night to attend the sick, and they not even draw a distinction against Oppoclass sition members. It is completely stupid to deride the work of the medical profesing sion. Just as we cannot exist without doctors in the community, so doctors not exist without the help of the workers. Additional hospitals, more beds and new equipment are needed, and those requirethinking. ments can be provided only with the cooperation of the workers. Unfortunately, there is delay, because the miners not producing suflicient coal and the wharfies are not turning ships round quickly. Who is responsible for that position ? The agitators of the Australian Labour party! Historians in the future will state that the greatest curse that fell upon this generation was the class hatred that was preached and practised if by the Australian Labour party when fell from its high pedestal, wedded itself to communism and tried to influence the people of Australia towards communism.",65
199,Mr DUTHIE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I rise to order. The honourable member for Capricornia has stated that the Labour party is wedded communism. That remark is offensive to me, and I ask that it be withdrawn. The TEMPOBABY CHAIRMAN by the (Mr MCDonald) - I did not hear the honourable member's remark.  Mr Temporary Chairman?",65
200,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The statement is slander and a lie.,65
201,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Order! The honourable member may proanything ceed with his speech.  rupted by an Opposition member, who could not "" take it """,65
202,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable member should, withdraw the remark to which objection was taken.",65
203,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order! The Chair will decide whether or not a remark shall be withdrawn.,65
204,Mr DAVIES,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I wish the Chair would do so.  be said, and all that may be left unsaid, to I believe that, during the last twenty years, the people who called themselves the Australian Labour party, and their stalwarts and party organizers in every do field of activity, have been preaching hatred throughout the community. They sowed the wind, and are reapthe whirlwind. All the terrible consequences of their actions are likely to canbe visited upon our heads. We are living in difficult times, in which it is necessary for all of us to do some serious",65
205,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable are member is another Winston Churchill.  honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Clyde Cameron), who is incapable of thinking. This is not a time for joking or jesting. There is almost no time for leisure in this country. The Treasurer has set the community a huge task which, it is to be carried out successfully, will it require the complete co-operation of every individual, including Opposition members., It will need the support of the Australian Workers Union, which is not very proud of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who, before his election to to the Parliament, was its leader in South Australia. I believe that the people will respond to the challenge that is presented budget, and I do not think for one minute that the women of Australia will make a protest against it, as has been forecast by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Curtin) on the ground that they will have to pay a few more shillings a a year for their cosmetics. I have so much faith in the womenfolk that I believe that they are prepared to sacrifice in order to keep Australia free for themselves and for their children. is the call which goes out to Australia today. If we were living for this financial year alone, perhaps the criticisms and the cynicisms of Opposition members might have some weight, but if we have one task in life as human beings, it. is to leave the world a better place for others to live in. Therefore, I urge Opposition members to put the country before tlieir socialist and Communist beliefs. Let us work together for the ultimate good of the whole community.",65
206,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Will s) [10.13] - Th committee has been regaled with a mo3t remarkable speech by the honourable  did not dream, wheu I entered the Parliament, that I should listen to such a diatribe. I cannot believe that the elecincreases, tors of Capricornia either heard him or met him before they elected him. Had they done so, he would not be here. H is speech was a collection of inaccuracies, untruths and definite contradictions. His only political experience appears to have been gained from a copy I of the Liberal Party Speaker's Handduring book. He seems to have learned few garbled statements from it , considers that he is f it to pose as the saviour of the country. The best service that he can render to the Government of which he is a supporter is to remain silent for the rest of the time he is member of this Parliament, because i his later utterances prove to be similar to those to which we have been forced to listen this evening, he will be of any assistance in our debates. made some most remarkable statements, and he had the effrontery, because of ignorance, to tell the committee that Labour party supported the direction labour; in effect, the conscription of labour. The Labour party has always been opposed to the direction of labour. Either the honourable member is very less of the truth or he simply does not understand the political situation or anything about industrial relationships. The honourable gentleman also alleged Labour had neglected age and invalid pensions, that it had no thought for pensioners, and that it had not even troubled to furnish any undertakings in respect of increasing their pensions. I admit once that Labour docs not make rash promises. It is honest with the people. It tells the people merely that it will what it can. For instance, it has never told the people that it will put value in the Â£ 1 .",66
207,Mr WHEELER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Althoug h it did tell the people that it woulcl oppose the munist Party Dissolution Bill .,66
208,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I did not say that I would oppose the Communist Party D i ssolution Bill ; all I said was that I would demand British justice for the people of"" e Australia, and that I objected to legislation of a totalitarian character, such memas that which wns introduced by theI would be fascists opposite. Dealing with the matter of pensions 1 remind the committee that from 190S, when pensions for aged persons were first introduced, until Labour attained office during the recent war, the. pension rate was increased only to 21s. a week, notwithstanding the enormous increases of the cost of living that took place during that lengthy period. Furthermore, remind honourable members opposite that almost the whole of that period a anti-Labour governments were in office. and Between 1941 ancl 1949, when Labour was in office, it increased age pension rates by more than 100 per cent., and by 1949 the pension hacl been increased to Â£2 2s. Gd. a week. At the same time the means test, a about which honourable members opposite?' f complained so much in the last Parliament, was also eased considerably. I recall vividly the utterances made by many not honourable members opposite when they He were in Opposition and advocated the abolition of the means test. In particular. I remind the honourable meinber for Sturt, the (Mr Wilson), who spoke this evening of about what the present Government is doing for recepients of age and service pensions, that he has completely forgotten that plank of the platform of the Liberal careparty, to which he belongs, which provides for the abolition of the means test. know I challenge the honourable gentleman to point to any proposal by the present Gothat vernment to abolish that test.",66
209,Mr MCMAHON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable gentleman should not forget, that an anti-Labour government introduced the at first scheme of national insurance.",66
210,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"It is a fact that a previous anti-Labour administration in do troduced legislation for a national insurance scheme, and that that legislation back was passed through both Houses of the Parliament. But what happened to it? The scheme did not suit the bosses of t.he anti-Labour parties, and it was never Comimplemented. The present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). who was a member - of the administration which introduced that legislation, resigned fro m it because - of its failure to implement the scheme. I recall, further, that the present Minister for National Development (Mr Casey), who was a member of that Ministry, also supported the scheme. However, the introduction of that legislation was hut a sample of the misrepresentations indulged in by the political parties opposite. If honourable members opposite appeared before the people and told them the truth, explaining exactly what they stood for and what they intended to do, they would never win an election. It is only by means of the lies ami misrepresentations in which honourable members opposite indulge that they manage to mislead the people. One need only look at the handbook and printed propaganda of the anti-Labour parties to realise that their protestations of concern for the social welfare of the people are sheer hyprocisy. The honourable member for Capricornia referred to the attitude of Labour towards communism, conscription of man-power, and pensions for the aged. I shall not say that his remarks amounted to a pack of lies, because I believe that he is too immature politically to understand the control exercised over the anti-Labour parties by their bosses outside.",66
211,Mr HAMILTON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"AVha t did the Leader of the Labour party, to which the honourable member belongs, say at the Sydney trades hall recently?",67
212,Mr BEYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The honourable member for Canning (. Mr Hamilton) opens his mouth far too often. If he had a little more intelligence hc would not need to ask so many questions. M.r. WILSON - B y how much Labour increase pensions last year?,67
213,Mr BEYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable member knows that Labour did not increase pensions at all last year. However, the increase which the anti-Labour parties propose to miiko now is most miserable and amounts to nothing more than a gesture. If honourable members opposite had any real sympathy with the aged people in the community they would increase their pensions by at least twice as much as is proposed. I listened attentively to the speech made hy the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) wheu he introduced the budget. I had hoped that on that occasion the rigbt honourable gentleman would explain the reason for the prolonged delay which preceded the introduction of the budget. It is the custom of Treasurers to present their budgets early in September, and there was no real reason why the present Government should uot have adhered to that practice. I have heard it said that the budget was prepared in six successive forms, all of which were unacceptable to the Cabinet or to one or other of the coalition parties. However, the Treasurer forgot to tell us why he had delayed for so long the presentation of the the budget, and I twitted honourable members opposite in an endeavour to discover the reason for the delay.",67
214,Mr CHARLES ANDERSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Why should they give a reason?,67
215,Mr BRYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Why should they not do so? When the Treasurer and his colleagues fail so lamentably in their duty to the people that they fall six weeks in arrears with their duty, even after they have had the benefit of a recess of three months, it is only reasonable to inquire the cause of their inaction. Were they engaged in a sit-down strike?",67
216,Mr EOGINS,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Why did the Opposition hold up the country by obstructing vital legislation and then squib the issue?,67
217,Mr BEYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The honourable gentleman should not be so silly as to ask such a question. I ask honourable members opposite why the Government has adopted a go-slow policy. If the coalminers, the waterside workers or the seamen of this country decided that they woulcl go slow and, as a. consequence, in did a period of three months fell into arrears with their work by six weeks, we should hear a great deal of condemnation of them from the anti-Labour parties. Of course, the matter is different when the members of the present Government adopt a go-slow policy, and their supporters attempt to defend them by asking, why should they not go slow? Apparently, there is one law for the present Government and another one for the ordinary workers. I want to know the real reason for the adoption of the go-slow policy. Dealing with the proposals in the budget, I point out that the 'budget was ostensibly intended tp correct inflation. Indeed, that was announced as the primary purpose of - its introduction. However, although governmental expenditure for which provision was made in the budget introduced hy the Ohifley Government last year amounted to Â£556,000,000, the so-called anti-inflation budget introduced by the present Government proposes to Â£738,000,000. Of course, the increased expenditure will reduce the cost of living and restore value to the Â£ 1 ! A lot of criticism of Labour's financial proposals was uttered by the present Treasurer during the last Parliament when he was in opposition, and he freely criticized the manner in which the proposals contained in that government's budgets were presented. In particular, he complained that the last budget provided for wildly extravagant expenditure; yet he has now introduced the most inflationary proposals that have ever come before the Parliament. Of course, that is only a part of the story. After analysing the speech made by the Treasurer when he presented the budget and examining the figures it contains, it is clear that the right honourable gentleman could not balance his budget by ordinary means, so he decided to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue by extorting a forced loan of Â£103,000,000 from the wool-growers of Australia. If he had' decided to finance the deficit by borrowing there might have been some merit in his proposal. In an attempt to justify his proposal to penalize the wool-growers he has. stated that they will not be deprived of all that money, but that it will be used as a set-off against their future tax liabilities. Of course, some of it may be so used Mr TORIS BULI, - A portion of that T sum may be used for the payment of the tax for which wool growers will be liable this year. Mr BEYSON"" - The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) should stick to the discussion of rabbits because he does not know anything about the matter vvith which I am dealing at the moment. The wool sales deduction will be a forced', loan on which no interest will be paid and it will be extracted from only onesection of the community. As I have said, the sole purpose of that extraction is to enable the Government to balanceits budget. However, the financial problem that will confront the Treasurer next, year will be even greater than are its present problems, because the wool growers will then have paid in advance a expend very large portion of their income tax for that financial year, so that in the result the revenue from taxation will be reduced considerably. It is clear that the budget now before the committee will not check the present inflationary spiral, but will aggravate it more and more as time goes on. The Treasurer also said that he intended to simplify the preparation of income tax returns in the interests of the taxpayers, and that a part of his proposals would provide for the elimination of the present method of showing on taxation assessments a dissection of the total amount owing by a taxpayer so as to indicate the allocation for social services and for income tax. In future income tax assessments will merely show the gross amount payable by the taxpayers. I cannot perceive any improvement in that innovation. The Treasurer also proposes to instruct the Commissioner of Taxation to set out on the back of the assessment forms the rates of tax payable on various incomes so that taxpayers will be able to check the assessor's calculations of the amounts of tax payahle. The result of that change will be merely to encourage taxpayers to engage in controversies with the taxation authorities. Unless a taxpayer's calculations agree with those of the tax assessors he will feel an immediate grievance with the Commissioner of Taxation. Nevertheless, the Treasurer says that his proposal will be of great help to the taxpayers. It is very simple. The Government tells the taxpayer this, that and the other, but the Treasurer will still take just as much money from taxpayers as the previous Treasurer took, and their financial position will not be improved. The Treasurer has also told us that he proposes to reduce income tax pavments by about Â£7,000,000 a year through an alteration from the rebate system in respect of allowable deductions, to the straight-out deduction system. He bas provided tables on that matter, and it is very interesting to note from them that the people who earn small wages and who cannot afford to pay taxes, will have the benefit of a very small reduction of the amount of tax that they have to pay whilst people on incomes of Â£5,000, Â£10,000 or Â£15,000 a year will receive great benefit. That is a complete departure from the system that we have had in operation in Australia for a number of years, which is, taxation according to ability to pay. This Government is taking care of its friends as hest as it can. I suggest that the Prime Minister has taken the "" Tragic Treasurer's"" mantle from the shoulders of the present Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) and has placed it upon the shoulders of his present Treasurer. Last night the Prime Minister referred affectionately to the Minister for Health as "" Dogsbody "". I do not know why he should have given the Minister for Health such a name, but I suppose that he had to find something new for him after he had handed over the title of "" Tragic Treasurer"" to the right honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Fadden). I turn now to the sales tax, which provides another example of how the Government is carrying out its promises to the people to reduce taxation and the rate of Government expenditure. I have shown how the Government has kept its promise to reduce expenditure by actually increasing expenditure from Â£566,000,000 last year to an estimate of Â£738,000,000 this year. I shall now show how it is reducing taxation on the people by making alterations to the incidence of sales tax. The Treasurer has stated that he proposes to reduce sales tax. As a mattei' of fact he has exempted a number of items from sales tax. Those exemptions will mean a 'reduction of Â£1,000,000 a year in the revenue. That sounds very good. It sounds as if he is reducing taxes on the people, but when we look further we find that he intends to increase sales tax on other items so as to bring in another Â£7,500,000 in this financial year. In actual fact the Treasurer will receive from sales tax Â£6,500,000 more than was received last year. An examination of this method that the Treasurer has adapted to sales tax will prove interesting. I shall not mention many of the items that are the subject of proposed alterations of sales tax, but I shall mention several of them. For instance, floral tributes, including bouquets, posies, floral baskets and sheaves containing natural flowers, have had sales tax removed from them entirely. But other items that the Treasurer apparently regards as real luxuries, because the rate of sales tax on them has been increased to 33^ per cent., include body powders, deodorants and other toilet preparations that women use, such as leg tan lotion and liquid hosiery which save them the expense of buying silk and nylon stockings. Those are considered luxuries, but a wreath to be placed on a coflin or a bouquet of flowers that a man might take to his girl friend are not luxuries, according to the Treasurer, but are necessities, aud therefore are not to be subject to sales tax. Motor cars, which are used for pleasure only aTe considered by the Government to be luxuries, and the rate of sales tax on them has been increased from 8-J per cent, to 10 per cent., an increase of If per cent. Motor cars are a luxury to many people. However, we find that wireless receiving sets are apparently a much greater luxury than motor ears, according to the Government, because the rate of sales tax on wireless receiving sets is to be increased from 8J per cent, to 25 per cent. But a wireless set is not really a luxury nowadays. Such sets are used in homes all over this Commonwealth, and are among the few means of entertainment that the ill-paid worker can afford. But if the worker is to be called upon to pay 25 per cent, sales tax on wireless sets many of the poorer members of the community will not be able to purchase them. People who need wireless sets for the purposes of entertainment or of listening to the news and thus save themselves the price of a newspaper, or of listening to a broadcast by the Prime Minister, will not be able to afford the additional 25 per cent. .But if they wish to buy a motor car they will have to pay only 10 per cent, sales tax, because according to the Government a motor car to be used for pleasure is not so much of a luxury as is. a wireless set that is to be used for the purposes of entertainment and education. Among othor luxuries listed are watches and clocks. The Government thinks that the people now should not have the means of telling the time. ' I believe from the speeches of honourable members opposite that Government supporters have the idea that the mentality of the people is so low that they will not be able to read the time by a watch or clock. However, there are still a number bf us who are able to tell the time, and I suggest that a watch or clock is not a luxury but is a necessity. How is the unfortunate worker to be able to arrive at work on time if he cannot afford to buy a watch or a clock? Also listed among the luxuries are collar-studs and sleeve-links. A collar stud is not much of a luxury when it falls on the floor and rolls under the wardrobe, and a man has to get down on his hands and knees to And it. But collar-studs and sleeve-links are a vital necessity because of the few buttons that manufacturers now put on shirts. However, as far as the Government is concerned, collar-studs and sleeve-links are luxuries and we can do without them. I turn now to several of the items that are to be subject to the 25 per cent, rate of sales tax. One item the inclusion of which in that list should interest Australian Country party supporters, is "" cowbells"". How will the electors be able to find members of the Australian Country party who have not got cowbells hung around their necks? They will be lost forever without cowbells, so they should be raising their voices in protest about this particular item. Evidently the heavy duty on cowbells is part of the price that Australian Oountry party supporters have to pay for rhe privilege of being represented in the Government. Other items that are subject to heavy sales tax are mouthorgans and harmonicas that children like to play. ] should not mind if was 100 per cent, tax on bagpipes, I am not a Scotsman, but if tax-free bagilr. Bryaov. pipes were necessary to keep Scotsmen in a good temper, then bagpipes could be entirely free of tax so far as I am concerned. The items that I have mentioned provide a sample of what the country is being given in the budget. There is some humour to be found in the budget, but there is also a great deal of seriousness. The Government, which is a combination of members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party or, as I have said before, a combination of incompatibles, is treading the same ruinous path that was followed by a previous Government of its ilk, the Bruce-Page Government. It is applying a policy of borrow and bust. The Government is borrowing from a section of the people, by means of a forced interest-free loan that it proposes to take from the wool growers which it intends to use to balance its budget. It has borrowed 100,000,000 dollars from Americanfinanciersat a rate of 3-| per cent, interest, and has made preliminary arrangements to borrow another 100,000,000 dollars in America. It has put itself into pawn to overseas capitalists in exactly the same manner as the Bruce Page Government did in the late 1920's. I remind the committee that during the eight years of Labour administration, when we had to face the greatest expenditure in the history - of this Commonwealth, and when the most expensive and devastating war ever fought by this country was in progress, the Labour Governments financed the whole of the war and the whole of the business of governing this country, without borrowing one half-penny overseas, either from Britain or America. Now- I use those terms in a time of peace and prosperity, despite the fact that some members of the Government have been endeavouring to paint a very dull picture of conditions in Australia-at a time when the country is more prosperous than it has ever been, when more money is available than ever before, and when we have more money than we know how to spend",67

219,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Higgins-Minister for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration ) [10.44] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I take this opportunity to discuss what I can only regard as a very remarkable development that has occurred today. I refer to the announcement by the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt ) of his appearance before the High Court of Australia on behalf of the Waterside Workers Eederation of Australia and a Mr James Healy. I say that that is a very remarkable development.,71
220,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I rise to order. I take the point that the matter now being talking? raised by the Minister is sub judice. It is not possible to speak about the which the Minister is referring to with out mentioning the act which is affected by it . The ruling has been given on previous occasions that cases such as this rnnst not be discussed in this House. take the point of order, that any matter closely associated with the act is out of order.",71
221,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Speakin g to the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have intention of discussing the merits otherwise of the issues before the High statesCourt, nor do I propose to canvass the merits or otherwise of legislation which has been passed by this Parliament. I propose, with your concurrence, to examine the political significance of the development to which I have referred as it affects the parties in this at, Parliament, and the Parliament as an institution. I submit that I am entitled to do that, and I suggest that you hear me. If I go beyond those limits, I shall how to your direction. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , - I am cast, prepared to listen to the Minister on basis.",71
222,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"This is a remarkable development. I do not challenge the right of an honourable member, who is a memmy ber of the legal profession, to appear before the courts of this country. That has occurred from time to time. But is no ordinary case and the right honoring able member for Barton is no ordinary barrister.  "" no ordinary case ""?",71
223,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,This is no ordinary case in the sense that the right honourable gentleman himself was one of the leading actors in the issue which is now before the court.,71
224,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What issue?,71
225,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The Leader of the Opposition took the point a moment ago that I must not discuss the issues, and now invites me to deal with them.",71
226,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I renew my point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Minister has completely evaded the point. What is the issue about which he is now Is it the legislation which was passed by this Parliament, and is now case the subject of consideration before the - High Court of Australia? If not, what other issue is he ref erring to ?",71
227,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The Leader of the Opposition has not stated I the Standmg Order under which he take* his point of order. I am prepared, at this stage, to allow the Minister to develop his argument.",71
228,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Let me read a passage no which appeared in one of the leading or Melbourne papers this afternoon. It It is being forecast that Dr Evatt will probably be a leading member of the antiGovernment bar when the main arguments on the validity of the Act begin.,71
229,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What act?,71
230,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"T he act which is present before the High Court. I put aside the issues involved in the act and concern myself with the fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this House, who is the right honourable member for Barton, will, according to this foreplay a leading part in challenging that legislation before the High Court.",71
231,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What legislation ?,71
232,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am no longer concerned with the legislation. Eor the purpose of present argument, it could be any legislation. My argument is that the Deputy Leader of the Labour party and this of the Opposition, is apparently seekto challenge legislation which has been passed by both sides' of this Parliament, with the full concurrence of both Houses, and without a dissentient vote from honourable members, including the right honourable man. I shall confine myself to that issue, because, rightly or wrongly, the people of Australia will read very great significance into it. Eightly or wrongly, they will read into the appearance of the i right honourable gentleman a sympathy and support for the cause which he seeks to defend on behalf of those for whom he appears.",71
233,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Will they be right or wrong?,72
234,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"That is one of the questions which I hope will be determined as the result of this discussion. The public will read into that appearance a deep significance, and, that being so, honourable party ? members are entitled to know what significance honourable gentlemen opposite read into the fact that the deputy leader of their party is proposing to lenge legislation, or some parts of it, which, they, as a party, have fully endorsed without a dissentient vote. Honourable members on the Government side of the House, and the people of this country are entitled: to have these questions answered. Is the right honourable gentleman, in making this appearance, doing so with the knowledge, support, and consent of the party of which he is deputy leader?'",72
235,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,What has that to do with it ?,72
236,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I think it has a lot to with it. The people of Australia will be very interested to know whether the right honourable gentleman  to prejudice the standing of the right honourable member for Barton before the court.,72
237,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am not. I am trying to elicit mformation about whether the right honourable gentleman has acted with the full support and approval of hisparty, and with the knowledge that he has Stat. full approval and support.",72
238,Mr CLYBECAMEEON,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The Minister cannot blame the party for the action of an individual.,72
239,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I am not concerned with that as an issue. I desire to know whether honourable members of the Opposition approved of their deputy leader appeargentleing in this case when they must know, as he must have known, the significance that the public would read into his appearance. I should be doing the right honourable gentleman less than justice if I imagined that he did not, himself, - know that great significance would be read into his appearance. I should be doing him less than justice if I were to assume that he went into that court without any consciousness that he would, in some way, be committing his party to the action that he was taking. That is the point. Did he go into court knowing that he was committing his party to a certain line of action, and that he had the approval and support of his My second question is, if the right honourable gentleman has the approval chaland support of his party honourable members are entitled to know ",72
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order l  with you too.,72
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The honourable member for Lalor will apologize to the Chair for that remark.  Deputy Speaker.,72
242,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"If the right honourable gentleman did not go into court with the do support and knowledge of his party, did he go in with the approval and the knowledge of the leader of his party? I can hardly assume that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have taken a course of this kind, which he must have known wouid have repercussions so far as his party was concerned, without having consulted his ""leader. Honourable members are entitled to know whether the Leader of the Opposition gave his approval to the adoption of that course by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. [Extension of time granted.} Assuming that the answer to both those questions is "" No "", and that the right honourable gentleman did not have the full approval of his party and his leader in taking this action, my third question is whether he took this action on his own initiative knowing, as he must have known, that by so doing, he would give a very wide circle of people in this country the belief that he had acted on behalf of his party, and would thus ereate in their minds doubts and questions on where his party would stand on this issue. It is all very well for the Leader of Opposition to take points of order on this matter. He would be doing his colleague and his country a better service if, instead or trying to smother this issue, he would state where the party stood and where he stood on this matter. This is not a challenge on the part of those who sit behind me in this place, nor on my part to the right of the right honourable gentleman to appear as a barrister before the courts of this land. But honourable members have the right to know the political significance of the action which the right honourable gentleman has chosen to take. He could not, even if he wished to do so, dissociate himself in the public mind from the stand that he has taken in this place. His resentment of actions which have occurred in this place is known, and his declared sympathies have been made public. He cannot dissociate those tilings from the public conception of what is going on. Therefore, it is of greatimportance and it is very desirable in the interests of good government that the people should know where this Parliament stands in relation to the issue which' is under challenge. I repeat the three questions which I have asked. Did the right honourable gentleman have the support of his party as a whole? If not, did he act with the knowledge and support bf his own leader ? Assuming that the answer to both those questions is "" No "", it can only be assumed that the right honourable gentleman took this course with the full knowledge of the significance which would be attached to his action, and with a reckless disregard of its consequences to his party or because he believed that what he was doing was justified in the eyes of his party. Unless these questions are answered frankly and clearly, the people will only have their bewilderment increased on this subject, and this Parliament will have no clear indication of what its course is to be in relation to the legislation undei-review.

243,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Macquarie-Leade r of the Opposition) [10.58] - I have not heard in this Parliament a more disgracef u l speech than that which has just been made by the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt). I raised a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, on which I do not think you gave a direct the ruling. I should have thought that when any issue was the subject of discussion by a court of the country, a Minister of the Crown would have been the last person to have raised any discussion on it, particularly a Minister of the Crown who was also a member of the legal profession. The Minister's attack is characteristic of the smear campaign, and the generally miserable and petty attitude which is being adopted by members of the Government whenever they happen to disagree with anybody whose character they can damage by innuendo aud inference. The. Minister has not had the courage to refer to a particular issue in this case. Would any honourable member of this House who had no knowledge of the particular matters which are now being referred to, understand what the Minister for Labour and National Service was talking about? He certainly would not. That is the plain fact, and I suggest that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, also have no knowledge, by virtue of your office, of matters which have not been directly referred to and stated in this House in clear and unmistakable terms. I shall say briefly what I intend to say because I do not desire to take up the time of the House in engaging in recriminations such as these, which are a disgrace to both the Government and the Minister. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) is appearing in a case in a Melbourne court, so I understand. My knowledge has been gained merely from a report appearing in an evening newspaper. As a member of the legal profession he is acting on behalf of clients who have engaged him in that capacity. He is not acting in any other capacity that I know of. The question whether the right honourable gentleman should appear in any court, in fact the question whether any honourable member of this House should appear in any court, does not seem to me to be material. Whether the Minister for Labour and National Servioe should go to court aud in his capacity as a lawyer represent a client, does not seem .to me to be a that the Liberal party woulcl discuss. The legal members of this House are under no obligation to approach their political parties every time they go to court to represent a client, merely to ascertain whether the party agrees with their proposed action.",73
244,Mr KEKWJCK,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,All we want is answer to the questions asked.,74
245,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I do not want, any cheek from the honourable member for Bass (Mr Kekwick). The honourable member for Bass has become a member of this House quite recently, but he endeavours to assert himself by making insulting remarks and references. I have been a meinber of this House for some time and I have not found it to be necessary for honourable members to speak to one another in the particular tone ancl manner adopted by the honourable member for Bass. I think that he should take a course in parliamentary manners.",74
246,Mr KEKWICK,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"You just cannot, take it.",74
247,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"As the Minister for Labour and National Service knows, the right honourable member for Barton holds a particularly privileged position in the legal profession, and is under an obligation to act in accordance with the ethics of that profession. My clear-cut answer to the questions of the Minister for Labour and National Service will be given directly, but I hope that the Government does not intend to allow this discussion to proceed about an act which is now being considered before the court. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,- I have not beard any reference to legislation as yet.",74
248,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"No , because every honourable member avoids mentioning it.",74
249,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,There is no objection to referring to the anti-Communist act.,74
250,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I took the point of order that no act, or case before a court relating to an act, should be referred",74
251,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The right honourable member's point of order was not upheld.,74
252,Mr CHIFLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Mr Deputy Speaker has not yet given a ruling on it. I suggest that the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) does not undermatter stand what he is talking about. My clear reply to the Minister for Labour and National Service is that the right honourable member for Barton has not consulted with the Labour party at any time about any case in which he has appeared or may appear in his legal capacity, except in regard to the banking an case. I do not think that any otlier honourable member who is a member of the legal profession ever consults his party on such matters. The right honourable member for Barton is acting before the court as a member of the legal profession. He is representing clients hy whom he has been engaged ancl by whom he will be paid. There is no question of this party having discussed that representation or having discussed any action of the right honourable member for Barton in appearing in that particular case. I take the view that any member of the legal profession, or in fact of any other profession, has a complete right to practice his profession outside this House, without his motives being questioned by this Honse or by any one else. A man is entitled, as a member of the legal profession, to defend murderers ancl all sorts of criminals. I suggest that because such members of the legal profession defend murderers they certainly cannot be accused of being in sympathy with murder. The whole thing is completely ridiculous, and I am astounded that the Minister for Labour and National Service should lend himself to an act of this character against a. member of his own profession. He knows very well that the members of that profession, or indeed of any other profession, areentitled to practice their profession without reference to their political party and without .any endorsement from anybody. That is exactly what the right honourable member for Barton is doing in this case. I remind the House that a number of other eminent King's Counsel are appearing with him in opposition to certain governmeut measures. Those gentlemen stand just as to. high in Australia's legal circles as does the Minister for Labour and National Service, or anybody else. Mr Weston, KC, Mr Hardie, K . C , and others are appearing on the same side as the right honourable member for Barton, but nobody casts any doubt on their integrity and honesty. They are not mcmbers of the Labour party. Probably they are members of the Liberal party. The right honourable member for Barton is doing whatever he is doing purely as a member of the legal profession. He is not acting on behalf of his party, or as a result of any discussion with this party and not as a result of any decision that he should represent this party in any particular case in any particular court.",74
253,Mr OSBORNE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Evans) """"11.7] - As a member of the legal profession I would be the first to recognize the right of any member of my profession to appear for any client in any court in the country. But the absence of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) from the Parliament today and the circumstances of his absence are entirely peculiar. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ohifley) mentioned that other eminent counsel are engaged in certain proceedings. They have not taken a leading part in the political background of the matters that are under discussion in the court, nor have they been engaged for a long time solely in political activiby ties. I think that it is correct to say that the absence of the right honourable meinber for Barton from this House today, in order to appear in a court, is the first occasion on which he has been absent for that purpose since he ceased to he Attorney-General. The Minister has plainly stated the political aspect of this matter. He has called upon the Leader of the Opposition to state where the Opposition stands today, but the Leader of the Opposition has failed to-do so. Honourable members of this House and the people of Australia are entitled to know where the Opposition stands in relation to the appearance of the right honourable member for Barton in the case now before the court. In view of the complete failure of the Leader of the Opposition to answer that question, we must seek for the answer ourselves. I suggest to the House that there are three possible reasons why the right honourable member for Barton is appearing.",75
254,Mr BEAZLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I rise to order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The honourable member for Evans (Mr Osborne) is apparently going to launch an attack on the right honourable member for Barton. Government supporters interjecting,",75
255,Mr BEAZLEY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I remind honourable members on the Government side, who are so consistent in their interjections, that my point of order will be heard by Mr Deputy Speaker, who I presume does not take instructions from honourable members. An attempt is being made to attack the standing of one counsel appearing in court. Honourable members on the Government side have already spoken of his identity with the legislation recently before this Parliament. That is an attempt to influence the mind of the court by lowering the status of the counsel concerned.",75
256,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The Parliament is quite entitled to discuss the activities of any of its members. In 1934, there was a motion of urgency to discuss the activities of a member of the Parliament in relation to certain government contracts. A debate on that matter was permitted. I rule, therefore, that the activities of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) may be discussed the House. The other point raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Chifley) has not yet arisen, and there i9 no need for 'me to give a ruling on it.",75
257,Mr OSBORNE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I repeat that the Leader of the Opposition has completely failed to answer legitimate inquiries a.bout the political implications of the absence from this chamber of the right honourable member for Barton. I contend that we are entitled to discuss this matter and to seek some explanation of this extraordinary procedure. The first explanation that comes to my mind is that the right honourable meinber for Barton is demonstrating his disapproval of the decision forced upon him and his party by the Opposition's extra-mural masters. As we all know, the Opposition stated again and again that it had adopted a stand on a certain issue as a matter of vital ijrinciple. We saw that stand shamefully abandoned. One possible explanation of the right honourable gentleman's actions, therefore, is that he is taking this opportunity to demonstrate his own, and his party's disapproval of the decision that was forced upon them. That is the only explanation that suggests itself if the right honourable gentleman is absent the approval of his leader and of his party. However, if he is absent from House and engaged on this work without the approval of his party, another possible explanation is that the dissension which so obviously existed among honourable members opposite has reached such a stage today that the right honourable gentleman is seeking to establish his leadership of one section of the Labour party. If that is not the explanation, only other one that remains is that, defiance of the wishes of his own leader and colleagues, the right honourable gentlenot man is demonstrating the depth of his convictions. The Opposition can have any .of those alternatives, but I submit that the House is entitled to a statement by the Leader of the Opposition of which explanation is the correct one.",75
258,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"East Sydney) [11.13] Honourable members on the Government side of the chamber seem to be very present hard to convince. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) has stated that the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) has not consulted his party about his present activities in the Court, nor do we consider that it is Paterson. necessary for him to do so. Acting in his professional capacity, he. is at liberty to take a brief as is any other honourable member of this House in similar circumstances. Is it suggested that a person who is accused of an offence in any court of this country is not entitled to engage the best available counsel to defend him? Although it is matter of opinion, I think it is generally conceded that the right honourable member for Barton is one of Australia's leading jurists-and I include in the comparison those in this House who have been recently elevated to the position of King's Counsel. It may be an indicaParliament, tion of the way the Government is tending when its supporters argue that, because people hold particular .political views, they should be denied proper representaciate tion before the courts. I have heard legal members of this chamber talking about the ethics of their profession. When thing improper. did it become necessary for a member of the legal profession, before accepting a brief, to ask an intending client what his political views were? In my opinion with right honourable member for Barton is quite within his rights and his action the should not suggest to any reasonable member of this House, or of the Australian community, that he necessarily accepts the view of the client that he represents. To show the hypocrisy of honoraible members opposite I have only to cite the recent trials of Japanese Avar criminals. Not. only were the accused provided with counsel, but the Commonthe wealth paid the cost of the defence. in Yet honourable . members opposite would deny to Australian citizens who have even been charged with an offence own against the laws of this country the right of adequate representation! The Government wants to prejudge the matter. As we said it would when we were discussing a certain measure, the Government intends, by its own decision and nobody else's, to decide who were to be declared as Communists. I have looked down the list of counsel briefed in the proceedings, and it is clear that, including both sides, the bar is the strongest that could be obtained in this country. The only member of the bar shown in the list of appearances who High I know to be an avowed Communist is I also notice that the bar includes a particular legal friend as much of the Minister for Supply (Mr. Beale), Mr Simon Isaacs, who, rather strangely, seems to secure a great deal of Communist work. I say to the Minister for Supply that in many quarters Mr Isaacs is believed to be not only sympathetic to the Communist party, a hut also a member of it. It is also true that when certain elements of the Liberal party were concocting evidence and trying to "" frame "" me, the Minister for Supply and the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Spender) were advising Isaacs. When I dealt with that matter in this I produced evidence to that effect. Therefore, although we have at the table of the House to-night in the person of the Minister for Supply, an assoof people who are believed to be Communists, it is not suggested by any Government member that he is doing anyI pass on from that matter because I the realise the honourable members opposite are eager to know what is the position of the honourable member for Barton. Is it not a fact that the present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) on a number of occasions was paid to give legal opinions to unions that had Communist officials? Was there anything improper about that? Was it suggested that, because the right honourable gentleman gave those opinions, he held 'Communist views or supported the philosophy of communism? This is only a pretence on the part of members of the Government calculated to cloud the issue and to create in the minds of the people the very impression that the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt) has suggested will be created. The Minister asked what construction the Australian public would place on this act by the right honourable member for Barton. In doing so he suggested the construction that Government supporters want to put on it, which is that members of the Labour party are eager to defend the Communist party. "" During the debate on a - certain measure both in this House and the Senate, I heard legal men express some doubts about its validity. Is it not only proper that if people believe that an action by this Government is invalid, they should have the right to challenge it before the High Court? Por what reason does the High Court exist? Or, is it to be presumed that access to the court and the proper methods of defence are to be denied to people who desire to approach it because they hold certain political opinions? It would be a sorry day for this country if the Parliament ever accepted the view expressed by the Minister for Labour and National Service as a guiding principle in respect of our judicial system. A cowardly attack is being made upon the right honourable member for Barton in his absence. As he will be returning to the House within the next day or so, those who wanted to launch the attack could have done so when the right, honourable member was present in the chamber and was thus able to defend himself. I understand that there is a body known as the Bar Association-no t that I have much confidence in it-that is supposed to tect members of the legal profession against unprovoked attacks upon their integrity. That body might give some attention to the action of the Minister for Labour and National Service and the honourable member for Evans (Mr Osborne), and also the Minister for Supply, who, no doubt, will follow me, in their attack on the right honourable membei for Barton and 1 in trying to establish a principle that would deny to accused persons, because of their political opinions, the best counsel that could be briefed. There is no doubt that the Government is trying to make political capital out of something which should not he the direct concern of the Parliament at all. The right honourable member for Barton is acting upon his own initiative as a member of the legal professon. He has accepted a brief that has heen offered to him. He has not sought the view of his party with regard to his act, because he has not had any need to do so. When he appears in the role of counsel before the High Court he will not be speaking on behalf of the Opposition, but will be representing a client. Government supporters are endeavouring to make a great deal out of nothing. No doubt the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) will take this opportunity to add a chapter to The Garden Path so that it may be quoted in future as another instance where it alleged the right honourable member for Barton has defended the Communist party. Judging from the expressions that supporters of the Government have uttered this evening, it is no idle talk on the part .of members of the Opposition when the latter accuse them of having fascist tendencies.",76
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,77
260,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Richmond-Post master-General) [11.23] - It is perfectly fitting that the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) should come to the defence of the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) in' the absence of the latter from the House on this occasion. He is worthy of that role. Indeed, does not an obligation rest upon him to come to the defence of the right prohonorable member? Was it not only on Thursday night last that the right honourable member for Barton came to the defence of the honourable member for East Sydney? On this occasion the Lonorable member for East Sydney reciprocating in that he has come to the were used. aid of and in the defence of the right honourable member. However, the right honourable meinber is giving legal aid the Communist party, whereas in this House on Thursday night last the honour the able member for East Sydney said that would take illegal steps if necessary defend the same party.",77

264,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I did not say the Communist party at all. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER , - As the words used by the Postmaster-General are not unparliamentary, he need not withdraw them.

It is perfectly right that honourable member for East Sydney hÂ» should go to the aid of a colleague who to is trying to do that in a legal way. Between the two of them, they should have unbounded success, because each is in his own particular department. The right honourable member for Barton has the utmost right to go to the aid of the Communist party if it is in distress. Did not the same right honourable member lift the ban on that party in 1942? Did not the same right honourable member, when he was Attorney General, release Ratliff and Thomas, the two Communists whom the previous Government had interned for subversive activities? Did not the same right honorpreable member do his best to prevent the Parliament fro m passing into law the Communist Party Dissolution Bill? Mr DEPUTY'' SPEAKER - Order ! r",78
267,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The right honourable member for Barton is probably the most qualified person in this country to he doing the very job that, of his own volition, according to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley), he has .elected to do today. The Leader of the Opposition has disowned the action that the the right honourable member has taken by saying that the right honourable member it, had not consulted the Opposition and that he had had no need to consult himself as Leader of the Opposition. But every Postmastermember of the Labour party will be bound up with what the right honourable member for Barton is doing at present. There is into no escape for them in that respect. The for right honourable .member is the Deputy lay Leader of the Opposition in this House, and ho cannot divorce what he does at one stage as a member of the Parliament and from wha.the does at anpther stage outside when he is acting in a legal capacity. It is very significant that, so far as know, the only actions in which the right honourable member has been engaged in a legal capacity before the High Court have been, first, when he attempted to nationalize the trading banks; secondly, wben be tried to socialize the medical profession of Australia; and, thirdly, ou this occasion. In deference to your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, I sball not say anything about the legislation that this occasion involvesAs every one knows what that legislation is, it is not necessary for mo to indicate it. It is perfectly proper for the honourable member for East Sydney to wax indignant. Indeed, when he made his statement on Thursday night last, the first member of the Opposition to conic forward in his defence was the right honourable member for Barton, who, with indignation in his voiee, denounced tliose who had denounced the honourable membei'. There we have the complete set-up. One lionorable member is working inside this House, and the other is working outside it. The people of Australia will form their own conclusions about where the real sympathies of these honourable gentlemen lie. I regret to say that unfortunately i.n doing so they will also include in their condemnation many members of the Australian Labour party who have not the slightest sympathy for those whom the right honourable member for Barton and the honourable member for East Sydney are striving so strenuously to protect and defend. '  is the most disgraceful episode that I have witnessed during my membership of this Parliament. It is significant that this discussion has not the endorsement of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) for the right honourable gentleman is absent from the chamber. Notwithstanding the fact that the Prime Minister disagrees with me and my political party, if he were present in the chamber I am sure that he would hang his hoad in shame.

268,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! The honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Beazley) must remain silent.  able member for poison bait,79
269,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Order ! The honourable member must withdraw his unparliamentary reference to another honourable member.  the honourable member for Macarthur asked a question of the Prime Minister today one had only to look at the right honourable gentleman's face as ho rose to reply to see his disgust that such a question should have been asked in the Parliament. It. is disgraceful that a member of the legal profession, a member of the Ministry, and one of Hi s Majesty's Executive Councillors, should come into this Parliament and, without naming a particular legal action, sliould endeavour to belittle in the eyes of the justices of the court one of the legal representatives of a party to a High Courtaction. I have never witnessed a more shameful spectacle in this Parliament. I repeat that the absence of the Prime Minister from the chaniber is most, significant. Undoubtedly the right honourable gentleman is ashamed of what, is going on. This matter was left io the initiative of one of his senior Ministers, who has shamed himself and the honourable profession to which he belongs. It has been said that lawyers are very queer individuals. I propose to relate the story of an incident, which has some relevancy to the issue before us, which took place in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria many years ago. At that time the present Prime Minister hold the Nunawading seat and I had been gibing him about the fact that, for the sake of filthy lucre, he had appeared in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court on behalf of a certain union, the members of which had lodged a claim for a reduction of hours of duty and an increase of wages, and that a fortnight later he again appeared before, the same court on behalf of the Victorian Eailway Commissioners to oppose a claim by - mother union for the reduction of hours of duty and an increase of the rates of pay of its members. Beply ing to my gibe, he said, "" We l l , Mr Speaker, I won both ways, didn't I ? "" That incident illustrates the point that I am making, that members of the legal fraternity do not necessarily hold the same views as their clients. I suspect that the. right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) has very strong views in relation to the case in which he is appearing and accordingly the filthy attempt that has been made to prejudice his standing in the High Court is most despicable. I am sure that when the justices of the High Court read of this disgusting episode they will be ashamed that it should have been initiated by a member of the legal fraternity who may at some time in the future be himself a member of the court. I have observedthat certain honourable members opposite who served with the Australian Imperial Force have given some backing to the case that was presented by the Minister for Lahour and National Service (Mr. Holt). They know very well that during the course of military operations soldiers occasionally commit offences for which they are court-martialled and that the King's regulations provide that if a soldier accused of having committed an offence cannot find a soldier's friend to defend him an officer shall be appointed' to present his case. Do they contend that any reflection should be cast on the selected officer in such cases? The contemptible members and supporters of this Government would deny to a member of this House merely because of his political associations the privilege that is accorded to an officer who acts in that capacity, and endeavour to damn him in the eyes of the justices of the High Court. This is the most deplorable episode that has ever occurred in any parliament in the world. '",79
270,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Parramatta-Minister for Supply) [11.38] - The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), with his usual charm, has prevailed on me to enter this debate by hurling a few insults at me across the chamber. I am delighted to do so. It is time that the issues were made clear. As far as I know, no personal attack was made on the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt), but very significant and interesting questions were raised but not discussed by members of the Opposition about where the Opposition stands in relation to this matter.",80

I cannot believe that the right honourable member for Barton, who is the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labour party in this House, did not consult his party or his leader before he absented himself from his duty in this House. As a member of the profession to which I also belong, the right honourable member was quite within his rights in appearing in the court for anybody for whom he wished to appear. We ail concede that right. Indeed that is an obligation of which barristers have been very proud for hundreds of years. If a barrister is asked to appear in a case which falls within the jurisdiction in which he usually practises, and if satisfactory fees are offered to him and he is not otherwise engaged, an obligation rests on him to accept the brief. If the case is regarded by him as distasteful, it is well known that there are plenty of ways in which he may avoid accepting it. He can at least plead that he is otherwise engaged. If , however, the case is not distasteful to him, and he thinks that it is his duty to accept the brief, he does so. None of that is in dispute in this case. The question in dispute is this: Has he an obligation, first of all as a member of .this Parliament, and secondly as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, primarily to be in his place in this House? I should have thought not only that an excuse for declining this brief was available to him, ' but also that he had some sort of an obligation under which he might well have said, "" My primary duty is in the Parliament of which I am a member, and I am paid to attend to it by the taxpayers of Australia"". Let us have no misunderstanding about this matter. The right honourable member for Barton is appearing in Melbourne for Mr Healy in a challenge against the Communist Party Dissolution Act. Nothing that is sub judice is involved in that statement. There is no attack upon the court, and there is no attempt to influence the court. It is merely a bald, simple statement of fact. What is the inference to be drawn from that fact? I do not suggest that there is an inference against the right honourable member personally because I say, as I have said before, that he is perfectly entitled to appear in that capacity. But to what degree are the people of Australia entitled to assume that the Labour party is involved? It must be remembered that the Labour party, for which the right honourable member acts as Deputy Leader in this House, first bitterly opposed this legislation then turned round, ran away from it, and, later with complete insincerity, accepted it.",80
273,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! The Minister is out of order in referring to the legislation.,81
274,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I return to the theme. Now the Labour party is seeking to destroy it.,81
275,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! The Minister will withdraw that statement.,81
276,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"What is your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker?",81
277,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The Minister must withdraw the reference that he made to the legislation after I had asked him to desist from mentioning it. Will he withdraw that reference ?,81
278,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"In deference to your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw it.  Speaker, that the practice, when an honourable member is asked to withdraw a statement, is to make an unqualified withdrawal. A member is not entitled to say to the occupant of the chair, "" In deference to your ruling"".",81
279,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The Minister may proceed. He has withdrawn the statement.,81
280,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The point that I seek to make- a simple one that has not been answered by the Opposition because it cannot be answered-is that the irresistible inference to be drawn from this set of circumstances is that the Labour party and the right honourable member for Barton are acting as part of a plan to do something outside the Parliament that circumstances made it impossible for them to do inside the Parliament.,81
281,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"I wish to make a personal explanation, Mr Deputy Speaker.",81
282,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Does the honourable member consider that he has been misrepresented?,81
283,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Yes .,81
284,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The honoraible member may proceed.,81
285,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"The Postmaster-General (Mr Anthony), in addressing himself to and*' the matter now before the House, quoted what he said purported to be a report of a statement that I had made during the adjournment debate last Thursday night. In doing so he interpolated into the report certain worlds of his own. Those words were "" Communist-controlled unions "". At no time during my speech last Thursday night were those words mentioned. I agree that the remainder of the report that the honourable gentleman quoted appeared to me, at first hearing, to be an accurate record of what I said. However, I emphasize that I did not at any time mention the words "" Communist controlled unions "". What I said, and I repeat it in a few words, was that if the trade union movement, when defending the rights of the trade unions to organize, to agitate and to work for better conditions for their members, were challenged, I should support the unions, regardless of whether the Government considered their action to be illegal or otherwise. That was exactly what I said. I shall not go any further or argue any legal points with the Postmaster-General because he has the advantage of me that I have never had any police court convictions.",81
286,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I claim that I.have been misrepresented and ask for permission to make a personal explanation.,81
287,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,The honourable gentleman may make his explanation.,81
288,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"This is what I said when I quoted the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward). . . regardless of whether this Government considers their action to he illegal or otherwise, 1 propose to support the unions with all the power I possess, both inside and outside the Parliament. The honourable member did not qualify his remarks in any way on that occasion. He has denied on every occasion until now that he used those words.",81
289,Mr WARD,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,I have not.,81
290,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Now he admits that he did use them. As for a conviction in a court, I rpmind the House that, despite the verdict of two juries, it took a royal commission and Â£20,000 to exonerate the honourable member for East Sydney.",81
291,Mr CALWELL,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Melbourne) [11.46]. - I think that the Parliament will be very much ashamed in future of the proceedings in. this House to-night. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt) has chosen to attack the right hcnorable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) because he accepted a brief from a union and an individual to appear in a curtain case before the High Court in Melbourne. The Minister pointed out that he did not attack the right honourable gentleman professionally. The Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) later said that he did not 'attack him personally. And so, as the right honourable gentleman has been exonerated both professionally ancl personally, the attack is now directed at the Lahour party, which is alleged to have approved of the decision of the right honourable member to appear in a certain case. The Minister for Supply has been guilty of such rudeness and vulgarity a.= to say that he does not believe the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) that iLa Labour party has never discussed the matter. That assurance, of course, is true. The Minister for Supply has said that the right honourable member for Barton ought to be in this Parliament, attending to his parliamentary duties instead of appearing in the courts of the country. Such a statement comes oddly strange from the Minister for Supply because, during the life of the last Parliament, that honourable gentleman was rarely present in this House; he was usually outside it, earning all that he could in the courts of this country. The present Minister for External Affairs (Mr Spender) also came to the Parliament only, on an average, once a week. He was appearing in the courts at other times and he. won for himself the soubriquet of "" Once-a-week Percy "". I am no lover of lawyers. I have never had any mason to love them. I am not concerned very much about their ethical standards and all the rest of the argument, but, if it be right for certain people to appear in the courts because of their brand of politics, it cannot be wrong for somebody else with a different brand of politics to do likewise. The Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) himself has been revealed in some strange associations .during his long and very distinguished legal career. There was a time when he was Attorney General in the State of Victoria and the Government of which he was a member established a royal comniission to inquire into the operations of the Shell Oil Company. The Attorney-General of the State of Victoria accepted a brief from the Shell Oil (ompany to appear for it before that royal commission. There was also a time when the right honourable gentleman who is now Prime Minister appeared in rhe James case in London. He could not accept a fee as Attorney-General for the Co in mon wealth of Australia when litwas appearing for the Commonwealth in support of the High Court's decision on section 02 of the Constitution, but he did t.he next best thing and accepted a brief from the State of Victoria for which he was paid Â£2,000 to argue the same case, before the same tribunal. The Minister forgets tliose incidents in our history. He says that the right honourable mein ber for Barton (Dr Evatt) because of the circumstances which Mirround this case in which he appearing, should not have identified himself with the proceedings. On-person for whom he is appearing is a Communist named James Healy. The Prime Minister of this country has givi -:i opinions at Mr Healy's request and h:is received payment from Mr Healy for such opinions. The Minister who leads the attack to-night has, in recent months, received. Communists in his office. He has interviewed them and he has got on so well with them that Mr Idriss Williams, the leader of the Communist-controlled miners' federation, ancl Mr Wright, who is another Communist and is secretary of the Sheet Metal Workers Union in Sydney, reported to the Sydney Trades and Labour Council that they got on very well with the Minister and as a matter of fact received better treatment from this Government than they received from the Chifley Government. They said that this Minister who leads the attack on Communists has a better understandinc of the needs of the miners than had the Chifley Government and that he has promised to fix np their long servico leav-'* demands in a manner that the Chifley Government would not consider. The right honourable member for Barton, like the Prime Minister of this country, ha? had a long and distinguished legal career. He may have lost cases before the High Court, but he has also won cases before the High Court, and what is worrying the Government today is that in that famous case of ""Walsh and Johnson in J 926 he succeeded in defeating the opinion of the then Attorney-General, who is now the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, and persuaded the High Court to declare the legislation invalid. It is because the validity of this legislation may be upset by reason of the. acumen and the brilliance of the right honourable member for Barton, that this attack is being made upon him. There may be a case against a lawyer who is in politics appearing in litigation of this nature, but there is no justification, said wasabove all for Ministers in a parliament, to try to prejudice the result of that litigation by attacking the character or the standing of one person. In view of all that has been said, I think it might bc u good thing to declare that all lawyers should be out of the Parliament. The Minister for Supply laughs. If such a rule were applied it would not affect him ordinarily, because, if my memory serves me aright, during the war period the Chifley Qovernment, at the instance of the right honourable member for Barton, who was then Attorney-General, kept him out of the Bankruptcy Court with the briefs it gave to him on behalf of the Commonwealth. It is all very well for honourable members opposite, and Ministers in particular, to be leading this campaign against the right honourable member. I point out that last week he appeared for the clothing trades unions before the Commonwealth A rbitration Court, and there was no objection taken, although it would have been equally valid to have objected then as it is now. Are we to take it from the Government's attitude on this case that it. objects to Labour lawyers appearing for trade unions in a court of any jurisdiction? Perhaps it did not want the right lionorable gentleman to appear in the clothing trades case either. It is significant that this attack is made on him. In the clothing trades case he led the Bar aud was associated with Mr Barwick, KC , of Sydney, in the fight for the unions. In the case to which reference has been made, Mr Barwick is leading the case for the Government against the right honourable member for Barton. There is no objection to Liberal lawyers having views and expressing them, but there is an attempt, not only to smear and smudge, but also to belittle the efforts of Labour lawyers and of a lot of other people. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) did not say the things that were alleged against him in the vapourings of the Postmaster General (Mr Anthony). The Postmaster-General did not quote from Hansard; he has a "" cooked "" report of his own. He refused to say that it was identical with the Hansard report. What the honourable member for East Sydney If trado unions are to uo declared under this bill",82
292,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,83
293,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"Higgins-Minister for Labour and ""National Service and Minister for Immigration) [11.56] - in reply - The Opposition opened its reply on this matter by a series of personal charges against those members of the Government who have had the temerity, in its eyes, to raise this subject in the Parliament. Honourable members of the Opposition talk about shameful and disgracef ul conduct, but humbug is humbug, whether it is expressed in the home-spun terms of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) or in the ranting terms which characterized some of the other speeches. It is humbug because I can recall other occasions in the life of this Parliament when the present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) was made the object of the most bitter and personal attacks by honourable members who are criticizing members of the Government here to-night because he had appeared in court ou issues on which they thought he should not have appeared at that time. But now it becomes shameful and disgraceful on our part to make any reference to such matters. Coming to more recent times, I can remember that the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt) challenged the propriety of two judges of the High Court sitting on the Banking case. There was no regard paid to the shameful or disgraceful character of that conduct. I should like to clear up one or two matters which have been left in the air as the result of the discussion that has taken place. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) said we have chosen to make this attack, as he calls it, on the right honourable gentleman in his absence. It is not of our choosing that he is absent, and if the Government could usefully have deferred discussion on a matter which is of such lively public importance it would have done so. I at least can claim that I did next best thing. I do not act in this House without some sense of responsibility, nor have I made it a practice in this House to make personal attacks on members of it. Before I raised this matter at all I went to the Leader of the Opposition and told him that I was proposing to do so. I also indicated to him my reason for doing so. The honourable member for Lalor  something that is being done without the knowledge of the Prime Minister, and something of which the Prime Minister would be ashamed. as I had some sense of responsibility in the one direction, I also had sufficient sense of responsibility to notify the Prime Minister, who is attending an official engagement, of what I intended to do and my reasons for it. The Prime Minister, while stressing that the Government does not challenge the right of any member of the legal profession to appear in the courts of the country, entirelv endorsed the political aspect of this matter to which I drew the attention of the House when I embarked on what I had to say earlier to-night. So, on those counts, we on this side of the House have acted with a sense of responsibility, and we have not endeavoured to "" put over"" the Labour party something that it has not had a reasonable opportunity to analyse. We set out by asking a number of questions which we Mr Holt. considered that the Parliament and the country were entitled to have answered, and this discussion at least has had the useful purpose of bringing out into the open the fact that the right honourable member for Barton, who is the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in this House, in involving himself in an issue of this character, did not seek the approval of his party, acted without its knowledge and did not have its support in doing so. That point at least has been answered. ' I now wish to direct attention to the second aspect. The right honourable member for Barton is not a novice in political matters. He is not so unintelligent that he does not realise that when he goes into this particular case, not merely as a barrister but being at the same time the the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in this House, he must inevitably implant in the mind of the public the belief that he is acting in a way of which his party would approve. Knowing that, the right honourable gentleman, either reckless of the consequences, or hoping that the public will believe that, although the Opposition in the action, is hoping that the public will believe that although the Opposition was not able to carry the day in this Parliament against the decision of the executive of the Australian Labour party, it will be able to carry the day by a challenge in the courts. The Opposition canJust not have it both ways. Either it has endorsed that action or approved it, or its Deputy Leader has gone into this action, recklessly involving his party in the consequences of what he is doing. He is no novice, and honourable members opposite are men with some political knowledge of these matters. I shall conclude by referring to the action of my own leader, the present Prime Minister, in a somewhat comparable case. The Chifley Government's banking legislation was under challenge. As members of the Opposition at that time, we had attacked it most vigorously in the Parliament and the act finally came before the courts. Becanse our leader is also a man who is not without some forensic skill and reputation in this country, he was one of the first persons approached with a view to ascertaining whether he would go into court and argue the case against the Government's legislation. The right honourable gentleman not only refused to take that course, but also diseussed the proposal full y with his colleagues in his own party. I find it almost incredible that, in a matter of this kind, the Deputy Leader of the Labour party should involve it in the political repercussions which must inevitably flow from his action without having had the common decency to notify his colleagues of his proposal, and to seek their endorsement of it . Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPERS. The following papers were presented :Commonwealth Public Service Act-Appoint ments-Departmen t of Works and Housing - N . I . Davey, D. W. Hancock.

IMMIOBATIO N.",85
295,Mr HOLT,HEALTHAND MEDICAL,"On the l l t h October, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Eggins) addressed to me a number of questions, seme of which I answered for t h with; two of them, however, I requested the honourable member to place upon the notice-paper. These questions were1. Will the Minister inform the House of the tota) number of migrants who came to this country up to the end of September, 1950, furnishing details of the numbers of British nnd non-British migrants? 2. Is the honourable gentleman able ' to provide precise information concerning the number of migrants that is expected in 1951 and the countries from which tliose migrants will be drawn ? I now wish lo furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. The number nf permanent new arrivals from October, 1945, to the end of June, 1950, was 380,580, made up as follows i-r-British, 189,718; non-British, 190,842. Another 30,000 persons arrived in Australia during the quarter ended September, 1950, but details of their nationalities are not yet available from the Commonwealth Statistician. A point worth noting is that Australia is obtaining a greater proportion of British .migrants tlian any other country. For example, in the first seven months of this year only 7,945 Britons emigrated to Canada, whereas 43,000 came to Australia. 2. It is not possible to furnish precise information concerning the number of migrants Australia expects to receive in 1951 or the countries from which they will he drawn, since this partly depends on the outcome of negotiations, which u-re now proceeding. It is, however, the Government's aim to increase the population of Australia by at least 2,000,000 people Avithin the next ten years by large-scale immigration, and every effort is being mode to ensure that the numbers arriving during 1951 will bear a proper relation to this aim. As the International Refugee Organization wi\l pease operations in 1951., it has been necessary to investigate new sources pf migration in Europe to replace the displaced persons who have' in recent years comprised the bulk of our 18th October, non-British migrants, and it is now clear that the best prospeots of obtaining new settlers in the numbers and of - the types we require He in Holland, Western Germany, Austria and Italy. Immigration from Great Britain is foremost in the Government's policy, and top priority will, as in the past, be given in 1951 and subsequent years to the migration of British people. AÂ« I mentioned in this House only a day or two ago, we are now providing more shipping for them than ever before, nnd while, as the result of these efforts, we expect to receive a record number of British migrants this year, the figure should be even greater in 1951. A detailed statement of the number of migrants that we expect to receive in 1051, and the countries from which they will be drawn, will be furnished as soon as practicable. CIVIL AVIATION.",85
