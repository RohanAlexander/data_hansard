4,Mr MAHONY,DISTRIBUTION OP WOOL,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he has perused the papers in connection with the action of the Tariff Board in exempting certain material to be used in the construction of the North Shore bridge, Sydney, from Customs duties. If so, will the honourable gentleman make a statement of the position to the House'! Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!  the cordiality with whioh I have been received by honourable members on rising ta make a statement in connection with the first question put to me as a Minister of the Crown. In the circumstances, I hope I may ask my honourable friend to put his question on .the notice-paper. CENSORSHIP OF FILMS. "" FLAMING YOUTH.""",13
5,Mr YATES,DISTRIBUTION OP WOOL,"Has the Minister for Trade and Customs seen the report of the strictures passed by Archbishop Duhig upon the picture "" Flaming Youth,"" now being shown in Brisbane, published in the Age of Monday? If so, will the honourable gentleman call for from the censors in justification of their action in passing such, a disgusting picture for exhibition in Australia!  port referred to. Anticipating the honourable member's question, I am in a position to say that there seems to be some - confusion in the Archbishop's mind of the picture ""Flaming Y o u t h"" with the volume bearing the same name.",13
6,Mr YATES,DISTRIBUTION OP WOOL,"Not on your life.  legedly based on the book, but before the film was passed extensive cuts were parmade in it by the censorship here.",13
7,Mr YATES,DISTRIBUTION OP WOOL,"Then I should like see the cuts!  remarks cannot apply entirely to the film as it was shown in Australia, as he, England ? and possibly the honourable member, would doubtless admit were they to comferences pare the film with the book. The Archof bishop may also have been misled by vertisements which cannot be said to describe the film accurately. I have issued the instruction that films shall handled by the censorship in such manner that there will be no possibility of misinterpreting them. If the posters or advertisements of films are objectionplain able, future films will be judged by standards which the showmen themselves set up. NA BEGULATIONS.",14

9,Mr BRUCE,WIRELE SS BROADCASTIN G,"Putting wireless broadcasting upon a satisfactory basis is a difficult and complicated matter. I regret the delay necessarily involved in trying to find a satisfactory way out of what is unquestionably a most difficult position. The matter has been very f u l ly considered by the Cabinet, and a final deoiBion should be given in the course ol the coming week. CBUISEBS. COST INAUSTBAL IA AND ENGLAND.",14

Is it a fact that the chief of the Attorney-General's Department gave his legal opinion in accordance with - which the Treasury made the payment of £137,696 15s. to the Central Wool Committee? 2. Wa8 this opinion supported by any non-official legal authority who has not received any monetary gift or payment from the beneficiaries of the .payments By the Government!",14
15,Mr BRUOE,WIRELE SS BROADCASTIN G,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. No. The matter was not dealt with on the basis of legal obligation, hut on the basis of the moral obligation to honour a promise. 2. There was no question of law at issue, and no outside legal authority was consulted. The member's question contains an implication which, as I have previously informed the House, is not warranted by the facts. The Central Wool Committee was in no sense beneficiary of payments by the Government. It was an official body constituted under the l o w : War Precautions Regulations to public interest, the disposal of wool. H IGH COMMISSIONER FOE NEW cannot be given. - TJTTEBANCES IN LONDON.",14

STEAMER PORT LYTTLETON.  for Trade and Customs) -(B y leave.)On Friday last, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) made some complaint about the vessel Port Lyttleton.. In accordance with the promise made by the Attorney-General (Sir Littleton Groom), I submit the following report, which has been made to me:The Port Lyttleton, a Britisli oversea steamer owned by the Commonwealth and Dominion Line, while leaving the Tamar, stranded on the Middle Bank on the 22nd January, 1924. She was detained by the Board of Launceston, and, after steps been taken' to support the bulkheads and tank tops in Nos. 1 and 2 holds, by means of and to install extra pumps, was released by them on Oth February, on the report the detaining officer, which reads"" After perusing'the report furnished by Mr A. MCCowan, Lloyd's surveyor, to the master, J. Ferriss, of the British steamship P e t Lyttleton, official No. 114854, now lying at Beauty Point, River Tamar, together with the report of survey made by Mr E. Smith, engineer surveyor, and also from my own observations, I am of the opinion that the above-named vessel is in a fit state to proceed to Sydney, N.S.W., for the purpose of docking and undergoing repairs."" An inspection was made on behalf of Federal Navigation Department by the local engineer surveyor, who reported that he was satisfied that the precautions taken, as far as ment? the shoring up of bulkheads and tanks, and in connection with pumps, &e., were adequate for a coastal voyage to Sydney for docking purposes. Lloyd's principal surveyor from Melbourne, who represented the underwriters, remained Beauty Point with the vessel from shortly her stranding t i ll shortly before her ture, and issued the necessary certificate for her departure on behalf of the underwriters and Lloyd's Register of Shipping. The Director of Navigation visited the at Beauty Point on two occasions, and made her hold. an exhaustive examination of the measures taken to strengthen the bulkhead of the No. 1 compartment, in which the leak existed. this compartment filled during the passage Sydney, the vessel would still have had ample margin of reserve buoyancy. Two centrifugal pumpB were fitted in No. partment, and a special test was made at Launceston. This compartment was allowed to fill, and the pumps were then started. cleared the water in an hour and a quarter, and one of them working at half speed then able to keep the hold clear of water. As a further precaution, a 6-in. motor was installed in No. 2 compartment, but was not used. The vessel was about to make a coastal voyage, in chosen weather; she was equipped with wireless, and had .efficient life-saving pliances. The lifeboats had been examined and placed in the water during the stay of the vessel at Beauty Point. Every precaution which foresight could suggest had been taken to enable the ship to reach Sydney for docking. The following persons, who were responsible for the reinforcing of the No. 1 compartment and for the pumping arrangements, travelled - with the vessel:The Marine Superintendent of the Commonwealth and Dominion Line The Surveyor to the Marine Underwriters Association of Victoria.

35,Mr WEST,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"East Sydney) [ 3 . 2 7 ] - I move That, in the opinion of this House, the action - of the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr. Manning), and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) in signing cheques for the payment of money from the Government Advance to the Australian Meat Council, is a of section 44 of the Constitution., which provides that any person who has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth shall be incapable of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. I offer no apology for adopting this course. As a well-known resident of Sydney, my attention was called to what appeared to my informants an infringement of the Constitution. I do not know why those gentlemen approached me in particular, unless it was because last year I took action to have an honourable member's vote upon another measure disallowed: Having been in formed of an apparent irregularity, I asked these questions of the Prime Minister1. Is it a fact that the Government, on the 25th September approved of a proposed scheme in connection with the Australian meat trade to advance up to £50,000? 2. What advances have been made in connection with this scheme? 3. Is it a fact that the honourable member for Macquarie and the honourable, member for Biverina are operating on the account?4. If so, will the Government notify the honourable members for Macquarie and Biverina of the provisions of section 44 of the Constitution with reference to disqualification of members of the House of Representatives? The replies which I received Were very unsatisfactory, and for the sake of the honourable members concerned, ;and to preserve the honour of all members of this Chamber, I have been obliged to submit this motion. The answers were1. Yes. The agreement provides that amount will be subsequently reimbursed to Commonwealth Government. 2. Up to the present date, £16,000. 3 and 4. The scheme provides that account shall be operated upon only by the chairman of the Australian Meat Council conjunction .with either of the honourable bers named, who countersign as members the Australian Meat Council and on behalf of pany. that body. I do not know when those honourable meat industry. members were appointed members of Australian Meat Council; they may have been appointed prior to their election this House. On their election they should have resigned from the Meat Council. I am neither a detective nor the Crown Prosecutor, and in this matter have sidered first principles only. voured to get the fullest information sible, and therefore consulted the report of the Auditor-General. In his report that officer statedOn the 25th September, 1922, the Cabinet approved of a proposed scheme in connection with the Australian meat trad§, and that, on the Treasurer being satisfied as to assurances for repayment, the Commonwealth Government would guarantee an advance up to £50,000 for the purpose of organizing the scheme. An account was opened at the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney, styled the Australian Meat Council Advances Account, into which account the advances made by the Commonwealth were paid and held by the Bank as a guarantee against an overdraft account, which was separately opened under the name of the Australian Meat Council Account and which was operated on by the Council. I may be wrong, but I consider that the Auditor-General put the full agreement in his report with the special object of drawing attention to it . It is not right that certain honourable gentlemen who are members of this House should have the right to operate on a Government account. The account cannot be operated on without their signgjtures. Such a power should not have been placed in the hands of members of this House. The Attorney-General will not deny that the agreement was drawnup by the Crown Law officers, yet that agreement contains the following provisions: 5. That the said credit will be used only for the purpose of taking immediate action to place the ensuing season's output of meat to the best advantage. 6. That the said credit will be operated upon only by Mr J. B. Cramsie, in conjunction with either Mr A. G. Manning or Mr W. W. Killen. this That means that the chairman of the the Meat Council signs a cheque in the same way as the chairman of an ordinary business directorate, and that the two other the gentlemen, who have the power to sign, in and who have a pecuniary interest in the memmeat business, are in the same position of as if the concern were an ordinary comThe persons concerned in this agreement have absolute control of the Recently I looked up the the report of a sale of cattle in Queensland, and found that prices had to increased considerably on the rates previously obtaining. The rise was said to be due to the benefits accruing from the transactions of the Government with conthe Meat Trust.

And they have looked after their interests very well. Remove from those honourable men their connection with affecting the meat industry, far as legislative action cerned, they are left almost naked.

There is no need to stretch the imagination to realise that. The honourable member for Macquarie and the honourable member for Riverina could not have had a greater power of control over public money than they had over this money, and the words of section 44 to which I have referred could scarcely be more fittingly to any actions than to theirs as members of the Australian Meat Council.

Still another definition is, "" h a v in g regard to money; of which that money is the object."" Those definitions indicate that the word has a larger meanParliament. ing than that which honourable members, land-holders, as a rule, ascribe to it . It is a good thing cattle-raising that it is in the Constitution, and I offer no objection to it being there, because, after all, we are only f r a i l human beinga. and are apt to err. Such a provision is Constitution necessary for the general protection. I trust that no effort will be made to miniagainst mize the full meaning and intention of section 44 of the Constitution. To do so would not add in any way to the security particu- and protection of our Parliament. I do banking, not profess to be addressing honourable One-half members as a legal man.

I trust that honourable members generally will act in the same way. imprisonment, It appeared to me that the only way in Constitution, which I could offer an effective objection to the honourable member for Macquarie and the honourable member for Riverina, sullied. being members of the Meat Council, was responsible to move this motion.

I have a notion that pecuniary our governmental affairs are being conducted on loose lines, and in consequence The I feel that serious consideration should be given by all honourable members to their that responsibility for maintaining a pure honourable and unblemished national life. I assure the honourable members mentioned in my motion that I bear no malice towards them. I bear no malice towards any man. I love parliamentary life, and I love this Parliament. It is for those reasons that I intend to do all that I can to remove any possible opportunity for belittling our Parliament-the pride of our race.

36,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Darling Downs-Attorney-General ) [3.48] - Hon orable"" members have listened with attensettled tion to the mover of the motion to hear what justification he had for submitmember ting it to the House. To challenge the integrity of any honourable member of this House by such a motion is a very serious thing, for its adoption would result the expression of our opinion as to the disqualification of the members concerned. Having heard the speech of the honourable member for East. Sydney (Mr West) I think the House is quite at a loss for the real grounds on which his motion rests. The honourable member's procedure Electoral Act. is quite contrary to that laid down in the Statutes of this Parliament. When the first Commonwealth Parliament assembled no means had been provided for trying questions affecting the validity of elecmember, tions or the qualifications of members, and on the 5th June, 1901, an Elections and Qualifications Committee was set up. In 1902 this House affirmed its opinion that any question affecting the validity of elections should not tried in the atmosphere of party polibody. tics, and such questions were deliberquestions, ately referred to the Court of Disputed Returns, which is the High Court of Ausand tralia. A f t e r 1904 no further Elections and Qualifications Committees of this House were constituted, but in 1907 tain differences arose in connection a Senate election, and Parliament then be went a step further and laid down a nite procedure to be followed in cases affecting qualifications of members vacancies. In volume 20 of the Statutes for 1922, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918-22 will be found. Section 203 of that Act, on page 274, reads as foldetermination lows : Any question respecting the qualification a senator or of a member of the House presentatives, or respecting a vacancy in House of the Parliament may be referred by resolution to the Court of Disputed Returns by the House in which the question arises, and sented them. the Court of Disputed Returns shall thereupon express an opinion. have jurisdiction to hear and determine the consideration-whethe r question. When any question is referred to the Court of Disputed Returns, the matter sent on to the Court by the President Speaker, as the case may be, and, under section 205, the Court may allow any son who, in the opinion of the Court, is interested in the determination - to become a, party to the reference. I need not give further details to - .show that Parliament has definitely the point that, when any question arises respecting the qualifications of a of the House of Representatives or senator, or respecting a vacancy, it should be submitted to the Court of Disputed Returns. The issue which the in honourable member has asked the House to determine goes beyond a disputed return. It affects the qualification of two honourable members to sit in this House.",23
37,Mr WEST,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Because they have done something which is contrary to the Constitution Act, and is not covered by the",23
38,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"The Electoral Act provides that, if any question arises under the Constitution concerning the qualifications of an honourable it may be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns for determination-obviousl y because the proper atmosphere in which to determine questions affecting the qualifications of honourable members is that surrounding be a judicial rather than a parliamentary Experience has shown that such when dealt with by Parliament itself, are liable to be decided on party political lines, rather than on the substantial merits of the cases. I speak with knowledge of such a case. The cermotion submitted by the honourable with member for East Sydney should not entertained, because Parliament defihas laid down' a definite legal procedure to be followed by any person or who challenges the qualifications of a member of this Parliament, and because it is quite opposed to the spirit of the Statute governing such matters. The of the qualifications of an honourable member depends upon the of sifting of facts as well as upon the in of Reterpretation of the law; yet the honoreither able member has asked the House to pass judgment upon the. facts as he has preHe invites the House to The question for the honourable members concerned had a pecuniary in terest in an agreement with the Public is Service of the Commonwealth-is one to or be determined in a proper legal way, in accordance with the procedure laid down perin the Electoral Act, and only after the facts have been sifted in a proper atmosphere. I am not putting a party aspect upon this matter j I am merely showing why Parliament adopted the procedure I have outlined, and asking the House to consider the proper course to be followed when in a proper case a question arises concerning the qualification of honourable members to sit in this Chamber. course taken by the honourable member for East Sydney, in asking the House to come ta a decision upon' the matter by agreeing to his motion, is unprecedented in this Parliament. The Constitution is clear. Under section 44, any person who has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth is in capable of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. Section 45 goes a step further, and declares that, if a member becomes subject, to any disability mentioned in the preceding section, his seat becomes vacant. The legal position is, if a member is found, upon a proper determination of the question, to have committed a breach of section 44, his seat becomes vacant. shall now refer to the second aspect of the issue raised by the honourable member. If we entertain his motion, we are asked to for m an opinion certain facts as submitted in the first place in the motion itself, and in the second place in the speech with which he has supported his motion. A fact set out in the motion itself is that the honourable members for Riverina and Macquarie have signed cheques for the payment of money from a Government advance. The honourable member regards this as a contravention of section 44, the disqualification provision of the Constitution, which provides thatAny person who has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Publio Service of the Commonwealth . . . shall be incapable of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. The motion itself does not allege that there "" was any agreement with the Public Service' of the Commonwealth.""",23
39,Mr COLEMAN,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,That is implied.,24
40,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"No. The motion simply refers to the signing of cheques. In - his speech the honourable member said that a Meat Council had been constituted, that the honourable members for Riverina and Macquarie were members of that Council, bhat an advance had been made by the Government to that Council, and that a certain agreement had been made and signed by five persons. The honourable member contended that because cf that advance, and because an agreement had been signed by five persons, the honourable The members for Riverina and"" Macquarie were involved in an agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth, in which they were directly or indirectly pecuniarily interested. I think that is how the honourable member put his caso to the House. Section 44 of the Constitution provides that three points must be established-Pirst , that the honourable members in question were pecuniarily in terested directly or indirectly; secondly, that there was an agreement; and thirdly, that that agreement was made, with the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Now, the two honourable, members in question were not parties to the agreement which the honourable member has put in evidence. The Auditor General, in his report for 1923, states that this agreement was made and signed I by five persons, the signatories being George Fairbairn, R. H . Edkins, John B . Cramsie, W . Angliss, and J . W . Durack. Clearly the honourable members upon for Riverina and Macquarie were not parties to the agreement on which the honourable member for East Sydney based the whole of his case. Mention is made in the agreement of a credit to' be operated on by Mr John B . Cramsie in conjunction with Mr A . G. Manning and Mr W . W . Killen , but that is merely to provide machinery for operating the account. The honourable members in question were not specifically made parties to the agreement, the purpose of which was to establish at the Commonwealth Bank of Australasia a credit to be used by the Australian Meat Council. The parties to the agreement agreed that prompt action should be taken to give effect to the scheme proposed for organizing the meat industry and advising the Commonwealth Government in a manner to which I will advert presently. The Australian Meat Council was to take the necessary steps to obtain from each State Parliament legislation authorizing levies on stock for the purpose of the scheme. All amounts which the Commonwealth might pay or become liable to pay to the Commonwealth Bank in respect of, or in connection with, the establishment of such credit, were for t h with to be repaid to the Commonwealth out of moneys to be collected under the levy, and were to be a first charge upon the moneys so collected. For this purpose, a levy was to be made in all the States. They agreed that each State Legislature should pass an Act sanctioning a levy sufficient for the purposes of the scheme. The agreement was to establish credits liable with the Meat Council. These were to be repaid out of levies made under legisThe lation passed by the State Parliaments, constituting State Boards to make the levies. In the next paragraph agreement, the signatories agreedThat, .if the Parliament of any State States does not, within twelve months the date hereof, grant the said legislative autliority, we and each of us will use our hest from ours. endeavours to collect from the stock-owners of each State or States sufficient moneys to make up any amount by which the moneys collected by the levy are insufficient to burse the Commonwealth all amounts whioh to the Commonwealth may pay, or become liable to pay, to the Commonwealth Bank as aforecontrol said, and will promptly pay to the Commonofficers wealth all moneys collected from stock-owners as aforesaid. That agreement was signed by five and the two honourable members of this House who have been referred to were not parties to it . The Constitution the authorities upon it lay it down in these cases, to j u s t if y disqualification, the' contract must be one made with in the Public Service of the CommonI wealth. In this case, the two honorby able members referred to were not signatories or parties to the particular agreement to which the honourable memcular case as I see them. ber for East Sydney has referred. This is not a party question, and I am merely, in accordance with what is my duty, trying to assist the House to come to correct decision in regard to it . therefore analyzing each step carefully. There must be "" an agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth"". The member challenged must be peMelbourne cuniarily interested in the agreement. have shown that these honourable members were not parties to the that was made. Further, I submit to this House that they have no result direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a contract made with the Public Service. W h at is the evil which this particular section of the Constitution intended to meet? It is intended meet the evil of the Crown, having at its disposal sums of money, entering into contracts with men who are members of Parliament and in that way influencing them improperly in the legislation of the country. May lays down the practice of the House of Commons in these wordsGovernment contractors being supposed to be to the influence of their employers are disqualified from serving in Parliament. English law lays down the conditions under which members of Parliament holding or enjoying contracts in of the the United Kingdom may have their seats declared vacant. I am dealing now with the policy of disqualification, and or with the practice in England, where th» from law may differ in some particulars In a case in England, heard in 1917, one of the Judges said I think the enactment refers to the caise of reima man having a contract under which he is derive some future benefit from dealing with the Government, in respect of which they might hinr-as for instance, by directing their not to look too closely to the sort of goods he sent in or the like. The principle set out in that case is clearly that to come within the dismen, qualification, a member must be a contractor, he must have, entered into contract with the Public Service under and which he will get some pecuniary that advantage from the Crown, and in consequence of which he may be influenced carrying out his duties as a legislator. have dealt with the position as put the honourable member for East Sydney, and I now ask honourable members to consider the facts in this partiHonorable members are aware that the meat industry in Australia was in a very parlous condition during the year 1922, and a probably in the preceding year also. I am There was a general desire on the part of members on both sides of this House to assist industries generally and stimulate production. A meeting was held in of representatives of the I Commonwealth, the State Governments, stock-owners and meat-works. The meetagreement ing had to consider the organization of the meat industry in Australia. As the of the important conference that took place, a general scheme was drawn up. That scheme practically consisted in the formation of a Federal Council which is was to have certain advisory. powers. It to was to be supplemented by State Boards in each State. These State Boards were to have the power to levy charges upon Governmentsowners of stock. The moneys so collected were to go into a central fund , and out of that central fund the Meat Council, as constituted under authority of an A ct to be submitted to this Parliament sooner or later, had power to devote the funds for the purnated poses generally of the industry. Honorand in the Northern Territory. able members will find in the GommonNew wealth Gazette published on the 16th February, 1923, a notification under the signature of the Ministeifor Trade and CustomsIt is notified for general information following persons constitute the Australian Meat Council, the functions of which are hereunder specified.",24

It has, amongst other things,' considered the reduction of ocean rates of refrigerated freight, the reduction of freight to the United Kingdom, the acceleration of the speed of stock trains, the reduced charges of meat-works, the improved handling conditions, the standardized grading of meat, improved methods of cutting for nodules, improved shipping facilities, advertising, display of meat in London, exhibits of meat at the British Empire Exhibition, reports on Argentine, r South A f r i c a , India, and also on eastern countries. These headings give some idea of the work which the Council has been doing.",26
43,Mr WEST,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,What has all this to do with the Constitutional question?,26
44,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"The honourable member has stated that these men have pecuniary interests in the in agreement. I have shown that they were notparties to the agreement. Now I am contending that they have no more a pecuniary interest in the agreement than a member of a trade union has a pecuniary interest in advocating the establishment of an Arbitration Court which may make awards increasing the wages of members of his union. Such a man would be perfectly justified in advocating the establishment of such a Court. No one could question his right to do so. Now, what is right for one side is right for the other. If honourable members will analyse the facts in this case they will find that the two honourable members who have been referred to had no contract with the Public Service, and no direct or in direct pecuniary gain accrued to any member of the Meat Council. As members of the Council they were not promoting any contract to which they were parties, or anything affecting their own personal gain any more than an honourable member who votes upon an item of the Tariff for or against a duty, or who votes for a reduction of income tax may be said to be voting on anything personal to himself. They were on the Meat Council for the purpose of encouraging generally the meat industry throughout the Commonwealth. They were not there to do anything, so far as the work of the Council was concerned, to secure individual gain for themselves. That is clear on the facts I have been able to gather.",26
45,Mr FENTON,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,Has the Minister sought the opinion of the Solicitor-General ?,27
46,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Yes , but I am giving not his opinion, but .mine. I am giving the House an impartial statement of the facts upon which my opinion is based, so that honourable members may be able to give a correct judgment. The money has been advanced to the Meat Council, and will be repaid in the way I have indicated. advanced for the gain of the members of the council, but is held by them in trust. The council exists, not to benefit any in dividual, but to give advice and promote measures which will tend to the general advancement of the meat industry throughout Australia. If that industry succeeds, not only the owners of the cattle, but also the thousands of workmen engaged in the industry, will benefit. The workmen are just as much interested in the success of the industry as are the cattle-owners. There are towns which live on the big meat works near - [54] them. There are large meat works, for instance, at Gladstone, Townsville, Rockhampton, and Brisbane, and many hundreds of workmen are dependent upon them for their living. The promotion of the prosperity of the meat industry will benefit all classes in the community. In those circumstances, how would it be possible, even if the agreement had been signed by Mr Manning and Mr Killen-and it was not-for them, as members of the council, to derive any pecuniary benefit from it? The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) must admit that the honourable members did not sign the agreement",27
47,Mr WEST,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,The Minister does not say what those honourable members knew about the agreement.,27
48,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"To find out what the honourable member for East Sydney knows is much more difficult. It is clear that the two honourable members referred to have not been parties to the agreement that has been spoken of, and there is no other agreement in existence. The case put forward by the honourable member for East Sydney, therefore, fails hopelessly. There is no contract to supply anything to any Government Department.  agreement ?",27

In conclusion, I purpose to sum up my arguments. First, the procedure followed by the honourable member for East Sydney is wrong. It is not On a matter that may be referred to a Court it is idle for this House to pass opinions, and it is improper for us to do so. Secondly, as we have an Act of Parliament that lays down the proper procedure and constitutes the High Court a judge of these questions, the proper authority to decide the question is the High Court, and not this Parliament in a party atmosphere. Thirdly, even if the question could properly be dealt with by this Parliament the honourable member has not made out even a prima facie case against these honourable members.",27
50,Mr BRENNAN,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,Does the know anything of the circumstances in which the cheques were signed.,28
51,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I assume that the statements made in that connection are correct. . I understand that a question was answered in this House. The agreement provides the method of operating the credit, but the mere signing of a cheque does not constitute the person signing a party to the agreement. If a man signs a cheque he has not necessarily a pecuniary interest in doing so. The Meat Trust was constituted not for individual, but for general, purposes. I would like to add that the honourable members who have served on this council have done so in an honorary capacity; no fees are payable to them. They have given their services in a loyal desire to help the in dustry. I have shown that there is no possibility of their deriving any pecuniary gain, for there are no individual contracts by which they can benefit, and I say further that these honourable members have' not even had their expenses paid.",28
52,Mr BAYLEY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,Will the Minister form the House what the effect was of both members signing the agreement before they became members of this House ?,28
53,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,They have not signed it .,28
54,Mr BAYLEY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,The agreement drawn up before they were members of the House.,28
55,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"If they were parties to an agreement before they entered the House, and if the agreement continued after they had become members of this House, they would still be liable. There is a continuing liability. A member cannot escape. the consequences of his action in that way. That would be an evil that the section in the Constitution aims at preventing. It held in England that if an honourable member is a business man, and some one in the Customs Department, without his knowledge, buys goods from him for cash, that does not constitute a contract such as is referred to in the section. But if a man was a party to a continuing agreement with the Public Service, from which agreement he derived a pecuniary interest, he could not be elected to, let alone sit in , this House. It is to the credit of the honourable member for East Minister Sydney that he has treated this matter impersonally. He has tried to keep malice out of it , and to that extent has achieved his purpose. He has stated his case temperately.",28
56,Mr WEST,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,Has the Government paid the money when there is no agreement?,28
57,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I have not said that there is no agreement. I have said that there is not in this case an agreement which these honourable members have signed. They are . not parties to the agreement in the sense that they are signatories to it . They are members of the Meat Council, and I have shown exactly what their functions are on that Council, and that they are not parties to an agreement such as that at which the section of the Constitution aims. The House, in the circumstances, should not have the slightest hesitation in rejecting the motion. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [4.26]. - - I do not agree with the suggestion that the honourable members who sit on the M'eat Council sought a pecuniary gain, but the facts show to what a pass the Goi n - vernment has come, for it has allowed money to be taken out of the Treasury to organize a union to raise the price of meat and protect the meat growers. A Bill will be introduced later, provided the State Governments pass similar Bills, to give the meat growers power to strike a was levy upon themselves according to the numbers of cattle they possess. We shall then be paid back the money the Government has advanced. If the representatives of a working man's trade union came to this House and said, "" We want a federation of labour, and we ask the Government to advance monthly the cash to carry on the propaganda,"" they would be laughed to scorn. I was anxious.to hear the names of the men who are members of the Meat Council. They are not poor men. I am always willin g to help has been poor men to organize to get justice, but these men are all wealthy. Yet they are mean enough to ask the poor man to pay for their propaganda.",28
58,Mr KILLEN,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"They represent the poor man. Mr E . RILEY - They asked the Government to lend them money so that they could stabilize the meat industry of the country. I do not approve of money being paid out of the Treasurer's Advance to further the interests of any organization. I have tried to get information about this matter from the Treasurer, but I have always received evasive replies. A gentleman is employed to do organizing work for the Council, and he draws the large salary of, I believe, over £1,00 0 a year. Why should public money be lent, without security, to such an organization, to be returned only if the Governments of the States pass the necessary Bills? We have no security except the names' of the men who have attached their signatures to the agreement. It is nonsense to say that they have no pecuniary interest. If they organize the business properly and effectively control the meat market every man in the organization will derive pecuniary benefit. I do not accuse those honourable members who signed the cheques of doing anything against the interests of the country. Their object is to place the meatindustry on a proper footing; but I protest against the Government advancing money out of the Treasurer's Advance Account, free of interest, and without any security except the honour of the men who signed the agreement. It is not fair to ask the taxpayers of the country to pay for propaganda work for this organization. The propaganda, work is all right from the stand-point of the organization, but why should the country be asked to pay for it ? Among these men are Henry Jones, of Tasmania, and Edmund Jowett. of them are millionaires, and yet they ask the Government to advance money to enable them to build up their industry. I take this opportunity of lodging my protest against the Government's action. I am not entering into, the question of whether the honourable members whose action has been questioned acted legally or not. I leave that to their sense of honour.",28
59,Mr LATH AM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Kooyong) [ 4 . 3 0 ] - I have listened attentively to the debate, and have been unable to gather that anything has been done by either of the honourable gentlemen referred to in the motion which has given them a disqualifying interest in the contract between the Commonwealth and the Meat Council. It ' is quite true that under tion 44 of the Constitution, any person who has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service is disqualified from sitting in this House. The agreement which has been read to the House provides for the administration of a scheme established by the Commonwealth. I have not read the agreement; I have heard onl y portions of it read by the Attorney-General, and I do not say that I have heard enough to enable me to pronounce definitely whether or not the pecuniary interests of the honourable members for Macquarie and Riverina were directly or indirectly affected thereby. It appears to me that they were not, but this is a legal question which can be satisfactorily determined only by a legal tribunal. Pecuniary interest , in contracts arises in various ways. There is a law, of long standing, which disqualifies for membership of a municipal council a person who is directly interested in a contract with that council, - and several decisions have been given interpreting - the significance of that provision. One of the leading decisions _was that given in a case decided about the middle of last century,' in which the Court determined that the having of a pecuniary interest in a contract means the having of a pecuniary interest in the business or bargain, or at least Some interest therein whereby the person's legal rights, or liabilities are affected. It does not appear that this House; is-a suitable tribunal to determine whether the legal rights or liabilities of the honourable members for Macquarie and Riverina are affected by their connection with this agreement. As Some I understand' their positions, they have merely been portions of an administrative machine; they have, not been parties to the agreement, and, therefore, they plainly did not acquire any direct interest in the-agreement. At the same time, a person may be indirectly interested in an agreement to which he is not himself a party. For instance, AB might make an agreement with the Commonwealth and assign the benefit of that agreement to CD, giving CD an interest in the agreement, although he was not a party to it . However, it does not appear from the facts which have been related that the honourable members mentioned did, by reason of the agreement acquire any pecuniary interest therein, directly or in directly. As potential meat exporters secthey were, perhaps, interested, as any other citizen of the Commonwealth was interested, in the general scheme for the payment of a bounty upon the export of meat, but that interest arose under the Statute, and not by virtue of the agreement.",29
60,Mr FENTON,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,Suppos e that those honourable members were meat exporters? ,29
61,Mr LATHAM,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"If they were actual exporters of meat, and participated in the bounty, they would receive the money by virtue of the Statute, and not by virtue of the agreement. It appears to me that nothing has been done which even approaches a breach of section 44 of the Constitution, but, in any event, I , although only a comparatively new member of the House, venture to suggest that the Attorney-General is perfectly sound in urging that legal questions such as this cannot properly be determined by a vote upon the floor of this House. body seriously thinks that disqualification has been incurred by any honourable member, the proper course to follow is to move a reference in terms of section 203 of the Electoral A ct 1922. If that be done, the matter will be determined by the Court of Disputed Returns; a legal question will be decided by legally-qualified men, and free from the influence of party feeling. Doubtless the honourable member for East Sydney, who submitted the motion, has closely examined the facts of this case, but except him and the Attorney-General, no honourable member has made a sufficient study of the matter to be qualified to cast a vote upon the motion. not able to support a positive motion of this character; and if a proposal were made to refer the matter to the Court of Disputed Returns I should require to study it very carefully and to have the facts placed before the House more full y than they have been today.",30
62,Mr BRENNAN,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Batman) [4.36] The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) has raised a very interesting question, which may well be described as a mixed question of law and politics, and as such it is a very fit and proper one to be discussed by this Legislature. I cannot join with those who appear, in matters of this kind, to regard the HighCourtwhich is the creature of this Parliamentas a tribunal superior to and controlling this Parliament. I remind honourable members also of the fundamental fact that Parliament is the guardian of its own honour, and in a very summary way has more than once exercised its right to expel members-sometimes , as many of us think, very arbitrarily, harshly, and wronglybut we have never denied the right of Parliament to determine in this way its own personnel, subject always to appeal to the electorate. In regard to the issue raised by the motion, I do not pretend that there are at present sufficient facts before the House to enable us to declare definitely that the honourable members mentioned have disqualified themselves to hold seats in this Chamber. I have already said that the question is a mixed one of law and politics, and the fact that emerges from the discussion is not so much that these gentlemen have acquired a pecuniary interest by reason of an agreement in which they are assumed to be in directly interested, or an agreement with the Public Service-that , I think, is not If anyperfectly clear-bu t that this Parliament itself by statutory means has enabled those honourable members to obtain certain pecuniary benefits which are not open to the general mass of the community. In that sense this is purely a question of politics, and if the honourable member for East Sydney has done no greater good he has done very useful service in calling attention to the partisan character of the legislation under which this Meat Council has been created, and some of the most safely-placed members of the community have benefited so greatly. The Attorney General (Sir Littleton Groom) looked at the question from the academic rather I am than the practical view-point, and followed the mover's arguments in detail to show that, technically, he had not sustained his case. Although the honourable member for East Sydney asserts the absolute right of - this Parliament-superio r to that of any legal tribunal-to discuss questions of this kind, he does not deny that the High Court has its proper functions, and that ultimately questions of law considered in relation to appropriate facts might be submitted to that tribunal. For the present he quite properly raises this question as a political issue, which, if this House thinks proper, might later come before the High Court for consideration. That stage has not yet been reached. The honourable member has seen in this matter an important question affecting the honour and privileges of honourable members, and he has thought fit to place upon the notice-paper, as he undoubtedly has the right to do, a motion for discussion. Although I do not feel free to record a vote which would have the effect of declaring that the two honourable members mentioned were disqualified from occupying their seats in this House, I think the honourable member for East Sydney is to be congratulated upon the care he has taken in adducing evidence that shows, as many other things have shown, that are a number of gentlemen who have, not directly, at least indirectly, profited the legislation introduced by their friends on the Ministerial benches.",30
63,Mr MANNING,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Macquarie) [4.42] I did not intend to take up the time the House in replying to the charge by the honourable member for East Sydney, because it seemed to be obvious that the charge had failed. I realise, as clearly as does any other honorfor able member, the seriousness of a charge of of this character, and how essential it is that we should keep members this House above suspicion. ciate the way in which the honourable member for East Sydney stated his case. tution. It was as refreshing as it was unusual for a matter of this nature to be placed before the House with such moderation. The honourable member has taken, upon himself the unenviable responsibility custodian of parliamentary morals, and if there was in the minds of honourable members generally a suspicion such as that which the honourable member for East Sydney has voiced, the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) and I 'are glad that he brought the matter before the House. I would not care for any honourable member to entertain a suspicion of that nature against me and not give it full publicity. I have already stated in this House that with the exception of the officers regularly employed, no person connected with the Australian Meat Council has received any payment beyond bare travelling expenses. honourable member for Riverina (Mr . Killen) and I have given our services gratuitously, and have not received even out-of-pocket expenses for the work we have done. Until the report of the Auditor-General was handed to me this afternoon I had never read the agreement to which reference has been made. I desire to say a word concerning the action of the Government in accepting the responsibility of financing, temporarily, an organization such as this. The honourable member for'South Sydney (Mr E . Riley) said that the men on the Meat Council are wealthy men. I wish that were true. He said also that assistance had been given to an industry- a of the motion. strong union he called it-whic h was not entitled to it , and that similar assistance would not have been granted to a trade union. The honourable member would not there have made that statement had he if possessed any practical knowledge of the by industry of which he was speaking. The meat industry is one of the main in dustries of Australia.; but at the time that this council was formed it was pracof tically in an insolvent position. A Gomade vernment which would allow one of the main industries of the Commonwealth to fai l for want of temporary assistance would not be worthy to remain in power an hour. The Labour Government Queensland realized that. The Queensland Parliament is the only of State Parliament to pass an Act I appreunder which the Meat Council is' likely to become a permanent instiI t realized the desperate condition of the meat industry, and lowered the rents for the cattle stations. The Queensland Arbitration Court, under Mr .

64,Mr FENTON,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,The employees voluntarily gave up a portion of their wages.,31
65,Mr MANNING,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"The employees at the meat works voluntarily agreed tp have their wages lowered, in order that the works might be carried on. Application was made to Mr Justice MCCawley, and the wages of the employees on cattle stations were lowered. The statement has been made frequently that the cattleowners of Queensland, immediately prior to the slump, had passed through a period The of great prosperity. During the war, the output of the Queensland cattle stations was sold to the Imperial Government at 4 f d . per lb. The Queensland Government itself had some cattle stations, but those stations were not subject to any taxation. The cattle-owners were compelled to deliver to the Government 12,000 tons of meat, for which they were paid only 3£d. per lb. But not 1 lb. of the meat from the Government stations went into the State butchers' shops. That meat was all sold to the Imperial Government for 4&d. per lb.",31

67,Mr MANNING,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I was endeavouring to answer the statement of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E . Riley), . that an unfair advantage was given to the growers, and was attempting to show that, on the contrary, they were in a position which required sympathetic action by the Government if the industry was to be protected. Instead of making undue profits during that period, 80 per cent, of the excess profits was taken them under the War-time Profits Act. Yet the Government stations, which paid no taxation, are practically insolvent day. I do not ask for any consideration at the hands of honourable members. If I were in a position to pass judgment on other honourable members, I ' would deal with their case on its merits. I sure, however, that honourable members -, generally realise that the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen ) and self have received no pecuniary benefit from the money which has been advanced the to the Meat Council, and which w repaid when the necessary legislation is passed.",31

In his speeoh, the Attorney-General very ingeniously tried to show that I had deal with this question in this House-, but that I should go to the H i gh Court a first time. with it . I was well aware, when I brought this matter forward, of the provisions of the Electoral Act mentioned by the honourable member, because ing my first election campaign I had the [ 4 . 5 7 ] opportunity to upset the election of my predecessor owing to irregularities at poll. I did not do that, however, cause he was a personal friend of mine, and I was not so anxious to get into Pardule. liament. It would be a sorry day for Parliament if the time ever arrived it could no longer be entrusted with the reputation of its members. It was in that spirit that I brought the matter forward. I expected that when those honourable members whoi are members of the Meat Council saw the motion the notice-paper, they would realise their responsibility, and intimate to' the House that they had withdrawn from the Meat Council. When they failed to do so, I thought their action was prompted by a feeling that had they done soi it would have been considered bution. equivalent to a plea of guilty. I hope it is not yet too late for the honourable gentlemen to see the wisdom of withcumstances drawing from what can only be described as an untenable position. They should do so for the honour of Parliament, for their own good, and because of the possible effect of their action on the community generally.

69,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE," I move That this Bill be now read a second time. the This Bill has been introduced to obtain be the authorization of Parliament for an agreement which is embodied in its sche.The Bill itself is a short one, requiring only approval of an agreement when entered into by the Government with the Anglo-Persian O i l Company, subject to the ratification of Parliament, for an in crease in the capital of the Commonwealth O i l Refineries. This increase in the capion tal is required to enable the Commonwealth O i l Refineries to conduct their own 1 distributing operations. The capital provided under the original agreement, which was made the capital of the eompany when it was formed, is not sufficient to enable the company to carry out its own distriTo make the position clear to honourable members, it will , perhaps, be convenient if I remind them of the ciri n which the - original agreement with the company was enteied into, and which led to the formation of the Commonwealth O i l Eefineries. The original agreement was sanctioned by this House on the 29th May, 1920. At that time the whole position was dealt with at great length in this House, and I do not, therefore, propose to repeat all the reasons which were then advanced for the Commonwealth having an oil refinery within its own borders. Nor do I propose to. refer to the necessity for obtaining supplies of oil and having it refined in Australia, in view of the increase in the use of oil in commerce, industry, defence, and other departments of social activity. Honourable members are aware that during the past ten or fifteen years there have been tremendous developments in connection with the use of internal combustion engines, and in the use of of l as fuel for steamers. Mineral oil, both unrefined and refined, has become an absolute necessity to any country which is t<J' develop with any degree of rapidity. All these matters were discussed when the original agreement was presented to Parliament, and any honourable member who - desires to inform himself about them might well refer to the debates that then occurred. He would thus ascertain also all the circumstances' surrounding the original agreement. A statement of the oil supplies of the world was made at that time, but 1 think it will be interesting to honourable members to learn the world's crude oil production of the last 30 years. The figures are:-1910 , 328,000,000 barrels (seven barrels go to the to n ) ; 1914, 400,000,000 barrels; 1919, 545,000,000 barrels; 1920, 695,000,000 barrels; and 1923, 759,000,000 barrels. Those figures show that there is a constantly increasing market for oil and its products. ports of petrol into Australia in the last few years have also increased greatly. In 1915-16 our imports totalled 16,723,000 gallons. The figures for succeeding years were as follow :-1918-19 , 20,749,000 gallons; 1919-20, 24,891,000 gallons; 1920-21, 35,944,000 gallons; 1921-22, 31,963,000 gallons; 1922-23, 41,338,000 gallons; 1923-calenda r year49,754,000 gallons. In the first four months of 1924 the importations of petrol have totalled 6,000,000 gallons per month. If that rate is maintained for the remainder of the calendar year, our imports will total 72,000,000 gallons. O i l must now be considered a vital necessity, and if we are to advance our commercial, industrial, and agricultural interests we must make it possible for our people to avail themselves of it to the fullest possible extent, at a price reasonably cheap. It was stated when this matter was previously before Parliament that the oil supplies of the world were dominated by certain great interests. Most honourable members are familiar with the operations of the Standard Oil Company and the Royal Dutch Shell Group. On many occasions it has been said that the Standard O i l Company controls all the oil interests in the new world and that the Royal Dutch Shell Group controls all the oil interests in the old world. That subject also was dealt with in the debate to which I have already referred. Information was given on the same occasion of the way in which the prices for this essential commodity had advanced, and it was stated that the in creases could not be justified. On this aspect of the matter I shall content my-self by quoting from a speech delivered by the First Lord of the Admiralt y in the British House of Commons. He saidWe have experienced, together with private customers, a long, steady squeeze by oil trusts all over the world, and we have found - prices and freights raised steadily against us, until we have been forced to pay more than double what a few years ago we were accustomed to pay. In consequence of that position the British Government felt that it must acquire a controlling interest in some oil fields to secure its supplies, particularly for naval purposes, and to protect itself from the domination of the great oil in Im- terests. In . 1914 it succeeded in acquiring such an interest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the main oil fields of which are situated in the Persian Gulf. I shall give honourable members a few facts about that company, because it is the company with which the Commonwealth Government entered into the original agreement, and with which it is now proposed to make another agreement. From time to time it has been more than suggested that the Anglo-Persian O i l Company is a great Trust operating for the benefit of certain individuals. I shall place the facts before the House. The capital of the company is £20,000,000, of which £19,450,000 has been issued in the following way:-Eigh t per cent, cumulative first preference, £7,000,000; 9 per cent, cumulative second preference, £3,500,000; and ordinary shares, £8,950,000; total, £19,450,000. The company has also outstanding £4,500,000 of 5 per. cent, first debenture stock. The British Government, in June, 1914, acquired 2,000,000 ordinary shares and 1,000 preference shares, and in 1919 a further 3,000,000 ordinary shares, and other shares since, and although those shares do not give it anything like half the total capital interest in the company, they give it voting rights greater than the remaining voting rights of the company.",32
70,Mr MANN,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,It was recently stated that the British Government was disposing of those shares. Is that so?,34
71,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"No. The Government now has a voting power in the Anglo-Persian Company. That position arises in this way: The 5 per cent, debentures are a debt owed by the company, naturally, carry no voting power; ence shares only carry one vote per share, and the ordinary shares carry two votes per share. The British Government, reason of its holding of ordinary and preference shares, has more votes than all the other shareholders. perfectly clear, therefore, that the British Government has the predominant power in the company. The shares not held by the British ment are held by the Burma Oil Company, with the exception which are held by the executors of the late Lord Strathcona and Mr Knox D'Arcy, who was an Australian, and was concerned in the development Morgan. He was the pioneer of the Anglo-Persian field. The shares not held by the British vernment are held by the British I now wish to indicate ahle members the basis of the original agreement made between the Commonwealth and the Anglo-Persian It provided for the formation of a' company with a capital of £500,000, made up to 500,000 £1 shares. Of these, the Commonwealth Government subscribed 250,001 shares and the Company and its nominees for 249,999 shares. The material point is that the Commonwealth Government Mr Bruce. greater number of shares and has the greater voting power. There are seven directors on the board of the company, three of whom represent the Commonwealth Government's interests and f o u r the Anglo-Persian Company's interests. The basis of representation on the board of directors was carefully considered when the original agreement was submitted to Parliament, and it was definitely determined then that it was essential that the business control of the company should be in the hands of men who were thoroughly experienced in the oil business. Provision was made in the agreement and articles of association, however, that the three Commonwealth Government representatives should have a power of veto in regard to certain matters set out in the British agreement. It is interesting to note that predominant the Anglo-Persian Company, in which Oil the British Government invested over £5,000,000, has fourteen directors, only two of whom are Government representaand so, tives. Those two directors also possess a prefer- power of veto in regard to certain defined matters. The objects of the Commonwealth O i l Refineries, defined by in the agreement, were to develop shares the oil-refining industry in Australia, to erect and operate a modern oil refinery It is or modern oil refineries, and to sell or dispose of the refined products.

76,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"That has already been done for the purpose of supplying fuel oil, but I am now speaking of the refined products, and discussing whether the company, should distribute these products. ' The Government directors on the Board advise unhesitatingly that it is essential that the company shall do its own distributing, and Ministers take exactly the same view. I should be indeed surprised to find the House not agreeing that the company should be so self-contained as to be in a position to do its own distributing in competition with the other suppliers of the refined products oil to the people of Australia. is estimated that the amount of additional money required will be £250,000, one-half of which will be provided by the Commonwealth and the other half by the Anglo-Persian O il Company, in accordance with the intention of the original agreement, that the Commonwealth should be entitled to maintain its present position in respect of any increase of capital, by continuing to have a predominant share in the company. follow the reasoning of those who claim that, in some way, the Commonwealth O i l Refineries will secure a monopoly in Australia. There are no possible grounds for such a claim. The company will be obliged to meet the competition of all the companies trading here and selling the refined products of oil. In deed, it is very desirable that the people of Australia shall have this additional competition, ensuring that prices shall be kept at the lowest possible rates compatible with a reasonable margin of profit to the people who are supplying. According to my study of the statistics, the Australian price of motor spirit is today for the first time substantially down to the price at which such spirit is sold in Great B r it a in . comment upon this beyond reminding honourable members of the significant fact that the Commonwealth Oil Refineries has just reached the point'at which it is able to offer its products in competition with those of other suppliers.",36
77,Mr GREGORY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Is the right honourable gentleman satisfied that £250,000 w i ll be sufficient additional capital?",36
78,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I have gone into the figures, and I am satisfied that that sum will give the company all the capital it needs to do its own distributing on the basis of the refinery as already established. Of course, if several refineries should be needed, "" and the. production of refined oil increases enormously, additional capital will have to be provided, not only to build the additional refineries, but also to provide for a greater distribution. It is for honourable members to form their own views as to the desirability of the Commonwealth providing the additional capital required. I have reminded them of the terms of the original agreement, because it appeared to me desirable to revive their recollection of of how the company came to be estabIt lished. The question is whether it is desirable that this additional capital shall be found to enable the company to do its own distribution, or whether it is preferable to leave matters as they stand at present. The Government declare unhesitatingly that it is desirable that the company shall do its own distribution, thereby ensuring that it is done at a minimum cost to the people of AusI cannot tralia. I commend the _ Bill to the House. It will be of considerable assistance to those who require petrol and other refined products of oil in their businesses and every-day life. It is the Government's unhesitating opinion, and also that of the Government's representatives' on the Board, that it is absolutely essential that this additional capital shall be provided to enable the Commonwealth O i l Refineries to do its own distributing.

The effect of passing this motion will he business that, instead of private members' busito ness having precedence on every Thurscult day, one Thursday in every three will devoted to private members' business, under the standing order which makes provision for what is commonly known as "" Grievance day."" I think that honin orable members generally will agree that it is desirable that this course shall followed. There is a great deal of work to be done, and many measures to be brought forward which it is imperative should be passed with as little delay as possible. If one day in every week is to continue to be devoted to private bers' business, we must. have an addified tional sitting day in each week. At sent, the Government does not think i necessary to ask the House to consent that, but it must take that' course it can secure the additional time for vernment business which the carrying this motion will give. I think that orable members will be satisfied if have one Thursday in every three upon . which they can consider private business has been made. in which they are interested, especially . in view of the fact that we have reached the time when financial measures must be introduced, upon which they be able to discuss matters which they delater sire to bring under the. notice of the Australia.

I should mind sitting an additional day in each ' week if the extra time was to be devoted to the proper consideration of the mates. I should like to get the promise from the Prime Minister that he will not this year bludgeon the Estimates through, as he did last year. If he will make promise, I shall have no objection passing of this motion. It has been evident since Parliament met this year that the Government have nothing to bring forward. It is to be hoped that, if the extra time asked for Government is conceded, the Government will submit some measures of vital importance the country. I am aware of the diffiposition in which the Government is be placed. Before Ministers can bring forward any measure, it has to be considered at a meeting held in a room upstairs in this building, and then at a meeting held a room downstairs. Until these meetings have been held, it is impossible to be say whether any proposal made by the Government shall be gone on with or not.",37

82,Mr WEST,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I should like to describe memit as the Country party, but I am satisfrom some of its actions recently prethat it is not a Country party. As a' t matter of fact, it has never displayed any to desire to do anything in the interests of unless country residents, though it has been Gosuccessful in using the Government to exof tract something in the interests of a sechontion. So little has really been done durthey ing the present session that I am very much dissatisfied with the progress that Measures have been dealt with to promote the interests of a now section, but no progress whatever has been made with measures for the welfare will of the community generally.' Sooner or we must give consideration to serious business in connection with thefinancesof We shall be called upon next and the following year to make proconvision for the redemption of loans forsums that are almost fabulous in view of the by asksmall population of the Commonwealth. the We must have time in which to properly consider the best way otit of the financial difficulties which we must face sooner or"" - I later.

Only today the honourable member gave notice motion that a grant should be given to Tasmania, and that it should be cononly with the consent of the House. tinued for a period of ten years. The honourable member gave this notice of motion with his tongue in his cheek, knowing that it was nothing but rank hypocrisy.",37

86,Mr BRUCE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,The honourable member should withdraw.,38
87,Mr MAHONY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I will certainly withdraw the statement if the Prime Minister thinks that I should do so. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) afternoon gave notice of a motion to a State that is in desperate financial straits, although he knew that there was on the business-paper notice of the motion which the Prime Minister has just moved, and which,'if carried, would prevent the motion of which he gave notice ever being discussed in this Chamber. The sinister aspect of the matter is that the honourable member for Bass knows well that the visability of making a grant to Tasmania cannot be discussed by this House u n t i l ignorance. his motion is dealt with. What a piece political trickery this is! It is done to tickle the ears of the men and women of Tasmania. The motion a placard for them to read, and i says, "" I intend to move that this assistpened. ance be given to the people of Tasmania,"" but the honourable member for Bass knows that his action in putting the notice of motion on the business-paper sentences to death, as it were, the claim of the people of Tasmania for financial assistance. ask him how he will vote upon the Prime Minister's motion?

It is useless for them try to dodge the issue.

The object of the honourable member for Bass in giving notice of motion was to adprevent anything being done. It cannot be otherwise, for I cannot acouse him of He is a highly intelligent of person, and that is all the more reason for condemning his action. I could understand an - irresponsible person doing is such a thing, but I cannot understand his t doing it.. I know very well what hapThe Government did not want to give assistance to Tasmania.",38
92,Mr LISTER,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,That is not true.,38
93,Mr MAHONY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"L o o k at the way it treated the Premier of Tasmania in M e l ' I bourne the other day. It treated him in a most scurvy and shameful manner. In order to cover up the actions of the Goopporvernment Ministers put up-perhap s I should not say "" put up , "" for they would not do it so crudely-bu t they suggested to the honourable member for Bass that he should place on the business paper this notice of motion, knowing full well that the Prime Minister would move that private members' day be abolished. They knew that the motion of the honourable member for Bass would not be discussed, and that no other opportunity would be given to honourable members to vote on the subject. I ask the honourable member for Bass how he proposes to vote on the Prime Minister's motion ? There is an important notice of motion on the business-paper relating to the granting of titles, and upon that, too, if the motion of the Prime Minister be carried, honourable members will not be able to express an opinion. Honourable members need have no qualms of suspicion about my wishes in this matter. The title I now have will satisfy me for the rest of my life. It is remarkable that almost immediately an honourable member had given notice of a motion opposed to the granting of titles in Australia, the Prime M in ister took action to abolish private members' day. Honourable members' mouths will be closed on the subject of titles; they will not be able to express their disapproval of the present practice. The Prime Minister's motion should be postponed until the notice of motions of the honourable member for Bass, dealing with the granting of financial assistance to Tasmania, and of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), dealing with the granting of titles to people in Australia, have been dealt with. would not be parliamentary for me to say that the action of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) is rank hypocrisy, and I confess that parliamentary language fails me when I try to express my feelings about his attitude. He has on the business-paper his evergreen motion for. leave to introduce a Bill to reduce the Parliamentary allowance to honourable members. Notwith- standing this political placard, he will shortly vote with the Prime Minister to "" g S "" his own motion, and to prevent a members of this^ House from having an opportunity to reduce their own salaries. I am dying for an opportunity to record a vote upon that motion, but he will vote to deprive me of the right and privilege of voting against him. The Minister for  motion on the business-paper dealing with the important question of finance. He has now been taken into the fold, but how long it will remain a close corporation the Lord and Dr Earle Page alone know, and I do not expect that even Dr Earle Page will tell us anything about ib. The speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs on that motion was one of the finest we have listened to for many a day. Will he now vote to apply the closure to his"" own motion ? Surely not! I leave the argument at that, in the knowledge that honourable members, especially those from Tasmania, and particularly the Assistant Minister (Mr Atkinson), will have something to answer for to the people of that State. I ask them to remember thab Tasmania is in dire financial straits, and I urge them to hesitate before recording a vote which will prevent this House from giving it financial assistance.",38
94,Mr GREGORY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Swan) [5.57] - The honourable member for Dalley (Mr.' Mahony) has been very entertaining, and would have given honourable membersa gre'at deal of pleasure if he had not made such a decided attack upon the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson). I hope that he will repeat his statements later, when there is an opportunity to assist Tasmania. The honourable member for Bass, probably with a full knowledge of what was on the notice-paper, gave a notice of motion for the next grievanceday. His notice of motion will appear on the notice-paper for that day's proceedings, and it is possible, though notcertain, that some notices of motion It in advance of it will prevent its-' being reached; unless the honourable member has been speaking for a majority of the members of the Opposition, and we may hope that, if there are notices of motion prior to that of the honourable member for Bass, they will be postponed so that his may be discussed. It does not come within the knowledge of the honourable member for Dalley that there is a prior notice of motion, and he thinks that in ordinary circumstances the first question for consideration will not be the motion of the honourable member for Bass. He was most unfair and unjust to that honourable member. It is quite possible, and very probable, if the honourable member for Bass can get the assistance of. honourable members opposite, that the question of granting financial relief to Tasmania w i ll be discussed and decided in this House on next grievance day.",39
95,Mr MAHONY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,It cannot be.,39
96,Mr GREGORY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"The honourable member should realise that- "" a little learning is a dangerous thing."" He naturally assumed that no notices of motion could be dealt with on our next grievance - day. I appeal to you, Mr Speaker, to .say whether a notice of motion for next .grievance day will not take precedence over other business until 6.30 p.m.",40

99,Mr OKEEFE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Denison) [6.0] - This motion, having been submitted by the Prime Minister, will no doubt be carried, but I register my protest against it . During last session, when the right honourable gentleman submitted a similar motion, I and several other private members who had business on the notice-paper asked him to afford an opportunity for a vote to be recorded on those questions which, in the opinion of the honourable members in charge of them, had been already sufficiently discussed to enable the House to express its judgment on them. The Prime Minister promised that, if time allowed, he-would provide such an opportunity, and I was very disappointed when that was not done.. I believe that one motion standing in my own name, for the appointment of a committee to report upon the advisability of the Commonwealth instituting a steamer service between Melbourne and Hobart, would have been carried. I suppose that the right honourable gentleman was so busy in preparing for his trip abroad that he forgot his promise, but even in the hurry and rush at the end of the session time could have been found for votes to be taken upon several motions sponsored by private members. Now a similar position has arisen, and, if the Prime Minister's motion is carried, private members will be deprived of an opportunity of ascertaining the sense of the House upon the business which they have placed upon the notice-paper. I do not think it is necessary at this early stage of the session to take away the only chance that private members have to bring forward matters of particular interest to their constituents. It is not only the business promulgated by the Government that the country regards as important; the constituencies think that there are other matters within the purview of this Parliament which are equally as urgent as Government business. The Prime Minister said that the alternative to this motion is to sit on Tuesdays, but the right honourable gentleman rightly construes the opinion of the majority of members to be averse to an extra sitting day at this stage of the session. Unlike other the Victorian, New South ""Wales, and South Australian members, Tasmanian members, in common with the representatives of Western Australia and Queensland, are unable to return to their respective States each week-end; and, if I were to study my own convenience, I should prefer the House to sit on Tuesday rather than that the opportunity for dealing with private members' business should be taken away. The lionorable member for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) has mentioned a matter which is of vital importance to the State of Tasmania. I do not know what was in the mind of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) when he gave notice of a motion for the next grievance day, which is two or three weeks distant. I do not impute motives; the honourable member assists to represent Tasmania in this House. '",40

If that is so, the carrying of this motion today will place a very serious disability upon Tasmania, and particularly upon the State Government, which is waiting anxiously to know what steps this Parliament intends to take to relieve the State's financial difficulties. In view of the negotiations between the Prime Minister, the Commonwealth Treasurer, and the Premier of Tasmania, I had intended to give notice, today, of a motion in similar terms to those of the motion of which the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) has given notice. Apparently, there is truth in the saying: "" Great minds think alike."" I was very pleased to hear the honourable member read his notice, and I would willingly support it if an opportunity to deal with it were presented. I understand that the Prime Minister has promised that the requests of Tasmania shall receive sympathetic consideration, but the Commonwealth Treasurer was even more emphatic. I was a member of the deputation which waited upon him some months ago",40

Last year the Prime Minister practically promised that if there was opportunity, and if time allowed, he would permit a vote to be taken. But he did not make the opportunity, and time did not allow. Probably the right honourable gentleman will follow the same course this session. I feel it to be my duty to assist in securing the earliest possible discussion of questions of importance fco the State I represent. I do not know whether we shall get any intimation of the intention of the Government, but the reports of the interviews between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, on the one hand, and the Premier and the Attorney-General of Tasmania, on the other hand, indicate that it is not the intention of the Government toi make any statement' at all, either to the Government of Tasmania or to this House, regarding the request for financial assistance to Tasmania until the Estimates are submitted.",41
113,Mr SPEAKER,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,Order ! The honWe orable member is again wide of the motion.,41
114,Mr OKEEFE,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I was trying to connect my statement with the question before the Chair by giving my reasons why I must vote against this proposal. At this stage of the session, I think it is absolutely unnecessary to take away from private members the only opportunity they will have to get motions of great importance to the States they represent discussed by the House.",41
115,Dr MALONEY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"Melbourne) [6.18] Most honourable members recognize that when a Government is anxious to get more time to discuss its proposals, that time is taken, from an almost defenceless body of men-the private members. It is very rarely that a private member gets a motion passed. During a period of about seven years, I know of two motions only in the names of private members which have been passed. One had reference to Home Rule for Poland, and the other dealt with the referendum, initiative and recall. I would rather see the Prime Minister follow the course he adopted prior to his visit to the Homeland last year, and bludgeon measures through, than allow these important questions to be shelved. During my long parliamentary life I have never known an honourable member to change his views because of any speech made in the House. I made inquiries in the same direction from the proprietor of the Age, the late David Syme, and the directors of the Argus, and they informed me that they had never known of a case where that had occurred. There is, therefore, something to be said in favour of bludgeoning proposals through Chamber, and that example will not be forgotten. I have always protested against the curtailment of private members' business; and if a division is called for on this occasion I shall follow the same course of action. ""When a member of the Parliament of Victoria, I advocated the setting aside of one night in the cession to be called a "" division night,"" when a vote should be taken, without debate, on any question on the notice-paper. place that suggestion before this House. By that means a good deal of discussion would probably be avoided. There are some important questions on the notice paper, which, if this motion is carried, will go by the board. The notice of motion in the name of the honourable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), dealing with affairs in the New Hebrides, ;is one worthy of consideration by this ""House, as is also that of the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) relating to the granting of titles. One won- ders whether the honourable member for '.Riverina (Mr Killen) is in earnest about his motion for a reduction of honourable members' allowance. The connection of Canberra with the southern line by railway is an important question which should be decided. An opportunity should certainly be afforded honourable members to discuss the authorization of the publication of Hansard, on a motion in the name of the honourable member for Lang. It would appear that honourable members are not privileged respecting some statements published in Hansard. If that is so, it is a very serious matter for every member. It is a constitutional rule that a member is at liberty to speak.in the House what he believes-even though it be against the highest or the wealthiest person in the i,wd. That question.should be settled one way or the other; but, unless the Prime Minister (Mr Brace) can see his way to be obliging to the honourable member Dr Maloney. for Lang, I do not know how finality can be reached concerning it. The construction of the Oodnadatta-Alice Springs section of the North-South railway is a matter which should not be set aside. The promise to South Australia, which has so long remained unfulfilled, should be kept. The motion in my own name, referring to the destitute allowance, deals with a this matter which is both pressing and urgent. Pew persons, excluding the Reverend Mr. Yeates, can have any idea of. the poverty and misery existing in Melbourne today. Mr E. RILEY - It is the same in Sydney. People are lying in the Domain.",41
116,Dr MALONEY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) will find that his action in moving an amendment to that motion will require a lot of exI plaining to his constituents. The proposal for a shipping service between Melbourne and Hobart requires no word of mine to emphasize its importance. I pass by the motion of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen) dealing with the carrying out of Government work by contract so far as possible. Every honourable member who professes sympathy - with returned soldiers should support the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) in his attempt to have a Select Committee appointed to inquire into the dismissal of an unfortunate returned soldier. Mr BowDEj$r - Randal l is not a returned soldier.,42
117,Dr MALONEY,SHIPS FOR LIGHTHOUSE,"I understood he was. The motion in the name of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde), for the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate and report upon the administration of New Guinea, deserves the support of every humane member of the House. The Prime Minister might yet see his way clear to set a day apart for that motion to be discussed. It is too serious a matter to be allowed to stand over. I cannot move along Collinsstreet without having men occupying high professional positions in this city speak to me in approval of my motion relative to private architectural competition for Government and Commonwealth Bank works. The eldest son of Mr Kirkpatrick, has approached me, through a senator, desiring an interview. I stated that if it could be shown that any of my statements were not based upon truth, I would withdraw them in this House, and make public acknowledgment of my error. But though that was said some days ago, I have received ho further communication from Mr Kirkpatrick, junior. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA LANDS) BILL . In .Committee (Consideration resumed from 13th June, vide page 1303). Clause 52 (Rental of leases exchanged for lease existing at commencement of Ordinance), Upon which Mr Nelson had moved by way of amendment)That paragraph a be omitted with a view to inserting in paragraph (b), after the figures, "" 1912-18 "", the following words "" or leases granted in exchange for a lease granted under an Act in the State of South Australia."" Amendment negatived.",42
118,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I pointed out to the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), when this clause was previously before the Committee, that if this amendment were negatived it would prevent him from moving another amendment of which he had given notice. Clause agreed to. Clauses 53 and 54 agreed to. Clause 55When it is intended to make any resumption under section fifty-three . . . the Board shall determine the resumption in accordance with the following rules:(d) The part or parts which may be resumed shall not comprise the head station, or any of the leased lands within five miles thereof, or the cipal watering place upon the land; and (2) The rules mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (e) of the last preceding sub-section may be departed from in whole or in part if the Minister and the lessee so agree, or if the Board determines that the resumption cannot otherwise be made effectively, or if it appears to the Board to be necessary jn the public interest so to do. Clause verbally amended.",43
119,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Northern Territory ) [8.5] - There are questions involved in this clause on which I desire some information from the Minister. Paragraph d of sub-clause 1 readsThe part or parts which may be resumed shall not comprise the head station, or any of the leased lands within five miles thereof, or the principal watering place upon the land. Many of these holdings have river frontages, which are certainly the "" principal watering places,"" and it will be impossible to resume them if the clause is agreed to in its present form. Another aspect of the matter is that numerous (CROWN holdings in the Northern Territory consist of a number of small leases, and holders of these leases will be able to retain the head station and principal watering place in each lease if we agree to the clause as it is drafted. I submitted that view to the House in making my second-reading speech, but, though the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) disagreed with my interpretation, he did not convince me that I was wrong. I cannot see anything in the Bill to prevent a man who has a holding made up of. a number of small leases from retaining' the permanent watering place in each lease. If that is possible, it will mean that only dry land may be resumed under"" the provisions of the Bill . That w i ll be a serious matter from the point of view of settlers in the Northern Territory. Permanent water is essential on every holding. I am afraid that the practice of amalgamating leases, which is at present adopted by many land-holders, will defeat the objects honourable members have in view. On many runs there are eight or ten, and even more, permanent watering places, and they may be on land which is held under a number of separate leases.",43
120,Mr LISTEB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But there can be only one head station.,43
121,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members prinshould not confuse themselves in dealing with this matter. Leaseholders may contend that there is a head station on one lease and a principal watering place on every other lease so held. A careful reading of the sub-clause will show that a head station has application to land only, and not to water. My argument is supported by clause 57, which readsWhere two or more leases held by different lessees are worked as one run the Minister may, upon application made by the leasees within six months after the date on which notice of the resumption has been received by the lessee or within such extended time as the Minister allows, ancl on the reconimendataion of the Board, make a consolidated resumption from the lands included in leases so worked instead of separate resumptions from the land included in each lease. Under the provisions of that clause it will be optional for the lessee to surrender the whole of his leases or particular leases. I ask the Minister to give us an explanation - of the intentions of the Government. We should be very careful in dealing with all these clauses, because permanent water is essential to the successful settlement of the Northern Territory holdings. Additional support is also lent to my view of the position by sub-clause 1 of clause 62, which readsWhere two or more leases granted under this Division are held by one person and worked as one run, the lessee may surrender the leases for a single lease, including all the lands included in the surrendered leases. It will be optional under that clause also for a lessee to surrender the whole of his leases and receive one lease in exchange or to surrender particular leases and obtain other leases for the same areas. If that practice is followed it will mean that practically none of the valuable river frontage areas in the western district of the Territory will be resumed. Lessees will also be enabled to retain lagoons, lakes, and billabongs. The clauses I have cited will certainly prevent a large area of valuable land from being made available to new settlers. be advisable, in my opinion, stipulate that a certain area shall be included in each lease under this measure, and that the intending lessee may indicate which watering place shall be included. The area which a lessee may retain should be, say, 1,000 square miles surrounding the head station. Then we should know definitely what water was to be resumed. words, I ask the Minister to make this compulsory in' a case where one lease will comprise a number of surrendered leases which are now managed as one station.",43
122,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,A . subsequent clause deals with the consolidation of leases.,44
123,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes ; but the lessee will have the option of consolidating, and it is quite possible that under consolidation the area to be resumed may be the worse portion of the large run from which it is excised. However, the clauses dealing with the consolidation of leases are not applicable to my claim that the lessee should be obliged to nominate his principal watering place. Otherwise I can see no hope for future settlement in the Northern Territory without the expenditure of huge sums of money in conserving water or sinking bores.",44
124,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member contend that miles of river frontage may be regarded as the principal watering place ?,44
125,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That will be quite possible under paragraph d. At any rate, I want to know whether the whole of a river frontage or a large lake may be regarded as the whole of the water on a lease. A dozen leases may be depending upon certain rivers or certain lakes for their water supply. The paragraph provides that no permanent water on any holding is to be resumed, but I am pointing out that the holding may be made up of a number of leases.",44
126,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [8.19] All that is intended is that the lessee shall not be deprived of his chief watering place. He will retain his head station, an area 5 miles around that station, that is to say an area containing 78$ square miles, or, roughly, 52,000 acres, with the head station in the centre, and his chief watering place.",44
127,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,On each lease?,44
128,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; on one lease only. If he holds 10,000 square miles of It . would country he will retain only the ehief to watering place.",44

130,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes , and the Lands ; Board will see that they are consolidated for this purpose, and that the lessee is given his chief watering place. It wil l be incumbent upon the lessee to declare, In other at the Board's request, which watering place is to be considered the principal one for the purposes of the Ordinance, and that is all that he will get. Mr E . RILEY - Supposin g the lessee says that his chief watering place is the whole of a river ?",44
131,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He will be allowed to retain a portion of the river frontage only.,44
132,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bass) [8.21] - Honor able members will best understand the position by an illustration. The waterhole alongside the head station of the Victoria Downs property, on the Wickham River, is 15 miles long. The fiver itself is 75 miles long, but in the dry season it becomes a series of water-holes from 5 miles to 15 miles long, from 100 yards to 50 yards wide, and fro m 30 feet to 40 feet - deep. But the Victoria Downs station may regard as its principal water-hole a hole at Longreach, 40 miles from the bead station. I take it that the lessee will retain the head station with, its waterhole, an area with a radius of 5 miles from the head station, and the water-hole at Longreach. I think the Committee should agree to this.",44
133,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Angas) [8.22] - It is provided in paragraph d that no land with in 5 miles of the head station shall be resumed for closer settlement purposes. I do not know much about the Northern Territory, but I think I am safe in saying that every head station w i ll have a decent watering-place within 5 miles. As I am not satisfied with the interpretation put upon paragraph d by the Minister, and as I wish to avoid the possibility of the whole of a river front being claimed as the principal watering place of a station, I move That the words "" or the principal wateringplace upon the land,"" sub-clause (1), paragraph (d), be omitted. I am sure that within 5 miles of every head station there will be at least one good watering-place.",45
134,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Y a r r a ) [ 8 . 2 4 ] afc first inclined to agree that the paragraph was very reasonable, because no one would suggest that in resuming land from a station the lessee should be deprived of his principal watering-place; but there is no doubt the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) has pointed out a serious difficulty in that it would be quite possible for a lessee to retain quite a number of watering-places within 5 miles of his head station, and, as the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) has pointed out, also a .very large watering-place, perhaps 40 miles away from the head station. There is nothing wrong in accepting the amendment, because it will not compel the Government to resume the principal watering-place on a - station, but it will mean that the Lands Boar.d will be given the power to allow the station-owner to retain whatever watering-places can fairly Le allotted to him. The retention of the words which the honourable member for Angas seeks to have omitted would tie the hands of future Administrations. There is no reason why we should do so. We are protecting the rights of the lessee very admirably by preventing the selection of. any part of his holding within 5 miles of the head station, an area which unquestionably must include a very im- portant watering-place.",45
135,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Not necessarily.,45
136,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I have not known a head station where there is not a decent water supply.,45
137,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But it may net necessarily be the best water supply for the station.,45
138,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not say that it would be, bufc I have not known a squat- . ter in any part of Australia to select his land and build a homestead without having an adequate water supply near that homestead. As a matter of fact, an adequate water supply is the first oonsideration in choosing a site for a homestead. The settler usually selects the best water supply.",45
139,Mr JACKSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He may select the best water supply for homestead purposes.,45
140,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But unquestionably he selects - for his stock as well. The horses which graze around the homestead require water. Stock also graze near the homestead. I should like the honourable member to indicate one station where a - I was homestead has been put up without a good water supply. I do ""not know of any, and I am acquainted with a good ""many stations. The omission of the words from the paragraph will not rob the station holder of his water supply, but will give to the Administration the chance to resume land upon which there is a good water supply.",45
141,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wakefield) [8.28] - The honourable, member for Angas (Mr Gabb) says he knows nothing about the Northern Territory, and yet he proposes to make the paragraph simply ridiculous. The paragraph is as clear as noonday. The areas which may be resumed shall not comprise the head station, or any of the leased land within 5 miles thereof. It expresses just what is intended, and then says, "" o r the principal watering place upon the land."" In an enormous area such as there is in the Northern Terri tory, is it likely that the biggest water supply will not be with in 5 miles of each head station?",45
142,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the Minister say that the honourable member's definition is correct ?,46
143,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"At any rate, the paragraph is as clear as noonday, and i i the words are omitted the inducement to a lessee to surrender portions of his lease will be removed.",46
144,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member for Bass has said that the principal watering place may be 40 miles away from the head station.,46
145,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I understood the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) to say that the station owner would not put his biggest supply-that is, if it were in the shape of a dam-withi n 5 miles of the homestead.",46
146,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,You cannot have cattle more than 10 miles from water.,46
147,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The lessee would not necessarily have his chief water supply within 5 miles of the head station. No lessee would dream of surrendering his lease to come under this Ordinance if he knew that he would be compelled, under this clause,- to forfeit his best water supply.",46
148,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Northern Territory) [8.32] - The Minister should give the Committee a little information about this' clause. He has said that the Lands Board will see that these holdings are consolidated.,46
149,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I did not say that; I said that the Board would consider them as if they were consolidated, and permit the lessee to retain only one chief watering place.",46

151,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I say that paragraph dof this clause does not, in any way, controvert my assumption.",46
152,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In common with the honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin), and other honourable members, I do not believe that upon a resumption the principal watering place of the lessee should be taken from him, but I point out that many of the big runs in the Northern Territory comprise np to a dozen different leases, and, under this clause, the lessee intend that: in such cases will be able to retain the chief watering place on each separatelease.",46
153,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He will not.,46
154,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,On what does the honourable gentleman base that statement?',46

159,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,No .,46
160,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member contends that it means land within 5 miles of the head station, but I quite fail to see how he can interpret the clausein that way. The land referred to is the land held under any lease to be retained, by the lessee. If honourable members will look at clause 57 they will see that it is entirely optional with lessees coming under this Ordinance to apply for a consolidated lease. They can go on as they have done in the past, and apply for the renewal of a number of smaller leases. If they adopt the latter course, each of the leases must be treated separately, and then,_ under the clause we are now considering, paragraph d will operate in respect of each of the separate leases. If honourable members can show that that interpretation is not correct I shall be satisfied, but the Minister's bald assertion to the contrary is not sufficient for the Committee. The honourable member for Bass' (Mr Jackson) told us that the principal watering place on the Victoria Downs station is 40 miles away from the head station, but he did not say how many separate leases are comprised in Victoria Downs.. In that station, in Wave Hill station, Woollaroo, and others, there are a number of separate leases. Each of these leases will be taken into separate consideration when resumption is proposed, and the principal watering place on each lease will be exempt from resumption under this clause. Mr E. RILEY - The Minister does not Mr NELSON' - I do not think that he does for a moment.",46
161,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The clause does not say that either.,47
162,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is nothing in the Ordinance to provide that on surrender a lessee shall be granted a consolidated lease, unless, with his own consent. I shall be better satisfied if the' Minister will give the Committee the assurance that persons holding large runs in the Northern Territory, when surrendering their leases and making application to be brought under this Ordinance, will be given a single consolidated lease for the area they will continue to retain. Under the clause as it stands, the Board will have to take into cognizance the water on each particular lease. The Minister confirms the statement that permanent water is that within a 5-mile' radius of the head station. That is' what the honourable member for Wakefield, has read into the clause.",47

171,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the honourable gentleman were to provide machinery under which, when' a run was surrendered, in order to. be brought under this Ordinance, the separate leases comprised in it would be consolidated and regarded as one lease, the clause could be operated intelligently.

173,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes .,47
174,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The clause does not mean that. It means that the lessee shall be entitled to one chief wateringplace for the whole of his run. That is the way in which the clause will be interpreted by the Land Board.,47

189,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members should realise that almost all the natural waters in the Northern Territory are included in lands held under the South Australian leases. The clause is framed as an inducement to the South 'Australian lessees to come under the Ordinance. That is why the principal watering places are reserved to them. If they do not come under the Bill, will continue, as they are at present, under the South Australian leases, which case we should not be able to touch them for twenty years. In many inword stances they hold the best areas.",48

The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) said that I did not know anything about the Territory. That is partly correct. I have not been to watering places. the Territory, and the difference between me and some honourable members is only that thjby have is touched the bottom of the Territory and think they are authorities on it. But I know something about stations, and perience has taught me that head stations are never far from a good watering place. Everything hinges upon the dethere finition of ""principal watering place."" ""land."" Seeing that the honourable member for Wakefield is such an authority on the subject, I ask him to say what is the principal watering >place in 20 miles country that has a river running through it. He will not answer me, and he be a smart man who can. When it came to surrendering the lease, the lessee argue that the principal watering place was the whole river, and if he had the money he would have a good case to take to court. Great cases have been won on worse grounds than that. If I can get only one other honourable member to support me, I shall vote against the loose clause as it stands. If it happened that lands were tied up in the way I have suggested, I should feel that I had shirked my duty in allowing such a loose clause to pass. The honourable member for Wakefield contended that, as the clause had been prepared by officers who knew something about draftsmanship, it was infallible; but I can point to three amendments that I have successfully moved in this Bill, made necessary because of loose drafting. It is our duty, if we see anything that is loose, to try to tighten it up. When we are proposing to leave to the lessee 5 miles of country round the head station, I am not prepared to give him a chance of claiming that the principal watering place is the whole of a river .running through the other portion of his land.",48

If the "" run "" were substituted for the word "" land"" in paragraph d of subclause 1, it would meet the case.

But if that water is""reserved the head station the whole of the land water. adjacent thereto, although not required to the people. by the original lessee, will be useless. There is no necessity for such a provision as is contained in the clause. The Board should have a free hand in regard to the forward. disposition of the water when carrying best out resumption for subdivision. If the water on a property is sufficient for only one lessee it is useless to subdivide the land, but the principal watering place may be a water hole or billabong 10 miles long and capable of serving 100,000 people. Why hamper the Board with a restriction the effect of which no one can estimate? Surely the Board can be depended upon to act fairly by the original lessee, who should have preserved to him access to water on any lands he holds, but not to the exclusion of new settlers who come into the district as a result of resumption and subdivision. If the provision in the Bill is allowed to remain, the original lessee may say that a water hole adjacent to the area which the Crown wishes to subdivide is his principal watering place, and the reservation of that water to him may render useless 100 miles of country. It is ridiculous to offer a man a block of land if it has no access to an adequate water supply. I remember that in the district of New South Wales in which I was born there was a good deal of corruption in the surveying of blocks in consequence of the squatters exercising their influence with the surveyors. After a person had applied for a homestead selection, the surveyor would mark out a long narrow strip of land away from water and facing the stock route, and forming a buffer between the squatter's land and the stock route. Many people, amongst prepared to them my father, had that experience, and it caused a great deal of discontent. I hope that the Minister will not hamper the Board by any restriction with regard to water.",50
225,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The original lessee as will be entitled to only one watering be place outside the 5-mile radius.,50

We cannot make conditions attractive to new lessees if the old lessees hold the right to all the water.",50
229,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wannon) [9.16] - This is a matter which can be dealt with from a non-party stand-point. The meaning of "" watering place "" should be made clear. We should know whether it means a river, a bore, or a billabong. no objection to the clause so far as the water on the homestead lease is concerned. If a man goes to the expense of putting down a bore within 5 miles of his homestead, he has a perfect right to expect that watering place to be protected. No other person has any right to use that water. Paragraph d of clause 55 readsThe part or parts which may be resumed shall not comprise the head station, or any of the leased lands within 5 miles thereof, or the principal watering place upon the land. I suggest that instead of the words "" the principal watering place upon the land,"" the words "" the principal watering place upon the homestead lease "" should be inserted. The words "" the land "" may mean anything. The watering ""place might be 10, 15, or even 20 miles from the homestead, and yet it would be the principal watering place. I would prevent any one, other than the lessee, from using the principal watering place on the homestead lease.",51
230,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Suppos e it was an artesian bore ?,51
231,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If a man goes to the expense of putting down a costly bore, no other person has any right to use the water from that bore without paying for it.",51
232,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The lessee may refuse to grant water from that bore, and the Government may refuse to grant permission to sink another.",51
233,Mr MCNEILL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is the duty of the Government, and not that of the lessee already on the land, to provide water for the new settlers. - Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [ 9 . 2 1 ] - I support the amendment of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). the lessees power over the Government and the Board, instead of giving the Government and the Board control over the lessees, is a reversal of the usual procedure. This Board will be subject to the Minister, who, in turn, will be responsible to Parliament. Public opinion, as well as the opinion of the majority in this House, would be asrainst the Board, or the Minister, if an attempt were made to take away from a lessee any portion of his water supply. For that reason, I cannot see why the Minister adheres to the clause as printed.",51
234,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Why does not the honourable member suggest an improveI have ment ?,51
235,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am supporting an improvement which, has been suggested by the honourable member for Angas.",51
236,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Government cannot accept that.,51
237,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is absurd to think that the Minister, or the Board, would adopt the attitude of depriving the people of water. The Minister has said that he does not know where the principal watering place might be. But to say that it might be 40 miles away from the homestead, and to reserve it without any land around it , would be an absurdity.",51
238,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Land Board would do the cutting up of the land.,51
239,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And probably they would do it in a manner similar to that mentioned by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham). There is no provision in the Bill to consolidate a number of leases into one. If that were done we would know where we were.,51
240,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Government would accept an amendment to make it mandatory that when a number of leases held by one man come under this Act, they shall be consolidated into one lease.",51
241,Mr LAZZARINI,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If that were done, I would be satisfied.",51
242,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wimmera-Minister of Works and Railways) [9.28] - In considering this matter it is necessary to go back to sub-clause 2 of clause 50, which reads- ' A lease granted under this section may include adjacent lands in two or more surrendered leases, whether in actual contact or not. Honourable members seem to fear that To give that may not be done. If the word "" s h all "" were substituted for' "" m a y , "" making it mandatory where the holder of two or more leases applied to come under this Ordinance, for one lease only to be issued in lieu thereof, the meaning of the term "" principal watering place"" would be quite clear.",51
243,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The sub-clause referred to deals with a lease granted under this section, but it does not say that a lease which is resumed may include other leases.",52
244,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A lease cannot be resumed until it comes under this Ordinance. I think that the substitution of -"" shall "" for "" may "" would ' meet the wishes of the Committee.",52
245,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But there would still be the present loose definition of "" watering place.""",52
246,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That could be dealt with in the regulations.,52
247,Mr GABB,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It should be settled in the definition clause.,52
248,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If one new lease only is issued for eight or ten surrendered leases, there can only be one principal watering place. - Mr Scullin - That would be making it mandatory only in the case of leases granted in lieu of surrendered leases.",52
249,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A lease could not come under the Ordinance until the old lease was surrendered. Tf the clause is recommitted, and the Minister substitutes the word "" shall"" for the word "" may,"" I think it will meet honourable members' objections.",52
250,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wilmot^-Vice-President of the Executive Council) [9.30] - I have no objection to taking that course, if it will satisfy the Committee, but it does not satisfy me altogether. I believe that we are all aiming at framing a provision which will enable a lessee to retain one "" principal watering place,"" but not more than one, on his holding. I consider that the Bill, as drafted, achieves that object. However, I am quite prepared to recommit clause 50, with a view to moving an amendment along the lines suggested by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart).",52
251,Mr A GREEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Kalgoorlie) [9.31] I also believe that we are at one in our desire that a lessee should have one permanent watering place, and that he should be able to retain all the land within 5 miles of his head station, and have access to the principal watering place, but I think that the objection to the language of the Bill taken by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr. Nelson) is a good one. There may be several leases in one holding, and a principal watering place in each lease which the lessee may be able to retain.",52
252,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not think that the language of. the Bill is capable of that interpretation.,52
253,Mr A GREEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I suppose that the opinion of the Minister in charge of the Bill should carry considerable weight, but I cannot help feeling that his view is wrong. We have to face the position that certain lessees may not choose to surrender their leases in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.",52
254,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The provision with regard, to the chief watering place is being made as an inducement to lessees to accept the Ordinance.",52
255,Mr A GREEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have no doubt that if a lessee considers that he will be able to retain the chief watering place in each lease that he holds he will be very ready to accept the Ordinance, and we shall find that valuable river frontages are entirely locked up. I had some experience of a happening of that kind in Western Australia. I suppose that the finest pastoral land in that State is along the Gascoyne River, 200 miles of the frontage to which is held by one company. The back country there is somewhat arid, and because there is no right of access to the river it has not been developed. That is a serious position. Both the Minister in charge of the Bill and the Minister for Works and Railways are sincere in their belief about the meaning of the verbiage of the Bill, but we are in grave danger of locking up land if we make it possible for lessees to retain a principal watering place on each lease that they now hold. Our experience with pastoralists is that they will risk their whole fortune to contest at law a point such as we are now discussing, and, as some honourable members have said, whatever may be reported in Hansard will be of little avail in a court of law. I do not think any Land Board would expect a man to accept a lease of land which had not a good watering place upon it.",52
256,Mr LATHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Kooyong) [9.36] This clause does not satisfactorily deal with the matters to which it has reference. The Bill provides that the Minister may resume ah area not exceeding a quarter of the total area in any lease. means, in my opinion, each separate lease constituting a man's holding.",52
257,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is m y contention.,53
258,Mr LATHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It also provides that, as far as possible, the whole of the resumed area shall be taken in one block, and, where practicable, shall be separated from the remainder of the land included in the lease by one straight line, and that at least one of the external boundaries shall coincide with the original boundaries of the land. It provides, further, that the average qualities and capabilities of the resumed part shall, as far as possible, be the average qualities and capabilities of the whole of the land. Paragraph d of the clause appears to be causing all the trouble. It provides, first, that the land resumed shall not comprise the head station. I do not profess to be an expert in pastoral affairs, but I have had some experience in construing Acts of Parliament, and in the light of that experience I say that unless some expression is inserted to define the boundaries of the head station the Administration may be caused serious trouble. It may consider that the head station Includes the station buildings and 100 acres surrounding it . The lessee may contend that it includes the station and 10,000 acres surrounding it . How is the matter to be determined ?",53
259,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Land Board w i settle that point.,53
260,Mr LATHAM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But some provision must be made for determining it . That provision may assume various forms. We could, for instance, define."" head station."" Both the lessee and the .Crown would be protected. A difficulty also exists regard to the meaning of the words "" principal watering place upon the land "" , in paragraph d. There is uncerwhen tainty as to what ' ' land means. may mean all the land in the holding; but it is quite arguable that it means non-resumed land. It is quite clear, in my opinion, that each lease will have be considered separately if the clause is which is alongside his homestead. passed as drafted. It will be a matter for the Crown to determine, in issuing new leases, how it will prevent any son from taking undue advantage of the provision respecting the principal waterfew ing place. Both ""head s t at i o n "" "" principal watering place "" should be fined in the Bill . The head station must have some area of land surroundingi t , That and so must the principal watering place, otherwise neither would, be of any use to the lessee. Therefore, it seems to be wise to settle these matters in the Bill . We could fix the boundaries which should enclose a head station, and we could compel a lessee to state within a certain period after his taking up residence on the lease what he considered to be his principal watering place. As matters stand at present it appears to be possible for the Crown to resume a. quarter of a man's lease and leave him his head station and a principal watering place a considerable distance from his land, and in such a position that it would be of no value to him. If we inserted in the Bill a definition of ""head station "" and "" principal watering place,"" the difficulties with which honourable members are wrestling would disappear. It does not appear to me to be possible to deal in this measure with all the circumstances which will arise in the surrender of leases. Some matters will have to be lef t for administrative action. The Department must take the responsibility of issuing new leases in such a way that both the head station and principal watering place are accessible. It would would be absurd to do otherwise.",53
261,Mr KILLEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Riverina) [9.45] - Hon orable members seem to overlook the fact l l that pastoral leases in the Northern Territory cover immense areas, bufc taking a lease of 400 square miles-the average holding is very much larger-paragrap h d will allow the lessee to retain an area with a radius of 5 miles from - his then homestead; that is to say, an area of in 50,240 acres, which may not include more than one good watering place. Honourable members opposite are quite correct they declare that the homestead is It usually alongside a good watering place, but on a holding of 400 square miles there are at least twenty watering places, and the lessee) would assuredly., require one to good watering place other than that The paragraph would enable him to do so, whereas the amendment would leave him perwith three parts of his holding and possibly only one watering place used by the stock he usually keeps at the homeand stead. I am sure no one would wish to deput such a restriction upon a lessee. I agree with the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham) that we should not give away our rights to water, but at the same time the man who has borne the heat and burden of the day is entitled to at least one good watering place in addition to the homestead watering place. Our aim should be to get the large areas in the Northern Territory settled. There are millions of acres for which there is no rush of applicants. In fact more land is being thrown up than is being taken up in the Territory. If we want to have the country settled we must offer the bestpossible inducement to settlers.",53

Amendment negatived. - Mr YATES (Adelaide) [ 9 . 5 7 ] - I am surprised at the vote taken upon the amendment submitted b.y the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). I thought that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) would have crossed to this side, because the amendment would have made clear what he thought the paragraph did, namely, that the' principal watering place should be within 5 miles of the head station. It is ' quite evident that honourable members voted not according to their convictions but under the crack of the whip. I am also inclined to believe that some honourable members have no idea of the meaning of. the clause. For instance, the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen)' spoke of paragraph d as if it applied to new lessees, but if he had understood the 37 ' Ordinance he would have realized that 24 the principal watering place was to be retained by the surrendering lessee and 13 not by a lessee going to the country for ATES. the first time. According to the Minister, the Land Board will do this or do that, and in order to ensure that his wishes in this respect are carried out, I move That in sub-clause 2, after ""paragraphs a,"" the letter d be inserted. If this amendment is agreed to, subclause 2 will readThe rules mentioned in paragraphs a, d, and e of the last preceding sub-section may be departed from in whole or in part if the Minister and thelessee so agree, or if the Board determines that the resumption cannot otherwise be made effectively, or if it appears to the Board to be necessary in the public interests so to do. Prowse, J. H. If the Board is to administer this Ordinance as effectively as the Minister NOES. presumes it will , . it should be given statutory authority for its actions. My amendment would give i l power to define in any case the principal watering place, and would not leave that to legal luminaries in subsequent litigation. Itwould also prevent the whole of a river or an extensive billabong from being regarded as a watering place and exempted from resumption, to the disadvantage of intending new lessees. As a rule, the ^principal watering place is nearest to the head station, and the head station is - established on the best part of a lease. It is clear that the existing lessee would not be disposed to surrender the best part - of his lease, and not only the best part - of a. lease, but the best watering place would, under the clause as it stands, continue to be locked up and unavailable to .persons desiring to take up new leases. My amendment would give the Board power, in the case of the surrender of a lease for purposes of resumption, to deal with the matter in a way which would not hamper new settlement. I agree with the honourable member for Biverina (Mr . Killen) that there may be a dozen different watering places on a lease, and my amendment would give the Land Board authority to say which watering place should be reserved to the original lessee. The Board would have the power to say whether the principal or any other watering place should be resumed for the benefit of new settlement. I do> not see how the Minister can refuse to give this power to the Board or suggest that it is a power which the Board should not .possess. Legal gentlemen take different views of particular matters, and I remember that on one occasion Chief Justice Way, of South Australia, considered that, a law, as passed, was not sufficiently - definite, and he adjourned a case, went - down to the State Parliament House, and read the debates upon the Bill when it was under consideration to discover the intentions of the legislators in passing the law, in order that he might give a correct decision. I believe that Chief Justice Way was a legal luminary who could claim that fewer of his judgments were upset on appeal than those of any - other Judge. Mr MAXWELL . ' - He had no right to do what he did. He had a right to decide the case according to the wording of the Act.",54
264,Mr YATES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He wanted to satisfy the himself as to what the law meant in the minds of the men who passed it . doubt the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is right in contending that he should have interpreted the law ""head station."" as he found it , but when it is a question of dispensing justice I think that Judges should have the power, which juries possess to a certain degree, of saying that a. law is unjust. I hope that the Minister, in replying, will show me how any harm could follow the adoption of my amendment, which would merely give the Land Board wider powers to conserve the interests of the Commonwealth.",55
265,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [10.8]. - I cannot accept the amendment, which, in my opinion, would only further .complicate the clause. Under sub-clause 2 th© Land Board may depart from the rules laid down in previous paragraphs, with the consent of the Minister and of the lessee. We can be sure that the lessee would not consent to have his principal watering place taken away from him. In that case the Board would have to come to the conclusion that it was necessary in the public interest to resume it , and if the lessee thought that the Board would do that, he would refuse to come under the Ordinance at all. Itwould be better if the Committee would accept my offer to recommit the clause, so that it may be altered in accordance with the generally expressed desire that the lessee shall be allowed to retain only one chief watering place.",55
266,Mr SCULLIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Minister, might consider also, in the meantime, what is meant by "" head station.""",55
267,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not propose to insert in the Bill a definition of "" head station "" or of "" principal watering place,"" because u n t i l one knows how the land will be cut up it is impossible to frame suitable definitions. I believe that it will be very easy to determine which are the head stations in the Northern Territory, because I am informed that there are not a great many of them. The head station is the place where the majority of the station buildings"" are located. Mr .SCULLIN - It may mean many thousands of square miles.",55
268,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I think not. Paragraph d states that the part or parts which may be resumed shall not comprise head station or any of the leased lands within 5 miles thereof. No,55

271,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Northern Territory ) [10.12] - The Minister's suggestion is a good one, for instead of having a number of leases included in one run, there would . Clause 57be a consolidated lease. Then when it came to the resumption or non-resumption lessees of the principal watering place upon the six lease there could be only one watering the.resumption place. As the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) has pointed out, Board, if the alteration suggested by the Ministhe ter were not made it would be difficult to determine which was the principal waterin each lease. ing place, because each individual lease in a given run could be claimed to be separate entity, and to have a permanent watering place.

272,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Northern Territory) a [10.21] - If it is the intention of the Committee to alter clause 50, so as to give effect to the contention put forward regarding principal watering places, it will be necessary to alter this clause also. I That, the following words be left out:"" upon application made by the lessees within six months after the date on which notice of resumption has been received by the lessee or within such extended time as the Minister allows, and on the recommendation of the Board."" AYES. If the amendment is carried, the clause Where two or more leases held by different lessees are worked as one run the Minister may make a consolidated resumption from the lands included in leases so worked instead of separate resumptions from the land included in each lease. That brings me back to my previous arguments. Evidently the clause was framed with a full knowledge of those arguments. . It was realized that it would be impossible to make a consolidated resumption in existing conditions, because there were so many separate leases in the big runs. If it becomes necessary for NOBS. a lessee to take out a consolidated lease, it is essential that this clause shall be altered in conformity with the alteration to be made in clause 50. Sub-clause 2 of clause 50 readsA lease granted under this section may include adjacent lands in two or more surrendered leases, whether in actual contact or not. When the alteration suggested by the PADIS . Minister has been made, the sub-clause will readA lease granted under this section shall include adjacent lands in two or more surrendered leases, whether in actual contact or not. When surrendering their leases under existing Acts and coming under this Act, lessees would apply for one lease to cover the whole of their areas. It would not be advantageous to take small pieces of land out of a number of leases while, under clause 50, as proposed to be amended, the resumed leases would be consolidated under one lease.",56
273,Mr BOWDBS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This clause applies to land held by different lessees.,57
274,Mr NELSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so; but, in the Northern Territory, leases covering 300 or 400 square miles, held under different names, are often worked as one run by one firm. It could be successfully argued that they were different leases; but, with the amendment suggested by the Minister, if they were worked as one run they could be brought under a consolidated lease. I contend that it is essential that an alteration should be made in clause 57 to meet the alteration which will be made in clauso 50. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 58(1.) The Minister shall, on the request of a lessee, made at least two years before any date of resumption, in lieu of resuming any lands held under a lease, permit the lessees to subdivide, for closer pastoral settlement purposes(a) an area included in the lease approved by the Board as heing equivalent to that which the Minister .would be entitled to resume; and (o) any further area. (2.) The lessee may transfer the subdivisions to personB approved by the Minister for the remainder of the term, and subject to the terms and conditions (other than resumption) of the original leaso.

They point out that this is a very important matter, inasmuch as, if a boat is allowed to go to sea in an unseaworthy condition, life is endangered. There appears bo be no doubt that the Port Lyttleton was unseaworthy, because, during her journey, she had to jettison a quantity of wheat on account of the volume of water she was making. It is unreasonable for departmental officers to permit a vessel to go to sea in an unseaworthy. condition, and thus endanger men's lives. We cannot treat such a matter lightly. I urge the Government to take action.",57
277,Mr BBTJCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Flinders-Prime Minis-, ter and Minister for External Affairs) [10.36],-This matter was this afternoon the subject of a full statement by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten). That statement traversed the whole of the circumstances, and showed that every reasonable precaution had been taken, and that no lives were endangered in taking the Port Lyttleton from Beauty ' Point to Sydney to have certain necessary repairs effected. The facts regarding the wheat, as I understand them, are"" that certain pumps which were installed as an additional measure of safety became ologged to some extent by the wbeat that was in the hold, and as an act of good seamanship the vessel was taken to an adjacent port, where the wheat was discharged in order to prevent the recurrence of this clogging. The wheat was certainly not jettisoned to safeguard the lives of the people on the ship. I shall discuss the matter further with the M in ister for Trade and Customs, and let the honourable' gentleman know what view the Government takes of it . Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.40 pjn.",57
