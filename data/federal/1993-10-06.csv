1,The Clerk,ABSENCE OF MR SPEAKER,"I infonn the House of the unavoidable absence of the Speaker. In accordance with standing order 14, the Chairman of Committees, as Acting Speaker, will take the chair.",11
2,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ABSENCE OF MR SPEAKER,"Mr Jenkins) thereupon took the chair, and read prayers. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",11
3,Mr BEAZLEY,BUSINESS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent at this sitting: (1) the interruption of business required by standing order lOlA occurring at approximately 12 noon; and (2) questions without notice being called on at 3 p.m. The reasons for this are pretty obvious; they go to the visit of the President of Chile. Question resolved in the affinnative. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional,11
4,Mr BEAZLEY,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I move: That, in relation to the proceedings on the following bills, so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the House making one declaration of urgency and moving one motion for the allotment of time in respect of all the bills: Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94; Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1993-94; Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94; Loan Bill 1993; States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1993; Wool International Bill 1993; Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill 1993; Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993; and Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills 1993. Honourable members will note that the relevant bills incorporated in this guillotine are the appropriation bills, which we are currently discussing, a loan bill and a series of wool related bills. All these particular manoeuvres are required of us by virtue of the timetable imposed upon us by the Senate. If we are going to get these materials through to the Senate by the end of October, as we must, then it is inevitable that we will need to guillotine these bills. This merely foreshadows Orders a fair amount of similar activity in the next couple of weeks of sitting. It is not the best way to do business, there is no question about that; but it is inevitable in the circumstances imposed upon us by the Senate.",11
5,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The opposition totally rejects this motion and totally rejects the absolutely fallaciQus arguments that have been advanced by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). If he has trouble getting legislation through, he should sit the parliament next week. He should sit the parliament for longer periods. Why do we not demonstrate to the Australian people a willingness to work longer hours, to sit more frequently, and to create in the House of Representatives, which is the popular House Orders of the Australian parliament, evidence of our commitment to passing sensible legislation, in sensible hours, and in a civilised fashion? More than on most occasions the focus of the country is on the doings of this place because of the remarkably petulant performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday. Perhaps there is no more appropriate time than now to say something about the way in which the affairs of this House are conducted. I know that the Leader of the House does have, above and beyond many of his colleagues, a concern for the way in which this parliament is conducted. I know how disappointed the Leader of the House was in the behaviour of his ,Prime Minister yesterday. I know how embarrassed he was, I know how embarrassed the Speaker was, I know how embarrassed the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) was at the way the Prime Minister behaved yesterday. Yesterday the Prime Minister behaved in that petulant, rude, arrogant, authoritarian fashion because he was unable to get his own way. He demonstrated that very deep authoritarian streak which has always been a feature of his participation in the political affairs of this country. I ask the Leader of the House very genuinelyon behalf of the opposition: what is wrong with the parliament sitting for a longer period through the remaining months of this year? I know that the Leader of the House would say in reply, 'Back in 1968 X did something else, in 1975 somebody else did something else, and in 1983 the Fraser government did something else'. I think the Australian public is a little tired of those kinds of arguments. I think the Australian public recognises that there is something of a logjam at the present time so far as legislation is concerned. I think most of the people who elected us on 13 March would be saying to us, 'If you want more time to debate legislation sensibly and to prevent that build-up of legislation at the end of each session, why on el;lrth don't you people work longer hours in Canberra? Why doesn't the parliament sit longer so you can demonstrate your commitment to sensible debate by sitting more frequently?'. I do not mean sitting longer hours; I mean sitting more frequently. There is a very strong body of support on this side of the House for parliament to sit more regularly. There is no reason why the fewer than 100 days a year that parliament sits, and has sat on average over the last few years, should not, be increased by 30 to 50 per cent. If the House were to resolve to do that we would not only meet - he problems that are inherent in the fact that the government has to move a guillotine in order to get its legislament. tion through but also win some respect and support out in the broader community. It concerns me that every time there is a debate about the proceedings and the happenings in this House not only the culprits are diminished but the whole institution is diminished. What the Prime Minister did yesterday was to diminish not only his status-I do not care very much about that-but also the status of this House. That bothers me far more than anything else. One of the positive things we could all do for this place and fot the reputation of this place in the broader community is demonstrate to the Australian people a willingness to sit longer hours and to take our role far more seriously. I say very directly to the Leader of the House that through the various procedural devices that the government has adopted over the past few weeks it is denying us any reasonable opportunity to say anything of great substance and great consequence in this House. The government is guillotining legislation through and denying us the right to move censure motions. Any Treasurer who faced the sort of pressure that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) faced last week after the two weeks that the parliament had been up would have come back and faced the sharp end of a censure motion. The major business of this House at the beginning of last week's sitting would have been a censure motion of the Treasurer. Any Treasurer or senior minister on either side of the House who had been under that kind of pressure would have faced a censure motion, but he did not. We were denied that opportunity. Last week, as the Leader of the House is aware, the Speaker, in a very genuine attempt to do something positive about the proceed- , ings of this parliament, had a discussion with the Leader of the Opposition and me about ways and means of improving the way in which the House is being conducted. I put it to the Speaker. I now put it to the Leader of the House and to the parliament-very openly that one of the major problems we face at the present time is that there is no parliamentary safety valve for the expression of legitimate degrees of dissent and criticism of the governThe government has denied us all of those safety valves; it qas denied us MPls; it has denied us censure motions. YeSterday the Prime Minister brutally and unreasonably denied us a question time, and the government is repeating it again today by moving this guillotine motion. Those opposite cannot parade themselves as even beginning to believe in the way parliamentary democracy operates in this country. They are parading around the nation talking about a republic and, by their very actions, behaving in a very authoritarian fashion. They are not giving us the opportunity to debate things legitimately. The reply of the Leader of the House will be that it is because of the Senate's motion. MrBeazley-It is.",11
6,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I have heard that before. Let me anticipate what the Leader of the House is going to say. My response to that is very simple: if the Leader of the House wants more time we will give it to him. If he wants to sit longer we are prepared to sit longer. If he wants to say this morning that parliament will sit next week to give us more time, good on him. He will get that motion passed without any dissent from the opposition. We are happy to sit every working day between now and the middle of December in order to have a rational level of parliamentary debate. We on this side of the House are perfectly happy to cancel other arrangements in order to fulfil our biggest duty: to sit in this parliament and to sensibly discuss tion for the benefit of the Australian people. Nobody, by the wildest stretch of imagination, could argue that what is happening in the parliament at present is good for Australian democracy or is good for the parliamentary system. The Leader of the House has it in his hands because he has got the numbers. He and I are good enough political realists to know that whoever has the numbers in this House ultimately gets his or her way. He has the numbers and he has it within his power and authority to do something to lift the reputation of this place. If the Leader of the House were to announce this morning a willingness to sit the parliament between now and the end of the year, he would win for himself the respect of this parliament and the respect and gratitude of the Australian people. The Australian people are not very impressed with what is happening at present. They were not impressed with the way the Prime Minister behaved yesterday. They were not impressed with that arrogant, petulant display of brutally unacceptable bad manners. They were not impressed with a man who holds the most responsible, sensitive position in the country so far losing control of himself that he looked as though he was a petulant bullyboy taking his bat home because he could not get his way. That is the Prime Minister of those opposite; that is their problem. Frankly, I do not care about the Prime Minister. I have no regard for him at all. I think he is a disgrace to this country. He distorts, deceives and misrepresents every issue. Yesterday, he went to a. press conference and said that, six or seven times during the term in office of the Fraser government, question time had been dispensed with in the manner in which he had dispensed with question time yesterday. That is completely untrue and the Leader of the House knows it. That is a complete and utter lie, distortion and deception.",13
7,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,Order!,13
8,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,I withdraw the word 'lie'. Mr Chynoweth interjecting,13
9,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I have withdrawn the legislaword 'lie', so do not get excited.",13
10,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,The honourable member for Bennelong has withdrawn. The honourable member for Dunkley will resume his seat.,13
11,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"The Prime Minister was being utterly contemptuous of the truth and that is his normal custom. He operates on the Goebbels principle: if you are utterly contemptible of the truth frequently enough you will end up getting away with it. It is the role of this opposition to make certain that the Prime Minister does not get away with the Goebbels practice. I say to this House that that attempt by the Prime Minister yesterday to imply that Malcolm Fraser had done on six or seven occasions what he did yesterday was utterly contemptible but entirely to be expected from this man. The Leader of the House has an opportunity to dissociate himself from the Prime Minister. He has an opportunity to lift himself above the ruck in which the Prime Minister is involved. He has an opportunity this morning to really strike a positive blow about the problems of this House at present. We need more time for rational debate. We are prepared to offer it. I make this offer on behalf of all my colleagues:· they are perfectly happy to cancel their other arrangements next week and to come back hereGovernment members-Ha, hal",13
12,Mr HOWARD,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Honourable members opposite laugh. It is just typical. There are Australian citizens in the gallery who are looking down here. They want to know what the response will be. People out there are saying, 'We are not terribly impressed with what is happening at present. We have record unemployment and we have an enormous overseas debt, but we have a Prime Minister on an ego trip about a republic that a growing number of Australians do not want, a Prime Minister on an ego trip about a lot of other things'. To cap it all, he spits the dummy, bundles up his papers and marches out of parliament like a spoilt child. The Leader of the House has an opportunity to demonstrate that, in caring for this instituabout it. tion, he is different from the Prime Minister. The Leader of the House can do that-and he will have our total support-by simply saying that the parliament will still sit longer. The government will still get its legislation in fullness of time, but we will have the opportunity of having some intelligent debate, moving appropriate censure motions, raising matters of public importance and talking about things that oppositions are entitled to talk about in any democracy. We have had this SOO-page tome from Mr Turnbull about the sunlit uplands of democracy. There are not many sunlit uplands of democracy around this place at the present time when we are being denied the opportunity that oppositions are traditionally afforded in a parliamentary system. The answer to that is to sit this place longer. There is no reason on earth why we cannot do that. None of us have a greater duty than to sit here representing the people who sent us, and we are not doing that very well at the present time. As somebody who has been in this place now for 19 years, I am profoundly unhappy with the way in which this House is operating at the present time. I do not think that we are doing justice to our representatives and I do not think the Leader of the House believes that either. I know he cares about the parliament and the institution, so let us have a practical demonstration of that concern. The Leader of the House does not regard this institution as just a rubber stamp for the executive. I know the Prime Minister does. I know the Prime Minister regards question time as a courtesy afforded on high by the executive to the poor mugs, the poor foot soldiers, of the parliamentary system, that is, the rest Of us. I understand all of that. But the Leader of the House is different. He is a man who has some concern for this institution and he has an opportunity today to demonstrate that concern. He has an opportunity to demonstrate that he is a cut above the Prime Minister. I have always known that, and we on this side of the House have always known that, but most of the people out there do not realise that quite so readily and the Leader of the House has an opportunity to do something I say very sincerely to the Leader of the House again that if he wants to get this legislation through, if he wants to lift the reputation of this place, then one very simple the way of doing it is to simply say to the Australian public, 'We have all decided to spend more time here. We have all decided to work even longer hours in the parliament. We will sit more days. We will sit more frequently. We will not sit to ridiculously late hours in the evening, but we will sit on more days'. I think that will get a very positive response. That is what the Leader of the House should be doing instead of moving this ridiculous guillotine motion, and his failure to do that is the reason why we will vote against this ridiculous motion.",14
13,Mr SHARP,URGENT LEGISLATION,"This motion has been moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) as part of the government's determined and deliberate attempt to strangle the democratic processes represented here in the parliament. Anybody who has observed the way this government, particularly under the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), has administered the operations of this parliament would recognise that this government is not about free speech and promoting the parliamentary and democratic processes that have been so important to the development of this country. This government is about strangling our democracy, strangling our parliament and making us irrelevant to the issues of the day by denying those of us who are elected to represent people the right to speak in this House on issues that affect every single member of the Australian population. The reason for that is that today the government is moving to limit debate on a number of important bills over the next couple of days. If we want to look at what this means in reality, we have only to look at today's Notice Paper. We see that listed for debate tomorrow is one of the most important bills that this parliament will debate all year, a relating to the Garnaut report on the Australian wool industry-the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill. That is a bill set up to completely change the structure, administration and operation of the Australian wool industry, affecting the lives of tens of .thousands of Australians and the viability of one of Australia's most important industries. The time allotted for the debate on that particular aspect of the bill is a total of five minutes-five minutes for debate on one of the most important bills the government will bring into the House in the course of this year and perhaps in the course of this decade. That is what this bill is all about. The motion moved by the Leader of the House is designed to cut off debate on some of those contentious issues. Not only is debate on that legislationtbeing limited, but the opposition's right to speak and to put our views in this House has been cut off. We no longer have a question time that could be called a process of seeking and gaining information. We have seen over the last 12 or 18 months since the Prime Minister took office the number of questions in question time being reduced to four or five questions; if we have a whoopee day, six questions might be asked by opposition members. Yesterday we had a total of two. In the week before, we were getting three or four questions a day. That is bad enough, but the answers that we get are totally irrelevant to the questions that we ask. If we ask a question about the weather, we get an answer about football. It takes people like the Prime Minister 15 minutes to give us a totally irrelevant answer. That is part of the whole procedure of destroying our parliamentary process in Australia. In addition to the denial of our opportunity to express our concerns on behalf of the people in question time, we no longer have debates on matters of public importance. The central debate of the day in the parliament has been taken away from the opposition. It is not as though government members did not get a fair go during MPI debates; they got as much time to put their case as did opposition members. But that important part of our bill parliamentary process has been taken away. The ability to censure ministers for incompetence has been denied us. My goodness, we would have liked to have been able to do that last Thursday when the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) was accused of the very serious matter of misleading the House. Normally, a censure motion would have followed. We could not do so because this government has denied the opposition the right to move a censure motion. The right to move for the suspension of standing orders has also been taken away from the opposition. So over the last few months, gradually, in that salami slice process, the opposition has had its democratic rights taken away. This does not just affect the opposition, because the opposition represents those people in Australia who are concerned enough about the future of this country to support us. Their voice is being denied in this parliament. That is what affects and concerns those on this side of the House. There are so many important issues which, as the honourable member for Benne10ng (Mr Howard) pointed out, ought to be debated in full. If it takes extra time to do so, let us do it. Tonight, I think we are adjourning at 7.30 p.m. Normally, we adjourn at 11.30 p.m. Why do we not go right through until 11.30 p.m. tonight? That means we could have an extra two, three or four hours., of debate so that those of us who have concerns about particular bills could have the right to speak about them. There are other matters that we should be speaking about. The Prime Minister is behavit! ing, as was described in the Australian today, like a petulant dummy. When the Prime Minister is behaving like that, it is no wonder the people of Australia have little respect their parliament. Just last Thursday night the adjournment debate the honourable memabout it. ber for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who does a great job in representing his electorate, read out a letter from a constituent of his who claimed, quite rightly, that the Prime Minister's behaviour in the parliament was setting a bad example for his children and that he was ashamed of it and disgusted by It is that type of behaviour by the Prime Minister, which was best exemplified by his petulant dummy approach in the House yesterday, that concerns people like the constituents of the honourable member for Trobe. If all of us on this side of the House had the opportunity to express the views our electorates, they would be expressed in similar terms. There is no doubt that this is the most disliked Prime Minister of Australia in living memory. Never before, in my nine years in this House, have I found people coming up to me in shopping arcades and the street, spilling out vitriol about how hate the Prime Minister. He is extraordinary. People dislike him as they have never disliked anyone else. Mr Chynoweth-What about Jeffrey that? Kennett?",14
14,Mr SHARP,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I can tell the honourable member for Dunkley that Jeff Kennett is a decisions? dam sight more popular than the Prime Minister. Jeff Kennett is going up in the polls; he is one of the most respected political leaders in Australia today. Any comparison between the Premier of Victoria and the Prime Minister of Australia is a comparison of competence versus incompetence. It is somebody getting on with the job and behaving in a reasonable fashion versus somebody who is not getting on with the job and who behaves in an unreasonable fashion. There are so many important issues deserving of our attention. There is the issue of one million people unemployed. There is the Mabo debate, which is so important to the future of Australia that we cannot talk about We have problems with the budget, which we cannot really talk about in this House because the government has denied us the opportunity to do so. There is the matter of for industrial relations-a huge issue by in anybody's calculation-and we cannot talk Then there is the republican issue, a report on which was tabled only yesterday, outlining what is called the minimalist approach. Some minimalist approach that is when it takes 500 pages to describe. There are things like the it. wool industry'S concerns and the problems facing rural Australia. These are all issues on which members on this side of the House believe they have a right to get up and express their concerns. Members are being denied that democratic right by this motion, La as they have been by previous resolutions on motions put by the Leader of the House. All of of these things are a worry to us. Only yesterday in a debate-I would not have got away with it if the rules of the House had been properly applied-I talked about some of the issues affecting truck in operators, many of whom would be in the they electorate of the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). As a result of the budget brought down on 17 August, one in six people in the road transport industry will lose their jobs. What does he think about Is he happy that one in six of the truck operators in his electorate are going to the lose their jobs because of his government's There are people in the shipping industry with whom, I am sure, the honourable member for Dunkley and others on his side of the House would feel a great compatibility. Their industry has been hit right below the belt as a result of the budget announcements. The excise on fuel oil has been doubled. As a result, the cost of operating the average Australian ship will go up by $360,000 a year compared with th- $440,000 a year saving per ship per year that the Fightback proposal would have given them. That means that there is an $800,000 operating cost differential between Fightback and government policy, and that will mean jobs lost in the Australian shipping industry. That is the sort of debate that this motion denies members of this House getting involved in. It makes a mockery of our parliamentary process when members of this House are not given a fair chance to express their views, and when ministers who display incompetencesuch as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and, yesterday, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis)-cannot be brought to heel by having their incompetence outlined in detail in this House through proper parliamentary debate. If Australians are concerned about the future of our country and.about our democratic rights being maintained, then they should all stand up, as we do on this side of the House, and speak out against the antidemocratic processes that this government has been putting in place. There is no doubt that this is a jackbooted government of the worse order, comprised of people who use the Goebbels principle of propaganda in order to get their message out. That is a very bad aspect of our parliamentary process, and we have been seeing more of it over the last few months. I say to you, Mr Acting Speaker, that members on this side of the House will continue to speak out, as much as we are allowed to, on behalf of our constituents' concerns. We will speak out for the future of Australia; we will speak out for what is right and decent. No matter what this government does to deny us the opportunity to speak in this House, we will resist its denial of our democratic rights with full vigour, using every aspect of the constitution to support those rights. That is why we on this side of the House will oppose the motion put by the Leader of the House-on this day and on any other day. If this motion is the best he can do, he should Adams, D. give us more days to sit in this House and more opportunity to debate. We are happy to make the change because change is so important if we are going to make Australia better. We are prepared to give up our time away from this House, spend more time here and have more debate if that will make this country a better and more democratic country. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the question be now put. Mr Lieberman-I rise on a point of order. My point of order is based on standing order 399 which of course is the basis on which the Leader of the House is putting this guillotine motion. Mr Acting Speaker, as you know, the wording of standing order 399 is: In cases of necessity, any standing or sessional order or orders of the House may be suspended It is absolutely clear that, when the Leader of the House is putting the guillotine motion, he has to establish the cause; that is, necessity. He has to establish necessity, and unless he establishes necessity",16
15,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"Order! The honourable member will not debate the question through his point of order. Mr Lieberman-Of course I do not wish to, but I want to make it absolutely clear that the standing orders of this House are designed to protect everyone in this House and ensure that divisions. are called correctly. There has been nothing said at all by the Leader of the House to deal with the question of necessity. He has not established necessity.",17
16,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,URGENT LEGISLATION,"I think the honourable member has made his point. There is no point of order. I am now going to put the question.

18,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Before calling the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) I wish to make a statement on time limits in Committee of the Whole House. During consideration of this bill in Committee of the Whole House yesterday, the attention of the chair was drawn to the fact that a parliamentary secretary and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) both spoke without limitation'of time to a group of proposed expenditures and an amendment proposed to one of the group. Reference was also made to this in subsequent debate. Standing order 91, relating to time limits for debates and speeches, provides that, in Committee of the Whole House, the minister in charge may speak for periods not specified. In effect, this means that the minister in charge of a bill may speak without limitation of time on unlimited occasions-subject to the alteration of the call. In the normal course of events, the practice is that another minister, a parliamentary secretary, receives a maximum of two periods, each of 10 minutes, unless acting for the minister in charge of the bill under consideration. Interpretation of the standing order is complicated somewhat by the fact that, during the consideration of the main appropriation bill, proposed expenditures for a number of departments and services are, on occasion, grouped together, involving a potential multiple number of ministers in charge. It is further complicated by the fact that the practice has developed for parliamentary secretaries to be seated at the table during consideration of a . number of groupings of proposed expenditures. I have ascertained the circumstances of the events of yesterday. It seems that, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) rose to speak, he was the only representative of the ministry scheduled to participate in the debate, and he made his contribution without limitation of time. When the minister subsequently rose, it was apparent that, while he was not in charge of any of the proposed expenditures before the committee, the amendment proposed by the opposition impinged upon his responsibilities as Leader of the House and, accordingly, a time limit was not imposed on him. I propose that on future occasions, when a minister or parliamentary secretary rises to speak on a matter which is not obviously within his or her responsibility, the minister or parliamentary secretary will be asked by the chair whether he or she is acting as the minister in charge, and time limits will be applied or not applied according to the response given. Mr Rocher-I rise to speak on a point of order, Mr Chairman. I want clarification on the advice that you have just given. What is the procedure when, in the. course of one item on the Notice Paper in committee, there is a succession of different people at the table, none of whom-as happened during part of yesterday-have any such connection with the or legislation itself? In other words, even with the ruling that you have given, and depending on the answer that you get from the person at the table on the government side, can more than one person assume the right to speak for a limitless time? I put it to you that as we under the guillotine it would be very easy for the government, as it has done outrageously on other occasions, to talk the whole legislation through by accepting the proposition that ministers or parliamentary secretaries can speak for a limitless time when under the guillotine.",20
19,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,The intention of the proposed procedure is to identify the minister or parliamentary secretary who is taking that responsibility. My understanding is that one person would have unlimited time for that question in the committee stage. The standing orders provide for only the one minister or parliamentary secretary to do so.,21
20,Mr TANNER,PAIRS,"I intend to address my remarks with respect to the appropriation for the Department of Employment, Education and Training to employment and, in particular, the labour market programs that have been funded by the government in this budget. The budget provides for approximately $1.3 billion to be allocated to labour market programs for the financial year that we are now in. This amounts to an increase of approximately $120 million on the previous financial year expenditure. It will: ensure that there are over 500,000 places in labour market programs this year-128,000 of which will be in my home state of Victoria. Jobclub places will increase from approximately 27,000 in 1992-93 to over 51,000 in 1993-94, and of these places 14,000 will be in Victoria. Honourable members will note that this is an increase of some considerable proportions. I also note comments made to the government's employment task force, of which I am a member, by the President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brendan Nelson, indicating that his experiences with jobclubs in his home state of Tasmania have been very positive. I applaud and endorse his comments. Recent research indicates that roughly 50 per cent of participants in jobclubs go on to either employment or to full participation in mainstream education. The proposed budget allocation also provides $3 million for the community activity are program, which will ensure that roughly 7,000 people who are currently unemployed are able to voluntarily participate in community activity of a work related nature. The budget provides for 117,000 skillshare places and 10,000 new jobskills places. The labour market programs produced by this government have become increasingly diverse and sophisticated in recent years. If we look back to the mid-80s and compare that situation with now, we will see just how far we have come in that relatively short period in tackling the structural problems of unemployment in our community, particularly the difficulties that the long-term unemployed have in being able to re-enter the labour market. Labour market programs are now well targeted· and well funded, having been subjected to quite substantial increases in the level of funding and the degree of commitment from the government. It is now appropriate that we should take stock of the situation, as is occurring in various reSpectsincluding the employment task force of which I am a member-and analyse how effective these programs are and how the approach could be improved by the government in order to deal with what is clearly an intractable long-term problem; that is, entrenched long-term unemployment. I wish to make a number of points in this regard that give rise to some cause for concern as to how we should be tackling the problem of long-term unemployment and the administration. of labour market programs. I commend these aspects to the government for consideration in its future dealings with labour market programs. In my view, the current criteria that apply with respect to participation in labour market programs tend to be too inflexible. They do not allow for a sufficient degree of flexibility, particularly at the grassroots level by case workers to fit particular programs to the needs of individuals. There is a limited capacity for early intervention in the case of particular unemployed people who are obviously in a high risk category and who are very likely to become long-term unemployed people. People have to prove their eligibility for programs such as jobtrain and jobskills by being unemployed for a certain period. There is a clear disincentive for unemployed people to take up employment opportunities that are of a limited temporary duration because, by doing so, they will remove their eligibility for programs such as job-ain and jobskills. I have had numerous complaints in my electoral office from people who have been unemployed for periods of two or three years. Recently, they took an opportunity to work maybe for six or seven weeks-work that was always going to be temporary-and discovered later when they applied for a labour market program that, by having taken that work, they lost their eligibility for that gram. Naturally, they are not very happy about it. We also have certain structural weaknesses in the programs; for example, with the situation of 20-year-olds who are eligible neither. for traineeships nor for jobskills, which is a program for adult workers which bears some resemblance to the traineeship system. We also have an unfortunate· situation where it, is not possible under the existing legislation to have ethno-specific skillshares. This means that workers from non-English speaking backgrounds whose English skills are not sufficient to allow them to participate on an equal basis within established skillshares are not able to gain access to certain training opportunities. I have had numerous examples within my electorate of people falling through the cracks as a result of this weakness. There are roughly 35 different labour market programs now·run by the government, ranging from broad major programs such as jobskills and jobtrain to more specific programs such as the fares assistance scheme. I suggest that, maybe with one or two specific exceptions, it would be appropriate for the government to merge these schemes into a single umbrella scheme and to allow considerable flexibility at the case worker level to tailor particular approaches to suit the needs of individual unemployed people. This would allow for a much more individualised approach, and it would get rid of some of the anomalies and bureaucratic difficulties that exist in the administration of the current programs. One of the tendencies of all governments, on both sides of the political fence, is that, when a particular problem emerges or comes to public attention, they create a new body to deal with it, even when existing programs or bodies are quite suited, with some modification, to take that problem on board. I think to some extent there has been a bit of that tendency in the labour market program area. There are significant difficulties with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Employers complain of staff turnover and of a lack of staff training. I think that that reflects proessentially no great discredit on the government; it is simply that the problem has increased so rapidly-namely, the long-term unemployment problem-and also that the range and depth of labour market programs have increased so rapidly that inevitably that organisation is struggling to cope, given its naturally restricted resources. It is very pleasing to see that the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the CES are moving towards a more case management oriented approach. I certainly will be a voice within the government encouraging more resources to be made available to the CES to enable a much more individually focused case management based approach. Perhaps we are putting too much emphasis-although the emphasis certainly is worthwhile-on training at the expense of other less vocationally oriented matters such as social support and life skills, which are of critical importance to maintaining morale arid connection with society and the job market for people who are long-term unemployed. It is interesting to note a submission to our committee from the electorate of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), who chaired the Ipswich region employment advisory group. Employers in his region reported to that group that they felt general questions of employability such as motivation, presentation and commitment to work were in many respects more important to them than pure skills, qualification and training. Therefore, we need to focus on those broader, more diverse aspects of employment and not only on skilling the work force. There should be a more direct involvement of employers in the framing and delivery of labour market programs. They are ultimately the market to which we are appealing; those we are seeking to take on people as employees. Clearly, the greatest possible involvement by those employers who are most likely to respond by taking on employees under those programs is likely to lead to the greatest of success of the programs. Under the program training providers should get more certainty. One of the difficulties with the existing structures is that, because tendering is done on a six-month basis for some of the programs, it is very difficult for long-term planning to occur on the part of training providers. It is correct to keep them on their toes to some extent, but it can also lead to some inefficient use of resources. There are also some in-built· biases in certain agencies within DEET against community based training providers. They tend to look to the established TAFE system and to be disparaging in some instances of places such as neighbourhood houses and community centres. I feel that that is a bias which exists only in some areas and which could be corrected. Finally, I feel that it would be appropriate for the government to consider a full-on marketing campaign directed to employers right across the country, large and small, to persuade them to take on an extra employee.

21,Mr MACKELLAR,PAIRS,"Like all members of this chamber, I am confronted daily with the reality of unemployment at an unacceptably high level in my electorate and, like a lot of other members of the chamber, have been endeavouring to do something about it over the years. Last year I set up in Warringah an employment task force. It became very apparent that one of the issues which have to be confronted in relation to this continuing problem of unemployment is the lack of information that a lot of potential employers have as to the assistance that is available through various government authorities, at both the federal and state level, which could assist them in providing opportunities for further employment. One of the organisations which I invited to join that task force was the Manly Warringah BusineSs Action Centre. It is one of the business enterprise· centres which are present throughout Australia. For those who do not understand what the BECs do, I remind the chamber that they are non-profit, independent partnerships of local business people and corporations, local and state governments and level educational institutions. Manly-Warringah offers initial free advice and counselling to those who wish to establish, or are operating, local businesses. When the centre was established, the aim was to promote business enterprise and coordination, increased employment and economic well-being within the district. The centre encourages and helps those wishing to establish a business. It also supports the expansion, development or survival of existing small businesses and promotes employment, business growth and the general prosperity of the district. This is a most important area because one of the most difficult areas of unemploymentis not necessarily the young unemployed but the middle-aged unemployed. Long-term unemployment amongst this group of people in my area is a very worrying aspect of the total situation. We also have a situation developing where a lot of people are being made redundant. In that redundancy they sometimes receive considerable redundancy payments and then look around for ways in which they can invest that payment. One of the things that they are looking at, of course, is the establishment of their own small business. That is a very laudable and commendable attitude, but one of the problems we have is that in many cases they are very inexperienced in establishing a small business and, either before the business is established or after it has been established and runs into problems, they need good, practical, sound, common sense advice as to how to go about things. In my view, these business enterprise centres provide a most useful and worthwhile method of assisting those people who may be in the process of establishing a small business or, conversely, having established a small business may be running into problems where they are having considerable difficulties making a go of it. The business action centre located in Manly-Warringah has done an extraordinarily useful job in coordinating local efforts and there is a tremendous amount of local support for the centre-people are making their expertise available free of charge to the centre-and a tremendous amount of cooperation and coordination of effort. The results that the centre has achieved in assisting people who seek its services really have been quite outstanding. I raise the issue because the centre is having a problem. I raise it in this context because I hope that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) may do something with his colleagues in relation to the problem that the BEes are having. The problem is that business enterprise centres are public benevolent institutions for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Fringe Benefits Tax Act and the Sales Tax Act. In a letter dated 7 February 1992 the Australian Taxation Office granted the BEes exemption from income tax and approval of public benevolent institution-that is, PBI - status, which also qualified them for exemption from sales tax and fringe benefits tax. Subsequently, for various reasons these arrangements have been revoked by the Australian Taxation Office. As honourable members can understand, the matter has consumed considerable resources and is one which directly affects the ability of the BEes to function in their local communities, in particular those which service a large geographic area. It is for that reason that the matter has been the subject of ongoing negotiations with the ATO. At considerable expense, the assistance of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was sought to assist them in these consultations with the ATO. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu gave the opinion that the BECs qualify for the original exemptions given on 7 February 1992 and that any ruling given by the ATO is simply a statement of its interpretation of the law and is necessarily the correct interpretation. As I have pointed out, the BEes are community organisations and, frankly, do not have the capability, the capacity or the financial resources to take on the Australian Taxation Office. They believe-I strongly support this belief-that the attitude of the ATO is counterproductive to the very worthwhile work these BEes are doing on behalf of the government and the community right throughout Australia. The involvement of the BEes in helping the unemployed and the small business sector is increasing day by day. I have seen examples of that in my electorate. The movement believes that it will continue to be as effective as possible and to be the delivery mechanism for many of both the state and federal government programs, but that capacity for effective delivery would be enhanced if this public benevolent institution status could be reinstated. Although the BEes have not. changed their direction since 7 February 1992, as I have already mentioned, the ruling by the ATO has made their performance considerably more difficult. They wish reinstatement for the following reasons: firstly, sponsors not carrying on a business can obtain an income tax deduction for their contributions under section 78 of the act; secondly, the BEes will be exempt from fringe benefits tax; and, thirdly, the BEes will be exempt from sales tax or, alternatively, those persons donating or providing goods to the BEes will get an exemption from sales tax on the goods they provide. . The important thing is to achieve that PBI status. My purpose in raising this matter today is, firstly, to congratulate the BEes on the very effective work that they are doing around Australia, particularly in Manly-Warringah in my electorate; and, secondly, to urge the government and the minister to take up this question which is of significant importance to the well-being of the BECs. Any organisation which brings together community resources, as the BEes do, thus making assistance available to individuals who are seeking to set up their own small businesses or to maintain their own small business, in facing the present not extraordinarily difficult economic circumstances, has to be encouraged. I do. not think for a moment that it would cost the government very much money at all. The cost would be. negligible but the benefit to this organisation would be great. I urge minister to take it on as. a matter of some urgent significance.",23
22,Mr JENKINS,PAIRS,"If time permits, I wish to raise two inatters in the discussion of the DEET portfolio in the committee stage of the appropriation bill. Recent media speculation has been brought to my attention regarding the future of the training guarantee levy. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) was reported in an article in the Melbourne Age as saying: At some point in time it should prob&bly go. He was referring to the training levy. If we were able to be a bit more flexible about the use of the levy it might have a longer life. I acknowledge that the department provides policy advice and the monitoring of the levy. The government has agreed to review the scheme within four years of its start-up date, which was on 1 July 1990. So it is an apt time to be discussing these matters. A suggestion has been put to me recently that the money could be channelled into work experience schemes. This suggestion arises out of a fairly innovative local program being funded under MAPS, dealing with the employment problems faced by newly arrived immigrants. The program I refer to is the employment advocacy program of St Johns Care-force, Plenty Valley. The project has highlighted at this early stage the need to provide often well-qualified new arrivals with work experience to make them competitive in the labour market. The contention put to me is that, whilst many of the companies are doing the right thing under the training guarantee levy, it has reached a stage of saturation where they are looking for new ideas and new outcomes. As an aside, I refer honourable members to page 98 of Budget Related Paper No. 7.4. Studies have indicated the very. high compliance with the training guarantee levy and the very high awareness of the levy. Under the proposal put to me companies could offset part of their obligation under the training guarantee levy by providing structhe tured work experience. The money that they do not spend on their own work force could also be turned over to the government for use in training and labour market programs. The Wran committee report in 1988, which led to the introduction of HECS, also included a scathing attack on the indifference of Australian employers and their continuing poor record in training. The Wran committee recommended a one or two per cent levy on top of the corporate tax rate as a contribution towards growth in the education and training system, a system from which industry directly benefits. Whilst students are now paying, the corporate contribution recommendation has never been acted upon. Perhaps it is well past time that it is looked at again. In a general context I say that I think from time to time the government has tried to deliver on an agenda for business, but it is very difficult to see whether the response has been appropriate aJldpositive. Perhaps this idea could be looked at in the context of the government's white paper on unemployment. I hope that through ongoing consultations many innovative proposals, such as the one that has been put to me, might see the light of day. The second matter I wish to raise is the tendering procedures used by· Department of Employment, Education and Training. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) touched on this matter in his contribution to this debate earlier this morning. Whilst I have been given a range of concernS about tendering, I wish specifically to talk about the points raised regarding the tendering procedure under ESL-English as a second language. Earlier this year a local community based organisation which had been previously funded brought to my attention the circumstances of its unsuccessful tender. The tender had been awarded to a large private profit making organisation. At the time of being awarded the tender this organisation did not even have a local premise, a local place, to carry out its business. There was no suggestion that the unsuccessful tenderer, the community based organisation, had not previously provided a quality service. In fact, it was very hard for the organisation to get any official reason from the department for the awarding of the tender in the way that it occurred. The suggestion was made to me that the unsuccessful tender was also the lowest tender. Subsequently, another round of tenders was awarded. Again, the local community based non-profit organisation was unsuccessful in preference to a private enterprise provider. In this instance, it has been confirmed to me that the average cost per place of the unsuccessful tender was well below that of the successful tender. It is my view things being equal, community based organisations should receive preference. I place that on the record. People might have to accept that my views are a little jaundiced by· that. I have tried to be fair in making comments about this case. Tendering processes must be altered so that small community based organisations are not discriminated against. I have raised my concerns with the minister. On this occasion I received a reply from an acting assistant secretary in the department. The letter confirms that DEET has not awarded the tenders in this case to the lowest tenderer. The rationwell ale that I have been given is that the larger organisation can run more courses concurrently and therefore offer pathways for students to go on to other courses. This justification fuels my concern that the department has perhaps become a little isolated, bureaucratised and on some occasions a little ossified in some of these matters. As a public servant in my previous life, I understand the difficulty that departments have in coming to grips with the myriad of policy changes that occur from. time to time. I think it is a matter of an attitQdinal change. We should sit down with local community users and find out what best suits particular occasions. In the example to which I have been referring, the ESL course provided by the statewide private enterprise at a far higher cost to the taxpayer has been delivered in a building a couple of doors from where the community based organisation previously delivered the same course in much the same· conditions. Again I stress that it appears there was never any question about the quality of the community based provider. Presumably the department has awarded its tenders on the basis of maximising outcomes for local residents, the users of these programs. Given that they have not questioned the quality of the classes previously provided by community based organisations, it follows that DEET sees the so-called flexibility or concurrence of the large provider as worth at least as much as the difference between the big providers, higher costs and the community that, other based providers, lower cpst. The question is: are they right? The obvious point needs to be made that, at a time when the demand for these places is high, the community providers .could provide more places for the same money or the same number of places for less cost to the taxpayer. What does this flexibility or concurrence which the taxpayer is paying highly for mean in practice? In reality it means that within the larger organisation a person can go through a succession of 'for profit' courses-no less, no more. Local community based organisations are placed to know what is available and to refer students on to other appropriate pathways, not simply to process people through successive 'for profit' courses at one private outlet. The department is making decisions on the basis of· an artificial view of flexibility and, in the process, it is systematically underestimating the value to residents of community based providers in the information and service delivery process. While I acknowledged my preference for non-profit community based providers, my interest ultimately is in the outcomes for users of the services. Are the users getting the best possible services? It appears that the department has insufficient information to know. It appears that there has been little or no evaluation of the outcomes for the service users. The department must get out and about into the conimunity; it must stop awarding tenders based on abstract considerations without really knowing what is happening in the real world; and it must stop throwing taxpayers' money at private enterprise without conducting a thorough evaluation of the outcomes for users. In the current difficult economic circumstances the department is a crucial department. We need to be confident that it is up to the enonnous task that confronts it. (TIme expired)",25
23,Mr SWAN,PAIRS,"Some weeks ago I was privileged to assist in the presentation of the· Queensland skillshare awards, the guest speaker at which was the Wallabies captain, Nick Farr-Jones. These awards were presented to unemployed young people who, through government labour market programs such as skillshare,have successfully re-entered the work force or established their own small businesses. Interestingly on that day, Mr Nick FarrJones pointed out some of the analogies between successful football teams and successful labour market programs. He pointed out that when the Wallabies were the wooden spooners and were 00 a losing streak their attitude to training simply consisted of nothing more sophisticated than a pep talk in the locker room, with prominent players banging their heads against the lockers. After their pep talk they all raced out onto the field thinking they were going to win the game. Nick Farr-Jones said that that attitude resulted in the Wallabies being the wooden spooners for many years. He said that the Wallabies went on to win and to take the world cup only when they adopted a much more sophisticated approach to their training, to winning and to the game. Over time, the Wallabies took on board a whole lot of additional services to assist in their preparation for the world cup, including additional training and psychological fitness training through the employment of specialists such as physiotherapists, psychologists and so on. Academics such as Judith Sloan and honourable members opposite in this chamber are a bit like the Wallabies when that team held the wooden spoon: they simply advocate the unsuccessful and painful approach of banging one's head against the wall and doing nothing more sophisticated to assist those people who need to achieve excellence, be it on the football field or be it in the labour market. Unemployed people can achieve much more if we provide the necessary back-up and assistance which is so essential. That is why these appropriations are so relevant today. Australia does require a comprehensive array of labour market programs to assist individuals who will never be the beneficiaries of prolonged or sustained economic growth unless they are given a leg-up in the labour market throqgh our labour market programs. It is well known that in this country, even if we were to return to very high levels of economic growth over the next few years, we will not successfully generate all the jobs that are required to eliminate our problem of longtenn unemployment. Long-tenn unemployment in our community is structural and is caused by technological change, changes in the labour supply and many other complex factors. Unless we take action through the labour market programs put forward in this budget, we will simply condemn a whole generation of Australians, hundreds of thousands of innocent Australians, to a life without work. We know that unemployment destroys individuals as people. It attacks their economic conditions and it destroys their lifestyle. Unemployment in itself becomes a self-perpetuating fact that, once one is out of work, one is increasingly less likely to.get back into work. That is the case for labour market programs. That is why I reject the approach of labour market economists such as· Judith Sloan and honourable members opposite, who simply argue that the only way to solve our problem in the long tew is through growth and that nothing additional should be done in labour market programs to assist the victims of structurallong-term unemployment. The solution advocated by Professor Sloan and the opposition is simply to slash labour market programs. We found last year in Fightback that the. opposition was going to hack into labour market programs to the tune of $435 million a year and abolish the CES. In addition, its only other solution was to slash wages. If academics such as Judith Sloan and the opposition are simply advocating Third World level wages minus labour market programs, why are they not honest about it and come out and admit that they do not want this country to continue to be a fair, progressive and advanced industrialised society which cares for its work force not only through the provision of a decent system of industrial relations but also through assistance to ployed workers via essential labour market programs? Like the Wallabies who achieved worldclass performance through additional training programs, this country will not achieve high levels of productive growth unless we make a commitment to a total package of economic measures, including essential labour market programs. The fundamental prerequisite is always growth· in the economy. We must continue to work to become more productive, to become more internationally competitive, to export more and to import less, that is, to grow as fast as we possibly can. However, even if we grow as fast as we possibly can, we cannot create the jobs for all of those people that require them. That is why we have made an additional commitment in this budget to the labour market programs. We have committed an extra $120 million to the labour market programs,taking our expenditure in total in this budget to $1.3 billion. That is more than double the expenditure of 1991-92. About 50 per cent of the people who participate in these labour market programs can expect to be in work, successfully, three months after the completion of programs. In 1993-94 some 500,000 unemployed people will commence training· through labour market programs, wage subsidy programs, programs such as LEAP, jobclub and so on. In total, 644,000 places will be available in our labour market programs in the current year. That is a very sizeable and substantial commitment to doing something about the problem of sustained, long-term unemployment. I find it somewhat bewildering and perplexing that academics such as Professor Sloan and honourable members opposite/can simply say that we do not require those sorts of programs. Those sorts of programs are essential to ensure that we remain a cohesive society with long-term economic growth. Unemployment has a profound effect not only through its social consequences on families, crime and health, which are rarely taken into account when we examine the social costs of unemployment, but also on the functioning of the unem- labour market. Unless we deal with the problem of long-term structural unemployment, as the economy begins to grow again we will run into the problem of having simultaneously high levels of long-term unemployment on the one hand and labour shortages on the other. The argument for these labour programs is not just a case of assisting people socially but a case, in the interests of everyone in our society, especially in terms of the economy, of providing this assistance to ensure that the labour market operates ·as effectively as possible. It is with all of. these questions in .mind that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has outli-ed the white paper process-an absolutely. essential process to highlight the gravity of the problem .of long-term unemployment and to search for new and different solutions to the problem. Whilst the government has made a massive commitment in this budget to labour market programs, the government, through the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), has also acknowledged that we must have a fresh look at these programs to see how they the operate more effectively, to see which ones could be expanded to more effectively cope with the problem of long-term unemployment and to see what new programs may be required so that we can have a comprehensive commitment in our community to assist the long-term unemployed.",27
24,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,PAIRS," Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure now before the committee has expired. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Defence Proposed expenditure, $10,336,997,000.",28
25,Mr MACKELLAR,PAIRS,"We are discussing expenditure, as has just been outlined, of $10.3 billion. Of course, we do not have time in this consideration to go into the fine detail of that. It is sufficient history. to say, from my observations around Australia at the moment, that whilst the government over the past few years has put heavy emphasis on equipment purchases in the short, medium and long term, I think there has been an overemphasis on some areas in this expenditure to the detriment of proper policy in relation to service personnel. I am particularly concerned that we are reaching, or have already reached, a critical mass in terms of various elements within the armed services to the extent that the whole organisation of the armed services has now been reduced to a level which, if it is not already at danger point, is approaching it. I do not want to speak about that because, as I say, we do not have time in this consideration. There are two other more homely issues that I would like to raise. The first is a pat the back for the Department of Defence and the former Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. I refer to the restoration of the mast of HMAS Australia within my electorate, near Taronga Park Zoo. It is a very famous mast and, obviously, a very famous landmark on Sydney Harbour. . The mast is in a state of quite significant disrepair. Some former service personnel from the vessel got together and raised a great deal of money for the restoration of the mast. A great deal of money was contributed by private companies and the Department of Defence also got into the act and contributed money. As a result, we now have a fully restored mast which is of great national and historical significance to service personnel in Australia and which is also a fine landmark on Sydney Harbour. Having said that, I turn to another point which I would like the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and the department to look at closely. In my electorate we have the famous Australian School of Artillery on North Head. It is a fine group of buildingsa school with very significant historic traditions. During and before the Second World War, fortifications were erected on North Head which are, naturally, part of both Australia's military history and the national In the 1950s, the 9.2-inch guns which were present until that point were removed and sold for scrap. The fortifications could not be removed as they were literally dug into the ground and the rock, but the guns were removed and sold. In recent times the School of Artillery has put together a museum in the area and has also undertaken the· restoration of a large part of the historic fortifications of Sydney located on North Head. Recently I looked at the work that has been done. It is very largely advanced and it will be a significant tourist attraction in the area. It will also, as I have already mentioned, be of great historical interest from both the service personnel and national point of view. The only problem is that, because the guns on were sold for scrap in the 1950s, there is no gun of an appropriate size that can be located in the fortifications. This is obviously of very great detriment to the total attractiveness of the restoration of the feature, both from a historical point of view and from a-tourist attractiveness point of view. I mention this matter because there are two guns of the appropriate size that we know about. They are located about as far away as they possibly could be in Australia-on Rottnest Island off Western Australia. One of them has been restored on Rottnest Island and the other one-the one that I am interested in-has not been restored. I think it would be a magnificent gesture by those who are responsible for and have ownership of the guns on Rottnest Island if the unrestored gun were brought back to Sydney and placed in the appropriate location on North Head. It would not only be most effectively and lovingly restored, but also it would complete the restoration of the artillery situation that did obtain for so many years on North Head. I think this is possible. I know that the Royal Australian Artillery Historical Society is very anxious to take part in the return of the gun, but I do not know what its financial resources are. It may require additional resources to be made available by the Department of Defence. They certainly would not be great and there would be, of.course, a swap of some of the historical material that the society owns, so that it would not be all take and no give in relation to Rottnest Island. This national historic monument on North Head is a matter which is of significance to service history. I think it would be highly appropriate if the installation of a restored 9.2-inch gun on North Head could be achieved prior to the year 2000 Olympics in Sydney. It would round out the restoration of the area and provide a most interesting exhibit. It would be an attraction of significant interest both to locals and to international visitors. I commend that suggestion to the minister and the department to see whether we can bring it about.",28
26,Mr LES SCOTT,PAIRS,"Oxley) (11.38 a.m.)The matters that we are considering at the moment are the defence spending aspects of the budget. It is a very important part of the budget, particularly for my electorate. I would like to mention a few things in relation to the FIll aircraft. The budget provided for an $83.2 million increase in defence spending in 1993-94. Of course, the major item of expenditure is $78.3 million for the purchase of the FlllG aircraft from the United States. 1\vo FlllGs arrived at Amberley last Tuesday, 28 September. They were the first of the 15 being acquired from the United· States. The purpose of purchasing these aircraft is to extend the service of theRAAF's FIll fleet until the year 2020. This is an important acquisition as the FIll is widely renowned as perhaps the best bomber in the world. Indeed, there is no other bomber as good or as affordable currently in operation anywhere in the world. Moreover, Australia's flying and technical expertise has developed· around ·the FIll. It is only logical to stick with what we know, and they are a particularly good aircraft. However, it is essential that we continue to upgrade the FIll to ensure its continued viability over the coming decades. The FIlls form the)core of the offensive capability of the RAAF. It is therefore essential for Australia's FIlls to be state-of-the-art and equal to that of any other force in the world. The purchase of these FIlls from the United States ensures that. The agreement to purchase an additional 15 FIll aircraft from the United States is good news for RAAF base Amberley which is located in my electorate, as I am sure honourable members are well aware. The decision demonstrates the government's commitment to maintaining the FIll as an integral part of Australia's defence up until the year 2000 and beyond. The expansion of the FIll fleet is sure to benefit RAAF base Amberley, the home of the FIll in Australia, and the rest of the Ipswich region as well. A defence base certainly brings a lot of economic development to any region in which it is located. That is certainly the case with Amberley base. It will also ensure that Amberley will continue to make an important contribution to the Ipswich community and to the economic prosperity of the region for many years to come. It will be my pleasure to attend the Australian acceptance ceremony at RAAF base Amberley on Monday, 11 October, a ceremony which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) will also be attending to formally accept the FIll Gs from the United States on behalf of the Australian government. It is an important occasion for RAAF base Amberley to have both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence there, and I welcome their attendance. The purchase of additional FIlls from the United States would have been under threat had the opposition won the last election. During the election campaign, the then opposition defence spokesman, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), said that the deal would not go ahead under its defence policy because the aircraft did not meet Australia's defence requirements. That seems to conflict quite dramatically with the expert advice of members of the Defence Force. Statements made by the honourable member for Mayo on this matter indicated that the opposition was not serious about maintaining the FIll as an integral part of Australia's defence strategy, and that it was prepared to contemplate reducing Australia's defence capabilities in order to cut costs. During the campaign, clear divisions emerged between the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his defence spokesman over the purchase of the additional FIlls. In fact, after that statement from his defence spokesman to the effect that the coalition would not go ahead with the purchase of the extra FIlls from the United States because they did not meet our requirements, the Leader of the Opposition, during an unannounced photo opportunity·at the RAAF base Amberley, commented that the opposition's position on the proposed purchase might be reviewed. I suppose that if one sat in the cockpit of an FIll at Amberley, surrounded by RAAF personnel, one would sense the ability of this aircraft even without having the opportunity to fly in it. It was obviously a photo opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition used for campaign reasons more than anything else, but there was certainly conflict between him and his then spokesman on defence. Luckily, for the future of the FIll, those opposite were rejected by the Australian people at the last election, and the decision to purchase the 15 FlllGs from the United States went ahead-a decision which will certainly enhance the capabilities of our defence forces for many years to come. I turn to some other elements of the budget, particularly in relation to defence equipment and stores, areas in which the government has shown a very big commitment over recent years. Over the last six years, there has been a great deal of progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the 1987 defence white paper for key projects. One such project was the acquisition of the new Collins class submarines, the first of which has just been launched-I think that is the term. Both the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) and I took the opportunity to visit Adelaide and have a look at the Collins class submarines. They are certainly state-of-the - art vessels, and I imagine that the honourable member for Groom will also want to comment on them. Another venture-this one undertaken in conjunction with New Zealand-was the joint ANZAC frigates project. The significant feature of all these projects is that the work done on them has been undertaken by local contractors. At present, around 60 per cent of federal government spending on defence equipment and stores has been spent on equipment and stores produced in Australia. That is certainly a good thing in view of the Buy Australian campaign. It is something that I very much welcome. The government's efforts to increase the proportion of locally produced defence equipment and stores not only ensures greater defence self-reliance, it also makes good economic sense by creating opportunities for local manufacturers and suppliers. The government recognises its responsibility to encourage industries related to the development and production of defence stores and equipment. In this financial year, government support has included funding of $5.8 million for aerospace, $10.4 million for shipbuilding, and $19.9 million for munitions. A sum of $15 million has been allocated for development projects including the development of a support potential for the laser target designator rangefinder and equipment for the FA18 forward looking infra-red pods. The defence provisions of this bill ensure the continued development of defence self-reliance;-and the decision to purchase the 15 FlllGs from the United States will ensure that RAAF base Amberley, the home of the Flll, will continue to play an important role in the life of the Ipswich region for many years to come. Continued budget support for the Defence Housing Authority reflects this government's commitment to looking after the needs of Defence Force personnel. On Monday this week, together with the local regional manager of the Defence Housing Authority in my electorate, David Andrew, I had the opportunity to look at some of the housing being completed around that area now. It is obviously very high quality housing, which is important because we need to look after our Defence Force personnel. I thank the Defence Housing Authority for the courtesy they extended to me on Monday. The Defence Housing Authority has been undertaking major works for defence personnel of RAAF base Amberley over recent years. Major projects under way include the new Heritage Heights estate, which I visited on Monday, and a $31 million development at Flinders View in Ipswich. The housing development at Flinders View will be completed in late 1997 and includes the provision of 550 residential allotments incorporating both detached and medium density housing. Of these houses, 180 will be offered to service personnel and their families, while remaining 360 lots will be offered for sale to private purchasers. The development will replace existing housing in the Amberley area and is in line with the federal government's commitment to improving the standard of accommodation for defence personnel and their families. The development will also include community and commercial facilities as considered necessary in the context of the overall development. The project will not only mean more modem housing for defence personnel, but will also free existing housing for the use of low income families by returning the housing to the control of the state government, which had,been operating under the joint Commonwealth-state housing agreement for many years. The redevelopment of existing housing stock for this purpose is also under way at Leichhardt, a suburb near the Amberley air force base. The privatisation of off-base housing stock is a key part of the government's strategy in relation to defence housing and will yield $60 million this financial year and a further $120 million over the next two financial years. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to support the matter before the parliament today in relation to defence spending in the budget. I am sure that the expenditure, particularly relation to the FIlls and the defence housing areas, is going to be of great assistance to Australia's Defence Force for many years and also in maintaining or improving the housing for our defence personnel. I commend the proposed expenditure to the committee.",30
27,Mr TAYLOR,PAIRS,"Groom) (11.48 a.m.)Whilst I do not agree with the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) in terms of the opposition's lack of commitment in the defence area, I do agree with him in relation to the FlllG acquisition strategy. Having only returned at the weekend from two or three weeks in Asia, I believe that we should make no apology as a nation for our strategic assets. One of the important strategic assets that this country has is the FIll force. I am very pleased that the FIll force is being enhanced the in the way that the honourable member for Oxley has referred to. I also believe, as he does, that it is important for us to understand the strategic value of the submarine force. Again, our regional neighbours should accept that fact provided that what we are doing in the strategic area is readily transparent. It is pretty clear from statements by our defence ministers that they are cooperating with our regional neighbours in those strategic areas. As the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKellar) has said, $10.3 billion is a very substantial amount. That is what is before us this morning in these budget papers. In terms of the 1987 defence white paper, these budget papers set in place a program for the long-term development of the Australian Defence Force. Unfortunately, those budget papers do not indicate that the white paper strategy was based on defence spending increases of three per cent per year between 1987 and 1992. That is perhaps more important than the original situation. This chamber should understand that it is history that in 1991, as a result of the force structure review, the three per cent growth figure was revised down to zero growth as the best to be hoped for under the budgetary circumstances. The force structure review said that with zero growth about three-quarters of the defence white paper's goals could be in achieved. But the force structure review also went on to say that, if we had real cuts of one per cent per annum, then less than half of the white paper's program could be funded. That is exactly what we have reflected in these budget papers today. We have a 2.25 per cent, or $237 million, cut in real terms over the next four years. That is translated into a 0.75 per cent reduction in 1993-94 and a 0.5 per cent reduction in the out years until 1996-97. Hence I am not surprised that within these papers we find a series of program deferrals-whether they be light armoured vehicles for the army, or forward looking infra-red radar for the navy Sea Hawks, cetera. It is very unfortunate that the governraised ment has decided to cancel the helicopter support ship project. That is a retrograde If we do not watch ourselves, we may very well find ourselves embarrassed-as potentialwithout ly we were during the Fijian situation a few years ago. I ask the government to reconsider that decision. It is very important at this point that the government understand-and, indeed, everybody in this chamber understand-the importance of the current strategic review which is being carried out as a replacement for the ASP '90 document within the Department of Defence and· in the wider context of a new defence white paper. Both of those reviews are absolutely critical to the question of national security viability into the future. was the first point I wanted to make. As a result of these papers I am concerned about morale. As the honourable member for Warringah alluded to, there are some probwhether lems in the ADF community. Those problems have been exacerbated in recent weeks by some previous legislation which has been through this place, which is still before other place, and which will be the subject of a Senate standing committee review on Friday. I refer to the Social Security Legislaarmament tion Amendment Bill (No.2), which deals with the fringe benefits area and is inextriarmament cably fused with conditions of service in ADF. I hope that as a result of that Senate committee meeting on Friday the conditions of service aspect of that social security amendment bill will be recognised legislation amended to recognise the fact that defence force personnel are receiving some those payments directly as a result of their conditions of service and not as fringe efits, as the umbrella legislation refers Those payments certainly are not fringe benefits, and I hope the Senate view will reflect that. The second point is a more specific comwithin plaint. It was raised in my electorate only Monday. It relates to the residual force Cambodia. I ask the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker), who is at the table, to take a number of these things on notice for the et appropriate defence minister. The concern on the telephone to me on Monday was about the financial conditions of service for step. that residual element, which we will be leaving behind for some time in Cambodia the protection of the wider Australian force. My informant, who happened to be the wife of one of those men remaining behind, was deeply concerned about the financial implications and the increased risks that her . husband would be enduring as a result of that residual commitment. I hope the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner) will look very carefully at the conditions of service for that residual force. I have a couple of other points that I would like to raise and I will perhaps place on notice our questions for the ministers. These refer to That three areas in the Sydney region. One relates to Cockatoo Island. I noticed that there was a comment that there will be no sale proceeds in the financial year 1993-94 because of a range of legal issues and so on. I wonder the minister might make some statement as to what those legal problems were, what the problems, if any, were with the New South Wales government, and why no sale the proceeds are expected in 1993-94. The second point relates to the Newington depot. The comment that I read was that the sale of part of the Newington depot in Sydney was on hold the pending the outcome of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games bid. That bid has been decided, and I hope the minister is now in a position to give a more specific comment on and the the Newington depot. Another point relates to the ANZAC rifle of range. I read a comment that there were a number of legal and other difficulties which benwould be actively pursued in 1993-94. What to. are those legal problems? When are we going to get on and do something about the rifle committee's range at Malabar? The final point is a more specific one my electorate. It relates to the transfer on of the ADF helicopter school to the army in aviation centre at Oakey. That transfer has been deferred beyond 1996, closer to the tum of the century. I hope the minister will reconsider that transfer on the basis of environmental and operational needs in carrying on that school at Fairbairn;. whereas Oakey is ready and can carry out, with capital improvements, that very vital task. I want to finish with some congratulations. Firstly, I congratulate Lieutenant-General Sanderson for the great work that he has done in Cambodia. Secondly, I extend my very personal congratulations to my brother Rod who, the minister announced last Friday, will be the new Chief of Naval Staff from March· next year. I congratulate him on behalf of the family. My only regret is that my late father is not here to do the same. I also congratulate the present Chief of Naval Staff, a close friend of mine, Vice-Admiral MACDougall, who has done a great job for the naval service and for the Australian Defence Force.

28,Unknown,PAIRS,"Sitting suspended from 11.59 a.m. to 3 p.m. NA NA Mr TIM FlSCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia)- Mr Speaker, as a matter of courtesy, I inform the House that the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, the honourable member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, and other honourable. members are attending the funeral of the New South Wales State President of the Liberal Party, Mr Bevan Bradbury, in Sydney this afternoon. I will be the acting leader for the period. NA Question Time",34
29,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yesterday, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) asked me in the first part of a fourPl,lrt question whether it was the first time my career as Speaker that I had seen question time terminated after 25 minutes. I answered no, because on 27 May this year question time was terminated immediately by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). I also agreed to respond to his questions regarding previous experiences in respect of the termination of question time. My research, in fact, has indicated that between November 1974 and August 1988, when this building was occupied, there were 10 occasions when question time ran for 25 minutes or less. For example, on 16 October 1975, it lasted three minutes; on 14 November 1978, it lasted eight minutes 30 seconds; and on 28 April 1988, it was terminated after 14 minutes",34
30,Unknown,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Government members interjecting,34
31,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I suggest that honourable members listen to the rest of the statement. Since August 1988 there have been two occasions when question time lasted less than 25 minutes. On 14 May 1990, it was terminated after 12 minutes; and, as has already been indicated, it was not proceeded with on 27 May this year. Yesterday also highlighted what I think some might describe as some of the less attractive aspects of proceedings in this House. Some time ago I indicated to honourable members that improvement in their own standards of behaviour was entirely their responsibility. In effect, the Speaker has the responsibility of administering the standing orders fairly to ensure the business of the parliament can be conducted effectively and efficiently. Whilst I realise that. recently the opposition has had few opportunities to put forward propositions of its own, the reality is that the government, for its own reasons, has chosen not to allow this course of action. Similarly, whilst some honourable members may not like or agree with an answer to a question, nevertheless, a minister is entitled to be heard in relative silence. Equally, though, honourable members may feel that they are entitled to a response from a minister which meets the spirit of standing order 145 and which is not excessively long. Despite the discretion which the chair endeavours to in exercise from time to time, the standing orders and practice of the House do not vest sufficient authority in the Speaker to enable the chair to enforce greater control in relation to answers. However, this does not provide an excuse for honourable members on both sides to offend standing orders, particularly standing order 55, which provides for members to be heard without interruption; standing order 98, which refers to points of order; and standing order 303, concerning disorderly conduct I warn honourable members that the chair will not tolerate repeated infringements of these and other standing orders and will move to name members without warning if such behaviour persists. NA Budget: Taxation Measures Mr COSTELLOI direCt my question to the Minister for Finance. YeSterday, before he was so rudely interrupted by the Prime Minister, he was invited to defend his August 1981 statement as shadow Treasurer opposing sales tax budget measures. He said: ... the Opposition is implacably opposed to these measures ... they will have an adverse effect on the living standards of Australian families, affect the equity of the tax system in quite a regressive way and they will most certainly add to the inflation rate. I ask the minister again today: does he (a) concede that there is no convention against an opposition opposing budget tax measures or (b) support the Prime Minister's contention that voting against regressive and inflationary taxes is rewriting conventions?",34
32,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honourable member, can I say that we all know that there is a convention in relation to budget tax measures. We also ,,11 know that there have been breaches of that convention committed by both sides of the House over the years. However, there has never been a breach of the substance of the opposition's in· relation to this year's budget. That is the reality of the situation. The convention is important. It has been breached by the opposition in relatively, although not entirely, minor ways since this government has been in office. But never during our period in government or, indeed, prior to that, has there been an attempt by an opposition to block such a substantial part of tax measures as has been proposed by the opposition in this year's budget debate. That is a very important point to make at the outset. The action taken by the opposition in relation to this year's budget is entirely different from that taken in 1981 in a number of respects. The first difference to which I would point is the magnitude of the measures that the opposition is attempting to block. In 1981 we opposed less than 1.5 per cent of tax revenue, and in the end only $132 million, or 0.3 per cent, was rejected by the Senate. This year the opposition is talking about the rejection of 1.5 per cent of revenue for this year, but $3 billion, or around 2.5 per cent of revenue, by 1996-97. This is at a time when the deficit reduction strategy is seen by financial analysts and economists, in this country and internationally, to be an extremely important part of fiscal policy. So, the dimensions are different. I notice that members of the opposition, being somewhat sensitive on this point, are they will now arguing through the shadow Treasurer that we really should not worry about that too much because, taking the express views of the Democrats and the Greens into account, only about $140 million worth of tax measures are at stake. The opposition is really saying, 'We want to oppose all these things, but we will be saved from our folly by the Greens and the Democrats because they will not support us'. What a pathetic line of argument that is! The opposition has a position that it is strongly advocating, but it says that we need not worry about it because the country will be saved from the effects of the implementation of its policy by the Greens and the Democrats. What a pathetic line of argument! The second point I would like to make concerns the change in the nature of the economy since 1981. This is a very significant and important point. The fact is that the economy now is a much more open, deregulated economy than it was in 1981 and, in those circumstances, particularly with a floating exchange rate, we are under intense international scrutiny each day in a way that was never the case in 1981. Of course, we were looked at in 1981, but not in the intense way that financial markets daily look at us now. The opposition knows that to be the case. Opposition members-Oh!",35
33,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite can say, 'Oh!', but the fact is that they know that to be the case. I can assure those opposite that the actions they are taking do have, and will continue to have as long as they pursue them, a damaging effect on the exchange rate. I was in New York a few days ago, talking to people who make investment decisions, and they told me that this issue is a factor in the devaluation of the Australian dollar. It is not the only factor, but it is a factor. The tion should know that the action it is taking here is action which is daily having an impairing effect on the value of the Australian dollar. It also has an adverse effect on the willingtion ness of international investors to invest in Australia generally because it erodes a sense of business confidence. Investors are not sure that our fiscal policy is as much under control as they would like it to be. Generally, they are very supportive of the deficit reduction program. Action which is taken to impair that program is seen as action adversely affecting confidence in the Australian economy and damaging to the willingness of investors to invest here. The opposition is deliberately taking action which is daily having these sorts of effects. Yet the opposition stands around here as though this is not a factor to take into account-as though it is a matter of no importance. The opposition is engaging in action that will produce an outcome that it totally opposes. I make the point that I made yesterdayMr Tim Fischer-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. We heard your answer at the start of question time in which you made specific reference to answers to questions not being excessively long. I believe you should be assisted by ministers, notwithstanding the standing order difficulties, and should invite the minister to wind up, in the circumstances.",36
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I also suggested that the answers which ministers give be relevant to the specific issues asked about. From what I am hearing from the minister so far that is the case, but I am also cognisant of the time. I am watching the clock-and I ask the minister to draw his answer to a conclusion.",36
35,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will do so in a moment; but I will just make the final point that members of the opposition are taking action to produce an outcome which is perverse to that which they say should be the case. Their action could increase the size of the deficit, while at the same time they are arguing that deficits should be substantially lower. Not just for this year, but for subsequent years, they opposiwill produce a higher deficit than would otherwise be the case, when in other arguments they say we should be producing lower deficits. It is a totally perverse action by an opposiwhich is just out to wreck and damage rather than to take a responsible position in this parliament. That was not the case in 1981. At that time the then opposition took the view that the budget outcome proposed by the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong, for a surplus of $1 112 billion was a wrong outcome in the context of the economy at that time-which was about to turn into recession. We believed it was an inappropriate review of fiscal policy to have a lower deficit. The fact that our action would have led to a higher deficit, if it had been fully supported by the Senate, was not against our view of appropriate economic policy. The circumstances that followed showed that we were right. Mabo",36
36,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he tell the House of the results of meetings he and the government have held recently in an effort to achieve a just and lasting response for all Australians to the High Court's Mabo judgment?,36
37,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Most members of this House would accept that Mabo amounts to the most important change to Australian land law since Federation. It gives the country a great opportunity to right a wrong, to effect a basis of repossession of the country for and by Aboriginal people, long dispossessed of land which they traditionally held. That core sense of Mabo and the core reason that the High Court, I think, overturned the concept of terra nullius, the land of no-one, in righting the wrong and repairing the fiction that there was not native title and custom that should be a core contribution to our common law. That is what the High Court has decided. Mr Reith-It wasn't repossession; it was continuing possession.",36
38,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you were dispossessed you would say you were repossessing it, would you not? Mr Reith-It would not be native title.",37
39,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I say to the honourable member for Flinders that the Prime Minister does not need his help.,37
40,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know you are the shadow minister for bashing blacks. That is your role. Opposition members-Withdraw that.,37
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will withdraw.,37
42,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is nothing but vociferous anti-Aboriginal interests coming from,37
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask you to withdraw.,37
44,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, if he objects to that I will withdraw it. We have an opportunity to put together what I think is a land- in the day. mark piece of legislation. Over the last few months we have continued a dialogue with the states and, on and off, with various segments of the Aboriginal community. A press report last week said that the government was prepared to concede a number of points to the states to get a deal. That report was erroneous. I made it clear that the Commonwealth had already informed the states that any attempt to. water down the principles of our proposed legislation would be rejected. Mr Reith-You did a bit of watering down over the weekend.",37
45,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is that right? Mr Reith-Yes, in your Caucus.",37
46,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the cap fits, wear it. The states have come back to us on these is the issues. The Commonwealth has obviously always seen the very clear role the states play in land management in this country. We do not manage land; states manage land, by and large. We manage land in the ACT and in Commonwealth territories but no further. But we also have a clear responsibility for the advancement and welfare of Aboriginal people, which was given to the Commonwealth parliament by the nation at the referendum in 1967. So there are trade-offs here between the Commonwealth's prerogatives and responsibilities in Aboriginal policy and the role of the states in land management. We have been talking to the states, and we have been talking to the Aboriginal community. It is possible, in a configuration of measures, to get a bill which actually serves all the principles of justice for Aboriginal people, which provides an effective system qf land management for the country and which the states can involve themselves in. Mr Tim Fischer-This is his statesmanship approach.",37
47,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A little bit of statesmanship over there would not hurt either, Tim. Opposition members can never rise to the occasion, no matter what it is. I met Premier Kennett this morning, and I told him what I thought the outstanding issues were. He has gone away to consider some of those issues and, as a consequence, we will talk again later I think there is a very clear opportunity here to actually set up a regime which Aboriginal people think is fair and just to their interests. The regime will involve participation on their part, as they have a right to be asked about the economic use of their land. The regime would serve to protect native title so there would be no mass extinguishments of native title, so much of it having already been extinguished. In the processes of hearing and awarding native title, there should be a proper assessment of the economic use of land-a proper tribunal process of evaluation. In the end, though, the ministers of the various states will have the capacity to override a particular development in the event of its being in the best interests of the states or of the nation. In all of those things we think that a balance can be met, but it means the states Will have to give some ground. It will mean the Aboriginal community will need to accept a role for the states in some areas. In all of these things it should be possible, nevertheless, to develop a highly principled piece of legislation that is better than most things we do in this parliament-in fact, something that will stand the test of time over a very long period. . The cabinet is meeting on this this afternoon. We are reaching the point now where we are running up against the deadline for introducing this bill to the parliament. If we do not have a couple of weeks to clear up drafting instructions for the parliamentary draftsmen, it will not be possible to have a bill introduced this side of Christmas. I think it is important that the bill be introduced this side of Christmas. This is not an issue that ought to be allowed to leach out so that everyone will be tearing and ripping away at it over the next year. We should consolidate these principles for the interests of everybody. So I make the point that we will remain with an open mind on states interests, but the states have also got to understand that the Commonwealth has a clear responsibility to Aboriginal people. The Aboriginal community itself has to recognise some of the imperatives of the states in the economic and land ,management systems of this country. I think all of those things together will give us the capacity to pull together the threads of a very sophisticated and, in a technical sense, complicated bill-but complicated only for the reason that it needs to cover so many interests so persuasively and sympathetically. We stand very much on the threshold of doing some primary thing in a good way to deal with reconciliation between non-Abpriginal Australians and Aboriginal Australians. The vehicles of the repossessing of land and social justice for those who cannot avail themselves of Mabo through other devices for the getting and acquisition of land are all the things which I think are available here and at stake. This is a critical time, and I certainly hope that the parties in the chamber can understand the weight of the issues and the fact that ground may have to be given on points. That is just as true for the states as it is true for the Aboriginal community and all the factions therein. Budget: Taxation Measures",37
48,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Given the fact that the minister led the successful defeat of budget tax bills for the then opposition in 1981, does this mean that he breached a serious convention of the House, as the Prime Minister maintains, and miscalculated by winning the vote, thereby breaching the convention asserted by the Leader of the House on the ABC PM program last night that an opposition can vote against a budget bill only when it knows it is not going to win? I ask the minister whether he opposed retrospective and regressive taxes and breached no convention, as he asserted at the time.,",38
49,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the simplest way to answer that question is to refer the honourable member to my previous answer. Economy: Growth,38
50,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen recent statements to the effect that lower economic growth will lead to an increase in the budget deficit? On what basis were the growth forecasts included in the current budget?,38
51,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prior to the finalisation of the budget the Treasury develops forecasts of what is likely to happen in the Australian economy in terms of the rate of growth, the likely inflation developments, the rate of growth of employment, and so on. In making those forecasts for the current financial year, the Treasury takes into account its own ideas of what is happening in not only the Australian economy but also the world economy and takes notice of what organisations such as the OECD and the IMF are saying about what is happening in the world, particularly the industrialised world, which is such an important determinant of world growth. In the preparation of this year's budget, the Treasury was aware of the fact that those major international organisations have been progressively downgrading their estimates of growth in the industrialised economies. So the Treasury decided to take a very cautious view of what was happening in relation to those international economic developments. In recent times the OECD has produced a new set of forecasts for world growth and has once again reduced its estimates for the year 1994. In doing so, it has now brought its own forecasts of world growth closer to the Treasury's own estimates of what it e'xpects will happen in the world and the likely impact on Australian growth in the current financial year. So, in a sense, the decision of the government, based on the advice of the Treasury, to take a very cautious view of growth in the Australian economy, based as it is on, again, a cautious estimate of what is happening in growth in the industrialised world, I think has been justified. I notice that the honourable member for Mayo leapt upon this revelation from the OECD on 1 October to say that this reduction in the OECD estimate of world growth imperilled the budget estimates. As I have explained, it does not because the Treasury was, in a sense, a step ahead of the OECD in its assessment of what was happening in the world economy and the effect on the Australian economy and, therefore, on the budget. The honourable member for Mayo went on to make this astonishing declaration: Lower economic growth will inevitably lead to a major increase in Budget deficits up to 199697 "" . He goes on to say that as a result of that the deficit target proposed by the government for the year 1996-97 will not be achieved; indeed, he says that the government will be forced to abandon that target. He goes on to say: Abandonment of this important target is have a major and detrimental impact on confidence in the Australian economy. There is one set of decisions and one set of actions which are more likely than anything else to imperil the achievement of that deficit target in 1996-97. It has got nothing to do with the OECD growth estimates, it has got nothing to do with those forecasts in' the budget, it has got everything to do with the attitude of the opposition, both here and in the Senate. It is the opposition which has decided-- ' M .. Downer-- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: coming back to your remarks at the beginning of' question time today, this was clearly a question about the OECD growth estimates, not a question about the coalition or anything else.",38
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-You have made your point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Downer--It would help the decorum of the House if the minister answered the question.,39
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-Resume your seat. You have made your point of order. The Treasurer is in order as he was asked to look at growth forecasts and the effect that they would have on the Australian economy.,39
54,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-The actions of the opposition are not about abandoning a deficit target--because it is yet to embrace one--but an attempt to undermine the government's sensible, credible, responsible deficit target for 1996-97. The effect of what the opposition is proposing to do in the Senate is to increase the deficit in 1996-97 by a massive $3 billion. Yet it is the architect of that policy, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo, who says in this press release he put out on 1 October: Abandonment of this important targetthat is the target which the government has set of a little over one per cent of GDP for 1996-97-is likely to have a major and detrimental impact on confidence in the Australian economy. likely to Therefore, condemned out of their own mouth, members of the opposition are about a strategy, about a set of tactics; about a set of actions which are deliberately designed to have a detrimental impact on confidence in the Australian economy. The opposition should be rightly condemned for this anti-Australian attitude. Fuel Excise",39
55,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it is totally untrue",40
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo will resume his seat. There are fonns in which questions can be asked in this place and I have repeatedly said to members of the opposition: you will come to the microphone and ask your question. You will ask your question.,40
57,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration tabled in the Senate today which called on the government to accept or introduce needed amendments to the budget fuel excise increase. Without abusing any of its members, particularly the three Labor senators, will the Treasurer take the advice of this committee and make yet another change to this budget by amending the fuel excise increases?",40
58,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members of the opposition have been instrumental in having many of the budget measures referred to S-nate committees. I do not quite know why they have bothered to have these matters referred to committees because they have already declared in advance of any consideration by these Senate committees that they are going to impose these measures in any event. What they are now portraying is some deliberate and serious consideration by some Senate committee of these matters but they have already declared long ago, weeks ago, the fact that they intended to vote against any of these measures. The opposition simply cannot be taken seriously in any of these matters. tion cannot say that it is seriously interested in some of the minutia of these matters when at the same time it has declared its opposition not just to the whole bulk of the revenue raising measures but to the government's total budget strategy. As the opposition has become fascinated by history, I want to read a few words to the honourable member for Mayo in answer to his question about budget changes. Mr Downer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: this was a question about the Labor senators arguing for amendments to the fuel excise proposal.",40
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The point of order should be based on relevance. Mr Downer-The question had nothing to do with the opposition. I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to uphold the quite clear standing order of relevance to ensure the House behaves with the proper decorum.",40
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question related to a Senate committee and a report that it brought down relating to budget measures. The Treasurer is answering that question, and he will answer the question.",40
61,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This goes to the question of budget changes and the budget strategy. Let me quote: I cannot think of anything more likely to reverse the very encouraging signs that have emerged in recent weeks on the interest rate front than a major departure from the thrust of the Budget strategy. Any fragmentation of that strategy, any suggestion that the deficit will be greater than what in fact was budgeted for, runs the risk of disturbing the very favourable trends that have developed on the interest rate front in recent weeks. The author of those remarks may well have been talking about the improvements in relation to lO-year bonds in Australia on the financial markets. In fact, these remarks were made on 14 October 1981 by the then Treasurer John Howard when there was some criticism about his budget. So I do not intend to take seriously the observations of the honourable member for Mayo when he has not only already declared himself to be opposed to the bulk of these measures but also decided that he will attack the budget strategy and attack the Australian The opposi- economy as a result. Asia: Exports",40
62,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Resources. The minister will probably recall the· twitterings from the opposition spokesman on resources in recent times. Can the minister inform the House whether there is evidence that Australia will benefit from increased exports of resources to the Asian region, particularly the rapidly growing Chinese economy? Would the minister like to cast a little sUnshine by telling us just how this will benefit the investment outlook in Australia? .",40
63,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question.,41
64,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,41
65,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This might be an opportunity for those opposite to learn something, so they should listen.",41
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister might not respond to interjections, and members on my left will cease interjecting.",41
67,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The problem is that they do not like good news, Mr Speaker. Even amongst the dynamic Asian economies, China with an economic growth of 13 per cent last year is a market that offers tremendous potential for Australia. Australia is already a very significant supplier of raw materials to China, last year exporting more. than 14 million tonnes of iron ore worth $430 million. It is clear from my recent discussions· with Vice-Premier Li-no relation-that China is planning an ambitious expansion of its steel production facilities from the current level of 80 million tonnes to 100 million tonnes by the year 2000. China could need to import up to 50 million tonnes of iron ore by the year 2000 and Australia, as a competitive and reliable supplier of iron ore, is ideally placed to meet that need. I have informed the Chinese that major Australian iron ore suppliers are very interested in transporting and selling iron ore into their market, with the possibility of another joint venture such as Channar which may be in the interests of both China and Australia. I am advised that later this week the Anshan steelworks in China and Australia's Portland mining company will finalise a deal to eXJ]ort two million tonnes of iron ore each year to China. Anshan steelworks is also planned to expand by the year 2000 to an annual production of more than 10 million tonnes. So it is clear that there are opportunities for Australia in that steelworks as well. There are also opportunities for Australia's coal producers in increasing exports to China. Australia already exports coking coal to China. The giant Baoshan steelworks has already taken more than half a million tonnes of Australian coking coal this year. Production at this steelworks is also expected to increase by 50 per cent by the year 2000. I say to those honourable members who represent the Hunter Valley and Queensland who wish to ensure that we also export steaming \. coal to China that there are also opportunities for Australia to boost its exports of steaming coal to this market. It is clear there is potential for Australia to export up to ;>even million tonnes a year of steaming coal to China by the year 2000, for the simple reason that while China may be the world's largest producer of coal, most of China's coal production is in the far north-west of the country and it will have great difficulty in transporting its coal down to the southern. and coastal provinces where there are the greatest rates of economic growth. Currently, China imposes a tariff of 15 per cent on imported coal. Australia and me, as Minister for Resources, have been keen to encourage the Chinese to look at opening up their market to not only Australia but other coal producers. I am pleased that in the last few days China has indicated that it will be adopting a more open market approach to coal use in that country, which is a good thing for Australia. It is something the opposition, I would hope, would join me in supporting. While this points to very strong prospects for increased exports of our resources to China and while the government is seeking to encourage investment and jobs, the opposition seems to be pursuing a very different strategy. Mr Thckey-We are into value adding.",41
68,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Perhaps the honourable member might speak to the shadow minister for resources because he does not seem to be into much value adding. Only two days ago the shadow minister for resources put out a press statementGovernment members-Who is he?,41
69,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Gippsland.,41
70,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister does not need the help of those on my right.,41
71,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can understand why honourable members might not know who he is. He has not had a chance to ask me a question yet, but I am sure one day he will get a chance to throw up a question on resources. In the meantime, he has to put out press releases. This is what a preSs release put out two days ago by the honourable member claimed: The mining industry faced an investment drought. He said Australia threatened to develop a high risk reputation as a site f9r new investment in mining ventures. He then went on the warpath about Mabo. Those sorts of views are not restricted to the shadow minister for resources-the Jurassic Park branch of the opposition. We also have views put out such as those of the Leader of the Opposition, who said that the Mabo decision was having 'a very significant negative effect on the investment climate'. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say: There is no confidence in mining. Nobody is going to run out and put a dollar into the mining today. That is what the Leader of the Opposition is doing. Together with you, you are seeking to talk down investment in the mining industry and talk down job growth.",42
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I take it that when the minister was saying 'you', he was referring to somebody on the other side of the House and not me.",42
73,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am referring to the honourable member for Gippsland. I hate to disappoint the opposition, but that is just not the truth. The mining industry is investing and it is investing today. Last week's ABS figures show that the mining industryMr Tim Fischer-In Chile.",42
74,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just listen and you will learn something about how much the mining industry is investing in Australia today. Last week's ABS figures demonstrate that the mining industry has spent over $170 million on mineral exploration in the June quarter, which was 41 per cent up on the previous quarter. Mr Snowdon-How much?",42
75,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is 41 per cent up on the previous quarter. It is· not just the mining industry, either. The oil industry spent over $600 million on oil exploration in 1992-93-a 29 per cent increase on the previous year. Both of those increases come at a time when international commodity prices are low and at a time when there is stiff competition from other countries for exploration dollars. I am sure the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was pleased to learn that on Monday of this week, the very day on which the shadow minister put out his press release-great timing!-the North West Shelf partners announced the go-ahead for the $1 billion Wanaea offshore oil and gas project off Western Australia. That was $1 billion in investment announced on the day that the shadow minister put out his press release. It was good timing; we have to give him that. This is a project that offers significant involvement for foreign investors, such as Shell, BP, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Chevron, and industry Australian companies, such as BHP Petroleum. By their commitment to this project, they have demonstrated that they are prepared to place a vote of confidence in Australia, unlike the opposition. The project will also improve our balance of payments situation because, when production starts in 1995, $440 million a year in peak years will go towards our balance of payments, and over 500 jobs will be created. So it is not just the North West Shelf that will be affected. ' Mr Speaker, as the honourable member for Cunningham, you would know that there are jobs in Port Kembla today because of new investment in Bass Strait. There is a clear choice: a government that is seeking to encourage investment and job growth, or an opposition that is seeking to talk the country down. Victoria: Flooding",42
76,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would be aware of the devastating floods in north-east Victoria, which are the worse on record and which have been described by the State Emergency Service as the worse natural disaster since Ash Wednesday. But is the Prime Minister aware that more than 2,000 people have been forced from their homes in cities such as Benalla and Wangaratta? Is he aware that cities such as Shepparton and Echuca are being threatened by the floods from the 12 rivers that have burst their banks? Is he aware that more than 3,000 homes and shops have been affected and that people h-ve been devastated by the loss? Would the Prime Minister be prepared to visit north-east Victoria to inspect the devastation and to meet some of the people? Would the Prime Minister be prepared to join with the leaders of the Liberal and National parties, who will be visiting the area on Friday, and come forward with a package that will help the state and the people in those areas to with the devastating losses?",42
77,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"lam indeed well aware of the devastation which the floods have brought. It is one of the perverse things about this country: in one place or another, we are either in a drought or in a flood. Whichever occurs, great hardship is the consequence, as we saw in New Squth Wales and Queensland just a year or so ago. I have been kept apprised of what has happened in Victoria and have inquired again about the relief arrangements that the Commonwealth can make through the national disaster relief program. That program provides for fifty-fifty funding on emergency spending, support by the army in particular places, and the normal funding arrangements that exist under the Commonwealth-state arrangements to ameliorate the costs of a situation like this. It is sad but true, I suppose, that in many respects a great burden of the cost of these disasters is borne by the individuals themselves over time. One can never fully compensate for the loss of valuables or personal effects and. the other things whiCh affect people. I had thought of going there in the middle of this week, but with the President of Chile here today, the Mabo legislation and the budget discussions going on in the Senate, it was not possible to leave. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is going there tomorrow to see things at first hand, to take stock of what has happened, and to let me know the situation. If I have an opportunity to visit, then I certainly will. Regional Development",43
78,Mr CUNNINGHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Can the minister inform the House of the time frame within which· the regional development task force will report to government? Will the minister inform the House on responses to the Industry Commission's report on impediments to regional industry adjustment? Mr GRIFF1THS-As honourable members are aware, the honourable member for MCMillan, through his participation in the cope caucus committee on regional development, has shown a very strong interest in issues relating to regional Australia. The regional development task force, headed by Mr Bill Kelty, has already visited the majority of regions of Australia. I am advised that either Mr Kelty or .members of that committee will complete that task by 10 December this year. For the information of honourable members: today I have also announced a major study on what encourages business to locate to regional Australia; that is, what investment issues are of relevance to Australian business when it makes decisions to 'relocate to regional Australia. That issue is very much at the heart of regional policy in so far as if the economics and the business in regional Australia are right then a lot of the other problems or challenges that we have will tend to resolve themselves. Emanating from the release of the Industry Commission's draft report on impediments to regional industry adjustment, there has been a lot of debate-and that is not an unhealthy thing. But it is interesting to note some of the initial responses. For example, the contribution of the honourable member for Maranoa on that particular report was: It .prohibits the downward flexibility needed to preserve regional employment. In that context the honourable member for Maranoa was supporting the apparent conclusion of the Industry Commission report that there was a need to cut wages in regional Australia as a necessary condition precedent to the region's success. The honourable member for Bennelong also indicated similar thoughts. He said: The Ie report has effectively endorsed the principles of the coalition's industrial relations policy. The Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, in the context of social security, also weighed in. He implied that the social security system in not utilising the mechanism of cutting social security benefits was preventing people moving around or out of regional Australia. ' So there have been a number of responses by opposition members here; but even these stand in stark contrast to the views of the Kennett government in Victoria. The minister responsible for regional development policy in Victoria, Mr Hallam, in answer to a question in the House last week, when he was asked whether in terms of regional Australia it would be more appropriate for the wages system to be based on a national wage fixing system, effectively endorsed that approach in his answer. He said-and I make the observation in fairness. - that he was not familiar with the report in its entirety, but he had seen. a summary of the major findings, He also said:  categorical undertaking that the finding that he has put to the House is not supported by my department or by the government. Even the Victorian government, the Kennett government, is not prepared to go as far as embracing a policy approach that is about cutting wages. Would honourable members believe that it is cutting social security benefits as an excuse for regional development policy? Enterprise Bargai)'ling",43
79,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I remind the minister that on 21 April this year in a speech to the Institute of Company Directors the Prime Minister said: Let me describe t\le model. of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitrary tribunals. Can the minister explain how he intends to achieve that objective when 70 per cent of the private sector work force which is not unionised will now have access.to enterprise agreements only through award flexibility clauses where unions have the right to intervene? Is this not one more example of the Prime Minister raising community expectations and being unable to deliver them?,44
80,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for the opportunity to put him and the House straight as to how the government proposes to proceed in respect of freeing up the labour market by encouraging enterprise agreements throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Everything that the Prime Minister said in April-and indeed everything that I have said in each of five speeches outlining the government's progress on this package-will be fully complied with in the end result. The honourable member for La Trobe has suggested that 70 per cent of the Australian work force will be prevented from entering into enterprise agreements because they are not in unions. The fact is that the opposite is the case: they will be allowed to enter into agreements, and they will be allowed to enter into agreements that are strictly controlled to ensure that we do' not get the sorts of outcomes that those opposite and their colleagues in the states would have. It is worthwhile to recall the words of the honourable member in the question that he has just asked, when he repeated what the Prime Minister has said about an arbitral safety net. The arbitral safety net, as we said in April and we have said every month since, is the award system. That is the great difference between us and those opposite. We believe in the award system and we believe that it should be the compulsory underpinning of enterprise bargains. On the other hand, those opposite say, 'Let's abolish awards and . let's godown to minimum standards'. We have said that we are all about flexibility, but . we want flexibility upwards, not downwards. Mr Speaker, the best way of giving you the difference between our approach and the approach of those opposite is to look at what has happened in the· last two months in Western Australia where a conservative state government has introduced arrangements for minimum standards that do not involve compulsory award underpinning. The Western Australian minister has set the minimum wage in Western Australia at $275 per week. This is how the minister, Graham Kierath, addressed it in his press release of 26 August 1993: New employees who fear that an employer might offer them bare conditions available under the Minimum Conditions of Employment Bill, that is his new actincluding a wage rate of $275 per week, will always have the right of refusal. In other words, take the contract or take the sack. He did not just stop there. He went on to say: As has always been the case, they can either to negotiate better conditions or look for a more suitable job. That is the approach of the conservatives, and that is the approach that we utterly reject. From the start we have been committed to an arbitral safety net, - hich is the award system. Let me mention two other areas where we are vitally different in our approach from that of our opponents. Not only will we retain awards, but also we will make sure that agreements entered into do not undershoot the award by stringently applying a 'no disadvantage' test to make sure that under no circumstances are workers left in a position of a low wage outcome. These, after all, are aimed at encouraging high productivity outcomes with a share going to the workers concerned. The third vital area where our approach is different from those opposite is in the role of trade unions. We are keen to encourage trade unionism because the best way of getting an enterprise agreement is to ensure that people are properly represented by someone who has the expertise to get them a result",44
81,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,45
82,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-'-These are very complex matters. The opposition makes light of this, but the fact is that in a complex environment of contractual employment terms, if people do not have someone decent representing them they can very easily get a bad outcome. So we have said that we want unions to represent people wherever possible. But, having said that, where there is not a union present, we have said it is inappropriate for a union to have a right of veto, as is presently the case under section 134. It is for that reason that under the agreement reached last night with the ACTU there will be a parallel stream available for those who are not represented by unions. That parallel stream will involve the commission applying the same tests: the 'no disadvantage' test to make sure that workers are not worse off; the test to guarantee that there has been informed consent-that a majority of workers agree with it and know what they are agreeing with-as well as safeguards to make sure that there has been no duress or attempt to deseek unionise a work force by inducing people to leave unions. We believe it is vitally important that those tests be applied, and we think it is vitally important that unions have a right, not a veto, to be heard before the commission in respect of those tests. Mr Charles-Why?",45
83,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition believes that there should not have been any scrutiny of these arrangements. The fact is that they must be scrutinised. The arrangements will be decided by the commission, but they will be publicly scrutinised so that everyone knows that there has been a fair and decent outcome. This morning on the radio I heard the honourable member for Bennelong say that employers will not take advantage of these arrangements. What employers are saying is code fqr, 'We want low wage outcomes. We do not want to abide by award minima. We want to get outcomes that undershoot the awards'. The government believes in an open, public, accountable process with a proper role for unions, and we intend to guarantee that outcome.",45

85,Mr DAWKINS,TIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"During question time the honourable member for Mayo asked me a question which was based, apparently, on a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In his question the honourable member for Mayo implied that the committee had recommended certain changes to the bill. I want to read to the .House the recommendation that the committee made. The committee said: The Committee, while noting the Opposition's position reported above, recommends that the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 agreed to. In other words, the recommendation of the committee was that the bills be agreed to by the Senate. I think it is possible that the opposition has become so carried away with its own importance that it thinks that the minority report, or the dissenting report, is in fact the report of the committee. In the penultimate paragraph the committee said: The Committee noted that the Opposition opposes the bills butand that the oppositionhopesMr Downer-It doesn't say that. Mr Di\WKINS-It does.

117,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 56th general report of the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",48
118,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee's 56th general report deals with the activities the committee during 1992. It was a very busy year for the committee. There were 29 public hearings which were held at a variety of locations-including Christmas Island, Weipa, Darwin, Townsville, Perth and Wollongong. The committee carried out 23 inspections. These took in existing facilities and proposed construction sites as well as completed facilities. Twenty-one reports were tabled and the estimated cost of public works on which the committee reported during 1992 was $1.486 billion-a record. Evidence collected on the references amounted to more than 5,000 pages of transcripts, and 265 witnesses appeared before the. committee at public hearings. By any measure, these outcomes are prodigious. As in past years, the committee's general report describes a number of what can best be described as difficult projects and raises a number of matters of concern which emerged during the year. The most difficult project was the inquiry into the public works aspects of the Civil Aviation Authority'S proposed air traffic services centres at Brisbane and Melbourne. Honourable members will recall that on 3 June last year I informed the House of difficulties and frustrations which were experienced by the committee in the exercise of its duties as a result of the unwillingness or inability of key CAA witnesses to answer relevant questions. Concerns were raised during the committee's inquiries into the selection of the successful tenderer for the provision of the hardware, software. and buildings for the Australian advanced air traffic system. Accordingly, the committee recommended that the responsible minister set up an independent panel to carry out a thorough review of all aspects of the awarding of the contract. This, to the credit of the minister, and the government as well, was done and a review was carried out by Mr Ian Report Macphee. The key element of the committee's misgivings about the tender selection process concerned the process leading to the selection of the successful tenderer. The stand taken by the committee in recommending an independent review was vindicated. The review found that the original tender selection process was of departed from in a manner which was both unsound and unfair. The review also recommended that the two competing companies for the contract revert to the original process. This has been done and next week the committee will resume its inquiry into the public works component of the TAAATS project. Judging from media comments about the stand taken by the committee in relation to the matter, the committee has served the parliament and the people of Australia well. In fact, on behalf of the committee, I take considerable pride in reading to the House what Mr Macphee wrote about the committee in his report. He said: The Parliament has rights in the public interest and its all party Committees are one of the few practical checks upon the abuse of executive power. The Public Works Committee is one of the hardest working, but normally low profile, Committees. Its current members are conscientious Parliamentarians without a desire for publicity or controversy. Nor do they have an undue sense of their own importance. Mr Macphee concluded with a pithy observation: The behaviour of the Parliamentarians involved was in the best tradition of the public interest. Another matter raised in this general report concerns the timing of references. The majority of references last year were received during the budget sittings. There has been an expectation by departments and agencies for the committee to undertake its inquires and report within a short time span. Sometimes this is possible; but in the future we do not want to see a repeat of 11 references being referred to the committee in. the budget sittings, the majority of which were referred late in the sittings, and all needing to be reported on before the summer recess. So far this year the flow of references has been somewhat more even. The committee hopes it continues that way. Sometimes, during informal discussions with departmental officials, the question of the mandatory limit is raised-the expectation being that the committee, in its wisdom, will agree to the limit being increased from $6 million to $10 million, or even $20 million. The committee does not consider it appropriate for the limit to be increased. The estimated cost of the majority of the projects examined during 1992 was well in excess of $6 million. The cost of only two references was marginally in excess of $6 million-.,..and were for works of national importance which the committee felt deserved examination. These projects were the construction of a new permanent repository for the Australian Archives at East Burwood, Victoria, which cost $6.5 million; and a storage-display facility for the Australian War Memorial in Mitchell, ACT, which also cost $6.5 million. Since departments and agencies are now able to appoint their own design and construction authorities without the involvement of Australian Construction Services, there has been some discussion about compliance with building standards and local building codes. Correspondence with the forner Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, relating to the use of independent building certification services or agents is highlighted in the report. Another matter for concern is the perennial question of inspections of overseas projects. For many years-and I have been a member of the committee since 1987-the committee has vigorously objected to provisions of the Public Works Committee Act which, on the one hand, require the committee to report on overseas works-embassies and high commissions-and, on the other hand, prevent'it from travelling or meeting overseas to inspect properties and to take evidence. Last year the committee examined two proposals involving overseas works: one in Thailand and one in Fiji. The committee was unable to carry out on-site inspections. The benefits of inspections of sites and discussions with local staff would far outweigh associated costs. In fact, I think it would be much cheaper for the committee to visit the sites than it would be to bring the bureaucrats and associated personnel here to Canberra. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that every time we have one of these hearings the room is full of bureaucrats and other overseas personnel brought here at great expense to the Australian taxpayer. It would be much cheaper to send the half a dozen members of the committee to inspect the-e proposals on-site. Last year, as a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I inspected construction of the new Australian these Embassy in Jakarta. I can say no more than to report that, had the committee been able to inspect the site of the proposed embassy, the limitations of the site would have been much more apparent to us. During the year the committee continued to focus on the provision of more energy efficient building designs as well as the utilisation of alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power. On Christmas Island the committee discovered that, although the island is within the belt of trade winds, the provision of wind-driven electricity generating systems was not included in the proposed Christmas Island redevelopment. The committee recommended a system be provided. Mr Katter-What about the Torres Strait?",48
119,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,Why does the honourable member not listen for once in his life? A pilot study is under way and the committee is confident that it will be successful and will reduce the reliance on diesel generators on the island. Mr Katter-It has already been done in the Tortes Strait.,49
120,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, would you ask the honourable member for Kennedy to be quiet until I finish my report?",49
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,I am listening to you intently and I would like silence in the chamber. The honourable member for Kennedy will cease interjecting.,49
122,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"The committee also believes the success of this project will reduce, if not eliminate, significant latent conservatism amongst engineers and technicians towards embracing what in most comparable countries are already proven technologies. The committee has also been pursuing with some vigour the provision of solar hot water heaters in houses being constructed for the Defence Housing Authority. During the year the authority agreed that half of the houses in a development at Seaward Village, Perth, would be provided with solar hot water heaters. From the point of view of occupational health and safety in air conditioned buildings, legionnaire's disease is a spectre against which all proper precautions must be taken. The report mentions a number of aspects of legionnaire's disease and the exemplary steps being taken by the managers of Parliament House in ensuring that all possible precautions are taken. These steps have wider ramifications and establish a baseline for all building managers. I urge all honourable members to re-d that part of the report. On the question of child care, the committee continued to focus attention during the year on arrangements for the care of young children of staff to be employed in buildings under construction. The Australian Taxation Office, one of the largest public sector employers, advised the committee on a number of developments and initiatives in relation to the provision of child-care facilities in buildings upon which the committee has reported in recent year-. Things are happening, and about time, too. The committee unanimously recommended that the proposal for· Badgerys' Creek not proceed; but that work commence on an international freight airport and if the government could not or would not fund this the private sector be invited to do so. Unfortunately, the government rejected our recommendations. The conimittee feels that history will show that our recommendation was the correct one. I would like to place on record my thanks and the thanks of my committee colleagues to the former vice-chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who is in the chamber, for the support he gave me during the year and during the time that he was vice-chairman. His penetrating questioning of former colleagues in the defence forces, as well as officials from the Civil Aviation Authority and other agencies during his period as vice-chairman will be a h!lrd act to follow. I thank him for his service to the committee. I would also like to acknowledge the sterling efforts of three former members of the committee, the former honourable member for Grey, Mr Lloyd O'Neil, the former honourable member for Indi, Mr Ewen Cameron, and the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). Finally, I said at the beginning that 1992 was a busy year for the committee. The report mentions the number of references and associated inspections. This report placed considerable strain not only on the committee but also on the staff. It was largely the dedication, professionalism and hard work of the staff which enabled the committee to cope with such a heavy workload and to achieve, at times, difficult reporting targets. The committee is fortunate to have such a dedicated staff ably led by the secretary, Peter Roberts. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1993-94 In Committee Consideration resumed. Schedule 3. Department of Primary Industries and Energy Proposed expenditure, $291,555,000. Department of Tourism Proposed expenditure, $100,008,000.",50
123,Mr MCGAURAN,COMMITTEES," The Department of Primary Industries and Energy presides over one of the most significant industry sectors in the' Australian economy, the mining and minerals processing industry. This industry sector is central to the country's export effort. While other industry sectors, over time, have fallen away as a proportion of mercltandise trade or else failed to take the dominant positions forecast for them by the so-called experts, the mining and energy related exports have climbed from under 10 per cent of merchandise trade 30 years ago, to more than 50 per cent now. Australia's share of world trade has fallen over the past 30 years but the mining and energy sectors have increased their share. Clearly, this is an area in which Australia holds a rare and vital comparative advantage which must be protected at all costs. Having said that, last month the government introduced a range of budgetary measures which constitute nothing more than an assault on the Australian mining sector. And in doing so, it constituted an attack on the export economy. Over the past few years, various government ministers have stood in this chamber and moved around the community extolling the commitment of the Labor government to advanced minerals processing and the like. The current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is one of these ministers; so too is the present Minister for Resources (Mr Lee). They boast about their government's confessed commitment to advanced processing, value-added industries, squeezing' more value out of the commodity sector and capturing new markets through knowledge and capital intensive industries. We hear this from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on an almost daily basis. But now he and the government have been well and truly found out. They now know that they cannot go anywhere in this country, especially in their primary industries constituencies, and talk with any faith or honesty about the minerals and advanced processing sectors. Last month's budget has struck directly at the heart of the mining and processing sector's competitiveness. It has placed another hurdle in its path as it struggles to hold on to its market position. This impediment is largely in the increases in fuel taxes levied in the budget. For the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) the increases in petrol, diesel fuel and fuel excises were simply easy revenue raising measures and nothing more. But to the mining and resource processing sectors they represented an unanticipated blow to their performance. Let me be specific about this. I want to run through some of the assessments by the mining industry itself about what the increase in the petroleum excises will do to the industry and its capacity to export, reinvest and, in some cases, stay in business. As I run through these, I would ask the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Resources to reply to each of the assessments raised by the industry and explain to the community why they have backed policy measures which have had this effect. Of course, I also ask the ministers charged with the oversight of the resources sector to contest these industry assessments. I am sure the relevant companies would like to take up the issue with them and the department. Look at the impact of the fuel oil excise. Until budget night, this was set at 5'hc per litre, but as a result of the budget will jump to lO'hca 90 per cent increase. Some honourable members may not know a great deal about fuel oil. It is a heavy crude oil used in furnaces which, in tum, are used to drive turbines which power drive shafts in ships or generate electricity. There are several ways the fuel oil increase has hie at the minerals and resource processing sectors. Some of them are direct consequences of the excise increase; others are unintended consequences about,which the Minister for Resources himself is only gradually becoming dimly aware. The fuel oil has effectively doubled the direct fuel costs of dedicated users such as Nabalco's Gove bauxite and alumina plant and Comalco's Bell Bay smelter. The Bell Bay smelter will now pay three-quarters of a millipn dollars a year in excise owing to the increase. Bell Bay consumes about 15 million litres of fuel oil a year. Tasmania's Savage River iron ore mine, which uses fuel oil to heat and bake pellets, has effectively had the cost of its product increased by $1.15 per oil tonne; that is $1.15 on a tonne of product that is only worth $36.61 a tonne as it is. And this is· a company which is struggling to contend with continuing falls in iron ore prices. If this company fails, if its forthcoming feasibility study finds it cannot sustain its operations against high cost inputs such as fuel oil, then the Tasmanian community, and for that matter the Australian community, will know who to blame. All up, the Tasmanian mineral processing sector, Savage River Mines, Bell Bay, Tasmania Electro Metallurgical Company and Pasminco Metal, all of which are companies hurting badly in the battle with low international prices, uses 34 1h megalitres of fuel oil a year. That means about $3 1/2 million a year goes out of these companies into the federal government's fuel excise coffers. For those companies and their employees, that is the difference between survival and closure, employment or unemployment. The $450 million Mount Keith nickel project in Western Australia consumes 80 million litres of fuel oil a year. Its operators' fuel oil tax bill will rise from $4 million to million. Other marginal but prospective mining projects in Western Australia are now at risk of being put on permanent hold because of the savage increase in input costs. But the biggest shock of all is yet to come. ' Nabalco, the largest user of fuel oil on the mainland, at Gove in the Northern Territory will pay $50 million a year in fuel oil excise-a $25 million overnight increase in federal fuel tax for one company. The company uses about 460 megalitres of fuel oil a year in its bauxite and alumina plant. This massive, unprecedented rise in fuel input costs has shaken the Nabalco operation to its core. I cannot underestimate the impact on the company's morale. This is a company that just spent $120 million or so upgrading plant and skills to win a $10 per tonne price decrease so it could compete in an export market where it is a price taker. This is the sort of corporate behaviour that we wish we would witness in every Australian company which is seeking to enhance its performance in a global market and incrementally improve its performance. But this huge investment effort has been wiped out as of budget night. That $10 price advantage has gone and another $5 per tonne price disadvantage has been placed on top of it. All up, fuel oil tax now accounts for $33 per tonne of alumina. This is a company which has had its pre-tax profits stripped by $25 million. Because the world price for energy inputs has fallen for its trading competitors, the gap between the world market and Nabalco's price structures has opened up-and it will open up further as fudexation of the fuel excise takes effect as well. "" I want to know where the Labor government's Senate representation has disappeared on this matter. Minister Collins and Parliamentary Secretary Snowdon have gone to ground as they watch the community of Gove, with its large Aboriginal population, suffer directly as a result of this decision. The fuel oil tax has also added to shipping costs which feed into the mining sector's cost structures. Three-quarters of all dry bulk coastal shipping is for minerals transport. Shipping costs per ship will rise by almost $8 $300,000 a year owing to the price rise, and this will be principally borne by the mining sector. Tasmania's Savage River iron ore mine transports pellets and concentrates to New South Wales steelworks and coal washeries. This will be so much more expensive now. Iron ore shipped from Western Australia to New South Wales steelworks will jump and steel prices will be forced to rise, further undermining the steel export returns, as well as lifting domestic prices. Manganese shipped from, the Northern Territory to the New South Wales ferromanganese plant operated by, BHP will be more costly by far.' The cost of alumina transported from around Australia to smelters in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland is set to rise as a consequence of the indirect impact of the surge in shipping ,costs brought about by the doubling of the fuel oil tax. Where companies use natural gas as their primary energy source for generating electricity and running furnaces, most have pricing arrangements linked to fuel oil delivered prices plus excise, so their fuel bill goes up, too, owing to the escalator provisions in gas contracts geared to fuel oil prices. If the guillotine had not been imposed, I could give example after example of the effect of this doubling of the fuel oil tax increase in the budget. It is going to cost jobs. Enough is enough. The Treasurer ran the budget numbers in secret. Governm-nt ministers did not have a clue what was gomg on. Now they are trying to defend the indefensible, although the Minister for Resourcis hiding out, too embarrassed to me-t hiS constituency. But let me say one last thmg:. I hope no one in this government steps foot m public and lays any claim in the future to having any honest interest in or commitm-nt to the mining and value adding processmg sectors. For the government, that rhetoric, as of budget night, is dead and buried.",50
124,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,COMMITTEES," My colleague opposite, the sha.dow minister, the honourable member for GippSland (Mr MCGauran), might be asking why I, the member for Perth, am speaking during this committee stage consideration of the proposed expenditures for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Tourism. That is no doubt because I have a much better knowledge of my electorate than he does. As I said in my first speech in this place, the electorate of Perth is a diverse one, stretching north to north-east from the Perth central business district to Midland. It includes semi-rural areas as well as residential and light industrial areas. It includes historic and cultural icons such as the Midland town hall, the Guildford post office and the Swan River. I made the point in my first speech that the protection of the Swan River, the enhancement of its water catchment quality and the protection of its foreshore, particularly in areas such as Ashfield and Bassendean, are very important local issues. That part of schedule 3 of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy proposed expenditure to which I wish to draw attention is in respect of natural resources management. As the budget papers state, this classification covers water, land and forest management programs which are now integrated within the national landcare program under the Natural Resources Management (Financial Assistance) Act 1992. The national landcare program encourages a long-term strategic approach to the management of land, water and related vegetation through three principal program components, one of which is assistance for community landcare projects. Nationallandcare program funding in 199394 of a significant amount, over $105 million, will be provided to support ecologically sustainable development in rural and urban communities. Over $14 million will be provided for community landcare activities and over $10 million for catchment management in our river systems. This, of course, includes the Swan River in my electorate. As part of those community based programs, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) recently announced the city landcare initiative under the national landcare program. City landcare will enable the establishment of community based city projects with an educational emphasis on the management of Australia's land and water resources, which will in tum encourage urban-rural links to land care. City landcare aims to demonstrate the benefits of better land and water management and to broaden overall public awareness in urban areas of sustainable land use and catchment management practices. One of the mechanisms that the city landcare program uses to enhance these initiatives is the creation of opportunities for urban communities to learn about land and water management through active participation in land care on selected demonstration project sites located in cities or on their fringes. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, as part of his administration of the city lartdcare program, recently visited Ashfield Flats in my electorate with members of the Town of Bassendean Council and the. Bassendean Preservation Group. Ashfield Flats is an important part of the Swan River, and for a number of years the Bassendean Preservation Group has been doing important work in Ashfield Flats to ensure protection of the Swan River against erosion of its shores. In addition, the Bassendean Preservation Group has been. responsible for the largest tree planting in the Bassendean and Ashfield areas, and that includes the good work done at Bindaring and Pickering parks, as well as at Ashfield Flats. The Bassendean Preservation Group works in close consultation with the town of Bassendean. Ashfield Flats is an area of approximately 50 hectares of river flats bound by the Swan River wholly within the town of Bassendean. Part of the flats is natural bushland; other parts are open grassland once used as a fann. In recent times, that area has been the subject of some degradation. The Bassendean Preservation Group has been working very hard to restore it to an acceptable state. When the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy visited the Ashfield Flats, he did - o together with Mr Greg Peterson, the chamnan of the Bassendean Preservation Group, and Mr Bevan Carter and Mr Ron van Delft, who are both preservation group members and Bassendean town councillors. Those three people are to be congratulated for the work they have done in community landcare activities. As a consequence of the city landcare program, the Bassendean Preservation Group has recently applied for funds under that program. I am hopeful that t.he - pplic-ti-n will be successful. That applIcation Wlll m part enable the group to construct baffle-wash fences, plant reeds, construct a boardv:alk, monitor the water quality of the Swan Rlver, and erect educational signage to ensure that Ashfield Flats and the Swan River in my electorate are protected and enhanced. The second area that I wish to speak about in respect of these proposed expenditures is in the are- of tourism. Again, members opposite might be surprised that I am speaking on tourism matters. I do so not just to draw attention to the importance of Perth as a regional tourism centre for the Asian region, but, in particular, to draw attention t? the prospects and the potential for reglOnal tourism in the historic Midland-Guildford area and the Swan Valley, part of which is in my electorate. The budget papers refer to the fact that Commonwealth assistance for tourism has increased from $21.8 million in 1983-84 to $86.6 million in 1992-93-a real increase of 148.2 per cent over the decade. In the current budget, funding is provided for several n.ew initiatives in the tourism industry amountmg to $42 million for regional tourism over the four-year period from 1993-94 to 1996-97. I draw particular attention to the implementation of the regional tourism development program through which $23 million will be expended over four years to develop regional tourism. The regional tourism development program is aimed at improving the capacity and ability of regional Australia to attract international and domestic tourists. A total of $5.5 million will be allocated to the program in 1993-94. I recently had the opportunity of taking the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) to the Swan Valley and the historic MidlandGuildford area, and drew his attention to the potential of those areas to develop as regional tourism sites under the regional tourism development program. The regional tourism development program will provide grants to local government, regional tourism associations and regional development organisations for integrated regional planning, to widen the drawing power for both domestic and international visitors, and provide tourism infrastructure. I have been working very closely in conjunction with the Shire of Swan and the Swan Valley Tourism Council to ensure that an application under the regional tourism development program is successfully submitted for consideration. I wish to read into the record the views of the President of the Swan Valley Tourism Council, Ms Kate Lamont, which were reported in a feature article in the West Australian of Saturday, 2 October. The article was about the Swan Valley and the forthcoming Spring in the Valley festival which is to be held in the Swan Valley this weekend, Saturday, 9 October and Sunday, 10 October. The article outlines the vision that Ms Lamont has for tourism in the Swan Valley. It states: Her plan rests on tourism, which brought a million visitors to the valley in 1992, and the area's cultural pursuits-viticulture, agriculture, horticulture and plain culture. ""This region has fantastic potential in agriculture and tourism . . . Ms Lamont sees a viable future for the valley in the hands of small business people-the vignerons, specialist horticulture growers, restaurateurs, artists and crafts people supplying a refreshing change pace right on Perth's doorstep. ""There is already a local demand that is not being met for cut flowers, free range poultry other products for the hospitality industry,"" said. ""What the valley desperately needs is bed and breakfast accommodation which would provide income for a number of family-owned businesses and allow day-trippers to extend their stay. ""Our survival as a region and as the Perth depends on the valley becoming a successful shopfront for visitors as well as remaining a significant agricultural producer. That is direction we must take to preserve and develop valley"". I have quoted at length because I agree entirely with that, and I could not have put better. I am very hopeful that, under the regional tourism development program, applications made by the Swan Valley Tourthe ism Council in conjunction with the Shire of Swan will be successful. This bold initiative by the Minister for Tourism is one which am sure will prove very successful in develmanaged oping regional tourism in Australia.",53
125,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES,"I wish to express my disappointment-actually, my outrage-that, in the committee stage Appropriation Bill (No.1), I have been left 21/2 minutes due to the guillotining of bills. seems this parliament is not fulfilling where near its function. In fact, it seem to be fulfilling any function at all, with a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who would rather dispense with it all totally so that can rule to suit himself. I will not go on further about that because I have not got time. In the brief time that I have left to speak, I want to pick up the primary industries energy portfolio. I refer to the energy aspect of the portfolio, which is dealt with in PPS on page 66 under the heading 'ESD and Greenhouse National Response Strategies it (Commonwealth/State Cooperation)'. The energy department claimed to have done mess it up. certain things in the last year. It states: Advanced the achievement of economicallyeffisavings. cient ways of limiting greenhouse gas emissions of from energy production and use through the development ... It has advanced them. That does not seem to be quite in keeping with what the Auditorand General's report said about energy manageshe ment programs. In fact, the department has some not achieved its energy management programs. The report says that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, which is responsible for the range of activities to foster better use of energy in Australia, had not taken sufficient action to implement the lungs of package that was announced in 1990. Let us just pick out a few of the more the salient points of what the Auditor-General the said about the program run by the energy department. The Auditor-General found that the department had taken longer than anticiit pated to achieve significant advancement of the policies. After just two years having elapsed, the Auditor-General estimated that package was one year behind what was achievable. It is a pretty good record to be, in a two-year program, one year behind! Not I many departments, I would think, could have such a good record as that one! The audit report noted that insufficient attention had been given to managing the problems. It noted that the department did not of provide the numbers of people approved for the programs or make full use of those that It were. Staff that were meant to be available any for putting the· programs into place were does not heavily engaged in other tasks. The report also says that Australia has a poor record of energy saving. I would like to he add to that by saying energy saving is probany ably one of the easiest things that we can the achieve in this country. There are no downsides to energy saving. It is of benefit to industry because it cuts down on costs, and it and is of benefit to the environment. It is of further benefit to the industry because, in the coming up with new technologies, we find that we can sell those to other countries. So is a plus-plus situation for everyone, yet the department managed to completely and utterly Australia has a poor record of energy We are amongst the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis. Our cars are amongst the world's most inefficient in terms of fuel.",55
126,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES,"Mr Truss)Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure now before the committee has expired. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Social Security . Proposed expenditure, $1,148,364,000.",56
127,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"Berowra) (4.40 p.m.)Mr Deputy Chairman, I wonder what amounts we are actually talking about. It must be one part of the appropriation, because my understanding is that we are talking about estimates that amount' to $34.1 billion for 1993-94, designed to ensure that benefits are paid to more than five million people. If we look at the budget documents, we see that social security and welfare account for some 36.2 per cent of the government's total outlays. It is incredible that we are going discuss the social security outlays-36.2 per cent of the government's total outlays-in the space of 20 minutes. That is 20 minutes to discuss more than one-third of the government's total expenditure. I think that is the most outrageous proposition imaginable. In terms of this government's priorities, it is reflection of its total lack of concern and compassion for the most vulnerable. These outlays are designed to provide the income support for the most needy people in our community. Quite frankly, in this discussion one would have liked to have been able to direct one's comments to a whole range of issues but, regrettably, that will not be posdo sible. For instance, I would have liked to discuss the government's original proposals exempt all pensioners from the tax systemunfortunately, the government broke that promise-but there will not be sufficient time for us to deal with that matter. I would have liked to talk about the government's home child-care allowance. That was not mentioned in the budget and, in time, it may become another broken promise. I would have liked to talk about the government's seniors health card. The government promised that it would be introduced in April 1994 but, as we know from other legislation we have discussed recently, its introduction has been delayed until July 1994. I would have liked to talk about the home equity conversion scheme, but that was another delayed promise. Mr Sciacca-It only took three months.",56
128,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"The parliamentary secretary says 'only three months'. Those opposite do not have any credit because they do not believe their word should be accepted. They do not believe that when they have made a promise they should remain committed to it. only That is what the parliamentary secretary demonstrated when he indicated it was only a matter of three months. I want to deal with one of those matters where the government told us that it had no intention of abandoning its policy approach: the issue of unrealised capital gains on shares. We all know that the government indicated its intention and great resolve to ensure that this to commitment, made in the budget last year, was not abandoned. The fact is that, even in relation to something like that, the government moved-largely without notice-but moved only partially. That has caused a very unpalatable result for many. I would like to remind honourable members of the a government's total mishandling of this issue because it does indicate the way in which it sees and treats Australia's most vulnerable retirees. The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which honourable members would be aware of, brought down a report which was very critical of this legislation. I not intend to go through all this again in the time available, except to say that the to report was written by members of the opposition-as we would expect, they were fairly critical-the Australian Democrats, who had a long standing concern about this matter, and the government. Their' findings, which were unanimous, were that the costings in relation to this matter were seriously flawed. They took the view that the government's approach could affect the share market in a very inappropriate way and they continued to reiterate concerns which the Senate had committed to righting before. We now know that, notwithstanding that committee's deliberations and recommendations, the government did not accept its report. It came to a view of its own on this matter, which I think was the most outrageous approach of all. It took the view that the only inequity that it was going to deal with was the issu,e of retrospectivity. One would think that retrospectivity was important, except that the government is about to introduce new legislation involving $250 million owed to the Commonwealth in which it wants to validate the collection of that money retrospectively. So let us not hear the government say that it regards retrospective legislation as being flawed and something we have to walk away from because it introduced more legislation last week. It introduced legislation to remove the retrospectivity, but it has essentially sapped the measure of any so-called· financial advantage for the government. Even accepting the government's own calculations, more than $60 million worth of savings are reducedhey presto!-to about $5 million worth of savings. Even when the government brought in the legislation it could not get it right because had not sought adequate information to be able to make judgments in relation to who owned shares at the relevant date and who did not. It had to be able to establish as at 18 August-I think that was the date-who owned shares and who did not, but it did not have any information. It had conducted a mail-out to every pensioner in Australia who owned shares, seeking information, but it did not get that bit of basic information. Now it has to write to every pensioner again",56
129,Mr COBB,COMMITTEES,What does this cost?,57
130,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"The honourable member asks about the cost; perhaps the parliamentary secretary wili be able to tell us what that additional cost is because I imagine it will probably run into millions of dollars when we include the processing time, the staff time, mail.out costs and the printing costs. Certainly the implementation of the original scheme, which was not as complex as the new scheme, was going to run into millions of dollars. So, with this additional element, that sort of sum would be involved. But there are other questions that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has to answer. Is he now going to postponebecause the government does not have the information-the operation of these provisions, or is he going to do it retrospectively? Is he going to go back to August 1992 and operate it from September as' was originally planned, or is he going to have to fix a new date? Is he going to try to backdate it to that earlier date? Whatisgoing tei happen to those people who are left owning shares in the event of takeovers when shares are compulsorily acquired? Can the minister clarify that, because all of the information from his department relating to this issue has failed to clarify that question to this point? What will be the government's approach to the issue of managed investments? Is it going to respond positively to the request for an independent inquiry into the whole issue of assets and income testing? The ongoing sore for this government is managed investmentsparticularly those. trusts which failed and which are now being refloated. The government now wants to rely upon arguments that it there are notional capital gains in relation to those trusts when previously people had lost almost everything they had invested in that form. Only now, with the refloating of some of those interests, might they continue to hold some assets of their own. But because of this loss and the operation of these provisions they might be faced with a total loss of pension income. Day by day in our offices questions of this sort are raised. The government will have to indicate very clearly and quickly where it stands on this question. Is it prepared to put these questions into the pot and ensure that there is a total and fundamental review so that these injustices that are emerging day by day can be properly addressed? I am sorry that there is no time for us to be able to go on and the deal with other matters which are of the utmost importance in this area. (Time expired)",57
131,Mr SCIACCA,COMMITTEES,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (4.50 p.m.)-I did not really intend to speak, but every time. I hear my friend and colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) he is trying to raise some arguments. Mr Charles-I had intended to make some.",57
132,Mr SCIACCA,COMMITTEES,"If the honourable member does not interject, I might even leave a few minutes for one of the other members to get up and speak. I only want to make a couple of points. The first point I want to make concerns the question of the shares. I do not really know what one has to do to satisfy this opposition. With regard to the shares, we preserved the integrity of the measure. We preserved the principle behind which the share measure was first devised. That is, if people purchase shares and they draw a pension, they do so on the basis of sic value of those shares as an investment and they do so with their eyes open. We considered the retrospectivity and removed it as a result of calls from the community and, in particular, from our own back bench. We took out the retrospectivity, and thus saved some 94,000 out of 104,000 people who were going to be affected by the retrospectivity in the measure. Only those who purchased shares prior to August 1992, when the measure was originally announced in the budget context, are not going to be affected. It does not matter what we do, we will never satisfy the honourable member for Berowra. The second matter I want to mention concerns the question of retrospectivity of overpayments belonging to the Department of Social Security. The bill was introduced last week, and it will possibly be debated some time in the second week when we come back. In his media appearances and so forth, the honourable member for Berowra is· trying to make a big issue out of this. He was obviously able to convince one of the journalists from the Sunday Herald Sun, that drama merchant newspaper, to write a big dramatic story. It was said that we were going to bring in retrospective legislation to collect overpayments. In reality, that measure is simply attempting to ensure that the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal do not allow people who have obviously been overpaid by the Department of Social Security to get away from the debt. In many instances the smart people have been able to find some technical error in the notice. Of necessity, we sent out literally millions of notices every year. We are saying to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, 'Look, don't invalidate a document simply because there might be a word out of place. The effect of the document is still there'. That is not really a situation where we are making something retrospective, in the sense that we are doing it on purpose. We are making sure that we do not have smart lawyers, and people like that, turning around and costing the Commonwealth government in many cases millions of dollars. It is simply rectifying a legal argument, of which the honourable merp.ber for the intrin- Berowra would be well aware. Mr Ruddock-It says it is retrospective.",58
133,Mr SCIACCA,COMMITTEES,"Yes, I know, and it is retrospective. I have no problems with saying that it is retrospective. We are going back to documents of sometimes one, two or three years agoMr Ruddock-It is 1988, isn't it?",58
134,Mr SCIACCA,COMMITTEES,"Yes, 1988. We are going back to documents in 1988, but the bottom line is that those moneys are in fact owing to the Commonwealth, and therefore to the Australian taxpayer, and we are simply closing yet another loophole. The honourable member for Berowra is always talking about closing loopholes. He is always talking about the fact that we should not be as generous with social security as some people think we are. Every time we do it, he gets dirty about it. .I do not know what we have to do to satisfy the honourable member for Berowra. I do not want to say anything more. We will debate it when the matter comes before the parliament. I do want to give our friend over there a couple of minutes to speak. Do not let it ever be said that I do not do the right thing by those opposite.",58
135,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"In the very limited time available to me, 1 simply want to say that the shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), is right: the amount of money appropriated for social. security programs is horrendous. Budget Paper No. 1 tells us: The 1993-94 Budget has been shaped in the light of two key factors: the gradual recovery from recession . . . and - the Government's medium term objective of reducing the budget deficit to 1.0 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. In aggregate terms for 1993-94: outlays are expected to increase by . . . 2.5 % in real terms . . . the major sources of growth in outlays are increases in the functions . . . Social Security and Welfare ... We are further told in Budget Paper No.1: In aggregate, over the forward years: - outlays are expected to rise by 4.5% in real terms ... And again: - the major sources of growth are expected to be functions . . . Social Security and Welfare This bill provides for an 8.3 per cent increase in spending on social security and welfare, at a time when inflation is running in the order of two per cent. Surely, we should aim to spend less on social security and welfare as we come out of recession; or is the expected growth in national productivity and employment only a figure of speech that is meant to make it sound all right? Is this just another case of saying the positive while anticipating the negative? The OECD recently put out a graph which contrasts unit labour costs against changes in productivity. Productivity has remained very flat and unit labour costs have risen quite dramatically over the. past 10 years to the point where our productivity is not matching our increase in costs. How on earth this will provide more jobs for tnore Australians and help reduce the social welfare burden is beyond me. I accept that we have an ageing population, but with more and more pensioners being hit by changes to the income test with respect to managed investments and small share portfolios many older welfare recipients are losing pensions rather than increasing the government's payouts. Some pen:;;ioners have had their pensions cut by hundreds of dollars a fortnight. A veterans affairs pensioner couple recently wrote to me saying that their pension had been cut by some $75 a fortnight because of managed investment 'deemed' income which they did not receive and on which, if they had disposed of the investment, they would have made a loss of some 10 per cent nominally but considerably more in real terms. It was interesting to note in the Senate estimates committee the department's answer to a question as to the reason for the expenditure of some $10,200 on promotional balloons. The department responded: The balloons are particularly effective in activities that relate to family payment. ... they are an effective means of getting children to drag the parents to shopping centre displays and other similar events. . . . ... there is a need to promote additional family payments ... It seems that families have to be coerced into claiming social security benefits these days. Apparently the department is anxious to increase its budget outlays. Again, from Senate estimates we discover that in 1992 the department .sent out 50,000 invitations to claim additional family payments. As a result of those 50,000 invitations, 20,222 claims were lodged and 10,687 were granted. It is staggering that a department which takes great delight in scrutinising every dollar that an aged pensioner or veteran is deemed to have earned on investments is begging younger families to take up other benefits. The issue is one of unemployment and expenditure on social welfare. While I applaud the government's action in ensuring that we have a safety net that prevents us having an unfair society with unequal distribution to the point that we have",58
136,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES,"Mr Truss)Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure for the Department of Social Security now before the committee has expired. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of the Arts and Administrative ServiceS Proposed expenditure"" $920,293,000.",59
137,Mr EVANS,COMMITTEES,"I would like to briefly touch on a number of issues regarding the arts that arise from this budget. Undeniably, the arts represents one of the more sensitive areas of government expenditure. The well-travelled myth is that reductions in government assistance to the arts mean a reduction in the quality and quantity of art in Australia-or anywhere for that matter. An examination of the arts portfolio in this budget, and a reading of the 'numerous political and artistic critiques of the budget, highlight an air of approval from many areas of the arts community for the government's actions. I begin by reminding the many people who have applauded the government's budget initiatives in the arts that it has been mooted that the budget increase is a payback for the wide and loud support given to the Australian Labor Party by the arts community at a particular low point during the recent election campaign. In other words, the arts budget is really a case of stealing from Peter to pay Paul. I remind the House that artists, the great majority of whom are relatively low income earners, will be hardest hit by the government's other budget initiatives, such as increases in the petrol tax and the wholesale sales tax, not to mention the increase in the wine tax-I am told that a lot of my art friends imbibe in wine a fair bit. Any positive initiative towards the arts, and, the government's commitment to arts and artists, can only be negated by the increase in personal financial imposts by this government on low income earners, including artists. In the Governor General's speech at the opening of parliament we were reminded of the government's commitment to arts and culture in Australia. He said: . . . cultural policy was going to become part Government's drive to create a new Australian identity. It was noted: . . . the government would continue its strong support for its existing programs. He also said: ... that new initiatives would be directed at youth and children-promoting excellence and innovationThat was in relation to the arts. For many programs the government's funding remains only slightly changed. The budget is devoid of any major program aimed at meeting its shallow promises earlier this year. The federal government's decision to pursue private sector support for the National Museum of Australia brings me to the second point I wish to raise. Amidst all the comment surrounding the coalition arts policy at the last election, little attention was given to a proper examination of the very substantial benefits that could be derived from looking at and encouraging alternative means of funding for Australian arts projects. It is clear that as demand for the taxpayer dollar increases, and as the taxpayer looks for greater value for his tax dollar, there will be greater attention on arts expenditure. For that reason it is imperative that the government begins to encourage alternative funding sources for the arts. Little attention is drawn to the fact that a great proportion of activity in the arts is undertaken with no taxpayer support. While federal government assistance to the arts totals approximately $260 million, the total.arts industry generates approximately $8.4 billion annually. The coalition correctly noted the government's role in the' arts as follows: ... support'not dominance, of encouragement not dictatorial direction, of stimulating creativity not cosseting self indulgence, of preserving the right to artistic freed<;>m and independence from Government not generating ideological or financial dependence on it. Coalition policy was committed to increasing the total level of funding to the arts by better using government suppprt through tax and other measures aimed at expanding private of the sector involvement. While government is obliged not to stifle, misdirect or manipulate culture, those who manufacture art and culture also have an obligation to avoid the temptation of willingly imprisoniIlg themselves behind a castle of grants and bureaucrats . The coalition is committed to encouraging greater private sector support for major cultural institutions such as the National Gallery of Australia, the National Library and the National Maritime Museum. The real dilemma for government is to recognise that there is a role for private enterprise. The extent to which the arts depends on the federal government reinforces the need in some minds for government subsidy of the arts. The simplistic notion that if funding were withdrawn the arts would be unfinanced denies the existence of alternative forms of revenue. That attitude lacks imagination and foresight, as evidenced in Britain in the 1980s when arts funding was frozen, leading to the successful search for commercial sponsorship. I would like to highlight how government subsidy of the arts can stifle the development of greater private sector involvement. The winning essay in the John B. Wood memorial essay competition entitled 'Do We Need an Arts Policy?' highlighted the shift that has occurred amongst the arts and political communities regarding private subsidy of the arts. It is stated: ... in a country where private money used to be considered as a suspect thing by most people until the end of the seventies and as a source of corruption by the art community until a few years ago, at least arts sponsorship is now accepted. Business agrees that arts sponsorship may be profitable for their corporate image or their internal communication. Arts groups admit that it is always better to depend on two, three or four funding organisations than on only one, the Ministry of Culture. The media generally agree to quote the name of the sponsor if it is involved in programme. At least the State admits that arts sponsorship could be something more than tax avoidance. The arts in Australia have been hard hit under this government. Not only are artists forced to bear the brunt of the government's decision to continue to impose taxes on low income earners-including many artists-but the recession continues to limit the extent to which average Australian families can appreciate art, and severely limits the extent to which the private sector can sponsor and encourage artistic endeavours. While many in the arts community may applaud loudly the government's performance in arts funding, they are being hard hit by other budget initiatives. What is worse, they are being denied greater access to arts subsidies because of the government's reluctance to encourage wider utilisation of private sector funding resources. Arts funding is leading to an elitist attitude. Coming from a community based organisation in my electorate, I can say that it is very hard for local community groups to resource funds, through government subsidies, for their future building programs, and so on. I encourage the government to look to private sponsorship as a means of relieving funds from the elite area of arts so that money can trickle down to the community to encourage our youth, our children, to take a more active role in the arts area.",60
138,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES,"Before the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services commences her address, in view of a ruling earlier this day I ask whether the parliamentary secretary has prime responsibility for the carriage of this part of the bill. Mrs Crosio-I am the parliamentary secretary to Senator MCMullan, wh() has the arts and administrative services portfolio. It is my responsibility to support him in that.",61
139,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES,So you have the prime responsibility for the carriage of this legislation through the House? Mrs CrosioYes.,61
140,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES,"You may an interesting, original proceed.",61
141,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services) (5.08 p.m.)-I would like not just the prime responsibility but the complete responsibility for this legislation. I certainly have an assisting role. In supporting the allocation of funding, as submitted to the committee for examination, I would primarily like to speak on the area of Purchasing Australia that I am very concerned about. But before doing so, I will comment on the speech of the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Evans), in which he spoke specifically about the arts. When we speak to the community across Australia we find that this government is probably doing more for the arts in every fonn than has been done in the preceding two decades. It is because of our federal government's interest in, support of, and financial assistance to all levels of arts-whether galleries, operas or museums-that all the activities and teaching have come down through 19cal community groups. I am very proud of what is being achieved; for example, in my own community what we have been able to put together is due to the funding that has been available and the resources that are now coming through. That assistance has been provided because it has been acknowledged by government that a need is there. That need is being met. We need to continue to promote our arts and obtain whatever funding is available at a government level. I would particularly like to refer, as part of the administrative services area of this debate, to something that occurred today which is probably one of the greatest projects that we have ever been able to promote and project, and that I had the opportunity in Sydney this morning to open-and that is part of the national program, meet the buyers. Today at Rosehill in Sydney we opened a meet the buyers seminar that was to go all day today and tomorrow. It is the first time in the history of this parliament that we have had three levels of government participate-the federal government participated with the government of New South Wales and with local government-and something like 5,000 industry suppliers registered. We had to close the books. In the first hour and a half this morning, nearly 2,000 people went through the gates. I had the opportunity, with the honourable member for Gordon representing the state minister, Anne Cohen, to launch the program in a tremendous feeling of jubilance, from the suppliers' point of view, with their working with government and getting knowledge from government, developing expectations of a bright future. I think what we are doing in meet the buyers programs has possibly not being promoted as it should have been through the media. I was very sorry to see this morning that probably only one radio station had shown up and yet thousands of people were there. There were 35 stalls, at state, federal and local government level, where all the buyers buying products for governments at all three levels wanted to give assistance to industry, from small business to large business. The queues were absolutely amazing. People from every walk of life were saying that they have a particular product and that they believed there was a market for them in Commonwealth government, the state government or in local government. They wanted to know how to get onto a common use contract. They wanted to know how to deal with government. In the last six months in particular that I have been very closely involved with this process, we have demystified what dealing with the Commonwealth government as a buyer is all about. It has created a tremendous response. I would particularly like to put on record the expertise of and the work that has been done by those unsung heroesthat is, the staff in the last four months who have been working very tirelessly to see this seminar come to fruition. When the meet the buyers program was first raised with me, I was a little bit sceptical. I said that if we have had such seminars in Canberra and we have had them in provincial cities and other major cities, why have we never had them in the most populated state? New South Wales, of course, is the most populated state. The department came back with a proposition that perhaps we should have it in Sydney, and perhaps we should now negotiate with the state government. Without repeating myself, I place on record the tremendous success of the program today, and I am sure that success will continue tomorrow. I have talked about Purchasing Australia, and I would also like to talk about some of the other areas of responsibility that people do not read about-that is, the way that we are training buyers in government departments at all levels. In the national program, training is being carried out across Australia. All departments-whether they be the departments of defence, education or health and housinghave an opportunity of putting their people forward and having them trained so they know how to use common use contracts; so they know what value for money means; so they know about the Australian and New Zealand supplies base in which we certainly promote Australian products in the purchasing areas but in which we also promote value for money. They are doing everything to the best of their ability. Many ask why do they continue to do it. They have to continue to do it at a department level because people move on; there are changes. But at least when changes occur staff are taking expertise with them. The training has been done on a continual basis, and we are seeing achievement there. I am particularly proud, too, of the small involvement that I have in Purchasing Australia and the advancement that we have made in the information technology field. I believe that we are putting in place-in both software programs and, in particular, in hardwaresome of the most complicated, realistic and world leading information technology. Again, we do not read about a lot of this. Perhaps it does not make the best headlines. Perhaps it does not make the stories that people want to read about. There is no intrigue; it is just hard work. It requires a lot of consultation, both with industry and with those suppliers who have the product that we require. I suppose it takes expertise to confer, consult and make sure that our buyers who are spending the taxpayer's dollar are doing it well. I place on record, too, the work and perhaps the consultation that has been done by all of those people involved in achieving this. At a recent seminar that I had with the Australian Information Industries Association I was particularly pleased when it said that the common use contracts have been reducing the cost for suppliers. Certainly it has been proven that, when government agencies use the common use contracts, it certainly reduces the risk to buyers. I know, from the point of view of where I sit now, that I would like to see the use of such contracts made mandatory. We have devolution of power. With devolution of power, we have devolution of responsibilities. So it is very difficult to instruct government at any level that it is mandatory to do this. Perhaps one day it will be taken on board through consultation, and government will see the light and know that that is the right way to go. I know that the Canberra Times runs a column on Mondays about the computer industry. One particular columnist is rather concerned about everything that is going on in Purchasing Australia, particularly in information technology, and believes that some intrigue is associated with it. I say to him and to everybody else who has concerns to go down there, have a look and see. It is very open; it is there not only for our buyers throughout the Commonwealth government but for anyone who cares to ask questions. We wish to continue to consult with suppliers, particularly those suppliers who feel that when they have missed out on a common use contract they have been disadvantaged. The only suppliers that we do not seem to be able to keep happy are the ones that do miss out on that contract, but at least we are able to renegotiate with them and show them where they have gone wrong in the past. Perhaps next time when they get on a common use contract and become one of our panel of suppliers they will be able to at least improve their service or the product that they wish to supply to government. All in all I commend and congratulate all those involved, including the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services, and say: thanks for a job well done. I am particularly pleased that I have had the opportunity, in a very limited way, to work with the minister who has the responsibility for this portfolio in another place. I am particularly pleased to see the common sense approach which he has been able to apply to the arts side of his portfolio and to the administrative services side, particularly in respect of the responSibility that I have had with Purchasing Australia.",61
142,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMITTEES," I want to raise the reinstatement of people to electoral rolls during the election process. Prior to each election, the Australian Electoral Commission conducts a habitat review. Basically, this involves a visit to every household a within the electorate and a .cross check is made of the actual residents as at that date and the people who are shown to be at that address on the roll. If a person is identified as being no longer a resident at that address, he or she is removed from the roll. If that person subsequently attends any polling place in Australia for a pre-poll vote and claims to be still living at any address within the division from which his or her name was removed, he or she is reinstated to the roll and allowed to vote. There are many circumstances where reinstatement is a correct and acceptable practice. But it is equally administered in a way which means that it can also be used by a knowing person to avoid a penalty for nonregistration or by unscrupulous people wanting to arrange a particular voting outcome in a closely fought division. I was concerned about this in my electorate, and I wrote to the Electoral Commissioner about it. He thanked me for my letter and wrote back in the following terms: In the division of Warringah, 571 electors were reinstated to the role and across Australia 45,627 reinstatements were made at an average of 310 per division. All reinstatements were made in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Each divisional returning officer must examine the claims made by an elector and, on the evidence able, must decide if the reinstatement and admission to the scrutiny of the electors vote is warranted. A divisional returning officer may not challenge such statements as the elector makes. Correspondence subsequently returned undelivered does not of itself prove the original claim false, nor does it constitute grounds for any prosecution. To my knowledge no evidence has been presented to the commission, nor has the commission's own investigations uncovered such evidence as would sustain a prosecution. He then says: However, any evidence you may be able to provide of apparent false plans would be appreciated so we can follow up as appropriate. I will certainly do that. In one case that I am aware of in my electorate, an eleCtor who had been removed from the roll pre-polled in Queensland and gave a false address, in Warringah. I know this to be the case because I sent a letter of welcome to the reinstated person whose address was given to me. The people who lived in the house rang me up and said, 'Nobody of that name has ever lived in this house. We have been living in it for six years'. This is a clear case where somebody has used a claim, been reinstated to the roll, and the vote was counted and included in the final result. That situation has occurred with 45,627 reinstatements throughout Australia, or an average of 310 reinstatements per division. I do not need to remind· the chamber that 310 votes per division could have a very significant impact on the outcome of some electorates around Australia. If the electoral commissioner can provide me with the names of the reinstated people in Warringah-I will write and ask him for these-I will personally check each of those reinstatement addresses so that we can ensure that the reinstatements were correctly made.",63
143,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES,"Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure for the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services has expired. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services Proposed expenditure, $2,295,504,000. Department of Veterans' Affairs Proposed expenditure, $1,607,572,000.",64
144,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"I would like to direct my comments towards the local government aspect of the appropriations for the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, which are now before the chamber, particularly to the financial assistance grants to local government and, coming from a rurally based electorate, to the aspect of those untied grants that that is directed towards roads. It is interesting to note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Mrs Crosio), who is at the table, was formerly the Minister for Local Government in New South Wales. I am sure that the parliamentary secretary would be aware of the problems that face local government in maintaining, let alone upgrading, roads in local government areas. I would like to concentrate on the financial assistance part of the local government aspect of this portfolio. This year in the electorate of Lyne the Greater Taree City Council engineers have considered two bridges to have structurally failed. These bridges are the Ashlea bridge and the Landsdowne River bridge. Both are situated within the area of the Greater Taree City Council. As a result of there being concerns about the safety of these bridges, the engineers have been forced to downgrade them so that they both have a 17tonne load limit. It is worth noting at this stage that they service rural areas. This is only a short-term solution and the future of these bridges really is in serious doubt. This year we applied to the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services for extra funding to the Greater Taree City Council under the financial assistance program, to try to alleviate its financial problems because of these bridges. The Landsdowne River bridge is particularly signi,ficant as it is used as a diversion. When the Pacific Highway-we discussed the Pac;ific Highway at length when we were looking at the expenditure for the Department of Transport and Communications; the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) spoke at length about its problems-becomes blocked in the Coopernook area because of flooding, the highway traffic has to be diverted over the Landsdowne bridge. Unfortunately, as anyone who keeps in touch with what happens on the Pacific Highway would know, it is becoming blocked far to often. The Ashlea bridge also has its own significance as it is used by semitrailers to carry milk supplies in and out from dairy farms, to carry building supplies into the area for people who are establishing homes and is also used for the local timber industry. I have seen correspondence from several companies, such as Boral Industries and Australian Consolidated Foods, which clearly outlines the economic hardship being faced by all persons involved as a direct result of the downgrading of these bridges. The engineers report that discussed these bridges states: Due to the nature and extent of defects and deteriolocal ration in Landsdowne River bridge and Ashlea bridge, further detailed inspection and testing has been recommended to enable realistic estimates to be made of the costs of repair. Extensive repairs must be made to both bridges if they are to remain operational for any period beyond the short term. I started my speech today with a description of these bridges because the department has not been able to find funding for local capital works to save these bridges, that is, over and above what the department is allocated under the formula of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. This is causing a great deal of concem to the people in the electorate of Lyne. Along with this, the Greater Taree City Council has had to suffer a surprising cutback in its financial assistance grants. I understand that its assistance for 1992-93 has been reduced by in the vicinity of $30,000, despite there being an overall increase in financial assistance spending across Australia to local government. There has been next to no government support for these bridges. I have been in touch with the Minister for Housing, Local Gbvernment and Community Services (Mr Howe) regarding this matter and his reply was that very little could be done about it and that it was a council issue. It is a council issue but this lev-l of government collects the majority of the funding that should be allocated to these roads and.distributes it ,as it sees fit from here on. The local government bodies rely heavily, as I say, on the financial assistance grants and identified local road grants provided by the federal government through the states formula yet, unfortunately, the minister felt it necessary to cut back both these grants for the Taree City Council Jor 1992-93. It will sadly take a major accident at either the Ashlea or Landsdowne River bridges before this government will realise the importance that these bridges have on the rural roads in the community of Lyne. At the moment people continue to drive over these bridges and are taking their lives in their own hands by so doing. I find it astounding that the budget papers show for the coming year a level of funding for financial assistance grants and identified road grants similar to that of the last two financial years. Yet, despite the minister knowing of the situation with these bridges, he has cut funding for both financial assistance grants and identified local road grants to the Greater Taree City Council. I would like to make it quite clear to the chamber today that in 1992-93 actual local government funding was $1,080.3 million and funding for 1993-94 has been set out at a similar levelof 1,084.6 million overall, or a 0.4 per cent increase. That stacks up against the amount of income that the government proposes to raise and is raising· at the moment, albeit maybe illegally, on the increased fuel excise right across Australia. One would imagine that that extra tax income should be allocated towards a much greater input to the road system of Australia and, more important1y' to the roads that I am talking about this afternoon, the local roads which are council . responsibility but which receive funding under that program from the federal government. Yet the Greater Taree City Council had a funding cut. This was after the government was made aware-I as the federal member made it aware-of what was going on with regard .to these two failing bridges. This year, 1993-94, the Greater Taree City Council got total funding of $3,178,524, compared with 1992 when it received $3 1240,732 - a drop of approximately $30,000. This means that some council somewhere has received a large increase in the overall slice of the financial assistance pie while the Greater Taree City Council has had to suffer a surprising cutback. When it is realised that these two bridges alone are estimated to cost around $2 million to repair, this is a huge burden which, according to the· advice from the minister's office, the council has to The program performance statements show quite clearly that little compassion has been shown to this region with regard to this matter of rural roads. In regard to the program performance statements for the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, I am also concerned at where the local capital works program money went. It has been axed; it has disappeared. This money was supposed to be a special oneoff initiative designed to provide a fiscal stimulus through the construction of economic and social infrastructure in communities most affected by the economic downturn. The mid-north coast of New South Wales has been, and continues to be, in economic downturn under this current government. We have unemployment levels of around 16 per cent; we have the second lowest median family income in the whole of Australia; and we have the lowest labour force participation rates in Australia. In anyone's language, the mid-north coast can consider itself to be suffering more than most from this so-called current economic downturn. It therefore surprises me that only lip-service has been paid to the electorate of Lyne with regard to these local capital works programs, the financial assistance grants and, more importantly, those local road programs, which seem to have been targeted to other areas. I am concerned that in the program performance statements there is no outline of where this local capital works program funding is directed and to what projects in particular. I would be interested to know what projects take priority over two bridges that are in a serious state of decline in an area of Australia that is desperately crying out for some economic support from the government. That is a question that is being asked by the majority of people around Australia who believe what the Prime Minister-he was then the shadow Treasurer-said many years ago, 'Every petrol pump in Australia has become a tax collector for the government'. This government is perpetuating that. (Time expired)",64
145,Mrs EASSON,COMMITTEES,"I repremeet. sent the seat of Lowe in the inner western suburbs of Sydney. In the latest report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the seat of Lowe was ranked 145 out of 147 seats in terms of need for day care for children aged zero to four years. A total of 14.6 per cent of the total population expressed this need, which is an inordinately high amount. Being a parliament overwhelmingly of men, the question of child care for most members has been the responsibility of others: their mothers, their wives. In the past decade, female participation in the work force has risen to 50 per cent of women between 15 and 55 years of age. Simultaneously with work, this same age group of women has been h-ving the babies. This Labor government, and the one before it-being concerned with this problem-have moved steadily forward on this question of social justice and equity for working mothers. This government's commitment to·child care is reflected in its long record of achievements. The number of operational child-care places has grown from 46,000 in 1983 to almost 208,000 by June 1993. The needs based planning system ensures that new community based child-care places go where. they are most needed. This year alone, the government will fund an additional $29,000 child-care places. This will bring the total number of child-care places to Z37,000. To keep the costs of child care affordable, the government's child-care assistance scheme now helps two-thirds of families using Commonwealth funded childcare centres. The government has also made it easier for families applying for child-care assistance to have their incomes assessed. The introduction of postal assessments means that families will no longer have to make a special visit to the Department of Social Security office. To ensure that children with special needs receive appropriate care, the government also provides supplementary service grants. The government also offers assistance through program support and special services to improve the quality and efficiency of childcare services. This bill is to establish the child-care rebate, which was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) before the last election. This rebate policy makes child care affordable for more Australians by including the informal child-care sector and also including many families who are currently ineligible for childcare assistance. This bill will enable the government to meet its objective of making quality child care affordable and accessible for all working families in Australia. This rebate provides a long overdue recognition that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for families in earning an income. With the wide variety of deductions available to some Australians in pursuing an income-$5 billion worth of deductions-it is only fair to extend this rebate to ordinary working Australians. Let us look at the mechanics of this excellent policy development. The child-care rebate will allow families to claim 30 per cent of child-care costs-after paying the first $16 per week-up to a cost ceiling of $110 a week for one child, and $220 a week for two or more children. The maximum weekly rebate will be $28.20 per week for one child$1,466 per year-and $61.20 per week for two or more children, representing $3,182 per year. The rebate will cost an estimated $152 million a year and will assist an estimated 230,000 families with an estimated 358,000 children. The rebate will be paid over and above child-care assistance-formerly called fee relief. The government decided to give this policy initiative by way of a rebate. Unlike a tax concession, a rebate can be claimed as the cost is incurred, rather than later. This facility is vital for many working families. A rebate will also ensure that women with low incomes also benefit, particularly women with part-time work or those who are studying and have no taxable income. The rebate will be payable through the Health Insurance Commission with effect from 1 July 1994. Families will be able to claim the rebate by mail or in person at any of the 240 Medicare offices around Australia. The cost of this initiative in 199495 will be $152 million. This is only one facet of the child-care debate. In my electorate of Lowe, the need for before and after school care is critical. The three main centres in Lowe requiring urgent assistance are Dobroyd Point, which provides before and after care; Concord West, which provides before and after care; and the Weldon Centre, which is situated in Burwood, also provides before and after care in Ashfield primary school and vacation care. I will be presenting the merits of these three vital facilities in Lowe to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe). Honourable members in the chamber should be aware oUhis problem, because it occurs not only in Lowe, but throughout Australia-especially in New South Wales. I will also be advancing the case for funding the Concord Cooperative Child Care Centre, which provides the new model of year round care, and which incorporates long day care, before and after school care and vacation care. The South Strathfield Centre wishes to provide long day care and vacation care and it will also require funds. The need for child care is well recognised in Australia. This parliament has a duty to help ordinary Australians earn a living by giving this most strategic help. I congratulate the government on this initiative. I commend the bill to honourable members.",66
146,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"I appreciate the action of the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) in not taking all of her time. I will certainly do the same in order to allow the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Dr Theophanous) to make a contribution to this debate. There are so many issues involved when looking at the departments which are being covered-the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services-that I can ,do no more than skate across the surface and perhaps mention one or two things of some significance. I want to mention the urgent need for a local office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to be established on the north coast New South Wales. I would not be selfish enough to ·demand that it should be in the electorate of Cowper-it would be entirely fitting and appropriate-but the need is there on the north coast. While I would like it to in my electorate, I would not object to its going anywhere to the north or south of my electorate because the need is there to serve the veterans in this rapidly growing area. We all know that the north coast of New South Wales is the fastest growing area of Australia, which is why, in the redistribution which took place last year, the new seat of Paterson was created at the bottom of the north coast. Consequential to that· growth of population, there was a very large increase in the numbers of veterans of World War II, from Vietnam and Korea, and other south east Asian conflicts. It is certainly· something that I urge the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) to consider establishing. It will not require an enormous amount of capital and it does not require an enormous number of staff. I ask the minister to consider using his existing faciliti- to create an office on the north coast of New South Wales to serve all of those people. I would also like to talk about a lot of the things being done by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, particularly in the area of community services. I note that the parliamentary secretary has been active recently in my electorate opening a number of additions to the facilities available. He always tells me how nic'- he is giving me millions of dollars for my electorate. I always go back to him and say, - Andrew, they are not your millions of dollars, they belong to the taxpayers'. It is not always appropriate to attack the government. I want to praise the government and the department for what they are doing in the area of community services. In recent times, the Vincent Court hostel containing another 40 beds was opened at Kempsey. It is a superb establishment being rim by a community organisation providing facilities for the aged. As well as that, Riverside Gardens, operated by Nambucca Valley Care of Ltd was opened at Nambucca Heads. It is another superb facility providing accommodation for the aged. Although not under that particular department, recently the Macksville Recreation Centre was opened. I want to give be high,praise to the Nambucca Shire Council, which seized upon the opportunity provided by the special funding under last year's budget for local government capital projects, for building an absolutely magnificent sporting centre. From the outside that sporting centre looks large, and I am sure the parliamentary secretary will agree with< me that from the inside it looks enormous-two full basketball courts and a grandstand for 200 people all under the one roof. It shows the vision of the Nambucca Shire Council in seeking and gaining that money. The state government also made a . substantial contribution. The final body I want to talk about under the community services mantle is an organisation which again is located in the Nambucca valley-the Nambucca Phoenix organisation. At Bowraville we had for disabled people a sheltered workshop, if that is the appropriate word to use-I know that these descriptions change and move in and out of fashionwhich was opened only last Saturday afternoon. It is a superb facility where people are producing pottery, a whole range of other things and operating a cafe and tearooms. It is a great pleasure to see disabled people able to make an absolutely first-rate contribution to society. I again applaud and praise the government for its funding. There was a rather difficult situation there. The Challenge organisation had closed down that facility and it had to be reopened and the department provided $55,000 to enable that to happen. It is only appropriate at the right time to say thank you on behalf of that community and to acknowledge that the government is doing the right thing in this area.",68
147,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,Thank you. There should be more of that kind of bipartisanship.,69
148,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"I certainly agree with the minister, and I am sure he would agree that I never fail to acknowledge thanks where it is absolutely appropriate and due. I would like to have talked about a lot of other things, I notice the clock and, because I know the parliamentary secretary has a contribution to make, I will limit my remarks at this time to what I have said. At some other time. I will seek to raise a number of other issues.",69
149,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (5.42 p.m.)-I thank the honourable members who have made contributions. We are under guillotine so there is not much time, but I want to particularly thank the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for their contributions. The honourable member for Cowper referred to a number of major programs and projects which have been launched in his electorate as a result of the work of the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. He is certainly assiduous in getting projects out of the department for his electorate. He should heed the words of the state member in his electorate who said that if I keep coming up to open projects in his electorate I will soon be the only person from a non-National Party of Australia side capable of being elected in the Cowper electorate. However, I want to refer to general matters on these appropriations for the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The programs outlined in the budget for these departments are of extreme importance for social justice for this country. The departments are at the delivering edge of the major social justice programs. We have to try to achieve as much as possible through bipartisan agreement on the issues concerning social justice in Australia to ensure that the programs for the departments are passed and become part of the general budget process that we are dealing with at the moment. I have been parliamentary secretary now for nearly six months. During that period I have been very impressed with the way in which but the programs have been organised and the way in which policy development has taken place. All of the ministers involved are assiduous and hard working. They are on top of their portfolios and are really out to deliver fairness and social justice for Australians in their areas of responsibility. The honourable member for Lowe mentioned all the child-care changes. I have introduced into this chamber a bill to deal with child-care changes, the dimensions of which are of historic importance to Australia. When talking about the budget it is interesting that so little is said about its positive features. Irrespective of political differences, for quite some time there has been talk on both sides of the chamber about deiivering child-care rebates for working parents. It is really good that we have managed to achieve that in this budget. The Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) has also introduced a number of initiatives in this budget. There are two initiatives worth referring to because of their great importance. One deals with fraud and overservicing. Overservicing by the medical profession has been an ongoing issue. A few years ago there was a lengthy inquiry by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, as a result of which certain changes were put in place. Unfortunately, that system has broken down to a certain degree or is not working as well as it should. I have introduced a bill into this House to refurbish the whole process of overservicing, and I am looking forward to introducing a bill to deal with fraud. Basically, we strongly support the medical profession but do not support people who try to rip off the nation through the misuse of their entitlements and positions as medical practitioners. There is also the matter of I reiterate what the minister has said in another place: we are very unhappy, to say the least, with the recent increases by the AMA to its scheduled fees. We believe that those increases are totally unjustified, given the low inflation in this country and given the fact that other sections of the community are not having wage increases and are bearing significant burdens. Although Senator Richardson has tried to develop a new era of cooperation with the AMA, we are very disappointed that the AMA has taken unilateral action to increase its scheduled fees. This will make medical costs much more difficult for ordinary people. These scheduled fee increases will create resentment towards doctors. I appeal to the AMA to rethink this matter. The AMA should consider its responsibility to the Australian public and in so doing recognise that, while doctors may benefit from these increases in the short term, in the longer term those increases will disadvantage the Australian population and may even create resentment against the medical profession. The other important problem within the health portfolio is that of hospital waiting lists. It is a difficult problem because we do not control the operation of hospitals; that is a state government matter. But we have said that we are prepared to work with the states to try to deal with this problem of waiting lists. The minister has put forward $100 million in the next three years to deal with this problem. Discussions are sti.11 being held on the actual way in which that money will be spent. There is an allocation of $25 million in this year's budget and other amounts will be allocated later. Interestingly, there are differences of ideas about that. One idea is that we try to buy hospital beds in private hospitals to help deal with the queues. The other idea is that we somehow increase the operating efficiency of public hospitalsperhaps the times during which they are open for operation, so that we get a bit more use of the existing facilities. That is another idea that is being looked at. But let me assure honourable members that the government will be bringing down recommendations in relation to costs. these matters. When we tum to the other areas of the portfolio, the area of local government in particular has been going through some significant transformation.",69
150,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES,"Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditures now before the committee has expired. Proposed expenditures agreed to. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Proposed expenditure, $2,182,224,000.  Estimates debates afford us an opportunity either to make some general statements or to go through, line by line, elements in the estimates which comprise the amount that the Deputy Chairman has just read out: I want to make a couple of points in generality, having regard to the brevity of the time available because of the guillotining of the debate. I returned only this morning from a visit overseas which involved my going to the United Nations. This was not a new experience for me, except that· on this occasion, instead of just finding that the names and dates had changed, there did appear to he a degree of more effective navel gazing to see whether the United Nations could playa more effective role and refonn itself. There seemed to be a greater degree of focusing on the need for refonn than has previously been the case. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) produced a book. It is true that anybody walking past the building in which our UN mission is resident, be they lame or blind, was thrown copies of this book, at cost to the government and no little inconvenience to the recipients, I am sure.",70
151,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"Very uncharitable.  this minister. But the General Assembly was hardly clamouring for copies of this book. I would like to say a word or two on what was produced by the minister. I did put out a detailed release on the day the book was released and do not intend to go through all those arguments. When I say the minister produced the book, it was produced at some considerable cost, I am sure, to the taxpayers and to the departmental officers who laboured on it with him. Nevertheless, it was an endeavour to examine many of the problems facing the United Nations today. For all the worth or otherwise of this publication, the fact remains that the government is divided on commitments to, for example, United Nations peacekeeping operations, if one can believe the overtly cautious and critical comments of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in this area. On the other hand, the book, in endeavouring to cover the role of the United Nations today, effectively ignores its crucially important mandate in global socio-economic development and therefore cannot claim, despite the cost, to be comprehensive in its coverage. However, it does focus on peacekeeping, peace enforcement, et cetera. The coalition is committed to the multilateral system embodied in the United Nations and other global institutions. We are committed to strengthening the effectiveness and credibility of cooperative international efforts to enhance global peace and security and facilitate economic integration, including through trade liberalisation and development cooperation. The passing of the Cold War, obviously, with the demise of the Soviet bloc, has led to a wider global consensus on democracy and market orientation. But there is also potential new instability-and that is before the world community daily at present-resulting from today's greater diversity of political and economic interests between nations. International conflicts are now generally great beyond the capacity of anyone country to handle, with the possible exception of the United States. So the international community is turning increasingly to the United Nations' role in peace and security with heightened expectations of what can be achieved. But the UN system, as the minister correctly assesses in the book, is desperately in need of refonn and restructuring. The system itself, its financing and the secretariat are dealt with in the book, sometimes with some worthwhile suggestions for change, at other times making what could only be described as heroic assumptions as to how approaches can be adopted. Furthennore, a number of the current UN peacekeeping operations reflect ad hoc decision making, especially in some of the most recent cases. UN military forces have had the power to use force in circumstances other than self-defence. Because of increasing acceptance that the UN should act to relieve global human suffering, the new types of operation have sometimes involved internal disputes within a state, impinging potentially on the sovereignty of the domestic government concerned. These are both very important and controversial new trends. Unquestionably, we need to work towards internationally agreed guiding principles in those areas. The debate about refonn of the UN is not going to be over in the next few months. I fear that it will not be successfully concluded by the 50th anniversary of the United Nations in 1995. In examining what the UN can achieve, I believe we should be very cautious about unduly raising expectations of just what it can do successfully. All international disputes must be treated as unique, as different from one to the other. We cannot simply categorise them into neat and distinct types of conflict and assume, as the book does on occasions, that an 'intellectual' professional approach to resolving these disputes will necessarily have a high chance of success. If honourable members doubt me on that, they should look at what is occurring in Bosnia today. Deeply rooted ethnic differences do not give way easily to so-called intellectual and detached arguments. But that discussion is for another day. We need to give priority to examination of the UN system. Senator Evans is doing that and I congratulate him on the endeavour that he is making, although God knows what the cost to the taxpayers-God may be the only one who does know; perhaps with some probing we may establish it-of this book has been. I cannot really, in the brevity of these remarks, discuss peacekeeping without touching on Cambodia. That, at least, has been a success for the UN and for the minister. I have congratulated him publicly and I do so again. He pushed at a difficult time a concept which became, in his own words, the only game in town. Whilst the measures adopted were not altogether mirroring what he had originally proposed, nevertheless he was instrumental in bringing about a successful UN involvement in Cambodia which was desperately needed. A government and a constitution have emerged in Cambodia and the United Nations contribution has wound down. There are still some UN personnel in the country; some, in fact, are coming out this very day. What I want to say, with only a minute or two remaining, is that despite the success of this endeavour, it was not there just to hold an election. It was not there just to buy time. In situations such as this, the buying of time is one thing; it is what is-done with the time bought that really counts. Here, the UN successfully bought time. It then did more than that it provided the means whereby the people could express their view to elect a government and more than 90 per cent turned out and voted. The assembly has adopted a constitution and a government is in place. The fact remains that Cambodia today is an economic basket case. With all the tragedy, human pillage and suffering that has occurred, it would be surprising if it were otherwise. With the departure of the UN, the economy will be even more grievously affected. Its infrastructure is ramshackle. There is virtually no law and order and it cries out for continuing international assistance. My remarks are not intended to in some way criticise the government for not offering enough, but to draw attention to the responsibilities of the international community today. Here is a classic case of successful UN intervention, yet the on-going responsibility of the international community remains. We have played a very instrumental role in what has transpired to date. We have successfully exercised a degree of leverage and purchase and we should be continuing-as I trust Senator Evans is-to ensure that Australia and the international community do not allow a situation to develop whereby, having elected a body, the nation nevertheless suffers.",71
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Before the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health commences, does the parliamentary secretary have principal responsibility for the government in the carriage of this matter before the House?",72
153,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government .and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (6.01 p.m.)-No, I will just speak for my 10 minutes.  are you?",72
154,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"I will be making some comments on what has been said by the honourable member for Kooyong, who has an international reputation in these matters. The honourable member made some comments about the book by Senator Evans and, quite frankly, I thought his comments were a little uncharitable. ",72
155,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"That is not what the honourable member for Kooyong said. The book by Senator Evans is obviously of great importance in at least two ways. The first is the way in which it deals with some of the entrenched ideas about reforming the United Nations and its operations. That is a matter of concern to everyone who has studied the issue. The second is the importance of ensuring that the UN is able to react to international crises of various kinds in the light of the so-called new worlq order-that is, the world situation since the end of the Cold War. It is true that most people are turning to the United Nations in the hope that it can ensure international order, peace and the resolution of disputes, especially those which result in armed conflict-and I refer particularly to ethnic conflicts. All of those things are important within the UN context and are discussed in the book. To that degree, I think that the book is very useful. It is true that the book does not go into issues of international economic relations, but I think what Senator Evans was trying to say was, given that there is some unde-standing between nations about the principles on which they are going to approach matters, how can we have a United Nations that operates effectively? It would require another book or set of principles to get another one?",72
156,Dr TBEOPBANOUS,COMMITTEES,I am talking about the need for intellectual development.  need for that!,73
157,Dr TBEOPBANOUS,COMMITTEES,I would.,73
158,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,It is entirely absent from the opposition side.,73
159,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"The Minister for Justice is quite correct. We now need a further work on how nations are going to develop, especially in their economic and trade relations, in the light of the demise of the Cold War. What we have seen so far is a bit of anarchy. Some people have called for more and more free trade while others have been calling for more proteCtion and the formation of blocs. The world now has to come to grips with what it is going to do to organise an international economic system that makes sense. For example, I refer to what has happened in the former Eastern bloc and Soviet countries which were encouraged to move to a market system and a new form of capitalist development. The problem there is that massive investment is needed for development to take place. In the Eastern bloc countries, the reality is that massive investment has not been forthcoming from the Western countries. So we have a situation where everyone encouraged the demise of Soviet communism, but when it actually collapsed-especially in the Baltic states and several other small countries in the former Eastern bloc-there was not enough Western support, especially by way of investment capital. That issue has to be resolved.  port, the conditions are crippling..",73
160,Dr THEOPBANOUS,COMMITTEES,"That is another matter. The honourable member for Kooyong is absolutely right; the conditions are crippling. There is also the question of whether, when individual companies invest, sufficient laws are in place to protect their rights. There are serious problems in this area and they have to be· addressed. On the one hand, there is a propensity for greater integration of western European countries-that has slowed down a little at the political level, while at the economic l-vel it is proceeding apace-but there is still significant protectionism especially of agricultural products. On the other hand, countries such as Australia are hoping that things will open up through GATT and that more open competition.will result. Unless there is a more positive and constructive agreement between countries on economic and trade relationswe all accept the idea of an international order where there is peace and non-violent behaviour-we will all get into serious difficulties. While all this has been happening, the Third World poverty issue has continued to be a big problem. Some former Third World countries have been able. to orient their economies in order to attract sufficient investment to move along and develop, but others have fallen even more by the wayside and are essentially economic basket cases. They will continue to need significant support just to keep people alive-never mind actually getting economic development going. The honourable member for Kooyong mentioned Cambodia and the very expensive and important process of holding a democratic election and putting a government into place. That process was successful but, as he mentioned, while some aid has been promised, it is nothing like the amount required for the reconstruction of Cambodia and to ensure that it will have a fair chance of participating in economic competition. Unless we actually do something more, unless we develop concepts for managing relations between nations postCold War, we will all be in trouble. I see the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), a former professor, on the other side of the chamber. I am surprised at the insufficient thinking that has taken place, in academe, on these questions. What was very significant about the developments after the demise of the Soviet Union was that, in a sense, practice and events overtook theory. There were many theoreticiaru saying that it was not possible for this to happen and that it was very unlikely that that would happen. In the meantime, it all happened and the theoreticians were left saying, 'What do we do about developing Poland or Russia? How do we install a system of privatisation that gives everybody a fair go?'. A lot of pain has been created in these countries because there has been insufficient thinking, and a lack of philosophical bases and practical measures on which to build development. We have a very big challenge ahead in foreign policYHhat of working out what is going to happen under the neW world order. It is not just a question of a formal order at the United Nations level; it is a question of relations between nations under this new system. One of the things that concerns Australia is the role of APEC. I was surprised that the honourable member for Kooyong did not mention APEC in his remarks. APEC has become extremely important to Australia. There is no doubt that the enthusiasm of the American government for greater focus on the Pacific area, the development of Asian economies, and the incorporation of Australia into the process, is a very positive development for us.",73
161,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES,"Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure now before the committee has expired. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development Proposed expenditure, $1,359,152,000. Department of Industrial Relations Proposed expenditure, $163,732,000.",74
162,Dr KEMP,COMMITTEES,"In the brief time allotted to me this evening I would like to focus on two areas, as they bear on the Department of Industry, Technology and Reeven gional Development. Both of these areas relate to the nation's premier research institution, the CSIRO, and the disruptive changes which the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) is trying to force upon this institution. In July of this year honourable members will recall that the minister announced his intention to establish, first of all, a new national institute for marine science, which would dismember two divisions of the CSIRO and place them in the new body. At the same time, he proposed to merge with the CSIRO the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO. When these proposals were put forward, the minister presented them as a fait accompli. In a desperate attempt to show that he was in charge of this portfolio-that he was someone to be reckoned with and that, although he was the junior minister in the area, he had clout-he tried to bulldoze these two proposals through without any consultation whatsoever with any of the bodies affected by the proposals. As a consequence of not having undertaken this consultation, it was quite clear that none of the implications or the various options which may have been available had been adequately considered. The effect on those people attempting ,to conduct the nation's scientific research in these organisations was quite devastating. They were already having to work in a circumstance where there was no clear, long-term strategy for science. They then found themselves subject to a form of policy making which destroyed any sense of continuity or purpose. that they had within these institutions. Let it be understood that each of these institutions-the CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS-has been going through a very significant process internally of adapting and changing its culture to the demands of the nation so that the very large sums spent on research in each of these institutions can be clearly applied to national priorities. The CSIRO itself, for example, under the leadership of Dr Stocker, had gone through a very major process of priority setting which had very considerable impact on those engaged in scientific research within that institution. But when that process had been virtually completed, as it has been recently, the scientists felt that they had some assurance that they then knew where they were going. Into this situation came the new Minister for Science and Small Business determined to make his reputation. Suddenly the scientists found that their whole assumption about where their institution was going and how their work might proceed had been completely overthrown. Not only were these specific proposals that the minister maQe, but also this process had been followed to implement these proposals, and this, in itself, carried with it the threat that there could be no certainty once these changes had been implemented, the scientists functioning and working in these institutions could have certainty and security for the future. The minister was faced with what almost amounted to a revolt throughout the science community in this country. There was virtually no support for the proposal to merge ANSTO with the CSIRO. There was almost no support-there was some support-for the proposal to break off two of the - ajor divisions of the CSIRO, oceanography and fisheries, and there was a lot of speculation for a period about the future of atmospheric research. The opposition made it very clear that these proposals, taken without consultation, were absolutely unacceptable and that we would oppose them in the Senate. The effect, I am pleased to say, is that the Expenditure Review Committee and the cabinet informed Senator Schacht that it was simply not prepared to go along with this set of recommendations and that there would have to be some process of consultation before any final decisions were taken. So an IDC was established to consider the future of ANSTO and CSIRO and a separate inquiry, the MCKinnon inquiry, was established to consider a national institute of marine science. We have a government without a strategy for science. The white paper that was brought down was universally conceded and recognised in the science community to be unsatisfactory. There has been no strategic statement by the government this year. So without any strategy, and with every indication that· the minister intended to proceed in wilful ignorance of the work that was being done in these institutions, a very serious situation· has developed in the science community. In one of the many critical newspaper editorials of the time, the Canberra TImes said: . . . in the past decade or so the hassled scientists have spent so much time and emotional energy over shake-ups or threats of shake-ups, and in defending their funding or applying for funding, that they have much less time and energy left for getting on with the job of science. It is time to end the incessant, destructive, bureaucratic meddling with Australia's scientific organisations. that, The MCKinnon report is due at the end of October. Recently I had the opportunity to visit both of the affected divisions of the CSIRO, the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville and other institutions concerned with tropical marine research in Townsville-the James Cook University and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. I had the opportunity to discuss with them the implications of the sorts of changes that were being proposed. One thing is very clear. First of all, through the efforts and energies of the scientists and administrators involved in these institutions in Townsville, Australia has developed an outstanding world-class centre of tropical marine research. The second concern that is clear is that there is every prospect that, if Senator Schacht's proposals are proceeded with, this tropical marine research effort will be scaled back to meet the costs of establishing a new institution. This would have the inevitable result of the establishment of a national institute with a focus other than tropical marine scientific research. This would be a tragedy for what has been built up and, indeed, in terms of Australia's national priorimedium ties. So far as the work of the IDC is concerned, I hope that we will see that report made public after it has been before the cabinet so we will know what the basis of its recommendations may be. But it is very hard to see that any positive purpose will be gained by the merger of ANSTO with the CSIRO. No decisive arguments have so far been put forward on the public record. ANSTO is a well functioning organisation. It has done a lot of work in bringing its management efficiency up to scratch. It does not wish to go into the CSIRO;' the CSIRO does not wish to have it. Any attempt to force that merger will be immensely disruptive to the research of both organisations. (Time expired)",74
163,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES, I call the parliamentary secretary. Is the parliamentary secretary acting as the minister in charge of these departments?,76
164,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (6.21 p.m.)- Yes, Mr Deputy Chairman. The industry, technology and regional development portfolio is the most important economic portfolio in the federal government apart from Treasury, This country is fortunate in having the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) whoably assisted by Senator Schacht-has put in place a dynamic set of new initil\tives in this budget to enhance business development in Australia. These initiativeS include a network of first26th stop shops offering ready and comprehensive access to information on a· full range of federal and state government programs; the establishment of an on-line computer service called Businesslink· to support the first - stop shops; and the expansion of the National Industry Extension Service, known as NIES. Smaller firms will be given greater assistance to enhance market opportunities both locally and overseas, to adopt best practice, and to help meet export requirements. Another initiative involves an extension of export access. This is a trade facilitation and enterprise development program for small and exporters. An additional $8 million over three years will enable a further 800 companies to develop their export potential. Another initiative-the commitment to the pharmaceutical industry development program-has been maintained. In 1993-94 funding will be approximately $130 million. This will provide a sound base for the pharmaceutical industry to achieve exports of $2 billion by the year 2000. I refer briefly to research and technology. Government support for major science and innovation programs for 1993-94 will increase. Long-term government support for science and technology is achieving an attitudinal change in industry. Research and development in the business sector has now reached $2.2 billion. This is a real increase of 4.6 per cent over' last year. Funding for CSIRO, now at $468 million, is a-very important part of the science and technology budget. Interested members will be aware of the very great contribution this organisation has made to Australian industry. CSIRO's rural based manufacturing division has a long record of success, particularly in the wool and wood products industries. New emphasis is being placed on this research which has the potential to benefit regional Australia by adding value to our rural products. A recent example of the success of this research is the invention of an electro-magnetic scanner which measures the amount of fat in cartoned beef. The scanner, Emscan MQ-27, won the 1993 food industry innovation award at the national Food Horizons conference held in Adelaide. Regional development is a new priority for the industry portfolio. Regional Australia knows what the opposition's policy is on regional development. Yet I recall that in virtually every maiden speech of members of parliament from both sides of the chamber, time was given to the issue of regional development. One issue of concern to me-I notice the shadow minister for rural and regional development, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), is in the chamber, and I would like him to respond to this-and to the people who live in regional Australia is that the opposition appears to support the Industry Commission's prescription of 'greater flexibility in wages and work practices'. That is a code for lower wages. If that is so, the opposition supports a policy that would result in those who live in our over-crowded cities such as Sydney being paid more and those in the bush being paid less. We reject that approach. We reject the misguided view that low wages are the route to success in modern capital and skill intensive industries in this country. We believe regional development policies should be constructive, not destructive. There is an important role for government in. providing both leadership and hope in a practical way at a regional level. I am continually impressed by the enthusiasm and energy of people in regional Australia to strive for the development of their particular region. This government is examining ways of enhancing a cooperative approach to industry development between all three levels of government and industry. The report of the task force on regional development will be a major contribution to developing a constructive approach to regional development. The Kelty task force has now participated in 60 meetings with regions all over Australia, and there are a further 23 meetings planned at this stage. What has been the response of the opposition to the Commonwealth's most significant effort in many years to listen to regional Australia? All we have had to date has been sniping, carping criticism. What is the Opposition's plan? It will not listen to regional Australia, and it has its prescriptionunless I hear from the shadow minister tonight that he rejects the Industry Commission prescription-which is lower wages and a document called Fightback. The Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission in its latest publication of September 1993 has welcomed this initiative by the Commonwealth government in establishing a regional development task force. This is an important initiative that has widespread support throughout the community. As I said earlier, this is an issue which has been spoken of in maiden speeches by members from both sides of the chamber. Wherever I go in this country, it is an issue that people of all political persuasions are taking very seriously in a non-partisan political way to try to achieve development and new industry in their particular region. Under this government, industry manufacturing has prospered. Exports of manufactures and services have increased, particularly in the high value added elements. We have improved infrastructure efficiency. Investment levels have risen, and the innovation and that research and development industry has increased. We now have significant economic growth relative to other major industrialised countries. We are the 12th biggest economy in the OECD. We have a growth rate of 3.3 per cent to 3.4 per cent, which is the highest in the OECD. We have industrial harmony. We have historically low interest rates. We have historically low inflation of about 1.9 per centthe lowest in the OECD. We have a very competitive investment regime. We have low labour costs compared with some of the so called economic tigers in Asia, substantially improved company balance sheets, and a very competitive business taxation regime. All that has been introduced by this government. Tax tariff reform is in progress. Corporate tax reform, including lower company tax rates, acceleration of depreciation, general investment allowance, and development allowances, all combine with other aspects of micro-economic reform in shipping, the waterfront industries, and the air transport and telecommunication industries to lay down a regime which encourages industry development in regional Australia in the highly competitive technological environment that this country is currently facing from its competitors. As I said in my opening remarks, this budget is a tribute to the energy and dedication of the Minister for Industry, Techno logy and Regional Development, ably assisted by his junior minister, Senator Schacht.",76
165,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) comes in here and talks about regional rural development as part of Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94. I remind the parliamentary secretary that regional rural development has been on the coalition's agenda for a lot longer than it has been on the government's agenda. It was only in the dying hours of the 1993 election campaign that the government announced that it was to have a department of regional development, and that was only after the coalition had clearly made it an agenda item. Suddenly, the government was shamed into doing something about regional development. Since the election the government has announced the creation of the Office of Regional Development. To allow 30 minutes for debate on the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development is not sufficient. Instead of the parliamentary secretary criticising this side of the House, he should be looking at making a lot more time available for debate on this portfolio. Regional development has become the 1990s Labor Party buzz terminology word. It is terminology that is dressed up with nowhere to go. The government's approach is fragmented, unclear and certainly susceptible to political overture. This comes at the expense of our nation's struggling regional and rural communities. The parliamentary secretary comes from Townsville and he would know that Australia's population is progressively drifting northwards and outwards to the coastal regions. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that 1,000 people are moving from southern states to Queensland every week. By the year 2030 it is predicted that Brisbane will be Australia's second largest city. The far north statistical division in Queensland, encompassing the remote Cape York, Weipa, Cook and the regional centre, Cairns, has experienced 20 per cent growth since 1986hardly acknowledged by the government. The trend is clearly northwards and it is clearly outwards from the inland of Australia. This is borne out by the figures in the statistical division of south-west Queensland where there has been a negative growth rate of two per cent. In Victoria, the Melbourne statistical division has increased by 5.4 per cent whilst the western division of Victoria has seen a negative growth rate of one per cent. Likewise, in New South Wales we find that the Sydney statistical division has increased by 5.2 per cent and the far western division has decreased by 3.4 per cent. This has all occurred after 11 years of Labor government-a government that boasts that it knows something about regional and rural development. This pattern of outwards and upwards growth is repeated right across the nation. Unfortunately, the move is to our major capital cities. We have a situation in Australia where 60 per cent of the nation's population lives in our five major capital cities. Under this government, regional development in Australia in the 1990s is largely proceeding as a product of disindustrialisation. The economic emphasis is changing from farming and manufacturing to technological and information based services. This government sees technology and information based services as sunrise industries. I have to support that approach, we certainly see them as sunrise industries; but we should not be talking about the farming and manufacturing industries as sunset industries. Clearly there is no commitment from this government to our farming and rural communities who are desperately in need of some support. Regional industrial centres such as Newcastle, Wollongong, the Latrobe Valley in Victoria and major regions in South Australia and Tasmania are feeling the squeeze from the macro policy settings of deregulation, reduced government expenditure and tariff reductions. I am sure the parliamentary secretary would agree that the government has proceeded down this path with little examination of its impact on regional Australia. Rural communities are faced with increasing economies of scale in local agriculture, a decline in the agricultural economy and a loss of services. As a result of these circumstances, regional and rural communities are left with small populations and abundant infrastructure. The western New South Wales city of Broken Hill is capable of catering for a cent increase in its current population of 22,000. In the last decade Broken Hill had 35,000 people. Clearly, it has services and infrastructure available for 35,000 people when it has only 22,000 people living there today. Meanwhile, in Melbourne and Sydney it is estimated to cost public authorities up to $40,000 to service new quarter acre blocks. Recent studies have shown that these costs are largely hidden from the consumer through the underpricing of services such as electricity, water, sewerage, public transport, road and rail-in other words, through the provision of housing subsidies. This has led to urban sprawl, resource overuse and environmental degradation and has contributed to a lack of demand for cheaper housing in non-metropolitan country areas as householders have not had to meet the real costs of services. federal government's response to these pressing regional and rural issues has been curious, to say the least. Currently there exists an urban and regional development review advisory group, assisting the urban and regional development review team, assisting the task force on regional development, which is being assisted by a consultancy-the successful applicant was announced today-investigating the factors affecting investment in regional Australia. We also have a comprehensive Industry Commission report on regional adjustment as well as the Office of Regional Development. I ask the parliamentary secretary whether that is what he calls regional development. The government is totally lost and is unable to give direction on regional and rural development in this nation. Today the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) announced that the MCKinsey company had been successful in bidding for the regional development consultancy. That company is to receive $1.25 million from this budget. Whilst I concede that the minister could do with a bit of assistance in the area of regional development, I believe that $1.25 million to advise him on his portfolio is a bit rich. It is also a bit rich to ask the Australian taxpayers to chip 60 per in $1.25 million to develop Labor Party regional and rural development policy. To this plethora of opinion, advice and information that the government is receiving from local government areas right across Australia, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last Friday announced the re-establishment of what was known as the Prime Minister's country task force. This task force is now to be known as the Prime Minister's Rural and Regional Task Force, and it is to be chaired by the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods). But it does not end there. A range of programs and policies are jointly administered by the federal and state governments, others are funded by the federal government and administered by the states, and still others are jointly funded and administered solely by state governments. In fact, the proliferation of labour market schemes The and the substantial expenditure involved has prompted the Industry Commission to recommend an independent public review of the role and effectiveness of labour market programs. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Office of Labour Market Adjustment operating within the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services and now, of course, the Office of Regional Development all have an interest in the concept of regional development. The result is obviously a duplication of effort and a lack of clear means of differentiating areas of responsibility. The establishment of the Office of Regional Development has failed to introduce any structure or cohesion into the regional development debate. In fact, it has simply added to the myriad of fragmented regional policies headed nowhere. There is no defined role for the Office of Regional Development other than to assess programs designed to assistregional development at federal, state and local government levels. The body count is very high. I think the parliamentary secretary body will be on the pile very shortly, as well as that of the minister. Regional development is about more than appealing to the Labor heartlandsuffering drastic population loss. It is about the very real structural adjustment problems that are set to escalate under this government, particularly in this technological age. It will never be addressed without the necessary political will. (TIme expired)",78
166,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES," The time allotted for the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development and the Department of Industrial Relations has now expired. Proposed expenditures agreed to. Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories Proposed expenditure, $482,829,000.",80
167,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES," Of that amount of $482,829,000, $183,857,000 is for the environment. For around $184 million of expenditure I have 10 minutes to talk, owing to the guillotine. That is not enough time. I wonder how taxpayers feel about having their $184 million dismissed in 10 minutes? I will address some of the environment issues. I notice that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is not at the table and neither is the relevant parliamentary secretary. There are no advisers from the environment department; so there is no-one listening in the chamber who has any authority from the government on the environment. In the budget, a sum of $100,000 is attributhad ed to a lead strategy __ the government wanted to collect several billiOn dollars from a lead tax. We heard the minister, before the budget, go on and on about how terribly important it was to the children of Australia to get the lead tax up. We expected to see a lot of money for that in the budget. If the children were so dear to the minister that she had to appear in the media, on radio and television, day after day saying how important it was to have the lead petrol tax why do we get only $100,000 for a lead strategy? I question the sincerity of the minister and her commitment to the health of Australian children. The minister has also spoken a lot recently about World Heritage. She is very fond of that subject. She has just put up Lake Eyre for World Heritage listing. She has said what a great thing it is to have parts of Australia on the international register for World Heritage. Let us look at her record and see what has been done for World Heritage. No money has been provided in this year's budget for Willandra Lakes, for example. A question was asked about that during estimates hearings and it was found that no money had been put aside for it, despite money being put aside for 'new listings'. The Willandra Lakes area has been on World Heritage listing for 13 years. But since this government has come to power, nothing has been done for it. I went there with my researcher and found absolutely no infrastructure to protect the great archaeological heritage that is Willandra. There was absolutely nothing. Children were running over the mounds. The centuries had deposited sand, with the result that Aboriginal habitation can be traced. I was taken to Aboriginal burial sites-the skeletons were there. Nothing has been done by the Commonwealth to protect this World Heritage site. The land-holders had been mistreated and had lost a considerable amount of income and capital. This government, which talks so much about World Heritage and how keen it is to have the Lake Eyre basin on the list, has done nothing for Willandra Lakes. The story for Lord Howe Island is similar. It has a massive sewage problem but it has no input from this government since it was put on the World Heritage List. I question the Minister's genuine commitment to World Heritage. I suggest that she uses World Heritage as a way of getting publicity-and for no other reason. Mr Ronaldson-She is very good at that.",80
168,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES,"She is very good at publicity, as my colleague has just mentioned. One of Australia's major environmental . problems is feral animals: rabbits, foxes, cats, goats, pigs, horses and donkeys. Mr O'Keefe-It sounds like Noah's ark.",80
169,Mrs GALLUS,COMMITTEES,"It is a Noah's ark, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and 'Communications said-but a very inappropriate one. The parliamentary secretary finds it funny but perhaps he would not find the cost to Australia of those feral animals so funny. Perhaps his attitude is the same as that of the minister. I went through her press releases, trying to find statements what she thinks about this major problemand what she is doing. I found one very. small press release about feral animals. Yet we are facing a major problem. At the moment the states are trying to get their act together-not very well-on domestic cats. Each state is trying to do something, but where is the Commonwealth leadership? It is absolutely nowhere. In the centre of Australia, feral cats as big as dogs are wiping out the native animal populations. The minister talks about endangered species but not about how she is going to control the foxes and feral cats which are totally and utterly decimating native species. Another area on which we have heard the minister talk, but on which nothing has been achieved, is waste. I have been talking to waste recyclers, especially in the plastics industry. They have said unanimously that the minister and department do not understand anything about waste or industry. They expect recyclers to recycle but,they do not realise that buying the recycled goods costs more than buying the virgin materials. There is no leadership from the minister or her department. I could talk about the IGAE and the rumours of its imminent collapse. What' has happened to the AESC, originally NEPA, on which the minister failed to give a Commonwealth comrilitment to abide by state laws when the Commonwealth was operating interstate? I could mention what has happened-or not happened-with. the ESD process. The group, six months after the strategy that was set up, has not met. I turn to the point of the budget papers and how absolutely impossible it is to find any information about the environment department in them. In Budget Paper No. l-understandably-the environment is not listed, because the budget comes under a European convention. The only recourse is to go to the program performance statements. They contain no listing of how much is spent on individual strategies. The information is broken up into 10 sub-departments, each of which is listed simply as spending money on staff, administration and environment proon grams. So what we get at the end is a summary of 10 lots of environment programs with no division into what the money is spent on and how it is spent. The minister seems to be much more interested in the procedures and setting up strategies than in accomplishing things. Money is allocated all over in small dribs and drabs. The amounts go all over the place. There does not seem to be any way of setting a goal and saying, 'This is where we are going'. It is divided into strategies that will give the minister a high electoral profile and publicity, but do not achieve anything.",81
170,Mr RONALDSON,COMMITTEES,"Ballarat) (6.48 p.m.)There is only a very short time available, 20 minutes, for not only the environrrient and territories, but for the whole portfolioincluding the Olympic Games, which is to be held in this country in seven years. Tha,t shows that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is paying lip-service to the Olympic movement. We all know how aggrieved she is to have missed out on all the post-olympic publicity. In the performance statements for the portfolio the first thing I will look at comes under the outlook for 1993-94. It refers to the government's response to the physical education and sport inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I presume the department is talking about the physical and sport education inquiry, and one would have thought the department might have got the wording right. In relation to 1993-94, we are talking about the response. That inquiry, which became affectionately known as the Crowley inquiry, released its report in December 1992. It is now nearly the middle of October 1993, and we have not yet heard one word from the minister about when she will respond to it, except for some fairly vague references in the program performance statements for the portfolio. To make it worse, what did we see on the front page Of a Sydney paper last Sunday? We saw the minister having a go at the New South Wales government. She said that it was undermining the games effort by neglecting the physical education of school children. How dare she appear in the Sydney press having a go at the New South Wales government when this country and the sports community right throughout Australia have been waiting for nearly 12 months for her to respond to the Crowley report. The amazing thing is that the Victorian government was elected in October 1992, and last month it released the Moneghetti report on physical and sport education for Victorian schools. This new government had been left with the most extraordinary legacy of debt in the state's history but, despite all that, it had there. the time and the will to get the expertise to produce that report. The minister, who has had nothing more pressing on her plate than getting her picture taken, has had nearly 12 months to consider the matter, and still she fails to respond to the Crowley report. I will put the minister on notice that, if this report is a toothless tiger, she will be hunted from one end of this country to the other by me, and she can rest assured that she will be hunted from one end of this country to the other by every person in the sports industry. Every single one of them is looking for her to respond in a positiye light. There are a number of other matters that I want to raise in relation to the appropriations for this portfolio. The. community, cultural and recreational sporting facilities program is one area in which the budget was padded up last year. Of course, it was padded up again this year because of the unexpended amounts. Do honourable members think that anyone can apply under the program for this year? The answer is no. The funding has closed. No applications will be taken for 1993-94, but I will bet my bottom dollar that, in the August budget next year, out of the papers will spring another program. That will happen because there is an election coming up in that year or the year after. All the way through this program has been designed for no other reason than the political purposes of the minister. The political purposes of the minister have been served by this programand we are talking about a lot of money. I am not saying that, by some extraordinary chance, some projects have not slipped through when they were justifiably put into areas where they should have been. But if honourable members look at the program, look at where it has been applied and get anecdotal evidence from right around the country, they will find it has been a great political con. It has been the most obscene political con that has ever been seen in this portfolio-and, I rather suspect, in any portfolio. It will rear its head in next year's budget, and the program will be abused by this minister, as it has been abused by her already, in the unlikely event that she is still The program performance statements for this portfolio refer to a number of other matters. I refer to the Australian Sports Commission, which is dealt with in subprogram 4.3, and the increased level of private sector support. There has been a lot of talk about increasing private sector support, but I cannot see anything in these statements which says that the minister has attended to that and that she is actually going to give some decent incentives to attract private sector support. .She could be looking at taxation incentives, or she could be looking at the proper use of the Australian Sports Foundation. While I am talking about the Australian Sports Foundation, I ask honourable members to cast their minds back to 28 April this year when the Federal Police and taxation officers carried out raids on the homes of sportspersons in all parts of the country. The raids were mainly in relation to yachts men and women throughout Australia. The Federal Police and taxation officers did not arrive at 10 o'clock in the morning with a knock on the door, saying, 'Can I have a cup of tea and a chat with you?'; these were dawn raids which involved dragging people out of their beds. Mrs Gallus-Shame!",81
171,Mr RONALDSON,COMMITTEES,"Yes; shame, indeed, on them. They dragged people out of their beds. It scared the living daylights out of a lot of people. Women were dragged out of bed in their pyjamas. They were quite rightly scared stiff. I wrote to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) oil 9 June and asked him a number of questions. I asked the Treasurer: in light of comments made by the Federal Police-&nd during the raids, Federal Police officers had said to these people that they were going to be charged-how many people have been charged with fraud and, indeed, have any charges been laid and against whom? I also asked: How many donations to the Australian Sports Foundation has the Australian Tax Office disalAntarctica, lowed? That was going to be the other part of it. The letter also states: In relation to those for whom deductions have disallowed, how many penalties notices have been issued? I also asked the Treasurer: Has the Australian Tax Office sought to clarify rules regarding donations to the Australian Sports Foundation? In declaring these gifts to the ASF, has the Australian Tax Office considered them deductible on the basis of Section 78A of the or is it relying on some other section? The letter then states: As you are no doubt aware, there is great concern within the sporting community that until this is clarified, future donations to the Australian Sports Foundation may be prejudiced. I therefore respectfully request your urgent reply. These raids were common knowledge right throughout the world. The sports industry a big industry, but it is also a small industry. The raids have done irreparable damage to sports industry in this country. Do honourable members think the Treasurer has bothered to reply to that letter? Do honourable members think he has bothered to reply to a follow-up letter? No, he most certainly has not. This minister has to start getting on top of her. portfolio or she needs, quite frankly, My colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is - ooking for two minutes to speak. Again, it is disgraceful that we only 20 minutes but I will allow him the opportunity to contribute. MrNEHL (Cowper) (6.58 p.m.)-I must say that I am grateful to both previous speakers' the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), for their generosity in giving a little of their time. In the very limited time that is available I want to talk about Australia's contribution to Antarctic research. I start by, paying a tribute to the tremendous job being done by the ANARE expeditioners at Macquarie Island, Casey, Davis and Mawson. I look forward to seeing some of them when they return. The rebuilding program, which has made such a marked impact on our presence in has just about finished. But Antarctic research is still critical. It is critical to global climate change and, in spite of all the work that has been done, still only very limited information is available throughout the been world on what is actually happening in Antarctica. We need to maintain and enhance our scientific research if the Antarctic region is the not to become the weak link in researching the global impact on climate. I note that the nonRussians, because of the problems they are ITAA having, have closed three out of their seven bases, and the other four are probably operating only as holding operations. The United Kingdom has closed down one base, and another is now only a summer operation. It is matter moving into an air supported system, which will enable it to maintain a broad regional coverage of Antarctica. I suggest to the department that we should is be doing the same. We need to improve our mobility and flexibility, and we should acthe knowledge that 'Mawson has the longest climate record of any station in Antarctica. Thy research that is being undertaken on the upper atmosphere and on ocean currents is vitally important to the future of world climate. The heat exchange between the Antarctic icecap and the rest of the world is also of to resign. critical importance. In the last seconds remaining to me to speak, I want to talk about the sea ice. In have summer the sea ice is four million square kilometres and in winter it expands to 22 million square kilometres. It reflects light heat back into the atmosphere and, without it, global wanning would increase significantly. With only a small rise in temperature there would be no sea ice at all, and the impact of that would be fatal for our climate.",83
172,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES," Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories has expired. Proposed expenditure agreed to. - epartment of Immigration and Ethnic Proposed expenditure, $429,812,000.",84
173,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"I want to draw some comments from the actual resource commitments that are being made in the portfolio of immigration and ethnic affairs because they are quite significant. The total outlays for 1993-94, the year that we are discussing, are $446,690,000. That is a substantial increase on the $383,742,000 actually spent last year. Where are these additional commitments? There is an additional commitment of $8 million for entry processing, on top of the $124 million that was spent last year. There is an increase in the area of settlement expenditure and, as a result of this budget, some increased recoupment of funds by the government in that area. Total expenditure rises by $22 million from $135 million to $157 million. While those figures are significant in themselves, they are not the figures that I want to address. The figure I want to address is the almost 100 per cent-in fact, it is in excess of 100 per cent-'-increase in the detennination of refugee status, which rises from $28 million to $57,974,000 in these estimates; a doubling of the amount of money that is required to detennine refugee status in Australia. These are the chickens, coming home to roost, of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) from his former life as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The cost to the Australian taxpayer of refugee detennination is a· direct result of decisions that were taken by the Treasurer when he was the minister for education, when and he sought to advance Australia's interests by encouraging students to come to Australia to study, the great bulk of whom had no intention of studying in Australia but were seeking a poor man's business migration route. A very large number of students were able to come to Australia by the payment of a $6,000 or $7,000 fee up front to an English language college. We were told in the estimates discussions in another place by the secretary to the department, in answer to a question from the shadow minister, that some 18,000 PRe Affairs students arrived in Australia before the Tiananmen Square massacre and 9,000 of their partners have been allowed to join them here and are likely to join a refugee queue unless the government decides, miraculously, to allow all of them to stay in Australia on some concessional basis-a basis on which we would not allow anybody else from any other part of the world to stay. I do not know what decision the government is going to make in relation to that matter, but we do know that the government has not had the courage to make a decision to date. It did not have the courage to make a decision on this matter before the last election or announce what it intended, and still no decision has been announced. We need to look at both sides of the coin in relation to matters of this sort. The people involved are left in limbo. They do not know what their future holds. They have no basis upon which they can plan for their future. :/ There could be yet another decision by this government to discriminate in favour of some on the basis of their race or country of origin but, on the other side of the coin, to discriminate against all others, by not giving them the same benefit, because of their race or country of origin. Given some of the debates that have occurred in this place before, I think we need to clearly understand the potential in relation to this matter. As a result of the decision that was taken at that time by the previous Prime Minister, and the decision that was put in the train by the Treasurer when he was education minister, we have had many other people in Australia-some of them students from the People's Republic of China and others from other parts of the world-who have thought that if it was good enough for the Chinese students it was also good enough for them, and they have lodged applications for refugee status. So the government has had to put in place procedures to be able to deal with that matter. The cost of that is a doubling of the moneys necessary for that task. I want to take up one other matter in these estimates discussions tonight. It has not been my practice to raise matters relating to the administration of the department, except when politicians get involved in administration. When I was the shadow minister for immigration, I was very critical of the way in which the former secretary to the department, Mr Brown, was dumped, largely at the behest of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and his deputy secretary was quickly moved away at the same time. Although he was later employed, I think in the Treasurer's office, and eventually found a slot in New South Wales as the Auditor-General, he was essentially shafted as deputy secretary in the same midnight action by the previous Prime Minister in a determination to bring about a change in the culture of the department of immigration. I do not know what change in culture the Prime Minister thought might occur, but I have looked at the results that have followed and the problems that have been identified in the program performance statements of the department of immigration in relation to morale within the department, the confidence of officers within the leadership of the department and the changes that have occurred in personnel in the department-I must say, it appears, this time without a political effort by those in this place. We have seen one deputy secretary to the department, who had survived the previous purging, suddenly moved after the election. One wonders about his future. I understand he now has some tasks to undertake in DEET but, having regard to his capacities and abilities, it seems to me that that is a utilising somebody with skills well beyond the task. The police were called into investigate the activities of certain departmental officers after some complaints had been made in a court case and a senior officer was stood down-it has been suggested at some expense to his health. He has been cleared as a result of all of the investigations that have been undertaken, and when I last inquired about this matter he had not been restored to the previous tasks that were his responsibility and about which the investigation revealed no substantial complaint. I regard activities of this sort within the department with a great deal of concern. I know my colleague in the other place has equally regarded it with a great deal of concern, and in these estimates discussions has raised this issue time and time again-and appropriately, in my view-and sought an independent inquiry into the administration of the department. If that independent inquiry is not forthcoming the Senate might seek to undertake an inquiry of its own motion, in much the same way as I understand the Senate did in relation to another department. We are now shadowed with the great reform bill that we passed, in expectation that it would be able to be implemented this year, with a request from the government that it be postponed. I have to ask whether the people responsible have had their eyes on the ball in administrative terms when we are being asked in legislation to postpone a significant initiative such as that and its implementation. (TIme expired)",84
174,Mr NEHL,COMMITTEES,"I am particularly grateful for the non-appearance of the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who was next to speak. If he does appear, I will yield some time to him. I would like to start by paying a tribute to the impact of migrants on this wonderful country of ours. Those who try to argue that we have not benefited enormously from migration have not had their eyes open. If we look around any part of Australiathe major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne are most .obvious as large migrant case of areas-we see that migration has had an impact. I do not know of any part of this wonderful country where there has not been some impact. In my electorate of Cowper in the northern part of the area-the Coffs Harbour region-we have in excess of 5,000 people for whom English is a second language. That is a significant number in a regional electorate. The two major groups are people of Italian origin and the Indian community at Woolgoolga, who are SHms from the Punjab. The Italians in our community have been there for so long that I am sure most people do not even think of them as being of a migrant group anyway. They are very sensible and maintain their culture. I had the very great pleasure of attending the Italian community's carnivale night only recently which was organised by a lady who was the stalwart of the Italian community, Mrs Nellie Spagnolo. This, I think, is symbolic of the way migration has helped Australia and the people who have come from overseas have settled in. The other major group, as I said, is the Indian group from the Punjab and they, too, have made a tremendous contribution to the area. While there has been the odd instance of problems in the immigration area, by and large the Sikh people, of Woolgoolga are superb. They bend over backwards to maintain the image and integrity of their community and I have nothing but praise for them. We need to acknowledge that illegal immigration in Australia remains at very high levels. I have been provided with figures that suggest that currently there are 80,000 illegal immigrants in Australia, compared with 79,800 at the end of lTune 1993 and 82,000 at the end of 1992. I - m not certain how anybody could be quite so accurate with the number of illegal immigrants within the country. If we were able to count them, they would not be there now. Nonetheless, I am sure it is a very significant number. Because of that fairly high number of illegal immigrants within our community, the integrity of Australia's immigration program is at risk. It is very costly for the taxpayers. In 1992-93 the government spent $50 million on tracking down illegal immigrants. That is a significant amount of money, which we can ill afford. I know that the officers in the overseas posts do their utmost in scrutinising visa applications; in fact, they do that so very well that I am frequently getting complaints from people within the community who are seeking to get relatives to join them in Australia. I think we should be aware that our overseas posts are doing the right thing by Australia and by the people who are seeking to come here. The legal migrants in Australia, that very large number of people who are making a contribution to Australia, are suffering at the hands of the Keating government and under the harsh budget, as is every Australian. I note that the honourable member for Calwell has entered the chamber. I take this opportunity of yielding to him. Migration in Australia has vastly benefited all of us.",85
175,Dr THEOPHANOUS,COMMITTEES,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (7.16 p.m.)-I apologise for the delay. As honourable members would know, there is a big debate going on about Mabo. As usual, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) came into the chamber and again tried to attack the government on a number of issues in relation to the immigration portfolio. This government remains committed in its consistent line of support for multiculturalism and immigration in this country. Unlike the opposition parties, which have wavered all over the place in the last 10 yearssometimes supporting immigration and sometimes not; often criticising multiculturalism and on another occasion saying that they are in favour of multiculturalism-the Australian Labor Party has been consistent in its principle support for multiculturalism. This is not a theoretical issue; it is a very important matter. A number of key points were the cause of our winning the Olympic Games for Sydney. One of those key points was the fact that we were able to make a presentation which showed that modern Australia is a multicultural society. It is a society which is committed to, and based on, the idea of diversity and of respect for a range of different cultures. The IOC delegates saw the orientation and the commitment of the government of Australia. Indeed, the Liberal government of New South Wales is unambiguous in its support for multiculturalism, as distinct from the federal Liberal Party which is all over the place, depending on who makes a statement. The reality is that our commitment to multiculturalism is sustained, it is consistent and it will continue. The Prime Minister (Me Keating) made it perfectly clear that this was a very important factor in our winning the Olympic Games. Australia is gaining increasingly in its international recognition for the way in which migrants are settled in this country and given full rights as citizens to participate in the processes of the nation. The other key factor is that the policy of multiculturalism has allowed people to feel relaxed about continuing their cultural traditions and the heritage which they brought with them. They have not only continued those traditions but they have also shared those traditions with other Australians enabling us to develop into a broad, diverse multicultural nation. There has been a great deal of cross-fertilisation in a whole range of areas such as education, the arts, the development of culture and the development of the economy. There has been a very positive contribution as a result of all those factors. I reinforce the importance of the government's commitment to multiculturalism which is important to the development of this nation. As a result of that, we need to also emphasise the importance of citizenship in Australia. We need to tie the concept of citizenship to two important notions: firstly, the commitment to multiculturalism; and, secondly, the concept that I have been working on, as have a number of other people, including the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), of basic social rights in Australia.",86
176,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES," Order! The time allotted for the proposed expenditure now before the committee has expired. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, arid agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Dr Theophanous) read a third time. NA Motion (by Dr Theophanous) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Medicare Offices",87
177,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to draw the attention of the government to a situation which I, as the new member for Cowan, find totally unacceptable. The issue was first brought to my attention by a local constituent, Mr Sid Breeden, of Warwick. For many years, and using many avenues, Me Breeden has been attempting to persuade the Health Insurance Commission of the merits of establishing a Medicare office in the Warwick shopping centre complex, the single largest shopping complex in my electorate. Warwick shopping centre has a shop account of 4.4 million people. A recent article in the Wanneroo Times reported that the shopping complex was the most successful regional shopping centre in the northern corridor of the Perth metropolitan area. The Warwick shopping centre complex serves a huge area of the northern suburbs, particularly those areas east of the Mitchell Freeway, through the suburbs of Girrawheen and Marangaroo, and north through Greenwood, Kingsley, and Woodvale. Presently, the closest Medicare offices are located in Karrinyup in the west, Innaloo in the south and Whitfords shopping centre in the north. Those who are familiar with the northern corridor of the Perth metropolitan area will appreciate the distance between each of these offices and the fact that none of these offices could effectively serve the residents of the Cowan electorate. As a consequence of the poor provision of services, the Health Insurance Commission is burdening my local constituents with the additional financial impost of the need to travel to distant shopping centres for the sole purpose of carrying out their Medicare needs. An examination of the Perth metropolitan area shows that of the 15 Medicare offices in that area seven are located south of the river, four are located north of the river, which includes the city branch, and three are located in the eastern corridor. Only one Medicare office is located in the federal electorate of Cowan. The office is located in the far south-eastern region of the electorate and, again, a 20to 30minute drive for almost two-thirds of the Cowan electorate. The issue of the lack of a Medicare office which is easily accessible to a majority of the Cowan electors is symptomatic of a much wider and deeper feeling of frustration and disappointment with the operation of our present public health system. In a letter sent to Mr Breeden by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) in August 1992, in response to a question raised by the former member for Cowan, the parliamentary secretary said that Medicare processed 400,000 applications every day, with a customer satisfaction rate of approximately 91 per cent. This means, of course, that nine per cent are not satisfied, which represents approximately 36,000 dissatisfied customers every day. Most private enterprise organisations work to a dissatisfaction rate only 0.5 per cent. Australian taxpayers pay dearly for Medicare and its associated services. At present the electors of Cowan are not getting value for money, nor are they getting an appropriate level of service. It may well have been that a few years ago a Medicare office at the Warwick shopping centre may not have been justified. That ignores, however, th€1 rapid population growth which has characterised the northern suburbs of the Perth metropolitan area for the last few years. It also ignores the changing demographics of the area. The inaction by the Health Insurance Commission ignores the fact that the Cowan electorate has experienced a population growth of 20 per cent from 1986-1991. It is one of the 20 fastest growing federal electoral districts in Australia. The Health Insurance Commission has ignored these changes and has been slow to respond to the demands of its customers. The Australian taxpayer, in particular the Cowan elector, is paying for this lack of service. I am confident I speak for the many electors of Cowan who are inconvenienced daily because of the absence of an easily accessible Medicare office. I echo the calls of Mr Sid Breeden of Warwick in demanding the Health Insurance Commission reassess its constant is refusal to establish a Medicare office at the Warwick shopping centre and I recommend a re-evaluation of the current situation. Enterprise Bargaining",87
178,Mr VAILE,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to bring to the attention of the House an article that appeared in today's Age which is relevant to my electorate. The article is headed 'Clothing union may oppose enterprise deal' and is particularly relevant after listening to some comments made today during question time by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths). That newspaper article in part states: The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union will consider opposing an enterprise agreement between of its members and a NSW clothing factory in which workers could work up to 48 hours a week without penalties to protect their jobs. Under the deal between the management and employees at the Bonds underwear factory at Taree, workers could be required to work 11112 hours a day between 7 am and 10.30 pm at ordinary rates. The workers will not have guaranteed weekly minimum hours under the two-year agreement, under which they will work an average of 38 hours a week. In return, they will receive a five per cent wage increase and an extra $11.20. The union had agreed to the deal after more than 75 per cent of the workers voted for it in a secret ballot. But the union said yesterday that it would consider at a national executive meeting in Sydney next week whether to oppose it in the Industrial Relations Commission. Last night a spokeswoman for Bonds said that the agreement was designed to allow for fluctuations in demand at the factory. She said the factory was running at a loss and the agreement would ensure its viability. She also denied that the workers were pressured to sign the agreement. She said she was surprised that the union was now considering opposing it in the commission. What about Bonds? Bonds is believed to want to push ahead with the agreement, despite the agreement not yet having been certified in the cpmmission. The regional development task force has been allocated $900,000 for 1993-94. Is it not comforting to see that Mr Bill Kelty is the chairman of that task force. He is also Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I hold little hope for this task force identifying the real problem in regional Australia, which is the urgent need for a more flexible workplace. If this agreement falls through at Bonds in Taree, there is a very good chance that that factory will shut down or move back to the city, or even overseas. This is all directly attributable to the intrusive hands of the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union. It therefore is laughable when I read on page 125 of the program performance statements for this department that one of its subprograms is enterprise development. The objective of the textiles, clothing and footwear program, as stated on page 125, is: To promote the restructuring and revitalisation of the textiles, clothing and footwear industries so as to improve their efficiency and international competitiveness, and reduce their dependence on assistance from the Commonwealth. How many public servants, how many studies into regional development and how many new Commonwealth government schemes will it take before this government realises that none of it will work in the real world unless a much more flexible workplace is developed? In regional Australia, most of the work is seasonal, and this needs to be recognised in workplace agreements. Interestingly, the debate on that part of the department's budgeted expenditure for this year was shortened by the guillotine this evening. That department would go a long way if it started looking at some of the industrial relations programs and objectives in regional Australia. The department should focus on making those factories in those manufacturing industries in regional Australia more viable and stable and focus on protecting the jobs that already exist before looking at creating and relocating more jobs out of the city. It will be interesting to hear the comments of the Minister for Industrial Relations on the situation that now exists at the Bonds factory in Taree. Asthma",88
179,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to speak on the issue of asthma. Asthma is the most· widespread chronic health problem in this country. Unlike heart disease, which is one of the biggest killers of adults in the country, asthma affects people from all walks of life and from all age groups. In my state of Queensland, in particular in my city of Brisbane, there is a much higher incidence of asthma than in many other parts of the country. Something like 10.2 per cent of the population of Queensland suffers from asthma. Even more disturbingly, asthma affects one in four children. In areas of Brisbane, particularly in areas of my electorate, asthma affects one in three children. This is the highest rate of asthma in Australia and it is amongst one of the highest rates of asthma in the world. Given this rate of asthma in Australia, we should be concerned with the effects of asthma. For· example, five Australians in every 100,000 die each year from asthma. That, in itself, is rising at an alarming rate. Asthma is now the main cause of hospitalisation for children and is the second most common reason for admissions of men to hospital and the third most common reason why women are admitted to hospital. That is why it is so important for Australians to be aware of asthma. Asthma Awareness Week starts on 10 October 1993. The focus of Asthma Awareness Week will be on diagnosis, treatment and management, because this is an illness which affects almost every household in the community. Speaking as a parent, nothing can be more disturbing than to be woken in the middle of the night by the wheezing, gasping and coughing of a young child and having to make the decision as to whether one will wait for two hours to administer some further ventolin or whether one will take the risk of rushing the child to hospital. That is an experience which is common to many parents not only in my electorate but throughout Queensland and the rest of Australia. The real problem that we as a community face is that we do not accurately know what causes asthma. What we can do, however, is try to manage asthma better than we currently do. Asthma as a condition is not even very well understood in the community. Essentially, asthma is where the airways tighten and that naturally restricts breathing. The airways become inflamed and the excess mucus is produced from an irritant. Asthma is more than the attack where hospitalisation occurs. It is also a general feeling of tightness in the chest and wheezing which occurs frequently. So it can be a condition which can send people to hospital but it can also be a condition which can simply impede their lifestyle and their work. The main factors that trigger attacks of asthma are cigarette smoke, the flu or a cold and an allergy to substances like pollens, mould or dust mites. Exercise can also bring on an attack of asthma. In the dark old days people were treated for asthma by being encouraged to stay away from physical activity or at some stages, heaven forbid, to take smoking. We have come a long way since then, but we have a long way to go. Doctors are now becoming more aware of asthma and how to manage it so that people can be properly treated. There are now many treatments available to relieve the symptoms of asthma, but we have a long way to go. I do not think it is frequently known that many prominent people in our community suffer from asthma. For example, the Minister for Health, Senator Ri9tardson, suffers from asthma. Many of our athletes in our olympic; team suffer from asthma. Many well-known sports personalities suffer from asthmapeople such as Jeff Fenech, Allan Border and Susie Moroney. It is something which is very widespread in the community, but it· should not necessarily be an impediment to a full lifestyle for many people. That is why Asthma Awareness Week is so important. That is why the job that is done by organisations like the Asthma Foundation is so deserving of community support. That is why it is worth noting in this House tonight that we as a community need to get behind the Asthma Foundation and fully promote all the activities associated with Asthma Awareness Week. Cybergenics Australia",89
180,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House the plight of one of my constituents, Mr John Wrigley, who is the general manager of Cybergenics (Performance Nutrition and Training Systems). To give a brief history of the company, Cybergenics Australia was formed in 1992 and is a subsidiary of Cybergenies USA. In that country, Cybergenies enjoys a turnover in excess of $USl00 million per annum and sells its products in over 60 countries under direction from corporate offices in New Jersey, London and Perth. It is claimed that the company is a leader in sports and nutritional supplements and that it was originally founded as a direct but safe opponent to .the world's thriving steroid industry. The Perth office was created to introduce· Cybergenics to the Australian market and to provide a regional base for the up Asia-Pacific region. It was envisaged the products would be imported to cater for the Australian market and shipped direct for export orders to other countries. Longer term planning also included Australian manufacturing facilities within three years of the launch in this country. During its first 11 months of operation, Cybergenics achieved sales of $619,878, which included export sales of over $226,000. During the first five months of 1993 exports have totalled over $176,000 and are growing. Initially, sales comprised just one component of the Cybergenics range-food productswhich account for less than 35 per cent of sales in the markets of other countries where a full range of the Cybergenics products are available to consumers. It follows that the other products which are not yet available on the Australian market are Cybergenics' best sellers and it is these products which Mr Wrigley wants to have registered but which are also causing the most difficulties for him. The products of which I speak are Isotesto 12 solution, Isolate 1 tablet, Isolate II tablet, Isolate III tablet and Isolate V tablets, which are the components of an anabolic but steroid free muscle building kit designed to stimulate muscle growth as part of a total 60-day diet, weight training and exercise regime which maximises metabolism and muscle cell development. These products are advertised extensively in print media, including Muscle Mag, Flex, lronman, Cycle World and Alive magazines, which are freely available in Australia and from which a great deal of interest about the Cybergenics range is generated. Mr Wrigley has assured me that his company makes every effort to ensure that all regulatory requirements are met when establishing itself in a new country by approaching the relevant authorities. In Australia, these included AQIS, Customs, the health department and the Therapeutic Goods Administration. This has proved over time to be an exhaustive and complicated procedure, especially in so far as the TGA is concerned. Of the five applications for product listing made by Mr Wrigley to the TGA in AprilMay 1993, only one has been approved to date. One application has been rejected due to the inclusion of one milligram of a chemical called inosine, which Mr Wrigley claims is less than is found in a teaspoonful of vegetable extract or a stock cube. The other three are still being processed. Mr Wrigley alleges these delays have cost him $40,000 in consultancy, application fees and expenses and an estimated $2 million in lost sales. Furthermore, it seems new difficulties which have arisen with Customs means that a shipment of goods worth $25,000 could be destroyed. These difficulties involve the labelling of the Cybergenics goods. Mr Wrigley is aware that all imports are subject to marking regulations in respect of labelling. He submitted to Customs for tariff applications, together with the labels, in April-May 1992 and he claims these were granted with no adverse comments. Further to that, he arranged shipment of product with the complying labels, but while the container was en route he was informed that it did not comply with the regulations and that Customs was authorised to destroy the shipment. The single offending word 011 the label was the word 'distributed'. It appears that Mr Wrigley's labels should have read 'Made in Canada by' rather than 'Distributed in Canada by'. Mr Wrigley has also been advised that further shipments will be inspected by Customs in addition to inspections by quarantine. Quarantine has also presented a problem for Mr Wrigley in that it has impounded one shipment of product pending application for import permits. The reason is that some of the products contain bee pollen, which is now the official reason behind the delay and the requirement of an import permit. This is particularly annoying to my constituent, who claims he presented all of the products to quarantine in April-May 1992 and was advised that no import permits were required. He can now expect inspection of all future shipments. Understandably, Mr Wrigley is gravely concerned that any further pressure is likely to put him out of business. He feels that the crux of this problem is the TGA's lack of understanding of sporting supplementssupplements which he argues would play a powerful and positive role in reducing, if not eliminating, the prolific steroid use and abuse in the world of body building. On behalf of my constituent, I can only urge that the government look at this area of the legislation. It is an area of importance to those people involved in body building and athletic development. I, for one, would want to see a product that is a much better and much safer product used openly in Australia, rather than the illicit use of steroids in muscle building, which is the subject of very grave concern in the sporting world. Banana Industry",90
181,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight on the adjournment debate to support the five-year strategic plan of the New South Wales banana industry committee. The indushis try provides significant employment in towns up and down the north cost of New South Wales, from Mount Yarrahappini in the south to 1\veed Heads in the north. Not only does it provide a lot of employment on the north coast of New' South Wales but, because of the very high expenditure in fertilisers, plastics, cartons and transport, it also provides a lot of jobs in the cities and has a beneficial impact on the economies on many areas. The aim of the committee strategic plan is to prioritise 10 key issues impacting on the banana industry in New South Wales and to sort out methods of dealing with them. The first issue is that of grower support. The committee needs to and will improve communications and information to growers so that their policies are clear. It is also seeking adequate statutory power and intends to sustain a high level of accountability. Marketing is vitally important and it is aiming at the widest possible consumer area. It needs to control the product, supply and management and sell the whole of the New South Wales crop at a profit. One of the difficulties which have bedevilled the banana industry in Australia-not just New South Wales, but up the east coast of Australia-is the fact that there is no control on production at all and there are great gluts from time to time. This means that producers are actually marketing and selling bananas at less than the cost of getting them to market. That is of no benefit to anybody. The committee's third priority is to look after pests and disease control, provide sufficient research and information and the eradication and/or cost-effective control of pests and diseases in bananas. The industry needs an increased output from a constant level of input on ways of developing environmentally friendly control practices, enhancing grower education and establishing and maintaining an appropriate research I and development program. / Interaction with government at all levels is equally important. The industry committee looks forward to pursuing correct interaction with government at all levels in the interests of the industry. The committee is most concerned about quality standards and is going to develop quality assurance policies and programs to improve the quality of New South Wales bananas. This will involve an education program so that growers can produce top quality fruit with a quality assurance program. From time to time, there has been a threat of importing bananas. This is something that the industry has to be completely on the ball about because imports could see the introduction of diseases which would totally wipe out the industry and destroy the economies of many towns up and down the east coast of Australia. It is essential that we maintain strict quarantine regulations to keep out diseases such as moko and black sigatoka. Black sigatoka has already devastated bananas on all the islands in the Torres Strait after the disease came across from Papua New Guinea. The committee needs to have interaction with other industry bodies to ensure that the policies and actions of the industry bodies concur with those of the banana industry. It also needs to ensure the most effective transportation of bananas by promoting the need for effective maintenance and upgrading of equipment used for handling and the movement of bananas, which are, of course, a fruit enjoyed by almost every Australian. The committee is also concerned about the environment and will be developing land use policies, acceptable to all levels of government and the community, to ensure the retention of enough land on which viable, normal farming practices can be maintained. The final priority is to ensure that grower control of the industry is maintained and that any threats to the industry are nipped in the bud. The Australian banana industry is of vital importance to Australia. It is a significant primary industry and it should be supported at all levels of government. Victoria: Flooding",91
182,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"Idraw to the attention of the House the serious problems faced by residents of north-eastern Victoria and the likely problems that will result from a large body of floodwater moving down via the Murray River. I speak with some knowledge of this area as I represented much of the Echuca area, including a section of the Murray River, as a state member of parliament. I know of the distress being felt by many families throughout the north-east at the moment. I know of the damage that has been done to houses and farms, and of the stock losses. Even since 3 o'clock today, when this matter was raised at question time in the parliament, sections of the urban area of Shepparton have been inundated with water and much flooding of orchards has occurred there. It is causing some very serious problems for that area. The areas of Benalla, Wangaratta and Kialla were flooded by the Seven Creeks, the Ovens River and the King River, causing vast losses to the community. The Broken River and the Goulbum River are both in flood. There is quite an amount of water coming down into the Shepparton area, which ultimately will flow into the Murray River. It will move downstream to Echuca where it meets up with the Campaspe River. The Kerang area is likely to be affected, as well as Swan Hill, Mildura and many other towns along the downstream side of the Murray River. I was pleased when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) indicated that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) will be visiting many of these flooded areas tomorrow. I understand that my colleague the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) will be joining him on that visit to those flood affected areas. I ask the primary industries minister not only to look at the damage that has already occurred in the north-east but also to look at what strategies might be put in place when that volume of water moves down the Murray and at the likely effect that will have on so many areas on both sides of the Murray River. Estimates have been given by people who understand the behaviour of the Murray River system that it is likely to reach its highest level in 200 years. Much of the water that will come down the Murray River will bank up, spill over into other streams and probably cause minor flooding in the Campaspe River, which can reach into areas of Rochester. There is likely to be a vast body of water carried down the Murray River which will affect not only the areas that are currently flooded but also areas further downstream. I compliment the Victorian State Emergency Service, the Country Fire Authority and Red Cross on the fine work that has already been done. A large number of welfare organisations are also responding to calls because of the massive flooding and inundation that has occurred throughout those areas. I know that the minister will be greatly shocked by the enormity of the problem. It has been compared to the great natural disaster of the Ash Wednesday fires, and we all remember the horror of that. I request that the government look at the serious ramifications for many other cities and towns along the Murray River. Aviation History  p.m.)-Last Friday evening I had the pleasure of being associated with the launch of Flight of the Halifax. The book is about the exploits and life of Captain Geoffrey Neville Wikner, who in many ways was very similar to Bert Hinkler, another great Australian aviator. The book is the story of the love of flying and the determination to build and fly aeroplanes of a young Australian born in Grafton. Geoff Wikner was a self-taught aviator. The first specifications for his aircraft were drawn up in chalk on the floor of a garage.· He built the aircraft, called the Wicko Cabin Sports Monoplane, and it had its maiden flight on 25 January 1931. On 25 February 1931 it was christened by the then Governor of Queensland, Sir John Goodwin. On 17 May 1931, that aircraft created an altitude record when it ascended to 17,000 feet. Geoff Wikner then got the travel bug and, like Bert Hinkler, went off to England to make his fortune. Both he and Hinkler were regarded in the UK as foreigners and aliens. That created considerable obstacles for them to overcome. It is coincidental that a year earlier, in February 1930, Hinkler designed his own aircraft and built it with a colleague. The Ibis flew in 1930. It was a beautiful little aeroplane. There was an Australian on one side of the world building an aircraft in the UK, and there was another one back here in Australia building an aircraft. Both went off to the UK; both of them lived through the Depression; but Wikner set up a company called the Foster Wikner Aircraft Co. That company survived during the 1930s until the outbreak of World War II. Captain Wikner then joined the air transport auxiliary. He flew some 67 different types of aircraft. He clocked up 524 hours as a taxi pilot, and he delivered more than a thousand aircraft. At the end of the war he wanted to come home to the sunny climes of Australia. He could not get civil air transport so, being a typical Australian, he bought himself a spare Halifax bomber. Those aircrafts were no longer needed: It was an aircraft that he had flown in his ferrying capacity. He arranged for his wife, children and some other people to make contributions to the cost and flew it back to Australia. They left England on 24 May 1946. They arrived, happily, at Mascot on 15 June 1946. I want to commend the Wikner family, particularly his son, Ken, who had the wherewithal and the determination to get together and put into a book form the exploits of a young Australian. It was a pretty daredevil, courageous exercise to undertake in 1930firstly, to build an aircraft here, and secondly to set off to the United Kingdom to try to set up business over there. At the same time Hinkler was in the UK doing the same thing. Bert Hinkler's story is much sadder because he never made it back. He died on an Italian mountainside in 1933 on the return flight. I bring this matter to the said: notice of the chamber, because one young Australian, Captain Geoffrey Wikner, brought his family back to Australia; he did what so many young Australians wanted to do at that time-and that was to design an aircraft, build it and fly it. He made a major contribution to Australian aviation, but at peril, as did Bert Hinkler. Hinkler met the same obstacles as I mentioned earlier. He did not have the same success that Captain Wikner had; he did not make it back to Australia. Both of them deserve to be well recorded and well respected in the annals of Australian aviation history. Republic",92
183,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to criticise the Turnbull committee, which handed down its report to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) only yesterday. In particular, I would like to criticise the remarks made by the chairman of that committee when he asked the people of Australia to take a bipartisan approach to this very important issue. He also asked politicians to butt out of debate on the question of the republic. Indeed, he appealed for a non-partisan people's debate on the issue, fearing that the republic debate could degenerate into a political slanging match. What amazing cheek! What audacity on the part of the chairman of this committee which has consumed over $600,000 of Australian taxpayers money-the $55,000 in the year past to fund the group, and the $551,000 in the year that has just gone. I believe that the government is setting aside a further $200,000 to push its case for the republic over the next 12 months. This partisan group of people allowed themselves to be used as tools by the Labor Party. They were largely hand-picked by the Prime Minister, and they have delivered a sham report which, in effect, many people suggest was largely written by the Prime Minister's department itself prior to the committee's deliberation. Mr Turnbull will receive a message from this side of politics, because we have been elected by about 50 per cent of the Australian people to put forward their concerns. Honourable members should look at some of the commentaries in the newpapers on this report. The Courier-Mail The r-port should be viewed as a partisan report on one SIde of the argument about whether Australia should be a republic. Having voraciously consumed over $600,000 of taxpayers' money while one million people are out of work, and in so doing carrying out the dirty work of the government at our expense, the purveyors of this partisan report on how to gut our constitution seek to deny us the opportunity to participate in this debate. I must say that I find that truly pathetic. The five minutes allocated to me in this debate are not adequate to allow proper consideration of the 500 or 600 pages of the two volumes of the report and the overview. I would, however, like to consider briefly a couple of matters. On page 19 of the overview the prospect of dictation to the states of Australia is· foreshadowed. While there has been talk about the possibility of states retaining their individual links with the monarchy, the report states: If the prospect of States retaining links with monarchy was considered unacceptable ... (abolishing the monarchy at State level) could be made without the cooperation of all States. So much for the minimalist approach. We find in this report that the government is saying that the states of this nation could well be frog marched into the Prime Minister's banana republic. The other thing that I find particularly curious is appendix 1 to one of the volumes of the report where the members of the Commonwealth of Nations are listed. They have been listed in three groups: those nations which have governors-general; those nat-ons which are monarchies; and those nations which are republics. I fail to unde-stand - hy the committee has seen fit to dlfferentlate between those monarchies which have governors-general and those monarchies which do not. After all, this debate is really about whether Australia's monarchy will be abolished, yet the Turnbull commit-ee seeks to deny in its report that we are m fact a monarchy. I find this bizarre in the extreme. We all know about the Prime Minister's hidden agenda. We know that the states are likely to be gutted. We know that the powers of the Senate are likely to be curtailed. Honourable members know that there is an irony in the timing of the publication of the report. As the Melbourne Herald-Sun states in its editorial: The report is meant to fuel debate on how one of the world's oldest, most stable democracies might change its system of government for the 21st century. This is occurring as Russians count the bodies of those who sought to halt democracy at gunpoint. While President Yeltsin and the people of Russia are fighting for the very principles of unity, stab-lit- and freed?m, underpinned by a constitution, our Pnme Minister is seeking to junk those very same principles.

184,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT," I circulated a letter to members of the caucus from Dickie Cox. Dickie Cox is the chairman of the Aboriginal community at Noonkanbah. Noonkanbah has great historical the connotations, for it was at Noonkanbah in 1979 that the first stirrings of Aboriginal demand for land or control of the land arose. In his letter Mr Cox made it very clear that he wanted no part of Mabo. He said that the community had not been consulted. In his view it was divisive in the community and did - ot represent the overwhelming view of Aboriginal people. Mr Cox is very prominent in the Fitzroy valley and I believe his views cannot be disregarded. He makes it clear that he believes Australia will exist as a united nation only if we all work together and that Mabo is not the way to achieve this. This evening I received a fax from the Kupungarri Aboriginal Corporation at Mt Barnett. Mr Billy King, the chairman of that corporation, sent a letter to Dickie Cox which supported his view. I will seek leave to have this letter incorporated in Hansard, if I may. Mr King has made the same sorts of comments. He, too, said that his people were never consulted on this issue, thatland councils do not speak for them and that ATSIC is not representative of them. I say that it is quite clear that the great bulk of Aboriginal people have not been co-ulted on this matter. If I am wrong, I WIll not survive the next election because I represent probably the largest number of Aborig-al constituents in this House-there are certainly enough to unseat me if they believe I do not represent their views. , I have been asked by Aboriginal people to speak out on their behalf. They say they have elected me and it is my job to do so. I say to them, quite frankly, 'If I were to say - he things you say, I would be declared a raCISt. You must speak out for yourselves'. However, it is very difficult to get the media to pay them any attention. Whilst they have agreed to talk to the media, the media-particularly the ABC; the worse offender-will not go and talk to them: There are some honourable exceptions to that, and I believe the message Mabo is slowly getting through. I also have a lot of dealings with Aboriginal people in Perth, which is not my constituency. I believe the overwhelming majority of the Nungar people in Perth also reject this approach. They know there is nothing in Mabo for them except a backlash. I was talking to an Aboriginal JP the other day who told me that, in her view, the backlash had already started and that Aboriginals do not like it at all. They know that if social justice is incorporated in or operates through ATSIC, it is a nonsense. Already the taxpayers of this country are putting $2 billion a year into the Aboriginal affairs area-that is quite apart from any social security pensions. This equates to $7,500 for every Aboriginal man, woman and child, but Aboriginal people know they are not getting it. I believe that what we are seeing today in Canberra is a ttavesty of justice. It does not represent the views or the aspirations of Aboriginal people. They know that if they could get access to the money that is being spent in their name they would all be better off. They would all trade their access to ATSIC, which they know is totally corrupt. I would estimate that Australia-wide 80 per cent of the Aboriginal people would be opposed to ATSIC; the other 20 per cent work for it. That is the situation, and we are not facing up to it. Until we do there cannot be any real social justice for Aboriginal people. In the long run, social justice for Aboriginal people will occur by their being fully absorbed, fully integrated, and fully a part of the Australian community which they say they are and want to be and which we, by our continual paternalism, are denying them. I feel compelled to say these things because, in my view, the direction of the Mabo debate is completely out of control. (TIme expired)",95

192,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Development Co-operation and Pacific Island Affairs, upon notice, on 1 September 1993: (l) What sums did the Australian Government provide in foreign aid to Brunei in (a) 1988-89, (b) 1989-90, (c) 1990-91, (d) 1991-92, (e) 1992-93. (2) What sum has been allocated for 1993-94. (3) Is eligibility for foreign aid determined according to prerequisites; if so, (a) what are they and (b) which prerequisites did Brunei fulfil to qualify for foreign aid. (4) How is Australia's foreign aid to Brunei spent. (5) Does the Government monitor the expenditure by countries which r;eceive Australian foreign aid to ensure that they are not misspending their own money and wasting Australia's aid; if so, has funding been withdrawn in any instance as a result of such monitoring. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Total Australia aid flows to Brunei for the years 1988-89 to 1992-93 were: (a) 1988-89-$369,951 (b) 1989-90-$339,800 (c) 1990-91-$381,893 (d) 1991-92-$326,438 (e) 1992-93-$239,086 (2) The 1993-94 allocation to Brunei is $251,000. (3) (a) Yes. $ $ 480,000 21,622 1,424,103 Australia's foreign aid is provided as official development assistance (ODA) as defined by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In order for expenditure to qualify as ODA, the following three requirements must be satisfied: (i) the recipient country must be included in the DAC List of Developing Countries; (ii) the expenditure must be administered with the promotion of the economic deVelopment and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and (iii) the expenditure must be concessional in character and convey a grant element of at least 25 per cent. (However, 100 per cent of Australia's ODA is provided as grant aid.) The DAC List was established by DAC Members in the early 1960s. Amendments to the DAC List by way of inclusion and deletion have taken place from time to time. In December 1992, the DAC agreed that six countries, including Brunei, should be graduated from the DAC List. Graduation of these six countries was based on the reduced need for continued external development assistance, using per capita GNP as a key criterion. The six relevant countries will be graduated from the DAC List from January 1, 1996. From this point in time Brunei will no longer be eligible for ODA. (The other five countries are the Bahamas; Singapore; Qatar; Kuwait; and the United Arab Emirates.) (b) Brunei satisfies the prerequisite for ODA eligibility because it is included on the; DAC List of Developing Countries. Brunei will remain on the DAC List until January 1, 1996. (4) In recognition of its status as a high-income developing country, Australia does not have a bilateral aid program with Brunei. The small amount of Australian aid which does reach Brunei is due to its membership of regional organisations such as the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Commonwealth. In this respect Brunei will continue to benefit from programs under the ASEAN-Australia Economic Cooperation Program (AAECP) Phase III until 30 June, 1998. The level of assistance to Brunei has been declining in real terms in recent years and is less than .02 percent of the total overseas aid program. Subsidised student programs accounted for much of past aid totals. However this program concluded in 1992-93. The main activities which have been allocated funding in 1993-94 include the ASEANAustralia Economic Cooperation Program (AAECP) and the Trade and Investment Promotion Program (T1PP). (5) No. Australia does not directly monitor domestic expenditure by countries which receive Australian development assistance. Sovereign governments have the right to determine the allocation of their own public resources as they think appropriate. Australia does not attempt to impose its perceptions of good governance, including financial and economic accountability of developing countries, through its foreign aid program. However, through policy dialogue with recipient countries, Australia can assist recipient governments develop their own approaches to good governance. Technical assistance such as the provision of electoral advisers and support for the judiciary, courts and legal systems; institution strengthening, including strengthening court systems, as well as anti-corruption activities through improved taxation systems; and infrastructure and equipment provision such as legal reference material, legal libraries, and crisis centres, are just a few examples of how Australia has long provided this type of assistance through its aid program, although it may not always have been identified specifically as being related to good governance. Australia requires stringent accountability in all our arrangements with contractors, consultants, international organisations and other governments involved in the delivery of Australian aid programs. Except for Papua New Guinea, all bilateral program aid is tied to discrete development activities. Aid to Papua New Guinea is also moving rapidly from budget support to sectorally targeted program/project aid. ODA is not supplied in the form of unconditional cash grants, which could be easily diverted to alternative uses. Country and regional development cooperation programs and projects are designed in close consultation with partner governments, the target beneficiaries and community groups. The composition of activities in individual bilateral programs is agreed between the Australian and recipient governments at annual high level consultations. These procedures, combined with effective monitoring and review mechanisms, make it extremely difficult for aid funds to be redirected to alternative uses by recipient countries and ensure that the development cooperation program is well information registries directed.",100
