One of the things that people immediately our roftds is the alleged threat that they pose debate that we consider what is happening in relation on fatal crashes involving articulated trucks to see just what has happened. In every case, fatal crashes in that period involving articulated New South Wales over that 1981 to 1998 period, occurred in 1988, with 120.

It is timely in the context of this to that view. In looking at the statistics in the period from 1981 to 1998, it is interesting no matter which state you go to, the number of trucks has declined overall. For example, in the highest number of fatal crashes actually also in Victoria in 1989 of 57. In Queensland, vehicles basically tapered down from 4 7 in That has been apparent to people who have folover that time. It is good to see that hapto promote improved road safety outcomes. of fatalities. No matter which state you go to, involving articulated trucks declined overall, with NA Wednesday, 15 March 2000 peaks of 151 fatalities in New South Wales in 60 in Queensland in 1989 and 31 in South all the states occurred in Western Australia, If we look at the impact of speed zones, overall. For example, in New South Wales, number of crashes to talk about; the numbers of crashes in low-speed zones involving articulated Wales it went from 38 in 1990 down to 22 in over that same period; and in Queensland with a peak of 15 in 1994. In high-speed zones, not dwell on that too much. One thing that is of concern is another statistic seems that, while we do have improved safety cern about hospitalisation.
