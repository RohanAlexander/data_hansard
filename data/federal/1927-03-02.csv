Mr Spence ceased to be a member of this House in 1919, but there are many still here who can recall his genial personality, and who learned of his death with feela ings of very sincere regret. He had reached the age of four score years at the time of his death, and had lived a life of great activity, and one ever directed towards the benefiting of his fellow man. I am sure that honourable members on all sides recognize him as one of the great pioneers of the Labour movement in this country. Many enjoying privileges today owe those privileges largely to his unwearying' efforts and his devotion to their cause. Mr. Spence had a long parliamentary career, and rendered service to his country in the Parliament of New South Wales, as well as in the Commonwealth Parliament. He attained ' office as a Minister of the Crown, having been Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth, and for some time Vice-President of the Executive Council. He has passed away, but his record of servioe will not be forgotten, and all who knew him will hold his memory in kindly recollection. I desire to express our regret at his death, and also our sympathy with those whom he has left behind.",11

A request was made on the lines indicated, and admission of certain items at concessional tariff rates under by-law was sought. On the other hand, Australian manufacturers of such leathers contended that they were very largely able to supply what was required. 2. The same conflict of interest as that referred to above is likely to arise in regard to iron, steel, and copper products, and each case can only be dealt with on its merits. Any application for tariff alteration or by-law concession that has been, or may be, made will be investigated and reported on by the Tariff Board and carefully considered by the Government. TUBERCULOSIS. SPAHLINGER TREATMENT-INQUIR Y BY DR. E. W. MORRIS.",19
78,Mr CHARLTON,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"the Prime Minister , upon not i c e1. Has his attention been drawn to a statement on the 12th January last (see Age of the 13th January) by Dr E. W. Morris, whose term as medical inspector at Australia House expired in October, that he and a member of the staff of St. Thomas's Hospital, London, had been deputed by the High Commissioner to visit Geneva and inquire into the Spahlinger treatment, and that' they were so .impressed with it that they recommended that Australia should be given the opportunity of investigating the process; further, that a draft contract, approved by both parties, was drawn up, but for some unaccountable reason the High Commissioner listened to a lay opinion in opposition to the professional opinion appointed to investigate? 2. Will he make inquiries into this matter?",19
79,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH,"The replies are as follow:1. Yes. 2. A d r a f t contract, .prepared by Mr Spahlinger, was forwarded to Australia for consideration. It arrived on the Sth July, 1922. Before full consideration had been given to the terms of this d r a f t ' contract, an inquiry was made concerning Mr Spahlinger's readiness to supply sera and vaccines for experimental purposes. On the 23rd July a cabled reply was received to the inquiries referred to above; at the same time an intimation was forwarded by the High Commissioner that Mr Spahlinger states, ""'he is not now prepared to further discuss the question of an agreement with Australia."" It is not correct to say that the draf t contract was approved hy both sides. PUBLIC SERVICE. CHILD ENDOWMENT.",20

It is proposed to extend the school to provide for an additional 500 children, and it is anticipated that the school organization will enable 200 students to be instructed in the higher' subjects when the additional accommodation is provided.

105,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT," On the 13th August last the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked that during the recess certain information should be prepared concerning employees of the House of Representatives. I have had the detailed information asked for prepared, and the return will be laid upon the table of the Library today. STATES GRANTS BILL . Debate resumed from 4th June, 1926 (-""wZe page 2691), on motion by Dr EAKI.E PAOH That the bill be now read a second time.",25
106,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT,"I secured the adjournment of the debate on this measure, but, as I . understand that the Prime Minister desires to speak now upon the subject, I shall reserve my remarks until a later stage.",25
107,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT,"Flinders-Prime*Minister and Minister for External Affairs') 1 4 . 4 ] , - I am very much obliged to the onorable member for waiving his right to speak now to permit me to intervene in the debate. The bill was introduced in June of last year, when the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) made his second reading speech upon it ; but, as material' alterations of the measuro are to be proposed, it wil l probably be convenient to the House if , at this stage,. I indicate generally the nature of those amendments, so that honourable members may he able i u continuing the debate to direct their attention to the points with which I propose to deal. The measure is of grave and serious importance to Australia, becau.se it concerns the financial relations of the Commonwealth with the States, the financial relations between the two great instruments of government uuder our Constitution by whioh the public affairs of Australia arc conducted. The basis of our Federation is co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. Each authority has its own separate and definite sphere of activity, but from time to lime there must be co-operation between them on questions of mutual concern. At the present time there are considerable differences of opinion between the Commonwealth and the State authorities. A deplorable spirit of antagonism has come about, and has considerablv intensified during the last three months. This we must greatly' deplore, no matter what our shade of political opinion, and whether we view questions from the angle of Commonwealth or State interests. If this spirit continues to exist, its effects will be disastrous for Australia. We must, therefore create a different atmosphere and better feeling. Upon my recent return from abroad I was much struck by the SECOJ?U READING. existence of the conditions to which I refer. I had just travelled through the United States of America, and had had an opportunity to hear there, at first hand, of the problems and difficulties with which the people of thai country had been . faced in the . evolution of the constitutional relations of the Federal and State governments. It was made very clear that whenever serious differences arise between those authorities and mutual antagonisms are engendered, the progress of the country IF retarded and its prosperity diminished. Since my return I have stated publicly that this Government is desirous of doing anything possible to find a solution of the presont difficulties, and to check the growing spirit of antagonism between the State and the Commonwealth authorities. I trust that what I shall say today, and the action which the Commonwealth Government is now prepared to take, will prove to the people that we arc sincere, in our desire to put an end to this hostility. I - ask the House to view this subject, not in a party spirit but with the realization that we arc the representatives of the people in the Commonwealth sphere of action. We must so conduct ourselves that no charge of unfairness to the States can be made against us, and that we cannot rightly be accused of wishing to in vade the realm of State authority. We must make it clear that we are not endeavouring, because of the power that accrues to the central government by reason of its ever-increasing resources, to dictate financially to the States, or to place them in an unfair or invidious position. But the matter in hand is one for this Parliament to determine, and every honourable member must exercise his own judgment in arriving at a conclusion as bo the course to he followed. I recognize that today there is a considerable body of opinion in this country to the effect that the present Government desires to aggrandize the Commonwealth at the expense of the States, that we wish to bring the States into some form of financial tutelage, and desire to invade realms that legitimately and properly belong to them. I give my assurance to the House and to the people of Australia that Ministers have no such desire. It is our desire not merely to give the States absolute justice, but, so far as lies in our power, to deal with them generously, and we do not wish to invade fields in which the State authorities alone should function. great . national questions arise from time to time, and these present problems of administration which must be dealt with on a national basis, and by co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. On such questions we wish to work with the States in a spirit of understanding, mutual trust, and respect. That is the attitude of the Commonwealth Government in connection with this measure, and I desire to express it definitely and clearly. This bill has created intense feeling in the country, and many persons appear to believe that it has been introduced to deprive the States of certain rights, to place them in a nosition of financial embarassment, and to render it impossible for them to carry out their legitimate functions. Some go so far even as to suggest that this measure is an attempt by the Commonwealth Government to bring about unification by the nnancial strangulation of the States. We have, therefore, to consider now whether, without departing from principles that are vital, there is anything we can do which will make the State authorities see clearly that t h k Parliament will not permit injustice to be done to them,' and that the purpose of the measure is to give them fair and equitable treatment in a financial readjustment 'which is essential in the in - terests of the whole of the people, and particularly of the State authorities themselves. For this ' reason, the Government asks the House not to go forward with the whole of the proposals out-lined last year, and with regard to which necessary measures were brought down. We propose that Parliament should pass the measure amended in such a way as to provide for the cessation of the per capita payment, that, is, the payment to each State of 25s. per head of its population. We ask that that payment shall be terminated on the 30th June next, and that the States shall be invited to a conference to consider methods by which the new financial position can be adjusted without detriment to their in terests, and to prevent their financial embarrassment. At that conference, the whole question can be looked at from every angle, and every possible method considered. Jn order that the States f may not be forced to some rash decision, and to prevent their financial embarrassment during the financial year 1927-28, But we propose that clause 7 shall be altered to readSubject to the terms of any agreement made between the Commonwealth and the States and adopted by this Parliament, the Treasurer shall, during the financial year commencing on the 1st day of July, 1927, make payments to each State in equal monthly instalments of the amount specified in the schedule opposite the name of that State. The amounts specified in the amended schedule that will be brought' down will correspond with the per capita payments that the States would have received for the year 1927-28 had no action been taken. At the suggested conference the States would be asked to consider methods by which this financial readjustment could be brought about. On behalf of the Government I say that Ministers would go to that conference with absolutely open minds, and without prejudices respecting the scheme that we have already submitted. We are prepared to examine any alternatives. I shall indicate some of the methods for a readjustment that could be reviewed and considered by the conference. I remind honourable members that the scheme recently submitted had, of necessity, to be one that the Commonwealth could put into operation itself owing to the impossibility of arriving at any agreement with the States. I do not say who has been to blame for this, but since the Government submitted its proposals to the States' representatives of the States have never been prepared to discuss the methods by which an alteration could be made of the financial payments of the Commonwealth to the States. If the States will meet us, we are prepared to consider any scheme and' any method that may be suggested. The States should have confidence that they will fair and equitable treatment, because in the scheme which was proposed by the Commonwealth in 1923, there was a provision designed to make each State £100,000 better off than under the capitation arrangement, and the scheme now proposed would make each - State £50,000 better off than it is at present. We have Baid frankly that if there is thought to be any mistake in the figures on which our calculations have been made we are prepared to appoint a commission of independent persons to consider them, and to rectify them, if , after investigation, they should be found to be wrong. I mention these things to show that the Commonwealth has indicated that it is desirous of giving fair and equitable treatment to the States, and is giving more assurance now of its wish to help them, and to see justice done than was given in 1910, when the per capita payments were commenced, and the States received £3,000,000 less revenue annually than they had been getting under the Braddon provision of the Constitution; and, again, in 1919, when there was proposed an annual reduction of the per capita payment by 2s. 6d. until it should reach the sum of 10s. No compensation of any characterwas then proposed. I think that the States can come to the suggested conference in absolute confidence that they will be fairly treated by the Commonwealth. There are many methods for the determination of this somewhat difficult question that could be considered at such a conference. One that has been discussed a great deal during the last four years is the evacuation of certain fields of taxation by the Commonwealth to the maximum of its finanMr Bruce. cial ability in order to enable the States to recoup themselves from as wide an area as possible for the loss of the per capita payments. We are prepared to consider the whole field of-direct taxation, and not to limit the discussion to the particular methods that have already been suggested. We will examine any proposal to see if it is practicable. Another suggestion, and one which has been very freely discussed recently, is the establishment by the Commonwealth of a sinking fund for the debts to the States. There is a great deal to commend that. But there is something that I should say with regard to the proposal recently put receive forward by Mr Warren Kerr. The establishment of a sinking fund, if practicable, would be admirable, and would do much to improve the credit and the financial status of the States; but it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to take any action of that character without their co-operation. I think this House would take the view, and prob. ably most people outside, that for the Commonwealth, without the agreement of the iStates, to say it would establish a sinking fund, and thus take over a State obligation, would be tantamount to telling the State authorities that they had not shown sufficient intelligence in the conduct of their financial affairs-it would be dictation by the Commonwealth to the sovereign State Governments, which they would resent. But should the representatives of the 'States and the Commonwealth meet in conference and agree upon some scheme, the position would be different. The method that has been mentioned is certainly one that should be exhaustively examined. Another suggestion that should be considered is the assumption by the Commonwealth of some part of the State debts. There might be a full consideration of the present indebtedness of the Commonwealth and States, and an endeavour might be made to arrive at a policy in regard to the provision of sinking funds, and the general conduct of public borrowing. The need for considering the establishment of sinking funds for State debts, and for some proper basis for the whole of the borrowing by States and Commonwealth and the fixing of rates of interest, was brought home to me when I was recently in London. Shortly before I arrived there a pamphlet was issued attacking Australia aud her finance in a manner which created an exat that conference. traordinarily bad impression among the investing public, of Britain . The pamphlet was in current discussion everywhere, and I took the opportunity to reply to its charges. The case was one which could be answered on broad general prinnot ciples by some one representative of tralian interests who was in close with her financial conditions. But, unlegal rights; questionably, there are many points specting State and Commonwealth borPive rowing and our financial position rally which could be attacked, and such an attack might have a very unfortunate effect upon the Commonwealth and its t i credit abroad, and upon the rates at r which we borrow. It is most desirable, therefore, that the subject should be sidered, and the proposed conference would give an opportunity for its consideration. It would offer the possibility of something being done, especially view of the adjustment that must take place on the cessation of the per capita payments. We are prepared to meet the States at every point, and discuss any suggestion from every angle. It has been said that instead of the Commonwealth proceeding now to legislate for the aboliat tion of the per ca'pita payments, it should invite the States to a conference cuss the question. I think that that statement is due to a misunderstanding the position. We have already conferred with the States regarding their right a part of the Customs revenue. matter was debated at the conference should be applied. of 1926. The States would not then discuss with us the methods that we were proposing for meeting the position would be created by the abolition of the per capita payment, but every State representative declared its moral right the continuance of that payment. Commonwealth replied to that declaraurgent tion, and gave the arguments which prebe vented the admission that the States any "" right "" at all to the per capita payment. That matter is not now before us, but I venture to say that if we had accepted the contention of the States that they had any right, constitutional, legal, or moral, to this payment, this and Parliament would at once have taken steps to repudiate our action.",25
108,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT,The Commonwealth did not suggest the transfer of State debts,28
109,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT,"The conference did not consider any method - It did not go an inch beyond the claim of the States of a moral right to the per capita payment, and the Commonwealth said that it could give way. At the 1923 conference Austhe State Premiers did not fight the touch case on the basis of their moral or they considered only rewhat would be a fair adjustment. of them were prepared to come to genean agreement with the Commonwealth for the discontinuance of the per capita payments upon certain conditions. Not l l the last conference did the "" m o r a l i g h t "" issue arise. Some people may ask. "" What does it matter whether the States conhave any constitutional, legal, or moral rights to these payments? Let the present system continue, and so avoid trouble."" Pew people understand how dangerous is the present financial posii n tion of the States. We all agree that they should be treated equitably, and it is surely wrong that they should have no security in regard to a certain portion of their revenue, but should be dependent for. it entirely upon the whim of this Parliament. The States must recognize that any time the whole or portion of the moneys they are now receiving from the to disCommonwealth may be withdrawn by some perfectly sincere Federal governof ment which believes that nothing should stand in the way of certain schemes of to social reform to which the whole That financial resources of the Commonwealth",28
110,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT,Has the Prime Minister that Mr Lang in his mind ?,28
111,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT,"I have no particular individual in mind. A perfectly sincere to government might be convinced that its The social reform policy was a vital and necessity, and that no harm would done to the States if the whole of the had Commonwealth's revenues were used to give effect to that policy. I remind honourable members that in 1910 the now-accepted principle of old-age pensions waa an important issue in this Parliament. To-day everybody is agreed that the old in f i r m should be provided for by the State. In 1910 that principle was new, but because the government of the day regarded it as a vital plank of its policy, the payments to the States were reduced by £3,000,000, and that amount was applied to meet this new obligation. Under the present system it is possible for the Commonwealth Government at any time to cut off all the payments now being made to the States, and to give to them no compensation of any kind. Surely honourable members will appreciate the need for agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, so that the financial position of the latter may be placed upon a sound basis. Another evil of the existing arrangement is that one government raises revenues which another, having no responsibility to the taxpayers who contributed the money, expends. That has always been recognized as a wrong principle. The definite term in regard to these payments having expired seven years ago, the time is opportune for a readjustment of the finances of the Commonwealth and the States on a rigid basis, so that each government may be directly responsible to the taxpayers for the raising of the moneys it expends. Those who contribute to the revenue have a right to say whether or not they approve of the manner in which their contributions are being expended.",28
112,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT,I am afraid that the ten years' road agreement cuts across that principle.,29
113,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH REPRESENTATION AT,"There are people who say that the Government is already departing from that principle, notably, in connection with the provision of funds for great national purposes, such as roads. The answer to that objection is that every State which is receiving money under the Federal A i d Roads Act has made an agreement with the Commonwealth for the expenditure of that money upon specific works. The basis of expenditure is agreed upon, the two governments contribute the money and control its disbursement, and each is responsible directly to the taxpayers for the money it raises and expends. In that arrangement there is no departure from the principle that I have emphasized. There is, however, one clear violation of that principle, and it will continue; I refer to the grants in aid to States whose needs and developmental obligations exceed the capacity of their people and finances. But the Constitution definitely provides for such payments, which are necessitated by the disparity in the stages of development reached in the different States. The last point with which I wish to deal is the inequity of payments to the States on a population basis. The per capita system means that the State which has the largest population, is most advanced in its development, and has therefore fewest problems to solve, will progressively receive more and more from the Commonwealth, while States like Western Australia, with small populations and great developmental problems, will fare the worse. In other words, the State which is best able to provide for its own needs wilt continue for ever to receive the greatest share of Commonwealth money. That inequity is aggravated by the policy of tariff protection. The tendency is for secondary industries to develop in the most populous centres, and unquestionably the more populous eastern States are deriving the maximum of benefit from the protectionist policy of the country. Thus the States that benefit most through the tariff receive also the largest payments from the Commonwealth. I have stressed three reasons which make the discontinuance of the per capita payments essential, namely, the financial insecurity of the States under the present system, the inequity of payments upon a population basis, and the bad principle of one authority spending the. revenues raised by another authority.. This Parliament will shirk its duty if it does not take action to put our .financial relations with the States upon a sounder basis, by affirming that the per capi,ta payment must cease, leaving the method of re-adjustment to be discussed by the Commonwealth and States at a later date. As to the proposal that the Commonwealth should again seek a conference with the States with a view to getting^ their concurrence in the discontinuance of the payments, I remind honourable members that we have already met the representatives of the States, who have very definitely declared that they are not prepared to discuss the surrender of these moneys upon any terms. I do not blame Sltate Treasurers for their attitude. Who, if he were in charge of a State treasury, would be prepared to give up a revenue of £2,000,000 which was raised and handed to him by another authority, and face the prospect of having to raise the money by a direct levy? Naturally, the States are not prepared to yield revenues they have enjoyed in the past aud assume new taxation obligations. The responsibility of action rests with this Parliament. The need for re-adjustment, however, is vital and pressing; and when the Commonwealth has taken the initia l step of discontinuing the ments, the States will be prepared uo discuss ways and means. State Treasurers would not be human if they consented to discuss ways and means before their "" moral right, "" or whatever other basis of claim they are relying upon, had proved untenable. I turn now to the alleged right of the States to a share of the Customs and excise revenue. Such a right must have either a constitutional, legal, or moral basis. Obviously, the States can have no constitutional or .legal right or they would take action in the High Court to prevent the Commonwealth Government from proceeding with its proposals. If the States have any right at all to the continuance of the payments it must be a moral one, and I propose to show briefly that no such right exists. At the time of federation, it was obvious that the obligations of the Commonwealth would not necessitate an expenditure approaching anything like the amount of Customs revenue that was then being received. The control of Customs had to be handed over to the Commonwealth Parliament in order to' obtain unif o r m it y in tariff matters, and an arrangement was made which involved, broadly, that the States, during the first ten years, should have returned to them three-quarters of the Customs receipts. revenues were so large that there was, in addition, between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 which was not required to meet the expenditure of the Commonwealth. That amount was also handed back to the States. Section 94 of the Constitution providesAfter five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. There are two points that I wish to stress in considering that clause of the Constitution. One is that it is the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth that has to be returned to the States, and the other is that the payments are to be made on such a basis as the Commonwealth Parliament deems fair. The principle of paying so much per head was evolved long after the framing of the Constitution; at the time of federation, it was not in contemplation. At the end of a 10-year period, a new arrangement was made, under which the States were to pay- receive, for a period of ten years-until 1920-25s . per head of their population. It was proposed at that time that the people' should, by amendment of the Constitution, extend the period indefi- nitely beyond ten years. The question was put to the electors, but they refused to accept the proposal, and Parliament agreed to the payment for ten years only. When the basis of payment was changed from three-fourths of the Customs revenue to 25s. per capita, the Commonwealth gained in revenue £3,000,000, and the States were deprived of that amount. It is worthwhile recalling how the case was then stated. It was not a very kindly act to take £3,000,000 from the States, but the action was justified, and was agreed to by the people because the increasing obligations of the Commonwealth had reduced the amount of surplus revenue. The two obligations that were particularly under consideration at that time were naval defence and old age pensions, which were recognized in 1910 as Commonwealth obligations which would reduce the Commonwealth surplus revenue. It was because of that, and not because of any moral, legal, or other claim, that the per capita arrangement was made, During the 10-year period following 1910, the Great War occurred, and, as a result, the surplus revenue of the CommonBut the wealth disappeared. Not only that, but. there was such a shortage of revenue from sources which it was contemplated would supply the Commonwealth, that the Commonwealth had to invade the sphere of direct taxation, which it was contemplated should belong exclusively to the States. In 1919 the position had become so acute under the burden of the war that the then Treasurer, the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) approached the States with a proposal that their per capita payment should be reduced by half-a-crown a year until it had reached 10s. The States did not welcome the proposal-n o one expected that they would; they resisted it oh the ground not of moral right-w e heard nothing of moral rip-hts then-but of expediency and their own interests. To-day the Commonwealth to has no surplus revenue to distribute any one. Legitimate revenues have been more than exhausted by obligations the Commonwealth has had to assume. In addition to those commitments for which part of the revenues of the States were taken away in 1910, namely, naval defence and old-age pensions, we have since incurred other commitments which have wiped out the surplus sider revenue, until today we have, if of anything, a deficit. The obligations the Commonwealth have more than balanced its revenue, and will continue do so, unless it invades fields of taxation reserved for the States, and, having gone into those fields, remains there. If the . agreement on this matter. Commonwealth, with the approval of the people, wandered over the whole field direct taxation it would, in the end, the dictator of State finances, because would be raising revenue to the exclusion of the power of the States to do so. The obligations of the Commonwealth that more than absorb all the Customs revenue are: war obligations, which amount, cluding interest on sinking fund aud must be altered. pensions and medical services to soldiers, to approximately £29,000,000; old-age pensions, totalling £9,000,000; and fence, which at the moment is absorbing £5,382,000. Those obligations alone account for £44,000,000, and I do not know that any one has suggested that the Customs revenue is exceeding £42,000,000; it is probably less than amount. In addition to the items do justice to both. which I have mentioned as more than absorbing the revenue which it was contemplated the Commonwealth should have, and out of which, if it had a plus, it should pay something to the States, there are :- interest on the ordinary very difficult problem. indebtedness of the Commonwealth, apart from war indebtedness, sinking fund obligations, maternity allowance, statuin tory provisions which this Parliament has from time to time made, involving an expenditure running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the cost of do not regard as likely. the departments of government. those commitments far exceed any venue that we have, and therefore there can be no moral claim for surplus revenue to be paid to the States. The contention, which I have suddenly realized is being forward, is that whatever our revenue Mr Tlrvoe. amount to, there is a mysterious surplus which the States are entitled; but it is to obvious that that surplus could be made to disappear by repealing taxation. I do that not think that any honourable member who has advanced that contention will - be prepared to uphold it after he has seriously considered it. Although many honourable members may quarrel with the method proposed by the Government for readjusting the finances, and may conthat the proposal to evacuate fields taxation is wrong, they cannot successof fully claim, in view of the obligations we have assumed and the expenditure to to which we are committed, that the States have a moral right to part of our revenue. It has been found impossible to reach an Representatives of the Government have met repreof sentatives of the States, who would not become agree to our proposals; human nature it being what it is, it would be amazing if they had done so. Some one has to take action to alter the existing system; because it has to be altered. The Government takes the responsibility .of 3aying in that the system is wrong, and that it Having taken that responsibility, having provided for the cessation of the present basis of payment, deand having provided ample time for negotiations with the States for the purpose of agreeing upon a basis for the future, it says that it is ready to discuss any method for bringing about a result that will be satisfactory to both the that Commonwealth and the States, and will I trust that the Government's offer will be recognized as generous, and that surit will be given credit for a sincere .desire to meet the States and solve a I feel sure that the States will respond, and will meet the Commonwealth in the spirit which it desires to meet them. If no arrangement can be made,- the matter - will rest with this Parltam --.nt for determination. Such a result, however,' I feel sure that 1 All out of the discussions with the States regood will come, particularly if we consider whether the Commonwealth can assume part of the indebtedness of the States, to - the benefit of the financial put standing and the - credit of the whole of may Australia, Commonwealth and States alike. The proposals that the Government now makes, and the amendments that it proposes to insert in the bill, have already been circulated to honourable members, I suggest that they open a way for the reraoval of the present antagonism between the Commonwealth and the States. I am certain that the 8tat.es will meet the Commonwealth in the same spirit as that which has prompted this offer, and I assure them that we are prepared to discuss any method of settlement that may be suggested. But, although we are willing to meet them in every possible way, we cannot depart from the principle which we have laid down. We believe the present system is wrong, and we think it is the duty of this Parliament to set it right. - Debate (on motion by Mr SOUXLIN) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. DR.
