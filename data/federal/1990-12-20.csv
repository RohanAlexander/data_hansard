1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"HoD. Leo MCLeay) took spected the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA Suspension of Sessional and Standing Orderrj",9
2,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,"I move: That so much of standing and sessional be suspended as would prevent(1) the House debating the parlous state of Australian economy;, (2) the Gov!!rnment outlining the economic meaSures it proposes to deal with recession; and ' (3) the debate commencing at 12 noon today and proceeding for such period as House determin-.s.",9
3,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"Order! I interrupt the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to say to him and the Leader of the Opposition that, since we have introduced Thursday mornings for private members' business, it has been the intention of the House and I have always attempted-I think both sides of the House have agreed with it-to leave that time over for ordinary members and discourage members of the Executive and the Qpposition front bench in the day. from participating'in that part of the debate. When I was the Chairman of the Selection Committee-and I think the current Selection Committee has followed suit-we followed the rule of always at the tempting to give private members preferthe ence in matters that go on in this debate rather than giving preference to members of the Opposition front bench, who are entitled to participate if they want suggest to the honourable member that perhaps the appropriate time for him propose this motion is at 2 o'clock after so that we do not have front bench members, of one side or the other, ing themselves in taking away that time from private members. I will hear the honourable member's motion if he wishes to persist with it, but I offer that suggesWe tion to him.",9
4,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,I seek your indulgence to to speak to it. respond briefly to that.,9
5,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,Certainly.,9
6,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,"The Opposition is mindful of the importance of private members' business on Thursdays, and we have rethat as it is in the interests of the Parliament for us so to do. In a sense, that view has generated the third, part of the motion, which is that we commence the debate later this day and, furthermore, that in the meantime we have .some negotiations with the Government as to orders how to best organise today's parliamentary proceedings. The truth is that today the is a one-off situation; it is not a normal . day. Today the Parliament has been called back for the specific purposes of properly the dealing with amendments which have been , the subject of debate in the other place. What we seek to do in a constructive the' way is to open up with the Government discussions on giving the Parliament an opportunity to discuss the great issues confronting the nation. The Parliament has resum-d for a 36-hour period. The country does face a crisis and we think it is both appropriate and responsible for us to move this motion. The matter would be immediately dealt with and disposed of if the Government would agree to this and we would have some sensible discussions then about the form of debate later",9
7,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"Might it not be better for you to have those discussions and then bring back your proposal later on in day? I only say that because, despite fact that you might say that this day is different from ordinary days, if the Government had interfered it would have been easy for it to dispense with this to. I morning's proposals so it could get through the business program. The Govto ernment has not done that. If you go on or with this motion, it might encourage members of the Government at some later involvdate. That is all I am saying.",9
8,Mr REITH,ECONOMY,"Mr Speaker, I sought your indulgence simply to put our position on the record, to respond to your comments. have moved the motion-it is on the table and before you-and I now propose",9

17,Mr FIFE,ECONOMY," Mr Speaker, on another matter, I wish to express to you, with greatest of respect, my concern at your intervention during the earlier debate when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) sought to move that the Standing Orders be suspended allow certain things to happen. I am not adopting the procedure of moving a subbers' stantive motion, but I would like to press my concern and certainly the concern of the Opposition that' you' sought to carry out the work of a Government Minister . by seeking from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition an assurance that he would put aside his motion for the time being and deal with it at another time. That kind of intervention, Mr Speaker, I am sure you would agree, if it were continue, would be a bad precedent. Of Government Minister. course, the fact that you intervened highlighted the fact that the Government was in disarray at the time. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who ders. was seated at the table, did not understand what was taking place and, if anyable one were to move in the way that you did, with great respect, it should have been a Government Minister.",13
18,Mr SCHOLES,ECONOMY,Mr SPEAKER - ,13
19,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,"Order! The honourable member for Corio will resume his seat. I am sorry that the honourable memopber for Hume (Mr Fife) felt disposed to reasay that. I made it quite clear in my remarks to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) that, if he wished to proceed, I would hear his motion. I would have made that proposition even more forcefully to the Government if it had attempted to come in here and do over private members' Dusiness. I am very of the view that this morning's proceedings should be for ordinary memof the Parliament. I took the view when I was Chairman of the SelectioCommittee, that I would encourage that Committee not to give precedence to business put forward by Opposition frontbenchers for Thursday mornings because in the recent past, Question Time and matters of public importance have been by the executive of both parties. I am of the firm belief that Thursday the mornings should be for those backbenchers who do not get to make interventions part of the at normal times. As I said earlier, if the Leader of the to House (Mr Beazley) had put a notice on the Notice Paper to suspend private membusiness, he and I would have had exprobably the first considerable argument we have ever had. He would have put it on the Notice Paper and I would have had that out with him in private. But I felt that, to be consistent with my view about private members' business on Thursday mornings, it was proper to ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to resile from his motion until we had finished private members' business. I am insulted by the suggestion from the honourable member to for Hume that I was doing the work of a  cedure does not override the Standing Or",13
20,Mr SPEAKER,ECONOMY,:-Order! The honourmember for Kooyong! I am trying to be sensible on this matter. I think the House has taken the view so far that we should keep this morning's business for ordinary members. My intervention was only on that matter. It was not to cause any other matter to occur.,13
21,The Clerk,ECONOMY,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows: The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: gives wide rights to children in Articles 12 to 16, including the right to privacy and freedom of association; . - gives only qualified rights to parents in Article 5; - fails to recognise the prior right of parents to determine the education of their children; - could, if ratified by Australia, result in government-assisted rebellion against parents who want to set limits for their children in their children's best interests. Your petitioners therefore prai that your Honourable House will: - request the Federal Government not to ratify this potentially damaging Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bilney (from 241 citizens), Mr Downer (from 645 citizens), Mr Steele Hall (from 67 citizens) and Mr Snowdon (from 32 citizens). Rights of ,the Child To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament. We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, draw to the attention of the House that; there is widespread concern and strong objection to the possible implications of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Guidance . and responsibility of our children belong to parents not Government. Your petitioners therefore request the House call upon the Government to refrain from ratifying this Convention. And your petitioners as in duty boimo will ever pray. by Mrs Bailey (from 35 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in ,Parliament asPETITIONS sembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: l. That ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above,by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or c,onsultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic ' priIwiples; 2. That the Convention's philosophy of parenti child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State, ownership of children; ,, 3. That the Christian principle' of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape' clauses permitting the widest of interpretation; 4. That Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say 'and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent; 5. That some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes fot the protection of paedophiles and certain types of childtraffickers; 6. That some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of chi1dren from abu,se or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws. ' Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for: (a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of. the, Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles; (b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray . by Mrs Bailey (from 23 citizens), Mr Beale (from 21 citizens) and Mr Halverson (from 28 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the matter of United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the way in which it may impact on Australian law and Australian families. Your petitioners request the House to legislate or provide for: 1. A 12 month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles of the Convention. 2.

Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives call upon the Government to implement the above. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Langmore (from 63 citizens) and Mr Snow (from 2,221 citizens). . Motorcycle Legislation To the Honourable the Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth: That your petitioners request that reforms be made to Australia's compulsory legislation of motorcycles and motorcyclists. The reforms are: Discuss motorcycling with motorcycle groups well in advance of legislating changes. Implement 5/25 With five years riding experience Over twenty-five years of age The rider is responsible to choose if he/she should wear a motorcycle helmet. No more design restrictions, motorcycles are fuel efficient and the lowest form of air and noise pollution in today's form of transport. And your petitioners as i,n duty bound, will every pray. by Mr Andrew (from 76 citizens). Middle East: Referendum To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Queensland points out to the House that no survey of the wishes of the people of Australia has Aid been made in regard to the possibility of military action over the gulf crisis. Your petitioners therefore ask the House that before any further commitment is made, a National referendum be held to ascertain if the Australia populace wishes Australian young men and women to fight in the Middle East. by Mr Beddall (from 41 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House: of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: - That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. . - That the right to life of all innocent human beings is the most fundamental of all human rights. - That the first duty of the Parliament and of the Government is to protect this right to life. - That in 1989/90 ·alone Medicare provided medical benefits for almost 70,000 abortions at a cost to taxpayers of $7.8 million .

And your petitioners as in duty bound will - ver pray. by Mr Carlton (from 14 citizens). Rights of the Child . To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia draws to the attention of the House our concern with particular aspects of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in that some of the Articles of the Convention, as they are presently drafted, do not recognise the rights and responsibilities of parents towards their children and may diminish the parent/child relationship. - Namely, the Convention declares that children have the right to ""freedom of expression"", a right described as including: "". . . . freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print . . . . "". - The Convention declares the right of ""freedom of association and freedom of peaceful assembly"". Your petitioners therefore pray that the House take action to have the Convention amended to give adequate recognition to the rights and duties of parents with respect to the education as well as the physical, social and moral development of their children. by Mr Downer (from 298 citizens).

23,Mr BRERETON,ECONOMY,"On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the report of the Committee entitled The 1990 federal election, together with the minutes of the proceedings. Ordered that the report be printed.",17
24,Mr BRERETON,ECONOMY,"I am pleased to inform the House that this is a unanimous report of the Committee. Following the re<;:eipt of a number of complaints relating to the March 1990 election, in May 1990 the Committee sought and received a general .reference from the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) to inquire into and to report upon the conduct of the 1990 Federal election. This allowed the Committee to undertake a short, sharp inquiry while the experience of the election was still recent. By responding quickly, the Committee aims to ensure that the changes it recommends to the electoral system will be implemented by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) well before. the next Federal elec·tion. In undertaking this task, the Committee has been greatly assisted by the submissions it has received and by the members of parliament who contributed to the Committee's survey on their experiences in individual electorates. The Committee has also benefited from having a dedicated and professional staff, without whom this report could not have been produced so promptly. In this regard, I would like to pay special tribute to the Secretary of the Committee, Bev Forbes, and to diligent assistants, Frances Coates, Patricia Tancred and Judy Jurek. The Committee's investigations revealed that many of the problems of the 1990 election arose out of the Australian Electoral Commission's failure to orientate its policies and strategies sufficiently towardS service, and as such were completely avoidable. The most acute problem experienced by electors on polling day 1990 was that many were forced to queue for unacceptably long periods prior to casting their votes. The Australian Electoral Commission could ""not supply the Committee with any satisfactory data on the extent of this problem, but it became clear that it was widespread and it was serious. LOng queues occurred at many polling places, with delays experienced in extreme cases of up to one hour or more. Responsibility for the queuing problem must be accepted by the Australian Electoral Commission, which, before the election, had centralised its procedures for estimating voter turnout and staff allocation. This led to the AEC itself cutting back the number of polling place staff by 11,483, a factor which contributed greatly to the queuing problems endured by many voters on election day. The fact that the Commission had run a very successful voter education campaign that resulted in a record voter turnout exacerbated ""the problem. To avoid the queuing problem at future elections, the Committee strongly recommends that the AEC employ additional staff and implement more flexible, less centralised staffing"" and resourcing policies. A second major shortcoming of the"" Australian Electoral Commission's management of the election was that the result was not known until four days after the close of polling. With minor parties and independent candidates receiving some 20 per cent of the total vote, it was their preferences which determined the result in several divisions; yet a distribution these preferences was not undertaken on election night. Prior to the election the AEC had denied that a notional distribution of minor party preferences on election night was needed. To prevent a recurrence of this problem, the Committee recommends that a new formal step be added to the House ""of Representatives scrutiny process. This step would allow scrutineers to have the opportunity to readily observe a two-candidate preferred vote in each polling on election night. If such a system had"" been implemented prior to the 1990 election, a result would have been known late on election night. A further shortcoming stemmed from the unacceptable delay in posting accurate results for both the House of Representatives and the Senate count on election night. Hardware and software computer problems held up the input of House of Representatives data and a third of the Senate vote actually counted was not entered onto the election night information system on polling night. The Australian Electoral Commission must take steps to prevent a repetition of these delays. In addition, there has been sustained criticism of the accuracy of the electoral roll, which has called the integrity of the electoral process into question. In an effort to enhance roll accuracy, the Commission has introduced a new on-line roll management system. The system does not, however, extend to divisional offices .in the eastern States and its full potential will not be realised until all divisional offices are on line. Other problems addressed by the Committee in this report include the perennial question of a candidate holding an office of profit under the Crown, ways of minimising optional preferential voting and several matters regarding how-to-vote cards. The inquiry also highlighted"" a number of management and operational deficiencies within the Australian Electoral CommISSIOn which require action. Of particular concern are inefficiencies arising from an excessively centralised decision making prooe,o;s and the inadequacy of of the training provided to divisional and polling place staff. Despite a high level of satisfaction with the cooperation and the assistance provided by most Australian Electoral Commission staff in divisional offices, throughout its inquiry the Committee became increasingly concerned about the failure of the AEC's central management to focus its efforts sufficiently on service. The Australian Electoral Commission presents itself as an organisation more concerned with enforc- "" place ing the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act than with using the Act as a basis for providing a service. Given the' problems identified throughout this inquiry, the Committee has concluded that the 1990 election was not as well managed as it should have been. In the light of this, it is our intention examine the Australian Electoral Commission in the current parliamentary term to ensure that the AEC has addressed the problems revealed by this inquiry so that the public will ,not be inconvenienced again at the ,1993 election. I commend the report to the House.",17
25,Mr MELHAM,ECONOMY,"The most serious of the difficulties that electors faced on polling day 1990 was that many were forced to queue for long and unacceptable periods. There is no doubt that the 1990 election will be remembered by many electors for that point alone. It was that long queuing that in many respects helped to bring the system into disrepute, because there were many anecdotal instances of people leaving queues because they' found it unacceptable that they. had to wait so long to cast a vote. In my electorate of Banks, in one subdivision in Padstow, an elderly voter had to be attended to by an ambulance officer because of the length of the queue: he collapsed waiting to register his vote. That is unacceptable in the system of democ-' racy that we have in this country. : What price democracy?We need to look' at this. One thing that stands out that could be attributed to the queueS being so long was that there were fewer ordinary vote issuing officers in the 1990 election compared with, the 1987 election. There were 2,902 fewer officers issuing ordinary votes. That of itself, especially if combined with the campaign by the Australian Electoral Commission which saw record voter t-rnouts, in my view. is one of the main reasons why there were long queues. It is not as if the Australian Electoral Commission was not on notice that problems would result. There is no doubt that the Commission's staffing levels were based on unrealistic figures, and that was brought to its attention by the Public ,Sector Union. But the Commission chose to do nothing about it. It is all right to be wise in hindsight, but it should not happen again. If it does, then heads should roll.",19
26,Mr MILES,ECONOMY,"There to reis just one comment which 1 would like to make in regard to the 1990 election, and that concerns the importance of the Australian Electoral Commission having a service orientation to the community. The Commission is not dealing with just any process; it is dealing with the most fundamental process in a democracy.",19

28,Mr KERR,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS,"1 think 1 speak on behalf of all members of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in saying that the process that has been adopted by the House and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) of referring the various Auditor-General's audit reports in relation to Aboriginal affairs to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs appears to be working extremely well. We have been very pleased with, the cooperation and assistance we have received from the various organisations now charged with the responsibility' of administering Aboriginal affairs and, in particular, the cooperative response we have received recently from officers of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in responding to the Auditor General's :reports, Our r-port reflects on issues which were relevant . before the establishment of ATSIC in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission in particular, but ATSIC has maintained many of the personnel who were involved in decisions under ADC and they cooperated and responded to the issues that were raised. There are a few important matters of principle covered in our response to the Auditor-General's report. In particular, I mention three points, the first of which is in respect of the overlapping of different objectives that may apply in the purchase of Aboriginal land. In relation to a number of purchases of Aboriginal stations, the Auditor-General expressed concern that there was a conflict of objectives, that payments to finance operations of those properties were made for the future benefit of Aboriginal"" people rather than to enable them to engage in business enterprise. The Auditor-General clearly was of the opinion that, either expressly or implicitly, the two powers contained in the Aboriginal Development Commission'Act under section 23 and section 24 were mutually exclusive. Similar provisions apply in the new ATSIC legislation, so the point was important. However, ATSIC obtained legal advice from the Attorney-General, whose opinion is set out in section 2.6 of our report to the House. The Attorney's advice plainly is that ATSIC can apply powers for more than one specified purpose. In other words, there can be a purpose both of permitting Aboriginals to reside on land and of allowing Aboriginals to exercise business interests. So on that particular matter it is plain that the Australian National Audit Office misapprehended the law. Nonetheless, we. have recommended in our report that the Auditor-General continue to be aware of the complexities in this area. It is not a matter fOJ; lack rigour. Where two heads of powers may each support particular expenditure, it is stilL important to make sure that the investments are authorised under, the sections I mentioned. It is not an excuse for lack of rigour. We do find in that particular instance that the Audit Office misapprehended the law .. Sectio- 2.26 of the report is al-o relevant in this regard. Where ATSIC is seeking to achieve two objectives in any particular transaction, we believe it portant that ATSIC establish its strategic rationale for the economic and social objectives of the project and clearly ,set out so that the performance of the project can be appropriately assessed. The second point that' I think warrants comment relates to purchasing of properties. It is always' a particularly difficult issue because if it is known in small rural communities that there is interest from Aboriginal purchasers, land prices may become inflated. In that regard, ATSIC naturally seeks valuations. In the particular case of Tanami Downs, the Auditor General was critical of the process used by the ADC where the purchase price was much higher. than the Government valuation. However, we examined that particular purchase in some depth. We have made in-principle recommendations which we believe will be very important in ensuring that there is a properly organised methodology for the ATSIC organisation to pursue. We recommend that, firstly, valuers anonymously instructed b- engaged to prepare pre-purcha-e valuations and, secondly, that before any purchase ATSIC consider any non-commercial factors that may apply to an acquisition and formally: determine a ceiling limit for that acquisition, taking all factors into account. Once that is done, plainly there, can be little room for criticisJ;l1 of the processes. Finally, we have made some recommendations in relation to enterprise indicators. We believe that those recommendations will playa large part in making sure that the ATSIC organisation is able to demonstrate effectively the value of of its' investments to the better interests of the Aboriginal people of Australia.",19
29,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS," It is with pleasure that I rise to talk briefly on the report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on the review of the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 29, 1989-90. I thank the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who is the Chairman of the Committee, for his work and also the Committee secretariat. This report reveals disturbing practices is im- in the former Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). which has now been subsumed by the Aboriginal and Torres them Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). AIthough we cannot blame ATSIC for the sins of·a former body, it should be said that while the functions of that body have been taken over by ATSIC we would expect to see a better stan9ard of pei:for-­ ance from the new ATSIC than we dId from the old AlJoriginal Development Commission. The report reveals basically two factors: weaknesses in how· the ADC assessed enterprises and weaknesses in how funds were acquitted. With Tanami Downs, of which the Chairman spoke, possible weaknesses were shown in the way a price was .assessed. With Trelawney Station, weaknesses, ,were shown in the initial rationale of purchase. and how ongoing monitoring was assessed. We have made recommendations on aU these factors; we expect ATSIC to take. them into account and for us not to have to Qeal with, these same issues next year. Weaknesses were shown in how funds were acquitted. Tranby College was given money in August 1988 for treaty negotia-' tions and an unspent amount has still not been recovered over two years' later. Money given to the Island Coordinating Council for treaty negotiations was acquitted only after members of the Committee started asking questions in September 1990. I note that a question regarding the acquittal of funds in Aboriginal affairs which was asked in an Estimates committee three months ago today still. remains unanswered. I am told by the Committee secretariat that ATSIC says that it is having difficulty telling which funds have been acquitted and which have not. I fully accept that if funds are not acquitted' it not mean that something is wrong, but certainly an organisation like ATSIC should have a better idea. of the acquittal of funds for which it is responsible. Finally, concerns' were expressed in the Australian National Audit Office about the accuracy of some of the ADC's statements to this Parliament. It is really quite outrageous that an organisation should make comments to this Parliament that are clearly misleading. We have made it quite clear that the Committee will treat this most seriously should it happen again in the future. Mt .DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Ronald Edwards)-Order! The debate is intertupted in accordance with sessional order 102. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA",20
30,Mr LANGMORE,COMPANY DIRECTORS,"I move: That this House condemns the self-interested abuse of position by most company directors of large corporations in Australia in awarding themselves pay increases far in excess of those received by their employees and by similar disproportionate and unfair increases in executives' pay, and urges those business leaders to demonstrate the restraint they so commonly urge on wage earners. One of the central requirements for sus-, tained economic recovery is that we reduce the rate of inflation. This is common ground between both the Government and the Opposition. There is no doubt within the. economics profession, either, that a central requirement is the reduction of the rate of inflation. Wage earners have made a striking contribution to achieving that goal during the tenure of the accord of the last seven or eight years, and I congratulate the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table, for his role in that restraint. It has been. a very important contributi9n to reducing the rate of inflation in Australia. At the very same time that wage earners as a whole-all employees-have been does demonstrating such restraint, there has· been an explosion of incomes amongst directors and senior executives. This came to a head last year when, in one year, the average increase in all aspects of remuneration for directors of the holding companies of the 23 largest companies in Australia was 22 per cent. That is more than three times the rate of wage increases and has a very damaging impact on all other wage and salary earners and executives as well. It is true that amongst some of those companies there was not an increase, but amongst others there was a very sharp increase. Looking down the list of those 23 companies, one can' see that the average remuneration of their, direGtors is now over $1 m. All directors in thosecompaniesr-ceive mor- remuneration than memQers of parliament and most receive more than the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). , The average remuneration for directors last year was $240,000. That is just under 10 times average weekly earnings. The effect of the trend of rapidly increasing directors' pay throughout the 1980s has massively increased the difference between their pay and the pay of their employees. One cQnsequence of the explosion in directors' pay is that there has been a similar explosion in the pay of senior executives. The 10 highest paid executives in each of those 23 largest companies increased their remuneration by 17 per cen.t last year, which is more than twice the rate of growth of average weekly earnings. That continues 'a trend that has been apparent throughout the 1980s which has been clear to anyone who has been looking at this area. It is shown by all the statistics that I have been able to obtain and it has occurred in every year for which I' have been able to obtain figures during the 1980s. I have figures for the last five years. example; in 1985-86, seniQr managers received a pay increase of 111/2 per cent while wage earners received 61f2 per cent. In the following year, 1986-87, senior managers received 12 per cent and wage earners 7 per cent. In 1987-88, senior managers received 11 per cent and wage earners 6 per cent. In 1988-89, senior managers received an increase of over 11 per cent and wage earners just over 7 per cent. Last year, according to this statistical series prepared by a private sector salary assessment company, senior managers received an increase of 101f2 per cent and wage earners ,7 per cent.' The difference hascoritinued to grow throughout those last' five years, and the remuneration of the 10 highest paid executives in the largest companies totalled over $1 OOm in 1988-89. These are the same people' who argue to employees that they should exert wage restraint, ytft they are not doing so themselves. : Another example of thjs kind of indulgence isshow'o'infigurespublished recently in the Australian Financial Review an.d which show that companies dn ave'rage spend 5 per cent of their total cost of production on travel and 'entertainment. Five per cent of the cost of production is a quite substantial proportion. Yet that is being spent simply on fine dinners and interstate and overseas travel for the sen'ior staff of those companies. The centnil problem IS that the d,ecisicins about directors' pay and senior executives' pay are being made by those people themselves-by unaccountable groups who are able to increase their own pay without effective censure. It is true that shareholders, if: they choose, could criticise what directors award themselves and what they agree to pay their senior management, but there has been very little of that criticism until recently. At a few c0mpany annual. general meetings. in the last few months, there has been some' criticism of this, but it has not been common until now. The fact is that directors in Australia are not effectivelyaccountable to their shareholders. What can be done about this? The most obvious: approach is to publidse tIle difFor ference and, try to persuade directors and senior executives to exert more self-restraint.But that method has been tried for sOqle years without good ,effect. The Prime Minister has been critical of directors and senior management for allowing, their own pay to explode, but it has not stopped. Another approach would be to· encourage shareholders to intervene more actively at company meetings; that would certainly be desirable. Directors are, in theory, responsible to shareholders and shareholders should exert the power that they have. But so far that has not been effective in persuading them to exert restraint. Another approach would be to have a more progressive income tax so that those very high incomes were taxed more' heavily, but there are a lot of reasons why is not appropriate. Another possibility would be to draw directors and senior executives into the national wage fixing system in the same way that employees are drawn into it. However, there would be a scream of criticism of that proposal if it were seriously made, and I do not think that is likely to be effective. One approach that has been suggested by Professor Hugh Stretton in a recent publication is to allow the Australian Securities Commission to assess the pay of directors and to approve it only when it is within guidelines. That would also attract a howl of protest. If directors go on increasing their pay in this way, that may be a step that ought to be taken. It has been argued that this growth in directors' pay has occurred as a result of the growth in profits. Undoubtedly, there is some truth in that; directors' pay is linked to profits. If that were the· sole explanation, then when profits are falling, as they are now, directors' pay ought also to fall, and that is clearly not happening. The evidence that one can obtain so far from company reports this year is that directors have stopped increasing their pay but have not reduced it. They would have to reduce it substantially to cope with the present fall in profits if they were to low that rule. I raise this issue because it is important. Publicising it may add to the moral pressure on directors to demonstrate more restraint. If they do not, then it would be surprising if the Government needed to adopt some more directive policy.",21
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPANY DIRECTORS,Mr Hollis)Is the motion seconded? Mr Bevis-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.,23
32,Mr CONNOLLY,COMPANY DIRECTORS,"Bradfield) (11.14)It is rather unfortunate that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) should come into the House and indulge in what can only be described as a deliberate attempt to sow dissension in the commercial community of Australia and among the Australian work force. That is not to say that the Opposition in any sense stands back from the reality of the that problem that, in times of economic downturn, it is essential that we see a sharing of the hardships brought upon all Australians as a result of the failure of Government policy. On 6 November, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) supported this very strongly when he said: As the economy sinks deeper into recession there is a need for a sharing of the hardship which has been created by the Government's policy errors. He went on to say: Corporate directors and senior executives could show the way. Corporate remuneration should be linked to the overall profitability of companies which is now sinking across the board. He went on to say: So unless they are going to be able to work against the trend, they must bite the bullet and signal now that they are willing and, indeed, taking action to cut back in 1990 and 1991. Therefore, there is a degree of support on this side of the House for the proposition that there needs to be restraint across the board. However, we do not support the use of language such as that mentioned by the honourable member for Fraser in his motion· when he moved: That this House condemns the self-interested abuse of position by most company directors of large corporations in Australia . . . folJust think of those words: 'condemns', 'self-interested abuse', 'most company directors of large corporations in Australia'. The honourable member has given us various statistics and so forth. He has not not mentioned the name of his colleague Senator Cook, who has been outstanding in his attempts to fan the fires of division and diversity in this particular field. The truth is that executive pay is a very complex issue. I take the time of the House to emphasise why it is so complex. Firstly, a large component of most senior executives' wage or salary is based upon performance. Different companies have different criteria for defining what they mean by performance. It is not just simply saying that, because a company had an increase in profitability last year of 10 per cent, that is a case for an increase in salaries. There may well be a company which did not have an increased dividend but which is a very soundly based company because it made. a long term judgment to reinvest its profits in capitalisation so that it will have a larger market share in the future. I merely mention that as an example of the difficulties we have in making an across the board analysis to condemn, as the honourable member for Fraser has in his motion, so many people in so many companies across· Australia. No doubt people will stand up and say, 'But there are examples of profligate spending and outrageous examples of shareholders being taken to the cleaners'. That is true. That will be one of the great shames of this country in the 1980s. Part of the reason for that again is the failure of Government policy. . Henry Bosch, the previous head of the National Companies and Securities Commission, made the point that he did not have the funds to carry out investigations which we now know were so important. An example is that of Qintex Ltd and Christopher Skase, who was making huge increases in his income at a time when the company was obviously on the skids. There are many other examples to bear that out. If we are not careful we run the risk of destroying one of the most important elements of the engine of economic growth in this country, and that is the capacity to produce a generation. of world-class corporate leaders and managers· vrho can make this country move forward and be able to compete on internation;ll terms. If we examine in more detail the list which the honourable member has given us today about the companies which he claims have transgressed, we .find again that he has not bothered to tdl this House the distinction between Australian-based companies and foreign-based companies. If we are talking about a foreign-based company which has its operation in Australia, its executive formula for salaries often takes into account the component relevant to an across the board payment which is paid to all executives of that company irrespective of where they may be internationally. In addition, we have other elements of the equation which also have to be taken into account. I have mentioned the question of profitability. Clearly, there is a link there. Short term considerations tend to ignore the fact that companies have to plan fori the medium and long term in terms of their strategic positions. TPFC, which has done considerable work in the area of comparative studies of salaries, makes the point that Australian managers lag behind their overseas counterparts in terms of purchasing power. TPFC claims that the average Australian chief executive officer (CEO) salary package is the equivalent of $US233,000. This contrasts with the average chief executive officer package of $833,000 in the United States, $389,000 in Canada, $377,000 in Germany and $308,000 in Japan and Britain. The other important consideration which has to be taken into account is the impact of the honourable member's motion and views such as his on the nonexecutive directors, a group which he has totally ignored in his analysis, compared with the· position of executive directors. We hear so often in this House and elsewhere that on the one hand we have a major tightening up of the corporate arrangements,'and the responsibilities of directors, whether they be executive or nonexecutive. But the reality of management at the company level is that the executive director is ultimately more able to control the destiny of that company than. nonexecutive directors. The latter group are often people of significant experience and backgro-nd in an industry. They are not necessarily responsible for the day to day management of the company. Legally, if anything goes wrong with those companies, they are responsible. That is how the company codes are now developed. That is a responsibility which must be paid for. But the ultimate responsibility must rest with shareholders. . The honourable member has made the point that up to very recently-the TNT Australia Pty Ltd board meeting was a classic example-there has been a very quiescent approach by shareholders. I simply suggest to the honourable member that the reason· for that is that up until very recently the level of profitability companies has been very good. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), the honourable member for Fraser and other members of the Government have come into this House and elsewhere and on all occasions have been delighted to tell us of the success of their policy. Surely under those terms it is impossible now to come along and complain about salary increases over the last two or three years and at the same time say, 'Yes, the level of profitability was high enough to justify most of those salary increases'. There are exceptions that is precisely why we do not support the view that the honourable member can claim that most senior executives and company directors are effectively abusing the system, demonstrating a self-interested view and so forth. My final point is very important. We have seen in recent years a decision by the Government to ensure that government corporations are able to compete both nationally and internationally for the tor. quality of the executives they want. In other words, the Government has allowed its own corporations to go out into the marketplace and determine salary and wage packages which means that their executives are at a comparable level. I make that point because it demonstrates the consistency of the approach of the honourable member for Fraser. The CEO of Qantas Airways Ltd, for example, had a salary in 1989-1 emphasise that this is the financial element of his total package alone-of $109,687. The next year, 1990, the salary package had gone up to $299,000. This is not a bad effort; it is well over 100 per cent. The same thing can be said for Telecom Australia, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Reserve Bank, Australia Post, Aussat and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. All of these senior executives and officers under them are now being paid on a salary scale comparable with similar positions in the vate sector. The Opposition does not object to that. We believe that the sooner we get government corporations out of the government sector and into the comof mercial sector where they are truly able to compete the better it is for everyone. The honourable member for Fraser should not .come into this House and claim that somehow or other the Government is able to maintain a position like Pontius Pilate where it can wring its hands about the level of salaries for executives and at the same time apparently claim that no-one else is in the same position. I also make the point that public servants across the board are now being paid more than those in the private sector. The earnbut ings of government employees are growing faster than those in the private sector and workers in States such as Victoria and Western Australia are also enjoying above average increases. The figures released recently by the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveal that the average weekly ordinary time earnings of full time adult employees rose 7.6 per cent in the public sector in the year to August, compared with only 5.7 per cent in the private secI simply put to the House that the evidence is clear: despite the apparent claims of the Government in relation .to the accord, the simple truth is that it is not possible to come into' this House and put forward a motion condemning a small in- group of people who have enormous responsibilities. Some of those people have broken the rules, some of them have broken the law and some of them are currently Her Majesty's inmates in the various gaols of the nation, and so it should be. lt is quite clear that over the past eight years the Government has had the responsibility for commercial law, for economic policy, and for funding the organisations under the Commonwealth which are responsible for maintaining adequate standards of ethics in our business community. The sad fact is that the Government has failed on all of these accounts. From now on, we are going to see a significant reduction in overall salaries pri- for senior executives of corporations, linked to the fact that we are in a recession. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it is important that these people should be prepared to set a standard for the community as a whole. But let us not, in this House or elsewhere, try to make some virtue of the fact that as a result of Government policy and as a result of the impact of free market forces on the determination of salaries of people at the top, the Government is now attacking those people who have worked within the system, made their profits and taken their share-there is no doubt about that-but now also have to be prepared to take lower salaries at a time of economic downturn. As I said initially, let there be no doubt that the quality of our executives ultimately will determine and guide the direction of economic improvement and the success of our commercial life in Australia. If the Government wants to attack those people, drive them offshore, put them into a situation where they are not prepared to work effectively to improve the economic well-being of their companies, then it can go ahead. That is what it has done through the accord. That is what it has done through the accord to the major proportion of the Australian work force. It has locked them into a situation where productivity gain in this country is now absolutely negligible. The Government is trying to suggest that if we reduce productivity across the board, even among executives, somehow or other Australia will be better off. At this stage, we do not need divisions within our community; we need a united effort. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, all Australians have to live in an environment which faces up to the problems before us. The Government, above all, has to set the standard. I am simply saying that the Government's record of handling chief executive salaries in the Public Service and the significant increase in wage determinations right across the public sector seriously bring into doubt the veracity of the motion put before the House this morning by the honourable member for Fraser.",23
33,Mr BEVIS,COMPANY DIRECTORS,"1 congratulate the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for drawing the attention of the Parliament to this important question, which goes to the very essence of social equity and wage justice. I should like to look briefly at the topic, initially through the eyes of an average Australian wage earner, a woman in the work force whom I will call Alice. Alice has undertaken several training courses during her employment and is now considered to be multiskilled and an asset to the company for which she works. In 1983 the Hawke Government replaced the years of confrontation and division experienced throughout the, 1970s with consultation, cooperation, consensus and the accord. In turn, Alice received greater income justice and her family gained improvements in their social wage, with Medicare and the family allowance supplement. For this, Alice and her union showed restraint. They did not lodge irresponsible claims with the Industrial Relations Commission and days lost due to industrial action were dramatically reduced. Real unit labour costs fell. What did some sections of corporate Australia do with this new opportunity, this golden chance to compete? In too many cases they squandered it in what amounts to the most costly lost opportunity in the past decade. To compound their felony, they increased executive salaries and directors' fees in a frenzy of self-adulation. We were told, 'You pay for what you get'. Obviously, those corporations paid an awful lot for things they no longer have. Let us look at some specifics. In the last financial year Elders IXL Ltd increased its executive remuneration packages by just under 23 per cent. Total director remuneration for the corporate giant rose by nearly 10 per cent. What did the shareholders receive for the extra $2.5m in senior executive salaries? They received an 80 per cent drop in operating profit. Another example is Adsteam, a company now accounting for less than 8 per cent of its former worth on the Australian Stock Exchange. Adsteam's highest executive fees rose by nearly 57 per cent in the past year, which is greater than average wage earners achieved in the past eight years. Adsteam's top director took a 53 per cent pay rise in a single year. That was a rise from a paltry $790,000 per annum to $1 -2m per annum. Adsteam's totftl executive remuneration rose by 34.5 per cent in the last financial year and directors' fees jumped by 22.7 per cent in the same ye'ar. If these people controlled the Parliament, with their idea of a tight corporate ship 1 suspect we would all be ,on sevenfigure salaries, with preferential share options on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Qantas Airways Ltd and Australian Airlines Ltd. Average' weekly earnings rose by only 7.3 per cent during 1988-89-not 22.7 per cent or 34 per cent or 57 per cent, but 7.3 per cent. On the whqle, corporate Australia has been as restrained as a crowd full of Fourex at Lang Park for a State of origin match. Yet these corporate leaders have the hide to turn around and tell Alice-honourable members will remember Alice; she is the worker who gave up some of her entitlements-that she must lose her penalty rates, take a pay cut and become more productive to save the company. This month Alice has been asked to give up her penalties because SPC Ltd directors got diversification awfully wrong. It all sounds a bit like Alice in Wonderland. I would, prefer to call it a case of malice in the industrial wonderland. A headline in Brisbane's Courier-Mail recently re.ad: 'Hewson lends support to SPC award battle'. The Australian Financial Review of Monday, 17 December said that SPC 'is a classic case of the workers picking up the tab for management's failed diversification strategy'. This company managed to involve itself in four ambitious agreements and takeovers that have resulted in an expected operating loss of $7.2m this year. What does the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have to say about that? At a doorstop interview at the SPC factory, he said that obviously the problem was the cost of wages, 'but clearly labour costs are the big element'. He blamed the workers, the wage and salary earners, who are clearly being too greedy; The Leader of the Opposition seems to have the same defective record player that his predecessors had. No matter what the record, it plays the same tune. The Leader of the Opposition opposes next year's $12 a week pay rise for ordinary Australian workers-a 2 percent rise for workers like Alice-on the basis that the economy cannot afford it. Presumably the economy can afford the 50 per cent pay rise Murdoch executives granted themselves in 1988-89 or the 50 per cent rise paid to BTR Nylex Ltd executives., Australian workers have made their sacrifices through unions and as part of their obligations under the accord. Equity demands that the burden be shared amongst all.",26
34,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPANY DIRECTORS,-.: Order! The time allocated for the debate has expired.

The honourable member will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA,27
35,Mrs BAILEY,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,"I move: , That this House: (1 ) calls on t-e Government to recognise the importance of primary production to the economic well-being of this nation; and (2) condemns the Government for causing a crisis of confidence throughout rural communities. . ' The terms of the motion 1I have put before this House today can best be summed up by a constituent of mine who, with a sense of despair in his voice, asked me, 'Doesn't this Goveniment want a rural industry in this country?'. That statement embodies the frustration and anguish of those living and working in rural Australia, who have always had a great sense of pride that the products of their labour have contributed to the economic well-being of this country. They have been the ones who can point with pride to the fact that their sector, the rural sector, has increased its farm product over the last 20 years from $2.1 billion to $12.8 billion, an average increase of 30 per cent per year. It is an increase rivalled only by the mining sector and is far greater than any other major economic sector. Michael Kirby, chief commodities analyst of the Australian. Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), says that for 1989-90 Australia's agricultural industries accounted for over $14 billion or 4 per cent of gross domestic product and 26 per cent of our export income. The performance of the Australian economy is very dependent on the fortunes of its commodities based industries. It is true that we are a small trading country and, as such, in global terms we are price takers. Our wool and wheat industries are present testimony to this fact, but, given that our national economy is dependent on our rural industries, there certainly is justification' for our farmers feeling badly let down by this Government. They have been battling high interest rates, high inflation, increased freight fuel charges, higher taxes and rates, while at the same time they have been facing declining prices for their commodities. The reality out in rural Australia is that people have been forced off their land. They are being forced to shoot stock and accept inequitable wool quotas, falling living standards and high levels of unemployment. Sadly, they have also had to accept for far too long poorer access to health and education services than their urban counterparts. The ABARE forecast released just two days ago now says net farm cash income is set to fall by 39 per cerit for 1990-91. The report states that the effect of this drop for all broad acre farms is 58 per cent in real terms; ranging from falls of 67 per cent for mix,ed livestock cropping and 70 per cent for sheep enterprises. The rural sector is facing a short term future similar to that period of the 198283 drought at a time when Australia's farmers have led the way with increased productivity rates. They have produced more with greater efficiency, only to find that there is either no market or limited market for their goods. Added to this, the ABARE report states: A further decline is projected for 1991-92 before a modest recovery over the medium term. As a result the rural sector is likely to face strong adjustment pressures over the first half of the 1990s. This is both the crux of the problem and the hope for the future-the need to restructure and develop new markets. We have an abundance of natural resources, talent, energy, technical expertise and determination but the average Australian farmer is 57 years old. Neither he, nor the younger ones still left on the land, have the expertise in research, marketing and promotion. They look to government for that but this Government, faced with a continuing economic crisis of its own making, has abrogated its responsibilities. It is not leading. It is not showing any sense of purpose or change of directionunlike the recent Liberal Party trade mission into China, actively looking for new markets. . That is why in shirking its responsibiland ities this Government has caused a crisis of confidence throughout rural Australia. People have lost faith. There is great confusion and uncertainty about the, future. This Government will not accept responsibility for its own actions of inflicting high interest rates for far too long---'Mr Ronaldson-It blames everyone else.",27
36,Mrs BAILEY,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,"Exactly-for its pathetic inaction in not achieving the microeconomic reform it constantly tells us' it is going to achieve. It attempts to lay blame everywhere except on its own head. For example, recently we heard the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) blame the increase in bankruptcies for small businesses, thousands of which have been in rural areas, on poor business management-not a mention of interest rates, taxation or compliance costs. Then we have the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) criticising the workers of SPC Ltd for standing up to the Victorian Trades Hall Council in an effort to retain their jobs and blaming the plight of the industry on poor managers-nothing to do, he says, with an Australian company being uncompetitive in the face of cheap imports. Just yesterday, the Minister had the audacity to say, 'There's a bit of unemployment around'a cruel understatement if ever there was one. Then we have this Government absolutely tongue-tied and refusing to intervene in the Victorian meat industry dispute where there is $5 billion worth of meat export industry at risk. Then we have the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) telling us that this recession we are in is the one that we had to have. Is it any wonder with such irresponsible statements and lack of action that our rural sector has no confidence in this Government? Is it any wonder that they and other small business people are going to gather in their thousands on 4 January to demonstrate their lack of confidence in this Government? The real tragedy though, I believe, is that when global commodity prices were high this Government frittered away·. a golden opportunity to develop .new markets. Not nearly enough effort has been made by this Government to change the direction of our trade and seek new outlets for our commodities. We have to accept the fact that with no changes to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade rules there will be a continuation of the present system, and, because of the infrequency of GATT talks, there is little likelihood of reform in international agricultural trade before the next century. This Government has overlooked the potential right here on our doorstep. There has been a· shift in demand from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries to the developing countries. ABARE predicts that economic growth in South East Asia will remain at around 6 per cent for 1991. Dr Gus Hooke, director of research with the National Farmers Federation, says: In the OECD countries, the average annual of demand for agricultural products is projected to be 1.4% in 1990-99 and then to fall to only 0.4% in 2010-2019. However, in developing Asia a 10 per cent rise in per capita income causes demand for agricultural products to increase to about 6 per cent. This represents a solid demand. In looking at the other side of the equation-the supply side-the amount of land suitable for farming has been declining in proportion to the growth of industrialisation; factories, offices and roads have util-: ised farming land. What this means, of course, is that there will need to be a strong growth of imports of agricultural products into that region. Let me just remind the House of the. populations of countries in this region, based on 1989 figures: China, 11/2 billion; Indonesia, 178 million; India, 821 million; Korea, 42 million; Philippines, 60 million; Taiwan, 20 million; Thailand, 56 million-to name but a few. How then can the beleaguered Australian rural sector take advantage of these huge markets right here on our doorstep? Our short history as a nation has proved that our rural industries have made a vital contribution to our national economy by .being flexible and able to adapt to changing markets. Efficiency and productivity are also hallmarks of our rural industries. With the shrinking of our traditional markets and uncertainties about eastern European markets' as they restructure their economies from centrally planned to market based systems, there 'is an urgent need for this Government to target the growth sector of South East Asia. If this Government would show some leadership, ther1,lral sector could be given some hope. Instead of farmers and their families feeling like flotsam being swept in and out by changing commodity prices and whims of government; they should be encouraged by government to be aware of new market developments and have their technical skills upgraded to adapt quickly tq changes. , In tandem with adapting commodities growth to changing markets, this Government should be capitalising on the growing market for value-added foods as Asian populations become more westernised. At present, only one-quarter 'of our commodity exports have a' value-added component. Not only do we need to produce marketable products, we need to ensure that the handling, storage, manufacturing, stevedoring and shipping charges allow us to remain competitiveThe challenges are there. It is now up to this Government to redress the mistakes of its economic policies and to statt restructuring'. There are thousands of families iIi rural Australia whose self-imleagues age is battered and bruised.' Unless this Government changes its economic, direction, it will destroy rural Austr-lia:'",28
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,"Mr Hollis)Is the motion, seconded? Mr Broadbent-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.",30
38,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,"1 certainly ,do not agree with this motion. There are two matters to deal with and I will deal with them individually. Certainly, as a third generation sugar cane farmer, I do not need any Collins Street hobby farmer to come in here and tell me about the importance of agriculture; nor does the Labor Government need to be told about the importance of agriculture.",30
39,Unknown,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,Opposition members interjecting,30
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,"Order! The previous speaker was heard in silence; this one will be as well. ' Mr COURTICE""-I suggest that members of the Liberal Party take a good look at the map of Australia. Two-thirds of the Australian land mass is represented by Labor members. Labor members represent agriculture in the electorates of the Northern Territory, Kalgoorlie, Grey, and Hinkler, which is my seat. The electorates of my colleagues the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and electorates throughout 'rural and provincial Australia are represented by Labor members. As chairman of the primary industries committee I recognise, as also do the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Government, the importance of agriculture. Agriculture, along with mining, contributes some 69 per cent of gross domestic product to our nation. The second point criticised the Government for causing a crisis of confidence. Quite obviously, while this motion was framed on 18 October, it is obvious that the honourable member MCEwen (Mrs Bailey), who spoke before me, is unaware of the facts. The only people who have caused a crisis of confidence are her colin the National Party of Australia, who have attended rural rallies right across Australia and, in particular, in my home State of Queensland, where most of the rallies were held. They talked down agriculture, wanted to surrender, criticised the Government's fight for freer trade, and basically told farmers that they had no hope. We are not wimps. We have been constructive. The Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has met with the National Farmers Federation. My committee has met with the National Farmers Federation. Indeed, I was criticised for not being at that meeting; I was here in the House debating a matter of public importance on agriculture at that time. Subsequent to that, my committee travelled throughout northern and north-west Queensland. What we found there was 32 years of neglect under the former National Party Government. We met with 40 groups right across the broad spectrum and we have taken up many of those issues. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), who is at the table, is fully aware, one of the most glaring examples was Mornington Island, where some 85 per cent of the population are Aboriginal and have water for only six hours out of every 24. I could go on for an hour and a half with a litany of problems that we found in northern and north-west Queensland. On top of that, I convened a meeting with the Queensland Farmers Federation on 14 November. At that meeting there were representatives from the Cattlemen's Union of Australia, the United Graziers Association of Queensland, the Queensland Cane Growers Council, the Queensland Grain Growers and the dairy and fishing organisations. We were able to work together constructively to overcome some of the serious difficulties we face. Through negotiation and consultation we have been able to get the message back to the grassroots growers. That is not achieved by rural rallies where people have 10 minutes to stand on the back of a truck and yell and scream at each other. One of the glaring examples of misinformation that has been spread, in Queensland in particular, has been on the importation of food products; It was spread by the Laurel and Hardy of politics in Queensland, big Senator Ronnie Boswell and little Senator Billy O'Chee, who have been running around Queensland saying that the Government, by supporting freer trade, is responsible for the horticultural, peanut and pig industries falling apart. I have a transcript here of a comment from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), who said on 14 December that he could not support a ban on food produce imported into Australia. I welcome that comment by the Leader of the National Party. I wish he had said it when these rural ral.:. lies were on. But while he is late in saying so, he has ultimately agreed with our position. However, it is about time he disciplined some of the troglodytes in his own Party in Queensland who are spreading misinformation. What that means is that it takes a lot of time and effort to get the message through to the grassroots constituency. The Government is not going to ban imported food products because that would'impact on our markets overseas. We have already brought in legislation in conjunction with the State governments. I compliment the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Michael Tate, for bringing in compulsory labelling of all fruit juices with country of origin. I think it is an outstanding achievement. That then gives consumers the opportunity to promote their own preference. So, through consumer preference, we will support our Aussie products without contravening our position at the General Agreement on . Tariffs and Trade. A further initiative of the Minister has been to call on all State Ministers to support our point of view. I am sure that the majority of members on the other side of the House-certainly some of the drier Liberals; I do not know about the wet ones-will support our proposition to have all food products, both processed and unprdcessed, labelled with country of origin, because at the present time many imported food products which are packaged in Australia are getting through the system by saying 'Packaged in Australia'. If we are able to achieve that result-I believe we should all lobby and pressure all State Ministers for health to get that agreement through'-again we will use consumer preference to .ensure that our Aussie products get a go. I have already received congratulations from the fishing industry' in South Australia for the initiative, and I think it is a great one. That is the way to overcome those problems. But it is not enhanced when we have opportunist senators from the discredited, and disgraced National Party in Queensland going to farm rallies and telling farmers half the truth instead of all the facts. It is a p'ity that those senators have not been brought into line and made to tell the truth. With regard to the statements made by the honourable member for MCEwen about what the Government should or should not be doing, I point out that the Liberal Party's own rural task force commented that if there were short term solutions, the Government would have already implemented them. The Liberal Party knows things are tough, and so do we. If the honourable member for McEwen wants to make a statement and to put out a press release, that is her prerogative. But she wants to stick to the facts; she wants to make sure that she knows what she is talking about. With regard to the positive things that the Federal Government has done, we need look only at the rural adjustment scheme. This year some $60m has been allocated to it. The Federal Government has indicated that if things get tough in the States, it will step in. ' Mrs Bailey-If they get tough! What do you call now?",30
41,Mr COURTICE,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,"There is another example of ignorance. It is envisaged that the States will be able to handle matters with that amount of money until June or July next year. If not, the Government will step in. With regard to rural counselling, - some $lm has been .allocated in 1990-91, and already some 5,000 people have been counselled; the counsellors do a great job. We recognise that there are some farmers who have lost equity. But we are not about to jump on the bandwagon to solicit cheap votes out of the suffering of some farmers who have done it tough. With regard to other support structures that we have introduced, let us talk about the tough issues of micro-economic reform, a proposition that the Liberals had nearly 40 years to carry out, from the good old days of 1949, and wimped out on every opportunity they had. Let us talk about tariffs and. tariff protection. Tariff protection on manufacturing is now down to 17 per cent from 22 per cent in 1984-85. Let us look at the waterfront. Often the Opposition likes to have a go at us about the waterfront. But it had 40 years to move. What did it do? It wimped. When it tried to take on the union movement, it had a wages blowout. It attacked. the unions because it is not within the Opposition's capacity to work with the union movement; it is anathema to the Opposition to look at the work force as being anything other than cheap labour. We heard the honourable member promote the voluntary employment agreements. I would like to see her work in a sawmill for a while and talk about productivity as the only way by which the workers could get a wage rise. People cannot stick a Jog of timber through a mill any quicker than the saw will turn around. Let us look at the program on reform in the shipping industry. We have reduced average crew numbers from 27.9 in 1989 to 24.9 at present, and will reduce them to 20.8 at the conclusion of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority program in 1992; we will improve access to foreign flag vessels; harbour tug manning has been reduced by 25 per cent-a total of 300 positions by 1992. They are facts. That is not wishy-washy talk. We have had the courage to do it. But at the same time we have seen a reduction in non-farm unit labour costs of 10 per cent. We have seen cooperation with the trade union movement. That productivity and that reduction in unit labour costs are starting to get industry picking up and starting to get our exports picking up. When we talk about value adding, let us look at it in my home town of Bundaberg, where we are exporting soft drinks, which is sugar in aluminium cans, to New Zealand. That represents $3m a year. I suggest that the honourable member visit Bundaberg to look at a fully integrated, fully value-adding industry, and to better acquaint herself with agriculture before she gets up and makes some silly statements simply to put out a press release. All I can say is: Peter Cleeland, you'll be . coming back, son, in two years.",31
42,Mr BROADBENT,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,"Corinella) (11.55)I have never been more disappointed than I have been today with the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). I would have thought, having regard to the feeling that he has for the people in his electorate, that he would have shown more concern for the plight of those people in rural Australia. He has today discredited and disgraced this House. I believe the honourable member used .those words a few moments ago.in regard to the National Party of Australia, but I refer to the discredit and disgrace that he launched into in this House this morning, and his failure, to recognise the positive statements presented this morning in the speech by the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey). He missed the positives and he missed what the honourable member for MCEwen was putting to this House when she pointed out a way in which we could possibly go. Instead, we have gone to the only point that this Party opposite can come from, and that is derision and personal denigration. When there is no answer, Government members always turn to these tactics of personal denigration and derision in regard to the Opposition or anybody who tries to make a reasonable contribution. Who attended those rural rallies? I will tell honourable members who was in attendance at those rural rallies-people who were not just bleeding from the pockets, but who were worried about their children, their children's children, and the fact that the farm that they had set up for themselves may not be there for their children. It is right for the honourable member for Hinkler to move away from his place in this chamber and sit somewhere else because he needs some support from a new member. It is the new members who are going to have to face up to the problems of future parliaments and the problems in the rural sector of Australia that are being put into place at this moment. He then· mentioned, with great gall, the fact that this proposal was to be put to this Parliament on 18 October. But because the Parliament has not sat, this motion has not been able to be put before the Australian people. Of course, the position is far worse day than it was on 18 October. People are in far more trouble noW, coming up to Christmas-a most difficult time. Talking about celebrations, today we celebrateor I do, anyway-the birthday of Sir Robert Menzies. It is also the birthday of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), I might add, and I expect that he will have the same future in this House as his predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies. I am sure that the new member from Western Australia will enjoy great success. Honourable members should think about it: the crisis of confidence, especially in my State of Victoria, has been caused by mismanagement on the part of this Federal Government and the lack of confidence that the Australian people now have in the ability of this Government to pull any lever whatsoever. They know now that the Government is tossing a coin and trying to decide which lever to pull. Most of the decisions it has made during the last seven years have been wrong, and the impact on the rural community has been more dramatic than that which has been felt in the city. In my State, 17 Victorian abattoirs have closed, with all the emyloyment consequences that go along with that. We have had years and years of belt tightening in the bush in. this nation, especially in Victoria. But now in Victoria we have the Kirner Government to add to the problems. It was good today to read, on page 18 of the business section of the· Age, an article headed, 'Austrade serves up statistics to spread some cheer', by Tim Colebatch. It begins as follows: Austrade has good news for us. While wool exports and net earnings from tourism were collapsing in 1989-90So earnings from tourism and wool are absolutely collapsing. We are talking about an economic basket case. That is what we are talking about in Victoria: an economic basket case in rural areas. I note today that the rural areas of Queensland are under threat. If the honourable member for Hinkler read the news today, he might have noted that Cyclone Joy is still at the first stage, but it may be threatening the sugar crops and he might be going home to- to a most disheartening Christmas. A letter to the editor in today's Age, from Betty Arundell of Yeodene, is headed, 'Mayhem in meat industry is making all Victorians poorer' - and on and on we go. It never ends. Throughout rural Australia today we have massive problems. I know it is recognised by honourable members opposite, and I know that they then come into this House, find arguments and talk about what a Minister mayor may not be doing about a particular issue. Meanwhile, the crisis continues-and I applaud the honourable member for MCEwen for being prepared to make a positive statement in this. House. It is about time that this House began to look at what messages this Government is giving to rural communities. One is the argument that high interest rates have not really been the cause. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you what the ANZ Banking Group Ltd is doing in Australia today. It has lowered credit card interest rates today by one per cent. They are now down. to 23.84 per cent, effective on 1 February. However, it has reduced its interest-free period from 25 days to 15 days. Rural Australia has a massive problem. When a householder: needs some credit, the only option one' has is Bankcard or some form of credit card with an interest rate of 23.84 per cent. These rates are usury; we are told this is the recession we just had to have; and that these are the interest rates we just had to have. I know it was embarrassing for the honourable member for Hinkler to stand there today and try to present a reasonable argument on behalf of his Government. It is terribly unfair of him to have made the' statements he has made today. . The Australian nation will be better off when personal derision goes ,out of this House and honourable members who put forward positive statements get support from people like him.",32
43,Mr HULLS,PRIMARY PRODUCTION,"1 think I have about 30 seconds, so that does not give me much tiine""to oppose the motion. But in the short time available to me, I 'simply want to quote to the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) and the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) what Mr Rick Farley of the National Fariners Federation said recently. I' think it is an interesting and correct quote. He said: A lot of farmers v.:ouldn't like to admit it best thing that has happened is Labor winning regional seats. This has widened the policy of the Labor Party to give greater to rural areas. Mr Rick Farley is dead right. To be frank, motions such as this really only rev crisis mentality. It ill behoves the honourcorruption able member for MCEwen to hold out false hopes t6 the rural sector by assumare ing that the realities of the marketplace can' be easily changed. By revving up crisis mentality, the Opposition gives to the banks to raise their margins rural borrowers. I would like to know whose interests are really served by tions such as this.",34

45,Mr SNOW,STATE POWERS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I move: That the House determines that the Government should proceed to use its powers and seek additional powers from the people, if required, to disburse all State powers to federal and local government, as appropriate, and the administration of many federal programs to local government. The present system of government in Australia is costly and inefficient. The State boundaries, which were drawn up in London, bore no relationship what soev,er to the communities in Australiacommunities around ports and communities of larger territories in inland Australia. Today, we have 15 chambers ofparliament, which is all right if we are interested in party jobs for the boys or occasionally the girls. But it is not necessarily the best system for proper government. Why? Because we are overgoverned. The present Federal system is unwieldy and cumbersome because the States have a pretty poor record with regard to respecting democracy. That is one good reabut the son. We have only to look at Queensland, with its previous National Party Governscope ment; we have only to look at New South consideration Wales, particularly pre-1976. Let us compare the record of all State governments with that of Federal governup a ments. There has been no major Federal problem since I became interested in politics in the 1950s. The States far more likely to make bad financial decisions. I give just a few examples. The a previous Liberal Government in Victoria fuel decided that Western Port Bay would befor come the Ruhr of Australia. What happened there? If we go to Western Port moBay today, we find that fortunately that has not happened. The great steel industry which was envisaged by the then Bolte has exGovernment has not happened. We have State governments cutting one ' another in their prices for power. We have State governments competing for industries and being prepared ,to offer lower prices to firms which will come into their States. Who. ends up paying for those price cuts? The ratepayers, the other people who pay for power in those States. We have governments trying to enter business and making the same mistakes as private enterprise has made. No wonder there has been a trend in Australia away from State power through sensible court decisions. Let us complete the trend. Even the best managed States have problems because the Federal Government controls taxe.s. They have problems because the control of non-Federal areas then comes under the power of Federal governments. We find that, because Federal governments control taxes and tell States how they would like money to be spent, they are actually controlling areas which have not traditionally been in the Federal sphere. Nothing that any governmenteither Liberal, National or Labor-has done has been able to alter the trend away from State power to Federal power. Courts have clearly established the control .of the Federal Government to a greater extent than ever before. We have had a shift in Commonwealth-State powers since Federation. Abolition of State governments is therefore logical in recognising the reality-that is, a· decline in State powers. There is no justification for State control of systems such as school systems. A child who goes from Victoria to Queensland may not be able to cope with the same year of schooling in a different State. For example, he or she may not cope with differences in the mathematics curriculum arid may find that the English curriculum taught in Queensland was covered in Victoria in a previous year. We find that traffic laws are different. If one turns right in Victoria,. the person turning left gives way. If one turns right in New South Wales, one has to give way to the person turning left. There is no justification for the courts being different from State to State. There is no reason why a person should have twice as much chance of going into gaol in New· South Wales as in Victoria, which is the case today. Surely crimes that are being committed present a similar danger to the community in whichever State they occur. There is no reason for employment conditions being different from State to State. State powers which ought to go to the Federal government include the power to create uniform laws on children. Just yesterday we ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. I seek leave to table that convention because it is relevant to the debate. Leave granted.",34
46,Mr SNOW,STATE POWERS,"I thank the House. This convention, which was worked on for some 10 years by the previous Government in which the honourable member  which has been worked on since by the present Government, has been worked on by the States and by non-government organisations right throughout Australia. Yet we find the Federal Government saying to the States in September of this year, 'We would now like you to tell us if you have any objections to the signing of this convention. We would like you to have those objections with us by late bctober'. There were no objections lodged, and yet we find in New South Wales the State Attorney-General making a speech, which has been passed on to me, in a Liberal Party forum opposing that - onvention. He did not present any objection to the Federal Government, so we can now assume, I guess, that he would feel free to go against the convention in spite of the fact that it has been ratified by the Government after full consultation and indeed cooperation with the States. Now we find that the urgent need for uniform laws on children may be hampered by the fact that State governments have not cooperated on that convention. Other areas where State powers ought to go to the Federal government include communications. In most areas of communications, particularly the airwaves, the Federal Government controls legislation. In the area of print, State governments are involved with legislation. The honoura9le member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) wanted to introduce an important motion on the Pacific Highway today which unfortunately the Opposition tacoperated tics earlier today have prevented from coming up. The debate will not happen. The motion does raise ari important point about the differences between Federal and State government on land transport. Land transport ought to come under Federal government. National standard laws' should be plemented. If one has a faulty bike in Hobart, it ought to be faulty in Darwin. If one has food that is substandard in Perth, it ought to be substandard in Sydney. The same applies to drugs. National standards should apply to indusficient. trial relations. When the Commonwealth Employment Service tries to put people into training, there may be a problem. It cannot tell the employer what the wage is because it is not its prerogative. Again find that State and Federal systems conflicting. Industrial relations ought be under the Federal government. Economic management is another area where national standards should apply. The Canberra Times recently drew attensame tion to the fact that more than $6 billion of Commonwealth money given to the lian States in 1988-89 had not been accounted for by JulY' 1990 according to an Austrathe lian National Audit Office survey. That disgraceful, and it reflects the problem that Federal and State governments have in ensuring that money is properly spent; $6 billion was'not properly accounted for. Then we have local government probagainst lems. I am not going to go into those problems so that other speakers will have time to speak, but I do say that a formed local government structure which incorporates accountability, democratic representation and dispersal of bureauAustralia cratic powers would be more responsive that process. than existing State governments. With a reformed lo-al government .critical structure, whereby people can be properly represented by full time local government people, we could give local government control over important public works and services, such as recreational facilities; health, including hospital management; welfare; housing-Queanbeyan is an excentralisation ample of where local government has cotralians with a building society to effect some housing reforms which do not happen often enough-land use planning and control; inspections and licensing; pollution regulation; emergency services; law and order in the local area; and manage- ' ment of sub-tertiary education. I strongly support a move to a twoimsphere systeni of government, which will be less costly and less confusing, which will reduce buck-passing, which will acknowledge the reality that States only have such power 'as Federal ,governments allow them anyway and which will be more efDr Catley-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.",35
47,Mr CADMAN,STATE POWERS," Mr we Deputy Speaker, I admire the genuineness are of the honourable member for Edento Monaro (Mr Snow), who has just spoken, in bringing this motion before the House. He is sincere in the hypothesis that he is putting to the Parliament. However, it is just the Whitlam era revisited; it is the thing all over again from the AustraLabor Party (ALP). Reduce the number of governments in Australia and centralise power; that is the process that honourable member is putting to the is House and the process that he would like to see the Australian people adopt. It just will not happen. History is against the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. It is not the history of Australia that is him; it is the history of his own Party. There is not a person in Australia that will trust the Prime Minister (Mr reHawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to 'run Australia from here. The people have had enough of the way in which has gone. They would not trust If the horiourable member wants to be of some of the practices of State governments, I will venture into some of the practices' of mismanagement of the Victorian and Western Australian governments. They have been deplorable. What I am saying in reply to the honourable member who has just spoken is this: the of power is something Auswill not accept under the Australian Labor Party. They have seen the abuse of that process and they do not believe that Ministers such as the Treasurer, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) have a genuine interest in decentralising or devolving their systems. portfolios. They are centralists. They want to control things here from this chamber and send their bureaucrats into the suburbs and the country areas of Australia to tell people what is good for them. No Australian will trust that process. The history of the Cain, Burke and Dowding governments is legend in Australia. Those State governments have put thousands of millions of dollars of abuse onto their people. If we look at an alternative, a way in which State governments can be managed, and look at the State of New South Wales we can see that, by application to the task and genuine cooperation, things can be improved. This problem will not be solved by dumping the States. It will be solved only if the nation dumps the ALP. That is the only solution to this problem because, indeed, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was being critical of the inefficiencies our system. They are inefficiencies that are being endorsed by the honourable member in a most wasteful way. There have been efforts recently, however, by the Prime Minister.to create a new sense of federalism and to try to resolve many of the issues, minor issues in fact, that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has enunciated. One needs to look at the comparison between State governments. One only needs to look at some of the advantages of good government and compare them with the advantages of bad Government. Fot instance, in New South Wales the Budget deficit for last year was $119m. In Victoria it was $729m. If one looks at the productivity gains, the borrowings and the debt charges in New South Wales one can see that, under effective government, States can succeed. On the other hand, we have both a Federal Government and State governments in Victoria and Western Australia that think the taxpayers meet the bill for anything they happen to dream up. The gross situation we find ourselves in now-a recession, the borrowings, lack of productivity and lack of budgetary control exercised by the HawkeKeating Government-is a condemI1ation of the central system as much as the State There is no panacea to resolve this problem. The only way in which it can be resolved is to attend seriously to areas of difference to find-by negotiation-resolution of those conflicts, if possible, and to have at the central core a government that is prepared to manage the relationship between States and exercise a rigour itself that this Government has not been prepared to impose upon itself in borrowings, in debt, or in its relationships with its own employees and the industrial relations system of Australia. We have only to look at the losses in Victoria to see the abuse of that system. Victorian people are going to have to pay $45,OOOm over a period. That is a horrendous abuse by a State government. Looking at Western Australia, the closest figure identified at this stage for wasted money by WA Inc. stands at about $700m. That of money has to be paid back by the people of that State. If one looks at the massive deficit that Australia is running as a .nation, instigated by the central Government, one sees that there is a massive debt on every man, woman and child in Australia. If we compare that with the declining debt levels in New South Wales, the increased productivity of government instrumentalities, the net public sector financing requirements of that State, the way in which asset sales have been dealt with, and the micro-economic reform we see that, working in concert, Federal and State governments can achieve a lot. The trouble with the proposition put by the honourable member to the Parliament today has been that he is not prepared to acknowledge that the current governments in the States and the current Government in Canberra can change and produce positive results. The proposition he is putting is, 'Get rid of the States and then we will have a Hawke-Keating Govwill ernment dealing with the local governments of Australia'. I cannot imagine anything worse, frankly. I do not think any Australian will wear that proposition. If the honourable member put it to a referendum right at this point, there would be a massive rejection of it. The simple reason for this is the lack of trust that the honourable member spoke about, the lack of confidence in government that has been created by the Australian Labor Party. In every State except one and here in Canberra, the Australian Labor Party has created this· distrust because there has been a lack of consultation. The Prime Minister says after an event that he would like to consult even with hispafty colleagues in the future, but proceeds not to. The Treasurer is remote and isolated and he does not consult. The Governments of Victoria and Western Australia, those shining examples of abuse of funds, were secretly hiving off taxpayers' money for smart investments that those geniuses in those States thought were going to reap a reward for the States. They knew nothing about the projects and they lost the money. They have been caught with their hands in the till in a collective sense, not in a personal sense. The proposition that there be less government flies in the face of the will and the wish of the Australian people. They feel that they need some protection from an avaricious Treasurer. This is happening at the very time when the whole of Europe is looking for an opportunity to express itself. The people there want to vote. The Soviets all want· to have a say about what is happening in their central government and the Australian Labor Party wants to go in the opposite direction. That proposition is crazy. People trust the system if they can have a say. What we are doing here on this side of the House is offering alternative propositions of consultation and we also have a program called Australia 2000 where we are going out and asking people. Why do honourable members opposite not do the same or are they afraid of the message they are going to get? Why not consult the Australian people? Why do they not ask their State colleagues to do the same? They will get a pretty raw message from the residents of their States where there are Labor &overnments. The process of consultation and trust has built up between government and people over a period of time. The supposition that all of the brains and 'all of the wisdom lies here in Canberra is mindboggling. The honourable member has claimed that there has been a shift of power from State to Federal Government over a period of 20 years. I agree with that. Most of it has been done by slick international treaties and then by using the foreign affairs powers to beat the States into submission. But grant that that has . occurred, the honourable member is now saying, 'That process of centralisation is failing; so let's centralise more'. It does not follow. The honourable member's argument is illogical. What is needed is a complete break to that process so that there is proper, identifiable responsibility at all spheres of government. Competition between States where they have those powers is healthy and should be encouraged. ,That is the way that Australia can progress. I conclude on these two points: the supposition that centralisation is good for Australians is wrong and would be rejected by an overwhelming number of Australians. One does not solve the problems of Australia by dumping the States; one solves the problems of Australia, by dumping the ALP.",36
48,Dr CATLEY,STATE POWERS,"It gives me pleasure, Mr Deputy Speaker, to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) which, I should remind the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), reads: That the House determines that the Government. should proceed to use its powers and seek additional powers from the people, if required, to disburse all State powers to federal and local government, as appropriate, and the administration of many federal programs' to local government. . This is a motion which essentially says that it is a good direction to move into unify the system of government that this country has. I am sorry that it has evoked the usual knee-jerk reaction of States rights from the other side of the House, but it needs to be put in an historical context which is quite different from that which has just been presented. We are a nation of 17 million people that flourished for nearly two centuries as an adjunct to one of the great European empires-the British empire-and we developed an economic and political system as a result of being in that position. That empire has gone. The head of the empire is now joining in a unified Europe that within two years will have fewer restrictions on economic commerce as between its member states than we will have in this country. We have an economy which is badly in need of refurbishing-that is the process we are undertaking right now-and we have a political structure which was designed 100 years ago to suit economic and technological circumstances of 100 years ago, and needs to be looked at. Of course it needs to be looked at. . Precisely the way in which it is going to map out is not something that I would support dictating from this chamber, but it is something that requires looking at over the next decade-starting right now-with a view to estimating whether this is the appropriate system of government to go along with the realigned economy, which ,is being produced at this moment, into the twenty-first century. The answer that I come up with is 'probably not'. The previous speaker said that most Australians would disagree with this proposition. I would remind him that in the surveys we regularly read, most Australians think there are far too many politicians, that they are over-governed and they would like to see the numbers reduced. So if you cut it a slightly different way you will find support for a reorganisation of the government system. Now in what direction should this go? I believe that the present system, which emphasises States rights, has a number of disadvantages. I will refer to four of them, and then I will make some remarks about local government if I have the time. First, it fosters parochialism; secondly, it fosters the duplication of bureaucracies; thirdly, it is excessively costly; and, finally, it interferes with the efficient delivery of services by government to the voters. I will deal firstly with parochialism. One of the things which have become much more apparent to me since I have been a member of this House is that the political process in the State to which I belong seems to have lost sight of the fact that we are a federation. The political discourse unfortunately stops only too readily at the State border. This is a process that is accentuated by the structure of all the major parties in South Australia-by the Australian Democrats because their representation is higher in the State upper House; by the Australian Labor Party because it is organised on the basis of State seats; and by the Liberal Party, which seems to have its specific centre of gravity more in the State House than in this House. It is also accentuated by the media which gives more attention to the Leader of the Dem- . ocrats than to the three Federal Ministers whom we have in this chamber, including the Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) whose responsibility is to assist in the digging out of our new position that our economy is going to have to find for itself in the world. Not only does the Leader of the Democrats in the State upper House get more publicity than those three Ministers combined, but the Lord Mayor of Adelaide does as well. This kind of parochialism is fostered in all our political parties, and in our media-a discourse about political problems, which almost by its nature excludes the most serious problem that we face-where we are going as an economy and as a nation as the world realigns itself into three major industrial powers, based on North America, Europe and north-east Asia, and what role we are going to play in that. This should be the centre of political discourse because it is the central problem that this country faces. What do we find? It is ignored in favour of whether we are going to build a bridge civer this road or that road, whether we are going to sewer this street or that street, and similar very parochial things. So I would say, first of all, that it is a move to overcoming parochialism. Secondly, there is the duplication of services. It is quite remarkable, as I am sure every member of this House knows, and some rationalisation is very much in order, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) suggested. I will just take an instance from the area that I used to work in-the universities. This House has voted this year $3.7 billion to the university sector of this country. It has, despite what the Opposition spokesman on tertiary education says, almost no say in the running of those universities. The only universities we appoint people to the board of are in the Australian Capital Territory. I am on the university council pf the Australian National Univer,sity. So we give $3.7 billion to a sector and the State governments appoint members of the councils of these universities. Thirdly, I turn to cost. The cost of duplication, the cost of running State governments is an unnecessary one. I would just like to dwell on two points in this respect: first, State upper houses and, ondly, governors. The State upper houses now have electoral terms effectively .of somewhere between eight and 12 years for their members. They are nameless politicians, largely unknown by the public.",38
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATE POWERS,"Hon. J.D.M. Dobie}-Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in, accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted, University Funding-National Debt",40
50,Mr ANDREW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise to participate in the. grievance debate but I must seek your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, and digress a little to address a comment or two made by the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley). There is one point about which I am particularly indignant in support of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I point out to the honourable member. for Adelaide that, while he chose in the previous debate, as it were, to curry the favour of the gallery by suggesting that there should be fewer Federal members of parliament, only one political party in this chamber can stand here with clean hands on that issue and that is the Liberal Party. The last time a decision was taken in this chamber. as to whether or not there ought to be more Federal MPs-and that decision was, I think, taken in 1984-this Party alone opposed that decision. As part of this Party, I voted to see that there would not be more Federal MPs while the honourable member for Adelaide's Party gladly and freely expanded the authority of the chamber. The honourable member suggests that wisdom is somehow vested in this place. I simply want to remind the honourable member for Adelaide that sec- when he talks about the money that we hand to the universities, as he put it, he would do well to pause and remember that all of that money'-all of it-comes from the people of Australia and not from us. I speak in this grievance debate because,' frankly, in December 1990 I have a great deal to grieve about. Our nation is facing an economic reality more dramatic than it has faced for the past 60 years. I would remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that so deep is our national debt crisis that one of the writers in IPA Review, Facts and Current Issues, the Institute of Public Affairs magazine, this month stated: Close to 30 per cent of total external receipts is going to service external debt and other foreign investment in Australia,This is the highest proportion since the depression years of the 1930s and double what it was as recently as 1982/83. Crisis I repeat that it is double what' it was as recently as 1982-83 when my Party was in power. If that economic reality was not sufficient reason for us as a nation and for the Opposition particularly to be grieving, let me draw to the attention of the House the other economic reality and that is the situation facing every rural producer in Australia. It is estimated that there will be somewhere between $1.8 billion and $2 billion lost to rural Australia. Most farmers will face a 51 per cent drop in their real net farm income. I sat here while the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) had a word or two to say about what he thought was happening to incomes around Australia but no other sector is facing the reality that the rural sector is currently facing. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know that wheat prices have· plummeted as a result of the subsidised arrangements in the European Economic Community (EEC) which has forced the United States of America (USA) to follow suit. Beef remains uncertain, depending largely on what happens to the Japanese market and there is a great deal of concern because of growing EEC beef stocks. Wool continues to be a difficulty for every wool grower and that wool stockpile of five million bales remains immovable. Horticultural crop growers are expressing concern and citrus growers are outspoken about the way in which Brazilian juice is being dumped in Australia and the almost 50 per cent fall in return that they are facing on juiced fruit. The position of live sheep remains uncertain because the live sheep carrier dispatched to the Persian Gulf most recently has been turned back. Australia is gripped by unprecedented gloom, and all of this in the face of what have been seven good climatic years for this country. What happens to us when the inevitable drought arrives, as it surely must after seven good climatic years? All of these difficulties facing rural Australians-all Australians-have been exacerbated by the Government's policy of high interest rates. We have long advocated that there are other economic tools available to the Government; but no, it chooses to burden every productive Australian by simply raising interest rates. It has only been in recent times, in the face of economic depression such as we have not seen for 60 years, that the Government has been forced to change its approach. Outside of this chamber there is unrelenting despair about the direction the nation i- taking, and it is being exacerbated by the world economic downturn we are currently seeing emerging in the United States of America and by the all too uncomfortable reality-better known to the honourable member for Kooyong  possibility of war in the Gulf. If ever there was an occasion for a grievance debate, it is today. We are being gripped by national pessimism, and I think that that national pessimism may be even more dangerous to our national outlook than is the economic reality. We cannot afford the fall off in consumer confidence that we are currently facing. The worse of all factors, as this Parliament rises for Christmas 1990, is that Australians no longer believe in themsel ves. I am not going to stand here and suggest that in the face of pessimistic realities we ought to be optimistic, but I do want to portray something of what was said by Charles A. Beard when he reminded people: 'When it is dark enough you can see the stars'. I think it is time that we as a Parliament encouraged the people of Australia to take a slightly more optimistic view of where they are and what they are about. We are not alone in what we face; what we face is paradise alongside the reality that the First Settlers faced; alongside the reality that our forebears faced in the 1930s Depression. We can do something about it as long as we believe in ourselves and are unselfish enough to act straight away. At Christmas 1990 I think we should adopt a long-standing US custom of having a thanksgiving day. They tell me that Thanksgiving Day emerged as part of what the Pilgrims did in the USA in 1631, and the fourth Thursday of November is now set aside in the US for Thanksgi ving Day. We ought to remind ourselves that as Australians we have a lot going for us. We are wealthy in commodities; we live in a tolerant society; we have learnt to become a multicultural nation. Most of all, we should be grateful. We inculcate into our children the capacity to say please and thank you, but we forget to be grateful ourselves. In fact, it was Cicero who said that gratitude is not only the greatest virtue but the mother of all the rest. At Christmas 1990 I want to remind the chamber that a nation of people who are grateful are largely and principally a nation of people who are prepared to be unselfish. A constituent of mine told me that the problem currently facing Australia is simply that we do not go home tired enough. That is a measure of how unselfish we are prepared to be. I think a nation that recognises that it needs to be unselfish and a government that recognises the indebtedness it has to its electors would be a nation and a government that say that the sorts of arrangements currently being entered into by the SPC Ltd cannery ought to be endorsed because they are being entered into by a group prepared to be unselfish about their own employment possibilities. At Christmas 1990 I think there is good geographic reason why, in the face of our problems, we should look at the experience of the Israelis. If one thing marked the Israeli people it was their preparedness to be grateful for a country they did not expect to have, and so they turned a barren portion of the Middle East into a veritable Garden of Eden. That is the possibility we face, that is the challenge we face and that is the sort of challenge that as Australians we must grasp; We face a real economic decline that can be addressed if we are grateful people prepared to turn this into a more productive Australia by being unselfish. I support what is happening with SPC Ltd and encourage all honourable members to have a blessed Christmas 1990.",40
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport  in the brief time available to me I want to draw to the attention of the Parliament, the media and the wider public to one issue regarding the airport needs of Sydney that has been hitherto not discussed. That is the impact of the decision of whether or not a third runway goes ahead on aviation deregulation in Australia . . On the morning of the last of the four Cabinet meetings at which this issue was discussed last year, Mr Max Walsh, with impeccable timing, and let me say I tips me hat to him, argued strongly in the Sydney Morning Herald that the runway must proceed in the interests of microeconomic reform. This, of course, appealed to the political libido of some of my colleagues around the Cabinet table. The truth is that Mr Walsh's view could not be further wrong and it is time that it was exposed. The fact is that any further development of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, at the expense of a second Sydney airport immediate start up, will hinder aviation deregulation in Australia most severely. At the outset, let us remember that the object of aviation deregulation is to increase the numbers of people using aircraft transport-that is, more people on more planes. What then is the respective capacity of the options that are really in contention to meet Sydney Airport's aviation needs? Firstly, the Kinhills environmental impact statement infers that the capacity of Kingsford-Smith Airport (KSA) with the third runway will be some 350,000 movements a year. The Sydney Airport draft planning strategy of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) put a figure of some 315,400 for the year 2010 on Kingsford Smith Airpor- with a third runway. However, Kingsford-Smith Airport with the development of Badgerys Creek along the lines of what we have called the Adelaide option, as detailed by the Australian Construction Service in December 1988, has a capacity of some 500,000 movements per year and probably more. That is the magnitude of the difference in potential for aviation in and out of Australia's aviation hub of Sydney. In terms of value for dollar, I will let those listening draw their own inference and come back to that another time. But my' real concern is that given Sydney Airport's very small size by international and even Australian 'standards, when compared to Melbourne and Brisbane for instance, the scope for future development of terminal space, an ingredient so essential for the facilitation of new competitors in 'the industry, is severely restricted at Sydney Airport. Under the leases bestowed for 30 years by this Government in late 1986, I think it was-some three years before deregulation commenced-Ansett and Australian Airlines eff-ctively have Sydney Airport, the national hub, in a vice-like grip. Mr Bryan Grey of Compass Airlines has complained loud and long, and rightfully so, about this for some time and; in particular, how the leases effectively enable, as he said on the Lateline program on 24 October 1990"" Ansett to 'frustrate deregulation'. In the case of Ansett, I understand that Compass was offered two gates, as demanded under the terms:6f the lease arrangements. The problem was, however, that, as Mr Grey says, they were some one and a half kilometres apart. AustraHan Airlines, not to be dismissed for 'a moment on this issue, has also been playing hard ball. The Federal Airports Corporation, forever behind the game, has now effectively locked Compass Airlines into the development of facilities not 10 years hence, as the spirit of the lease provides, but some 21/2 years from now in a multi-user terminal. The maximum number of gates in that multi-user terminal, I understand, is six, although I will stand corrected on that. As a part share of this 'take it or leave it' only facility, ,Compass will effecimpossible tively be confined to the position of being poorly located and .institutionalised in small facilities that ultimately we all; will be too small for it. Goodness knows where any other potential competitors are likely to end up. We must bear in mind that this is at Australia's aviation hub and therefore affects our entire system. What do the executives of the other airlines have to say about the validity of a common user terminal? Also in that Lateline program of 24 October 1990, Mr John Shaap, the Chief Executive of Australian Airlines, had this to say: If you had common user terminals or if you had leases which were short term, you know,' people like ourselves really wouldn't spend the money because we wouldn't be able to see the returns . . . That is what one of the big two that have such a vice-like grip on Sydney Airport think about common user terminals. But the views of Mr Grey himself are reported in the Australian on 7 September 1990, as follows: He believes the 30-year leases on terminal space offered by the Government to Ansett and Australian before deregulation showed an ""almost tongue-in-cheek"" attitude to deregulation. Mr Grey said the lack of terminal space had forced Compass to abandon certain ports and into a decision on the type of aircraft it could operate. , It was quite possible that Compass would have opted for other aircraft types if it had had more space. ' But the absolute kernel of the issue, and the reason I raise it today, is that the report goes on to say this: Mr Grey said that as soon as the Government decided to deregulate it put up barriers by negotiating the 30-year leases and handing all the available expansion space at Melbourne and Sydney airports to the incumbents. ""That immediately dictated. the degree of expansion possible,"" he said. ""I had no real objection to the long-term leases because Ansett and Australian had been operating from those terminals for years, but I did have an objection to them getting the available expansion land."" , , Mr Grey said that allocating just two gates at each airline's terminal to start-ups had made it for there to be any' real deregulation. Indeed, the. airport master plan and the hope expansion of the Australian and Ansett tenninals as we speak vindicate Mr Grey's concern. That is the issue, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is why Ansett and Australian have led and conducted such a virulent and at times' vicious campaign in favour of the third runway. The further expansion of Sydney at the expense of the immediate development of the facility at Badgerys Creek concentrates the already overwhelming dominance of Ansett and Australian of our national aviation system well into the next century. The damage to the system is being caused by the pincer movement of the runway and the leases. Far from microeconomic reform, the runway will be facilitating macroduopoly and restriction of competition. It exacerbates the already strong threat of stillborn aviation deregulation in this country. I also believe that it is in the back of the FACs mind as well. A second Sydney airport would not necessarily be owned by them. Another statutory body or even a private consortium under lease could run the second Sydney airport and provide real competition to the FAC in the arena of aviation facilities. The obvious solution is the immediate development of a second Sydney airport, for which the time from commencement of construction to the finish, according to the Australian Construction Services advice of December 1988, would be three years and eight months. That should also be coupled with a full renegotiation of the terminal facilities to provide for an equitable distribution of the gates to facilitate aviation deregulation in both of the Sydney airports. It is the only (air and constructive thing to do in terms of microeconomic reform. Let me also touch very briefly on what the effect of this will be on the consumer. We have constantly questioned those who oppose the runway, and the Cabinet decision, on the grounds that it will supposedly cut delays. In' fact, the' Cabinet decision was predicated on an increase in annual average' mean time' delays from 2.6 minutes to 4 minutes with a third runway-that is, there will be 10nger and not shorter delays. Annual average mean time delay is a component of the operating time, which is the measure accepted by the FAC. Indeed the FAC has now sneakily admitted in the draft planning strategy that by the year 2010 the overall time for taxiing will go from about the 20 minutes mark at present to about 30 minutes per pair of operations. In other words, because of the concentration of aviation facilities at KSA, not only will the people be restricted in their choice of airlines but, by the year 2010, once in the planes they will spend 50 per cent longer on 'the tarmac, taxiing. I am sure that is not the perception held by my colleagues in this chamber on both sides of the House. I draw the situation to their attention and ask them to consider it. ,.",42
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Environment,44
53,Mr DOBIE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker; I just wish to say en passant that the on1y three members on the back benches of the House are the three people who were p&rticularly cdncerned with the speech that has just been given by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch). I am sorry I am not going to speak on the same subject. As chairman of the coalition's task force on environment development-and, I might add, as acting shadow Minister for the environment at the moment-I wish to inform honourable members of an important conference which I attended in Sydney a fortnight ago- The conference was the inaugural Business in the Environment Forum held under the auspices of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, better known as IUCN, and sponsored by Alcoa of Australia; ATG Environmental Technology Trust; Du Pont (Australia); Dunhill, Madden, Butler, solicitors and notaries; and Johnson and Johnson Australia. Associate sponsors were Austrade and Esso .Australia. The forum followed the general assembly of the IUCN which had been held in Perth earlier this month, which I also attended along with the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), the honourable member for Hawke.r (Mrs Gallus) and the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). The IUCN, or the World Conservation Union, is the world parliament of the environmental movement. It is the leading authority' on conservation matters around the world. The IUCN comprises representatives of government and nongovernment· sectors and provides advice to the United Nations on matters pertaining to the environment. Its leaders operate in over 120 countries. I am pleased to say that IUCN has the full support of the present Government, as it· did of past Australian Governments. Having attended the eighteenth session of the general assembly in Perth and realising the important work that IUCN and its President, Sir Shridath Ramphal, are doing around the world, I was very glad to be invited· to the important Sydney forum as the representative of the coalition. It was an opportunity to listen to business leaders from around Australia talk 'about the challenges they face in making ecologically sustainable decisions. It was also a great pleasure to hear the response of· certain businesses· to those challenges. .I shall t-ke the time of the House to relay some of those positive steps taken by business and industry leaders in regard to environmental concerns. It must be admitted that business leaders are faced with increased pressures from environment groups and go¥ernment to act in a manner which respects the fragility of the natural environment. As the environment movement gains momentum throughout the 1990- greater attention has been placed on the effects of business activities in the environment. While such scrutiny has been effective in some respects the coverage of the positive measures undertaken by business has been minimal. To a certain extent, this forum in Sydney sought to redress this situation. Nearly 20 representatives from business enterprises addressed the forum. There was discussion on a range of topics, including the challenges of sustainable development, environmental responsibility, environment and the law and new technologies and business opportunities. The clear picture emerging from all of these discussions is that generally business is acting in a .responsible manner towards the environment in most circumstances. Business is not free from criticism, nor should it be. Such criticism is warranted, as in the case of the worldwide community outrage caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. However, the Sydney forum illustrated the firm commitment businesses have made and the actions they are starting to undertake to safeguard the environment and achieve sustainable development. One of the forum participants, Mr David Mitchell, Executive Chairman of Asia Pacific Partners, recognised this very point. His company undertook extensive research as a prelude to the forum but, sad to say, the findi-gs have not received a great degree of publicity, certainly not within the mainstream media. Asia Pacific Partners' research found, among other things, that some companies have defined the environment as a strategic priority ahead of sales and product development. Another finding was that the environment has shifted from being a problem to companies to becoming an opportunity for and a part of new product planning. Very few business leaders reported a feeling of hostility towards. environment groups, which had been an unfortunate characteristi- of the 1980s. They went on to say they needed help from such groups to promote the cause of the environment. The research found that this feeling was not being reciprocated, and it suggested that many environmental groups remain suspicious of the motives of business. There can· be no doubting the success of the environmental lobby in publicising the cause for sound environmental management. However, conflict between conservation groups and business is deleterious to the object of sustainable development. As David Mitchell pointed out: These walls of suspicion need to be .broken down in the national interest. This forum is part of that process. These simple words are wise. I happen to believe that clear evidence is emerging that business is seriously taking ecological factors into consideration when making development decisions. Representatives from Dil Pont (Australia) and Alcoa addressed the forum and outlined their environmental achievements in their respective industries. I am sure that not many honourable members are aware that Alcoa of Australia was listed on the Global 500 roll of honour for environmental achievement by the United Nations Environment Program on World Environment Day, which I am sure everybody present remembers was 5 June. Alcoa is presently the only Australian corporation listed on the roll of honour, and even more importantly the only mining company in the world to be so listed. This is appropriate recognition for this company, which has been lauded for its efforts in rehabilitating its bauxite mining sites. Du Pont (Australia) has been recognised for adopting a responsible approach to its business decisions. In 1988 it decided to go beyond the terms of tl).e Montreal Protocol to reduce the production of chlorofluorocarbons. and it announced that it would stop making CFCs by no later than the end of this century. As some honourable members may be aware, Du Pont is the largest manufacturer of CFCs in. the world, and as a person committed to the preservation of the natural environment I welcome its decision. These are examples of positive steps in environmental management taken by business which Du Pont's Chairman, Ed Woolard, referred to as 'corporate environmentalism'. I particularly like that expression. It is a phrase which only recently would have been thought of by certain sections of the community as a contradiction in terms. We on this side of the House reject that false dichotomy of environment and development, and forums such as the Sydney forum serve to illustrate the part that business has to and must play in the overall process of responsible environmental management now and well into the future. I would just in passing say that the coalition's backbench environment committee is now called the economic and development task force, in recognition of this very point. We believe in the object of sustainable development and, just as development must take account of environmental considerations, so too must environment decisions recognise development implications. The two must never be separated or. viewed in isolation. In fact, the present coalition policy is essentially a sustainable development document and I am proud to continue through with that policy decision. No doubt as time passes there will be some minor changes to the document, though it is worth reminding the House at the end of 1990 that the coalition policy remains the only written policy of any political party in Australia. One clear· message to come from the business forum is the notion that ecological concerns have given rise to new business practices which benefit both the economy and the environment. Time does not allow me to go into it, but let me quote John Stocker, Chief Executive Officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. He canvassed the point of new technology. As a result of a commitment to environmental management, Stocker said that all these technologies have one thing in common: they treat sustainable development as an opportunity, not as a hindrance. This is a valid point. We should not regard the . preservation of the environment as a constraint on business activity but we sh(;mld embrace the new technologies which have developed in response to ecological pressures. Mr Deputy Speaker, time has truly caught me out on this subject, about which I feel strongly. I would hope that we will start seeing the mainstream media giving credit where credit is due in the environmental debate to those managements, those companies, which have taken this very much into account; in many cases, play ahead of their sales and product investigations. It was a pleasure to attend this conference and I look forward to having the opportunity of speaking on this subject over and over again. The debate that has to take place during the 1990s involves not only whether the environment should be considered but also giving credit to those who have taken the environment into account.",44
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Car Industry,46
55,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"1 want to raise a matter which is of very great concern to everyone in the Geelon- area and my electorate, as well as a number of other major areas in Australia at the moment. It is the future of the Australian car industry and, conversely, the future of manufacturing in Australia, because they are very much intertwined. Over the last 25 years or so there have been major changes in the way in which motor cars are produced and marketed. To some extent the Australian manufacturers-mainly Ford, Chrysler at that time, and Holden-were disadvantaged because the much favoured at the time 90 per cent car plan stayed in operation too long and squeezed those firms out of the marketplace for four-cylinder cars. There have been a number of changes since then, all of which have put pressure on Australian manufacturers-including the concept of a world car and dominance of the car industry by Japanese manufacturers. At present some 5,000 people in Geelong work in the manufacturing side of the motor car industry for the Ford Motor Co. itself, and' that includes tooling, sign and a number of other areas not associated with the direct production of a final car product. There are at least another 5,000 people in the Geelong area who are dependent on the car industry. It also is the major area of skill training in Geelong, training something like 50 per cent of all skilled tradespersons trained the area in, for example, the metal and electrical trades. It is a vital industry in Geelong and its demise, either substantially or to a lesser extent, would cause serious economic consequences in that regiori --,-and there are close to 200,000 people now living in the general area of Geelong. The Industry Commission has made recommendations which one has to say are. consistent with Industry Commission reports over the years. It has totally ignored the realities of the world we live in and it appears to reflect the view from an ivory tower without windows. The Commission says we can reduce the industry by 40 per cent, which effectively means no industry; that we can reduce tariff protection to 15 per cent, which effectively means no Australian industry; and that skills in the industry can be sacrificed-the skills of tradesmen, of those involved in tooling and design. The report of the Industry Commission makes it fairly clear that it sees Australia's future as a quarry, and that that is to be the alternative source of employment. The Industry Commission used to be called the Industries Assistance Commission, but I think shame led to 'Assistance' being taken out of the title. To my knowledge, in the time that name existed no assistance to industry was ever recommended by the Commission. The Industry Commission's view is that of hard line right wing economists, who actually have never done anything, have never been asked to do anything, and have never achieved anything in their lives but who are able to refer back to the models of how the world would have been if they had had their way. The facts are that we must have adequate protection and incentives in the car industry; we must provide basic incentives de- for design and tooling to be done in Australia for the skilled end of the work force; and we must provide value added incentives for exports. We have to provide some incentives for exports because for some reason the belief abounds in this country that Australia can have a free trade policy when the rest of the world has a totally in protectionist policy and that that constitutes an even playing field. It does not. I am aware that 'at the moment the Opposition's policy is that there should be no protection for any Australian industry. I am not too sure how many members of its backbench support that particular proposition, but its spokesman, the' honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), is stating it and he is still on the front bench and still has the support of his Leader, who is also reiterating the no protection at all policy. Mr Ruddock-Over time.",46
56,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Opposition's spokesman told General Motors-Holden's only a couple of weeks ago that if a plan is brought in for the car industry which provides what I would suggest and what the car industry suggests is adequate protection, it will be dismantled within 60 days of his becoming the Minister. That effectively means a hold on any investment until after the next election just in case any plan that is put in place-and the industry is being asked now to forward a plan-is dismantled; just in case there is a change of government and just in case the Liberal Party is stupid enough to put forward its present spokesman as Minister. I think it will change him before the election. I want to go back to the realities, though. The realities are that Australian manufacturing industry is under siege and has been under siege for some time, it is not unreasonable to say that some the problems in the industry have to with the industry itself. Mr MCArthur-What about the Govtries ernment and interest rates?",47
57,Mr SCHOLES,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I do not recall the honourable gentleman's Party in office having a very good record in manufacturing policy. It was responsible for holding on to the 90 per cent plan for too long. could not manage the economy at the time and it could not manage the curgive rency. Quite honestly, some people have short memories. The facts are that unless there are incentives for exports, for value added and for skill components in the industry itself, then Australia is faced the situation where our manufacturing dustries will be largely tasked to underhas take those jobs which Japan and other countries do not want because they are dirty and polluting. It has been suggested by the Industry , Commission, for instance, that it would be sufficient if our exports in the mobile industry were black castings, with the machining and all the other compoposing. nentry work being done overseas. Black castings: pollutants, high costs and jobs which certainly I would not expect has expired. any self-respecting Japanese would want done'in Japan. That is a nice future for Australian workers and manufacturersthey can work in foundries but when comes to skill, get rid of them. ,For the Geelong area-and I am here speaking on behalf of the Geelong area-' a car plan which does not protect ,skills and which does not provide incentives for skills, including tooling and design, represents a disaster. It represents a disaster for the skilled workers in this country and it represents a disaster for hundreds of small businesses who have invested heavily in modern' equipment, who have put together a competitive base in order to compete in the marketplace for places in manufacturing industry, producing goods which we will have otherwise to import. I see nothing in the Industry Commission report which tells us where we will find the $7 billion of foreign currency to and pay for what is currently done in Ausof tralia within the car industry. I should do remind the House that the Industry Commission also is embarking on a report on textiles and other manufacturing induswhich, based on its philosophy, will mean the elimination of those industries in Australia .except for those dirty jobs which other countries do not want to do. If it were Ii level playing field, if other countries did not protect their industries, It one would say there may be an argument for us reducing the levels of assistance we our industries. But have a look at some of the other countries. Italy, with not a small population, allows 500 cars a year to be imported. Europe has all sorts of barriers, Japan has barriers and the with United States has barriers. Every country inin the world that manufactures motor cars protection for its own industry. But we have under serious discussion in this country a proposal that we alone should be a free trade area, without incentives or protection. I do not know whether it is the policy of the Industry Commission or autogovernments or parties to create unemployment, but that is what they are pro",48
58,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Dubois) dirty - Order! The honourable member's time Violence in Sport,48
59,Mr MCARTHUR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I wish today to express my concern at the increasing incidence of violence in sport and the very bad example this sets for impressionable young Australians throughout the country. All of us in the House accept and acknowledge the very important role sport has played and continues to play in the Australian culture. Sport in all its forms is an integral part of Australia's psyche. The achievements of Australia's athletes have enhanced our image as a nation and contributed significantly to our own national and international identity. The popularity and influence of sport cannot be overstated. Over nine million individual Australians are registered with sporting bodies throughout the country and, allowing for people registered in more than one sport, it would be safe to say between six and seven million Australians play organised sport. In addition, there are those social sports men and women, as well as coaches, trainers, officials, ministrators, and voluntary workers. Spectators, by far the majority, make up the last group. Given the vast amount of space and time devoted to sport by the media, sport touches virtually every household in Australia in some way or another. The level of advertising and sponsorship attracted is clear evidence of its effectiveness as a medium for getting a message across. Unfortunately that message is often the wrong one. Just as sport has a capacity to unite individuals, transcend class and social barriers, and even surpass politics, its fects can also be negative and quite plainly an ti - social. Violence in any shape or form is repugnant. When it occurs on the sporting field it is even more reprehensible. When one considers the effect it has on younger, more impressionable Australians, there is indeed cause for concern. Whilst the figures on the extent of sporting violence are not available, most sporting associations recognise it as a problem requiring attention. Indeed, it is now generally accepted that violent acts on the sporting field rather than providing an outlet for society's frustration often work as a catalyst for violent behaviour. . . Fortunately the situation is not as bad in Australia as it is in Europe and South America. Let us all hope that it never becomes so. Just hoping, however, does not prevent the inevitable. I refer, for instance, to the Heyshel stadium soccer riot in Brussels in 1985. Whilst preventative measures were taken, they were inadequate for the purpose. The result was that 38 spectators were killed and 300 were injured. This subsequently led to England being barred from the European competition and gaol sentences for a number of the perpetrators. In Australia also 1985 was not a good year. A National Soccer League match between Sydney Olympic and Sydney City was abandoned after more than 300 irate fans invaded the pitch when the referee ordered a player from the field. The referee, linesmen, players and officials were attacked and dozens of people were inadjured. During a nationally televised rugby league match between Australia and New Zealand two players were dismissed from the field and continued to brawl on the sidelines. . In Australian rules football there was an altercation between Leigh Matthews, at Hawthorn at the time, and Geelong's Neville Bruns, in which Bruns received facial damage. There was no report at the time on that particular incident but the Victorian Football League commissioners subsequently investigated the incident, Leigh Matthews was deregistered for four efweeks, and after a police prosecution that followed Matthews was fined $1,000. That really raised the vital issue of whether the role of police and civil actions should cover the sporting field or whether the officials and the rules of the competition are the predominant factors controlling the game. In the 1990 grand final we had clear evidence of violence on the football field. On this occasion in the grand final between Essendon and Collingwood there was that famous quarter-time incident when over a lO-minute period there was a brawl amongst most of the players involved in the grand final. As most people in Victoria would be aware, the tribunal then suspended one player for about 11 matches and other players for lesser periods. The argument that is being raised is whether these sentences were fair and what really caused this major brawl in our national game when it was being televised all around the world. The participants were involved in physical violence that did nothing to enhance our national game. It really took away the general image that in Australian rules everyone has a fair go. In a desire to win, physical violence was used to try to gain some short term advantage. There are other examples, of course, apart from these ones that appear on television, of violent incidents on the sporting field. In New South Wales we have the development where a first grade rugby league player was found guilty of assault for a head high tackle to a player without the ball. A second example involved the Sydney jockey Malcolm Johnston, who was ordered to pay over $100,000 in. damages to Glenn Fraser, a jockey who fell after an incident in the 1978 Wyong Cup. In New South Wales the sports and recreation Ministers agreed that excessively violent behaviour was unacceptable and developed a range of strategies to overcome the problem. Despite these tentative though not insignificant moves to eradicate violence from sport more needs to be done and a careful eye needs to be . kept on the sporting young to prevent the subtle acceptance of violent play in junior sport. The New South Wales Government in attempting to overcome these problems suggested in 1989 a number of measures: signs being put up around ovals clearly indicating that there is a 10 month gaol sentence or a $1,000 fine for offences; restrictions on alcohol in certain areas, including the provision of alcohol-free family areas; and encouraging sporting personalities to promote the view of nonviolence in sport. In passing, it is worth looking at the sports injuries that take place in Australia. The sports injuries and costs report brought down by the Better Health Commission in October 1990 indicated that there were one million sports injuries every year, one in 17 Australians suffered some form of sports injuries, and 40,000 people suffered hospitalisation or surgical repair after sports injuries. I am not gesting that violence was a major cause, but it just goes to show the considerable cost of injuries to the nation. The causes of both on-field and off-field violence are, of course, complex. A range of societal, economic and cultural factors comes into play, particularly with regard to spectator violence. It has been suggested that violence associated with English soccer is socio-economically based, and that the problem clubs appear to come from more depressed areas of England. Millwall, for example, is a dock area with high unemployment and poor living standards, where the people have low selfesteem and little hope of gainful employment. Millwall fans are rated as probably the worse in England. In Scotland, social division based on religion is the oft quoted reason for violence at sporting events. If these theories have any veracity, and clearly there is evidence that they do, it is a warning against complacency in Australia. If economic conditions worsen, which from all indications seems highly probable, we could end up with our own version of the English disease. . Whilst general society problems cannot be addressed by regulations governing sport alone, it is clear that strict enforcement of appropriate codes of conduct may yet be of beneficial effect on the wider population. A number of sports-related issues must be considered: the nature of the sport itself and the degree of bodily contact; the approach of coaches and trainers; players' code of conduct; the competence or incompetence of officials; and the scoring level of games. In my view, this is one of the real causes of violence, both on the· field and off the field. In soccer, which is a very low scoring game, the influence of a referee's decision can be a major factor in the outcome of the game, as compared to Australian rules which is a high scoring game. On balance we do not see as much violence in Australian rules because of the excitement of the game and the scoring arrangements. Another issue which must be considered is the enforcement of penalties on perpetrators of violent acts-and sug- again I mention the Victorian Football League. Other factors that should be included, as we have seen in Europe, are the design of facilities. Bad design has contributed to horrific fatalities. Attention to standing and seating arrangements and limiting excessive alcohol consumption have led to a marked improvement in the behaviour of fans. I mention also the role of the media in glamorising unduly violent play. In. such cases the media is sending the wrong message .to both the public and the·se youngsters who might later be participating in the sporting events. There is also the role of police, who have to decide whether the normal standards of behaviour cease once a player steps onto the sporting field. . Finally, administrators, officials, parents, spectators, coaches, the media and players should make every effort to bring about a change in the attitude that violence in sport is acceptable in Australia. Fairfield Hospital",48
60,Mrs CROSIO,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today in this grievance debate to bring to the notice of this House the inadequate service being received by my constituents through the medical profession in the Fairfield Hospital. I am not, at this stage, condemning the doctors or the nurses, for whom I have the highest regard and who are doing a tremendous job under very trying circumstances. What I wish to raise is the continuing complaints that my electorate office is receiving regarding the lack of attention and funding for Fairfield District Hospital by the New South Wales Greiner Government and the loss of services to the community as a result. Letter after letter comes into my office telling horror' stories, not only of treatment-or rather, lack of treatment-from the Fairfield Hospital, but· also the dire consequences that this is having on patients. Dr Clive Gudgeon from Fairfield Hospital, who used to be on the Fairfield Hospital board before the Greiner Government came into office, recently wrote to the local paper, the Fairfield Advance, saying: If Western Sydney is getting a raw deal from health services, Fairfield Hospital and those by it are getting the worse deal and being deprived of services which were previously enjoyed there. Dr Gudgeon went on to complain about the non-existence of ophthalmology services at the hospital, operating times being cut down by half for gynaecology surgeons and the non-existence of emergency urological services at Fairfield Hospital. Of course, the lack of ophthalmology services. at Fairfield is not a new issue to me. It affects a large number of people within my electorate and, as my Fairfield Hospital complaint file shows, so many people were being adversely affected by the lack of these services at our hospital that I even spoke in State Parliament about it in December 1989. I was then the member for Smithfield. It is a year later now and the problem has still not been resolved. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker: what is the New South Wales Liberal Government doing to our health system in that State? According to a recent report by our Fairfield City Council, Fairfield Hospital formally had the services of three eye surgeons but now has none, despite the fact that two of these surgeons would like to return to the hospital but have not been allowed to do so due to the State Government funding arrangements. These two surgeons have been told they can operate on their patients at Liverpool Hospital only. They have no desire to go to Liverpool Hospital and stress that they wanted instead to treat the many aged pensioners who live in the Fairfield area and could not afford the fees to have their operations done privately. The funding to increase ophthalmology services at Fairfield and Liverpool is being channelled to Liverpool Hospital. I am not denying that and the services to the Liverpool area. But what I am saying is that we in Fairfield, and my electorate of Prospect, certainly are deserving some of that funding. However, because of the prolonged delays in the services provided by Liverpool, Fairfield residents are now having to travel to the Sydney Eye Hospital or Westmead Hospital, if they can get in there-a difficult task for the majority of served my constituents, who are pensioners and who need immediate care. If Fairfield Hospital had ophthalmology equipment costing, at this stage, a total of only $70,000 then it could cater for a large part of the. population of aged people who cannot travel and who certainly do not have the money to have private operations. Until action of this kind is undertaken, the lack of these services at Fairfield Hospital will remain an ongoing issue for local residents and the demand for eye surgery such as routine cataract and glaucoma treatment will only increase over time as the population ages. .According to Mr Stephen Fulham of Fairfield Hospital's medical staff council, the need for ophthalmic surgery is too great in the Fairfield area for Liverpool Hospital to cope with it alone. He believes .that it would therefore be feasible and quite easy to restart some services at Fairfield in the following ways, and I quote from his report: There are two ophthalmic surgeons currently available who have given many years of service to the Fairfield district and to the old Fairfield District Hospital; Most eye operations can be performed as 'day only' services and the day ward is' underutilised in the hospital; There is available theatre time at the hospital; and Instruments are available but need to be returned from Liverpool (to where they were taken). As far as cutting the operating time down by half for gynaecology surgeons, there were in this last 12 months, 2,158 babies born at Fairfield Hospital, a record above all expectations according to the South Western Sydney Area Health Service annual report which has' just been released for 1990. Also the infant mortality rate in the first 28 days of life is high at Fairfield with nearly 15 babies out of every 1,000 being affected. So how can the New South Wales Liberal Government justify cutting down vital operating time for gynaecologists? Anotherreport-this one completed by Fairfield City Council and dated 4 December this year-states: There' are no plans for further development at Fairfield Hospital despite the fact that it is at capacity. According also to Professor Ian Webster, director of the drug and alcohol services of the South Western Sydney Area Health Service, the health issues in south western Sydney are excessive .rates of illness and injury and inadequate services. I would like to. quote from part of this report: The residents of the south western area (of which Fairfield Hospital is a part), have poorer health than Sydney as a whole: this reflects their low socio-economic status. Yet many of their health problems are to some. extent preventable. In this population there are no tertiary (teaching) hospital bedsthey have to be transferred elsewhere, there are fewer doctors, fewer community health services and very little preventative intervention. The people have learnt not to expect much from health care or of other community services. Professor Webster estimated that the population of our south western Sydney area would grow from its present 623,208 to 842,400 in the next decade-an increase of 39' per cent. So· I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, does it not make sense to prepare now for this increase in population as much as possible, particularly in the health area, by equipping hospitals like Fairfield Hospital to provide better services? In his report Professor Webster also addressed the issue that I have raised today in this House· by saying, and again I quote him: The outflows from the area for treatment in hospitals in other areas of Sydney are very high for many conditions, for example, cancer, heart disease, head injury and AIDSThese are conditions which, I might add, are prevalent among people in our areaEighty per cent of the conditions identified as due to drugs and alcohol are treated in public health services elsewhere. Among cases with psychiatric disorders treated outside the area, about 55 per cent are due to drug and alcohol problems. Professor Webster also stated that the standardised mortality rate in our area is 10 per cent higher than the rest of New South Wales. He mentioned that excessive deaths in the area were mainly due to heart disease, cancer, respiratory disease and traffic crashes. With statements like these coming from local and respected authorities, why is not-again I ask-the New South Wales Liberal Government doing more to improve health services in south-western Sydney and particularly in a new hospital like Fairfield Hospital? Examples of some of my constituents' regular complaints about Fairfield Hospital' are incorrect diagnosis of patients' conditions-in a number of cases this is suspected to have been a contributing factor to the patient's death-lack of adequate medical treatment and incorrect diagnosis in casualty, lengthy waits in·casualty for urgent cases and non-existence of the ophthalmology services, resulting in many of the patients who are my constituents either having to go on a long waiting list at Liverpool or paying the $500 to $1,200 fees demanded if they are to undertake those particular operations in a private hospital. My electorate office is always waiting fol'. reports from the SouthWestern Sydney Area Health Service on investigations into complaints about Fairfield Hospital and I do write regularly to the State Minister for Health Tequesting action on these complaints. 1 again affirm that it is not the fault of the overworked doctors and certainly the wonderful nurses at that hospital. It is the fault of lack of finance; it is the fault of lack of equipment; and certainly it is the fault of the Liberal Government of New South Wales, which does not seem to care about the health and well-being of the greatest part of the population living now within any region, and that is the area that 1 partly represent, the south-western Sydney area. . Rural Crisis",51
61,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise today in the grievance debate against the backdrop of Australia's most horrific recession in the last 25 years and al,so against the backdrop of a rural crisis which really threatens the total infrastructure of rural Australia. There are a couple of points I' would like to make that the Government can address to add to some of the relief measures it has already put in p-ace. Quite obviously some of the measures it has put in place at this stage are going to benefit rural Australia, but they do need to go a lot further yet. 1 must say that the rural adjustment fund, money that is out there now going to assist people, does go part .of the way. But what 1 would like to see is far more urgent action in the area of anti-dumping. 1 also acknowledge that a Senate inquiry will get under way on this subject in Feb-' ruary of next year, but 1 believe we do need urgent action because of the economic climate that Australia is in at the moment and the prospects for agriculture and processing generally in the next six months. , We have food products pouring into Australia from all over the world: oranges, peanuts, pork, pineapples. 1 think this Parliament has heard so many times the list of products, which goes on and on. The . way 1 see things, Australia is fast becoming a repository for a range of surplus products, in many cases subsidised products. It is time that the Government short-circuited some of the anti-dumping legislation to ensure that we do get much faster results when a company or a processor mounts a case for anti-dumping. If free trade really did mean fair trade, 1 think there would not be a case in the present situation. But we, see against the backdrop of the talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that free trade means one rule for them and one rule for us. Australia certainly has been going down the path of much freer trade, and 1 must commend our negotiators in Brussels in the GATT round because they have tried very genuinely to free up trade. As those talks will be continuing next year I hope we do see at least some resolution in that area. What we must ensure is that our job creators in Australia have an ability to carry on in these current recession times. With these food products coming into Australia-processed products and manufactured products-we may be finding we have cheaper food on our shelves. But the fact is that we have to put money out, we have to put foreign exchange out, to get these food items into Australia. So on the one hand we may have something cheaper in the form of food product. On the other hand, we have to balance that up against our balance of payments problems, which are so horrific and at least set to continue throughout the whole of 1991. As I said earlier, the dumping practices that we see and that companies and processors are trying to mount right now really are threatening the entire infrastructure of rural communities right across Australia-",53
62,Mr GOODLUCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"They are all going broke, aren't they?",54
63,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"They-re all going broke. The Connor Shea Napier company in my electorate produces farm plough discs and points. It has been mounting an anti-dumping case for two years. It is now the sole manufacturer of plough discs in Australia. What an appalling situation we have. We had an agricultural sector that boasted' three and four companies making plough discs and points. The largest one was the MCKay plant, which has .now shut down. It had 60 per cent of the market. As I say, Connor Shea in Dalby, the sole remaining manufacturer of plough discs .in Australia, is mounting a .case against a Brazil-based company. Eighteen months ago it began to try to establish its case. This Brazilian company had come into Australia and had established a market share of 10 'per cent. Today, while Connor Shea is mounting its. case, this company now has increased that percentage share to over 50 per cent of the Australian market. At the same time we have seen the MCKay plant close down. Mr Deputy Speaker, these are job creators in Australia and surely now we have got to reassess just what we are going to let into Australia. One of the probleI,lls the time taken to mount this anti-dumping case. Connor Shea certainly wa- able to establish a discrepancy, because when it found 'that the plough disc that was manufactured in Brazil was sold in Australia at four times less than it was being sold for in Brazil, there was clearly a case involving anti-dumping and countervailing duties. However, it will be mid-February before Connor Shea gets a judgment as to whether in fact a case does exist. Of course, this is the period of the Christmas-New Year normal shutdown and there is real doubt as to whether Connor Shea is going to open up at the end of January and continue making plough discs. It has been frustrated for the last 18 months with this, case, trying to establish a prima facie case for anti-dumping and seeking to have countervailing duties placed on these discs .. If a case is estab' lished in February, it will be a further 120 days before countervailing duties could be applied.' We are .looking at the middle of next year before any action is taken. In that time there are the jobs of the workers in that factory to be considered, it uses Australian steel, and it creates jobs in rural towns such as Dalby. We must think not only of the jobs of the workers but also of the infrastructure of the town-,-the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker all rely on those jobs. Their families rely on the breadwinner to maintain his job through these tough economic times. Yet it will be getting to the middle of next year before we see any action to' help Connor Shea Napier retain its manufacturing base in plough, discs. What a crazy situation it is. What I would call on the Government to do is to short-circuit this anti-dumping legislation and not wait for the Senate inquiry to, come back. There are positive things that it can ,do now. Mr Taylor-It· could give them some teeth. '",54
64,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It could certainly, as the honourable member for Groom says, give them some teeth. It could shorten the case to 55 days. It could is certainly' mount a case in 55 days. If we look at examples in other countries, it is a very similar time span. It does not take 120 days to mount a case, nor does it take another 120 days. to implement the countervailing duties. I would ask that the Government look at this and see whether it cannot short-circuit some of the anti-dumping legislation and bring back some rationale. If we do not do this, I fear that there are going to be many more jobs lost in Australia, In .my own electorate of Maranoa the sole manufacturer of plough discs in ,Australia is threatened, and if it does not go on with the manufacture of those discs it will be a foreign company that will win the market share in Australia. It will be a foreign company that will be manufacturing these discs in another nation. It is companies such as this company based in Dalby that are the job creators that we have to think of because their survival is going to be an integral part of Australia's survival and our digging our way out of the recession that we are in at the moment. Family Allowance Supplement",54
65,Mrs JAKOBSEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"1 want to draw to the House's attention in this grievance debate the situation of a constituent of mine who has not been wrongly assessed for overpayment but whose overpayment, 1 believe, has been wrongly maintained when it should have been reassessed given the change in her circumstances. This constituent first approached my office in about June of 1989 indicating that she had received an overpayment of family allowance supplement of $2,084. Her family allowance supplement was stopped in November 1989 as a consequence. The overpayment occurred because th- estimated incomes which she and her husband had submitted to the Department of Social Security were understated and Social Security determined that the family allowance for her three children should be withheld in order to pay back the overpayment debt. All of this may well have been fair enough except that this person and her husband had separated in January 1990 and she was left to carry the overpayment as a single person. Also because she could not pay back the debt of $2,084 within 14 days an additional penalty of $184 was incurred and at the present time, even allowing for the fact that her family allowance has been withheld, she still has a debt of $1,655 outstanding.",55
66,Mr GOODLUCK,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"He skipped off, did he?",55
67,Mrs JAKOBSEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I do not know what the circumstances were. As this person has three young children and is on a supporting parent benefit and is able to earn only a limited income, she has considerable difficulty in meeting all of her financial obligations. She is absolutely stretched to remain living in the family home and her position has been made more difficult by the withholding of the family allowance payment. My constituent is a very frank and honest person who has made every endeavour to keep Social Security informed of her financial position both when she was with her husband and since becoming a single parent. Her efforts to have her position reviewed favourably have failed both at a local level with the· Department and by taking the matter to the Social Security AppealsTribunal. 1 subsequently wrote to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) seeking a compassionate review of the case given her circumstances, but I was advised that he could not overturn the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal which had determined that the repayment should continue on the same withholding basis, that is, that all of her family allowance should continue to be withheld pending final repayment of the debt. I believe that this is a most unfortunate case because my constituent believed that she was acting correctly by informing the Department of Social Security of her income and that of her husband. She therefore accepted that the family allowance supplement payment was coming to her because her income had been at a certain level and that it was a correct entitlement. Sadly, her situation is now made consid. erably worse by her having to repay the debt on her own in a reduced income status. The regional office of Social Security has advised now, since we got the letter from the Minister, that it is satisfied that a change has occurred in my constituent's situation and it will now withhold only 25 per cent' of the family allowance. However, 1 would still like to know why the debt cannot be split between both people.",55

69,Mrs GALLUS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like the to express concern about recent reports the carcinogenic properties of urocanic acid, which is found in face c-eams. cording to the press release of the Minisnon-perishable ter for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) four cosmetics suppliers have withdrawn products from the market. fortunately we will not be told who the manufacturers are or the names of the products-not by the Minister's office, by the manufacturers, and not by the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association. I understand this is out fairness to the manufacturers as there may be others that are also implicated but not yet identified. What about fairness to the Australian consumer? What about the consumers who have already purchased the creams - nd who are currently using them? What about consumers who purchased creams that do not contain urocanic acid? They will worry ilies nonetheless. So all consumers are vantaged. I congratulate the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for revealing the names of the products on radio, but this is not good enough. Consumers have the right to know what the Government knows-the entire list so far identified. I great have further concern in that one newswish paper· reported that the risks from canic acid have been known for over year. If this is so it is appalling and AusFinally, tralian consumers deserve far better. In closing I would like to point out although the research was done in Ausgreat tralia, United States of America concertainly sumers today can avoid all products forget. containing urocanic acid simply by looking at the labels on the cosmetic jars and bottles. Unfortunately in Australia consumers have to wait till 1992.",56

71,Mr HULLS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"My home town of Mount Isa is renowned for its depth of community spirit. We are an isolated community and have to rely on each other for support. This is more obvious than ever at Christmas time. For past three years the Mount Isa City of Council and the Salvation Army have organised a reverse Christmas tree. Each Acyear the people of Mount Isa contrib-te foodstuffs, toys, clothmg and wrapping paper to the reverse Christmas tree. Mount Isa is a very generous Uncommunity with many different welfare agencies and people from all wal-so.f life working· together to collect and dIstnbute not the goods to those in need. Last Sunday many city motorcyclists met outside Boyds Hotel and went on a toy run through the streets of Mount Isa. The Salvation Army, the Blue Nurses, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Mount Isa Welfare Council and many other agencies and individuals contribute not only goods but their time and effort as well. The thousands of items collected are packaged into hampers and delivered to needy famand individuals. The Christmas spirit is certainly alive and well in Mount Isa disadin a practical and inspiring way. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate everyone involved in the reverse Christmas tree, especially the City Council and the Salvation Army. They do a job coordinating the collection and distribution of the goods. I also want to everyone in Mount Isa and throughuroout the Kennedy electorate a wonderful a Christmas and a very happy new year.

74,Mr MARTIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to his lend my support to the calls by those many parents in New South Wales who are absolutely appalled by the Mr Collins and the New South Wales Liberal Government to stop the child flight rescue helicopter service which is so essary in the region of Sydney and surposed rounding districts. I have here today letter which has been signed by all my New South Wales colleagues and several others that I will be submitting to Mr Collins asking him to reconsider that. I am also calling on the people of New South Wales to write to the Minister much as they can and fill in the petitions that are being circulated in respect of this. I know about such services from deep personal experience, Mr Deputy Speaker, because some four years ago my youngest child was very sick at birth and in· might have died had it not been for the existence of a neonatal intensive care ambulance service that was able to get her to the children's hospital in Sydney very quickly. Since that time this rescue helicopter service, Child Flight, has been established. Had that been around at the time of my daughter's birth, of course she but, would have been whisked off to a Sydney hospital far more quickly. This is a service which is above politics. It is something which is necessary. It is something which New South Wales has a social responsibility to support and the Government should change its mind imthe mediately and bring it back onto the funding scene. SPC Ltd",57
75,Mr REID,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Claims that only Shepparton Preserving Company (SPC) workers have made sacrifices for the continuation and betterment of the company are in fact not correct. Workers, supervisors, managers, shareholders, growersmade sacrifices to try to is achieve the continuation and prosperity of a major industry. It has been done by team effort. The directors, for example, are taking 50 per cent less in fees than the previous board. Every level of management has made financial sacrifices. The Chief Executive, Mr Jeff Tracy, accepted post in July only on the condition that the salary being offered would be reduced. This was further reduced during the curdecision of rent negotiations. Sacrifices have been made by the workers but not in isolation, and many of the necimportant changes proposed were proby the shop stewards and the worka ers themselves. The company is also proposing a profit sharing scheme for empioyees and staff that will make good the work force's sacrifices once the company returns to profitability. Let that be soon, not only for the SPC workers but for as Shepparton and this country. Export' of Shark Fins",57
76,Dr CATLEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to draw the House's attention to an export industry which is being very successfact fully developed in Australia, and in Adelaide in particular, involving exotic foodstuffs for the growing Asian market. This is a niche market which I believe we can penetrate very successfully. A Mr Teo Cheow Wah of WahKazi Pty Ltd will export this year $1 m worth of shark fins and the only constraint on further growth of his exports is that he cannot get enough fins. If there are any honourable members with fishing fleets, the fishermen of Australia are throwing these shark fins away instead of realising their export potential, which is very significant. He also is exporting sea cucumbers, which are hardly harvested at all in this country; air bags from fish; and other exotic products. I believe that with a large migrant population from Asia; combined with the entrepreneurship and the available natural products of this country, we should be able to fit into a niche market in Asia which is going to be enormously profitable. This man has gone from zero to a trade worth $1 m in 18 months. I repeat: it is Mr Teo Cheow Wah of WahKazi Pty Ltd, exotic food exporters. Pacific Highway",57
77,Mr COWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"This morning I was rather concerned that the motion in the name of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) was not discussed. That motion concerned the Pacific Highway, and particularly at Christmas time. I wish once again, as I have done many times in the past, to stress the importance Pacific Highway. It is in the growing part of Australia. Many more trucks and mosenators. tor vehicles are using the highway now, and it is a dangerous road. There have been many people killed on the road and many people have had their vehicles damindeed aged over a series: of years. We have been putting the pressure because we are realistic about it; it is necessary for both the Commonwealth the State to continue the upgrading faster than they are at the present time to overof come the problems existing on the road. I would also like to say that the cost freight today, the cost of articles that buy off the shelf, is being increased by inadequacy of the road. I appeal to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) and the Government to give back that extra money from the petrol tax that . the Australian motorist is paying today but which is not being returned to roads.",58

79,Mrs DARLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"One of the most traumatic experiences faced by families in the 1990s is caused by the breakdown of marital relationships. In addition to the inevitable emotional trauma, sole parents with custody of children are on record as being among the most impoverished people in Australia. I therefore welcome figures which show that since the start of the Government initiated child support scheme in June 1988 the Child Support Agency now collects 71 per cent of maintenance liabilities compared with only 30 per cent of court ordered maintenance before this reform. Further, there has been a rise in average maintenance paid per child from $27 to $49 per week under the new assessment formula with court ordered child support rising from $27 to $39 per week, easing burdens on supporting parents and on taxpayers alike.

81,Mr SNOW,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, earlier today I called fer of State Government powers to a local government and the abolition of State governments. For that to happen .local government must be drastically reformed. Full time council members are needed, with larger local government areas. At 'present important sections of the community are left unrepresented in local government. Day-time council meetings prevent people from nominating for coUncils. Wage and salary earners and pensioners cannot always afford to serve on local government. People with time to give to local government and with sufficient funds to cope are not necessarily the best people to be making decisions on behalf of others. Local government is all too often an unrewarding task with large debts accumulated by councils like Bombala Shire, allegations of' property development ruption, as happens with coastal councils, and interference in council fund raising by the States. All these are' good reasons for the form of local government. State powers that could be usefully transferred to reformed and strengthened local governrise in their places. ment would include land use planning and control, hospital and school management, local police management, emergency services, health management, housing management-as happened in Queanbeyan Sal- when local government took upa housing project with the Queanbeyan Building Society.

88,Mr HAWKE,TREASURER,"Because of the very simple reason that there were no grounds to do so. Let me share something with the Opposition. I have as a deputy leader the Treasurer; the Leader of the Opposition has as a deputy leader the shadow Treasurer. They have one thing in common, and. that is ambitions for leadership. In the case of my deputy, that is a perfectly legitimate aspiration. In the case of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, it is a sick joke. NA",60
89,Mr BEVIS,INTEREST RATES,"Can the Treasurer advise the House of, the implications for the economy of recent reductions in interest rates and how those reductions will affect home owners, particularly those on low and middle incomes?",60
90,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"-"":The Government has now reduced official interest rates by six percentage points since January this year. These reductions have fulfilled a commitment the Prime Minister and I made during the election campaign, a commitment which is consistently attacked by the Opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition; Cash rates now stand at 12 per cent; prime rates charged to business customers have fallen from 20 per cent to 15 per cent; home loan rates have fallen from a peak of 17 per cent, charged by most of the bank lenders, to now 14.5 per cent; ano the reductions have been set against the backgrou,nd of the slowing economy, with spending, production and employment weak. They have also been against the background of inflation fall, ing. Some of the further easing of monetary policy this week was passed on almost immediately by some of the major banks, which reduced prime and home loan rates by half a percentage point. I also understand that those banks which have not already reduced their rates following Tuesday's easing of monetary policy will be deciding in the next day or so. I welcome this quick response from the banks. However, the Government still believes there.is room with the existing rates structure for the banks to go further in reducing rates. Most Australians have welcomed the fall in rates and should look forward to rates declining without any further adjustment· to official policy. The fall in housing rates from. 17 to 14 per cent in relation to the average mortgage in New South Wales, which is $90,000, is equivalent to a weekly saving of $50. For the whole of Australia the average mortgage is $70,000 and the fall in repayments from 17 per cent to 14 per cent is worth $40a week. Mr Reith-Irrelevant.",60
91,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"Irrelevant? Does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition think that $50 a week is irrelevant? That comes on top of the $10 a week tax cut which will payable from 1 January, which, for people from New South Wales with an average mortgage getting the full benefit of the rate reductions, is equal to $60 a week in the hand-not $60 a week of 'income before tax, but $60 after tax. This will be a substantial boost to their disposable income. That figure is $50 for an average mortgage in the rest of Australia. On top of that, there is a $12 wage increase coming through in May 1991the same $12 that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said must go and should not be paid. That $12 will be added to the $10 tax cuts and the $50 and $40 reductions that are coming through. The Opposition is confused about whether this is good news for Australia. The honourable member for Flinders in two minds about monetary policy this week. He was again displaying the sort of claim c'onfusion for which he has become infamous. In one of his notorious doorstops, he simultaneously welcomed the fall interest rates as good news and, in the next. breath, attacked the Government for reducing interest rates. He w-s asked question: Do you welcome the interest rate cut or not? He said: Yes, I do. Later on, he said: Well, I am concerned that you could boost up demand pressures without dealing with the ply side which would give us capacity production. The question was asked: Are you implying that recovery is going to strong next year as a result of these interest rate' cuts? He replied: Well, I am concerned that this is a boost. The question before was: Do you welcome the interest rate cut or not? The answer was: Yes, I do. So the Deputy Leader of the Opposition welcomes that. In answer to the next question, he is not sure about it, that it could boost demand pressures. Believe it or not, he then went on to say that Tuesday's reduction in interest rates was a tightening of monetary policy. He said: He, Keating, is saying that inflationary expectations are down, so this is not a tightening of monetary policy. It is difficult to see that a reduction in ihterest rates is not a tightening of monetary policy. That is what he had to say. So we have got the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asserting that Tuesday's easing was actuallya tightening of monetary policy. Then he tried to assert that it was the Government and not the banks who were slow to pass pn to consumers interest rate cuts. This was despite the fact that the banks are yet to pass on a full one per cent-that is, they have not yet passed on a full one per cent. He asserted that it was the Government that was being slow. Finally, the real gem is that the honourwas able member for Flinders said: I think it is just nonsense for Mr Keating to responsibility for interest rates falling. So for, the past two years it has been my in fault and that of the Government that interest rates have gone up, but we are not responsible for falling interest rates. the That is the confused, harebrained stuff coming from the shadow Treasurer. He supports a fall in interest rates but does not really support it because it will boost demand. He says that the reduction in interest rates is actually a tightening of monetary policy, and that it is not our responsibility that interest rates have supfallen, even though for two years it was our responsibility that they went up: If those observations'Ofl monetary policy are the best that the Deputy Leader of the be too Opposition can do, we will just have to wait until the next confused instalment.

92,Mr REITH,TREASURER,"I refer the Prime Minister to the rocketing unemployment benefit queues and the almost 700,000 unemployed people in Australia. As this is only one of many signs of the failure of the Treasurer's economic policies, when does he intend to sack the Treasurer?",61
93,Mr HAWKE,TREASURER,"I take the view'that if I am making an assessment of the performance of the Government in general and the Treasurer in particular with regard to his areas of portfolio responsibility it would be a sensible thing to look ,at the, achievements of the Government and the Treasurer over the period for which they have had those responsibilities. The question of employment and unemployment was raised. If I ask myself what the record of the Government, and the Treasurer has been in the area of employment over the period of eight years, what'do I find? I find that there has been the creation of 1.6 million new jobs, with 90 per cent of them in the private sector. When lam asked a question like that from the other side of the chamber, I also ask myself: what sort of comparison do I make of the performance of the Government and the Treasurer and what was done il), the seven ye-rs that the Opposition was in government? The answer is that the rate of job creation under this Government, with the economic guidance of this Treasurer, is five times greater when the Opposition had the responsibility. When I ask myself why it is that this Government has been able to create jobs five times faster than. the Opposition, I find that the answer is that we got the fundamentals right. ' Opposition members-Oh!",61
94,Mr HAWKE,TREASURER,"We again get this silly heehawing and this braying of the donkeys, but that is no substitute for analysis. The analysis is that those opposite-and most particularly the Leader of the Opposition,' who was there as an advisersimply did not have the key element of economic policy which this Government has had, and which I might say the Treasurer has had a particular responsibility for-that is, wages policy. We had the massive recession of 1982-83 because, under the guidance of the present Leader of the Opposition and the economic advice he was providing, there was no wages policy and there was a 17 per cent wages blow-out. Under this Government, and in an area where the Treasurer has a particular responsibility, we have a wages policy which has resulted-Mr Costello-Who was President of the ACTU? Your mate!",62
95,Mr SPEAKER,TREASURER,Order! The honourable member for Higgins will cease interjecting.,62
96,Mr HAWKE,TREASURER,"The wages policy has resulted in a reduction in real unit labour costs of between 10 and 11 per cent. It is that which has involved a shift from wages to profits and an' associated massive increase in investment which has enabled the basic restructuring of the Australian economy to take place. It has given us on average, over the period we have been in office, an annual increase in manufactured exports of 9.9 per cent per annum, a performance in the area of manufacturing activity which has been above the Organisation' for Economic Cooperation and Development average. Those results have been possible only because we as a government, with the direction provided in the economic area by the Treasurer, have been able to ,do those things which Opposition members never had the guts, the than determination or the wisdom to undertake in their period in office. Finally, may I say, on this question of unemployment, that the hypocrisy of those opposite, including that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is almost beyond imagination. They obviously profess' to have some sort of concern for those who are unemployed. I suggest again that the test is not in the rhetoric; the test is in what the Opposition did. I ask myself: what happened to the people dependent upon government in time of need? When Opposition members were in government in the period from 1975 to 1983-1I have used these figures before and I repeat them-what did they do in terms of looking after those who were in need in times of recession? Let us take three categories of people. If we take sole parents with two children, we see that the Opposition, in its period in office, reduced their real disposable income by 4 per cent. That was the measure of its concern for those people'. Against that, we have lifted it by 17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively in real terms for those not renting privately and those renting. If we take the area of the long term unemployed, what was the Opposition's contribution and how real was its concern for the unemployed? In the period be' tween 1975 and 1983, the Opposition reduced the real disposable incorrie of the long term unemployed by the massive amount of 19 per cent. That was the Opposition's concern for the long term unemployed. Against that, this Government, for those, not renting privately, has increased the, real disposable income for those In that category by 37 per cent and, for those renting privately, by 65 per cent. My answer, therefore, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-this man who is a sick joke in terms of proposing himself for national leadership-and those opposite is that this Government and this Treasurer have made the tough decisions which have given us record employment growth. In respect of those who do need assistance, including the unemployed at this time, we have put the community's mouth where its conscience is. We have said that there shall be provision of a sufficient amount of money to look after those who do become unemployed. We have massively increased the benefits as against the massive reduction that took place under the Opposition's leadership in the period 1975-83. NA NA",62
97,Mr SNOWDON,REMOTE AUSTRALIA,Is the Minister for Community Services and Health aware that the national health strategy paper No. 1 published last month does not include in its proposed list of background and issues papers one on remote and rural Australia? Will the Minister inform the House whether he intends to remedy this and the reasons why?,63
98,Mr HOWE,REMOTE AUSTRALIA,"I thank the honourable member for his question, which relates to the issue of health services in rural and remote Australia. Honourable members may know that there was recently held at my suggestion a conference on those questions of health as they affect people in rural Australia, involving Commonwealth, State and territory Ministers for that northern part of Australia. At that conference it was suggested that as part of the national health strategy there ought to be a paper specifically on the question of rural and remote areas. I have included that within the terms of reference of the national health strategy. The special ministerial meeting whi-h was held on 28 and 29 November gave· a focus to the problems faced by people in rural and remote Australia. In a communique put out at the end of the meeting all Ministers agreed on a list of priorities which need to be tackled to help meet the health needs of people living in these areas. Ministers agreed on the need for high level cooperation and concerted efforts by governments to meet these special health needs. It is acknowledged by Ministers that many of the significant health problems faced by remote Australians were due to deficiencies in infrastructure which would be difficult and very expensive to overcome. They related to issues such as housing, .sealed roads, water supply and the difficulties of isolation which would need to be tackled over the longer term. Ministers stressed the need for all governments to give a high priority to the national Aboriginal health strategy. They agreed that the key issues concerned the recruitment of health workers in remote areas. These issues would need to be addressed through greater emphasis on training, through nationally consistent, formal accredited training programs for Aboriginal health workers,· improved coordination of aerial and .other transport services and the need for rural and remote specific programs of health promotion and illness prevention, and finally the need for greater involvement by local and community' government on environmental health issues. The Government has a very considerable concern to improve the health of Australians in rural and remote areas. Before I went to Broome I announced in Darwin the formation of a rural and remote area unit which will be established to ensure that my Department works closely with rural communities, particularly in the remote areas of Australia, to improve access to services. We have sought as a government to extend many of the services that we take for granted in the cities to the most remote areas of Australia. At the end of last year we announced the establishment of 10. outposts of Commonwealth rehabilitation service units at a cost of $1.9m and the provision of respite care places which are often so important in these areas of Australia. The national health strategy will be publishing a paper on rural and remote areas. The rural and remote area unit in Darwin will get a number of practical programs under way that will help us to deliver services in the very difficult areas that we need to serve. Over time the Government will seek to ensure that it provides more comprehensive health services, including health promotion and a screening program for women. Wherever one lives in Australia those services hopefully will be provided in a more comprehensive, intelligent and sensitive way. NA",63
99,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Was the Prime Minister's announcement of his plan to stay on for five years prompted by advice from Senator Richardson that the Treasurer had no electoral appeal and, having pushed the economy into recession, no longer had credibility as a leadership contender and should ultimately be sacrificed?",64
100,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,No. NA,64
101,Mr LEE,MIDDLE EAST,"My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. What is the Government's response to the release of Australian hostages detained by Iraq? What are the prospects for talks between the United States and Iraq, given today's reports that the Iraqi Government is preparing the country for hostilities?",64
102,Mr HAWKE,MIDDLE EAST,"I, as with every member of this House, I am sure, am delighted that the hostages have been released from Iraq. I think everyone in this House recognises that the Government has been unceasing in its efforts to have the hostages released and in providing for the welfare of Australians.in Kuwait and Iraq. As with the hostages from all other countries, the Australians should never have l;>een held hostage and they should not have been denied their basic freedoms in the first place. The Government's position that all hostages should be released unconditionally . and that the international community maintain absolute solidarity has been shown to be correct. In addition to that comment, I unreservedly extend my thanks to the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition as a whole for the consistent support they have given us on that attitude. I believe the House would wish me, as I intend now to do, to place on record my appreciation and that of the Australian Government and the Australian people for the unceasing efforts of the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and in particular of Australian officials in the Middle East. They and this country can be very rightly proud of their professionalism and of their determination. I have expressed that sentiment personally in a message to the Ambassador and his staff in our embassy· in Baghdad. As to the second part of the honourable member's question, we welcome the United States' initiative to attempt to hold talks with Iraq. Iraq's unwillingness to this point to reach an accommodation on any of the dates proposed and its insistence that Middle East issues be on the agenda do bring into question Iraq's seriousness in pursuing a peaceful resolution of the crisis. It is my sincere hope, and one which I know will be shared by all honourable members, that talks do in fact occur and that those talks should result in Iraq's full compliance with all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. I say finally that Iraq should be in no doubt of the determination of the international community to see full compliance with those resolutions as underlined by the recent European Community and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation declarations.

103,Mr TIM FISCHER,LEGISLAHON,"My. question is directed to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. I refer the Minister to the fact that last night Cabinet deferred consideration of the resource security legislation. Why was the Government unable to make a decision on this vital issue to the Australian economy and the responsible creation of jobs?",64
104,Mrs KELLY,LEGISLAHON,"This issue was discussed in some detail in Cabinet yesterday following the report of an interdepartmental committee of officials and ministerial consultations with industry, with conservation groups and with the unions. Cabinet decided that. it would look further into these issues next year if a proposal for a specific resource development is brought forward by a State government and if Commonwealth action to assist security of wood supply for that project is sought. I can assure the honourable member that the Government would give this its prompt consideration. NA NA",64
105,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMISSION LEGISLATION,"I direct my every question to the Attorney-General. The Minister would be aware that the LiberalNorthern National Party dominated upper House in Western Australia has blocked the legTerritory islation for the operation of the Australation, lian Securities Commission (ASC) in wealth Western Australia.

Can Minister advise the House whether the happen. Opposition parties in Western Australia have changed their position on this matter? Is it the intention of the Federal ernment to proceed with the ASC from 1 January 1991?

109,Mr DUFFY,COMMISSION LEGISLATION,"Unfortunately, as at tions about 1 o'clock, a little over an hour ago, there had been no change of heart by Liberal-National Party in the upper in Western Australia. However, being eternally optimistic, I point out that there are further' discussions continuing this afternoon between the Attorney-General, Mr Berinson, and members of the Liberal National Party in the upper House. However, honourable members of this House, and for that matter everyone in Australia, should be aware of the fact that other State parliament in this country and the Legislative Assembly of the Territory, which I must say came back after the election in the Northern to deal with this piece of legis-' have all joined with the Commonto put in place a national regulatory to operate from 1 January. The olHy group which does not agree, as the only group which is out of step with other government or party in this .country, is this strange group in the Western Australian upper House, which is no better than an irresponsible fringe group to the politics of this country. the honourable member for Stirling outlined because of his particular interest in this area, there are dire consequences the business community in Western comAustralia because those in the upper will House in Western Australia-the Oppothe sition-have decided that normal busiin ness activities in Western Australia will basically come to an end at midnight on the 31 December. That is what is going to As a result of this absolutely ludicrous Govposition, some of the ramifications which will follow and other matters that have action now come to light-and which the honourable member for Stirling outlined his question-include the fact that there is now a serious possibility that Western Australian stockbrokers will have to shift operations interstate in order to conduct business. That very serious situation has arisen because, unless the corporalaw is pas-ed, the stock exchange guarantee fund may not be able to continue to cover stockbroking operain Western Australia. So the situation from that point of view could not be the any more serious and the consequences, House of course, are obvious. . The other matter-the point raised by the honourable member for Stirling-is that Western Australian companies wishister ing to raise funds outside Western tralia will have to ,comply with dual registration requirements. That will' bring to bear consequential costs on Western week. Australian business which will not be borne throughout the rest of Australia. ' In relation to investigations that the honourable member for Stirling referred to and the concern in respect of the corwill porate investigations generally, the Bond Corporation, investigation,' amongst othindustry ers, will be severely restricted by the actions of the Western Australian sition. In particular, the Australian Securities Commission will not legally be to take over the investigation in Western Australia. As from 1 January the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) investigations will be taken by the ASC. But, because of this action by the Western Australian Opposition, that will not be the case, particularly in respect of the Bond Corporation inquiry and others in Western Australia. In any event, the seriousness of that is , seen when one analyses that any Western Australian investigation into the Bond Corporation will not be able to exercise powers, of investigation, ,outside Western Australia. I can only say to the honourbeen able member for Stirling and to all other honoural?le members that we all very riously hope that this afternoon or tonight or at any time before the end of next week, the Western Australian Opposition thinks again about the consequences of its actions and falls into line with the rest Australia, with its own parties in every other State and the governments of every State of Australia; , Finally, in answer to another part the honourable member's question about whether we are proceeding, the answer yes, we are proceedirig. The Executive Council meeting in relation to that matter has been held. The ASC regulations have been proclaimed and the scheme operating from 1 January, with or without Western Australia. Let me say' that it the hope of everyone on this side of the House and, I think, of the people who are involved in this area on the other side of the House-particularly the shadow Minfor corporate affairs and the shadow AusAttorney-General-that this extraordinary group in Western Australia come to heel at some stage between now and next NA",65
110,Mr LLOYD,CANADIAN TARIFF PARITY,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister be aware that a major element of the current crisis in the deciduous canned fruit is the accelerating loss of the industry's largest and most profitable,exOppoport market, Canada. Does the Prime . Minister now admit that he has failed to able achieve his commitment for Canadian tariff parity with United States fruit for the Australian industry? Does he recognise that he has been double crossed by over the Canadian Prime Minister?",66
111,Mr HAWKE,CANADIAN TARIFF PARITY,"That is tough language, Mr Speaker. Taking the first part of itMr Tim Fischer-It is a tough situation.",66
112,Mr HAWKE,CANADIAN TARIFF PARITY,"I realise it is a tough situation. The honourable member knows I do not have to be convinced about that. Over a very long period of time, I have in correspondence with, spoken on the telephone to, and in Kuala Lumpur seduring the last Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting spoken directly to my colleague the Canadian Prime Minister. It was the case that it was my understanding from the meeting that I had with of Mr Mulroney in Kuala Lumpur, and out of the discussions that others had with him at the official level, that we did have an arrangement that was going to accomof modate the very real problem that has been created for the gro-ers to whom the is honourable gentleman refers, as a result of what looked like the closing of access to the Canadian market flowing from the conclusion of the Canada-United States will be free trade agreement. I thought that was the position, and I is think the honourable gentleman would be aware that I conveyed that impression to the growers and their representatives. Unfor,tunately, it is the case that since I have been made aware that the Canadian Prime Minister seems now to have taken the view that he cannot adhere to what' we understood to be the agreement that had, been reached there, and that he is leaving this matter to be considered in the negotiations that will be part of the latter stages of the round. , I hope and trust that the honourable gentleman will accept that I have, at all points, ,attempted in good faith to do everythi'ng I could on this matter and I did believe that I had a resolution which would be acceptable. I do not think I could have done more. I am not prepared, having said all that, to embrace in regard to the Prime Minister of Canada the language that the honourable gen't1emap used in his question. I think that is inappropriate language. I, certainly cannot and will not embrace it. But I do express my grave disappointment at the fact that what I thought had been an acceptable resolution of this matter has not, for the reasons I have outlined to the House, proved to be possible.

113,Mr GORMAN,TRADE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Technology, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer. Would the Minister inform the House of the conditions this Government accepts from overseas countries as being consistent with being treated as level playing fields in trade dealings; and are we a free trader when in actual fact we should become a fair trader?",67
114,Mr CREAN,TRADE,"I am in a sense pleased that the honourable member has asked this' question because I know that he does take a very ,great interest in matters of industry policy. He would be aware that the Government is in the process of making an announcement early next year on industry policy. It was hoped that that statement would have come down before the end of the year. It has not been able to be brought down because of the delay in progress in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round, and the Governthen ment was of the view that it would be better to delay the decision until the early part of next year. I preface my response by saying that because it is important to understand that the Government is hot looking just at the question of circumstances in a particular country, relating to a specific industry or a specific company. I do not believe government can run industry policy in that way. It needs a broad strategic framework. The Government has the advantage of some very important reports: the Garnaut report, the Pappas-Carter report, the Australian Manufacturing Council report and the Hughes report on exports, the one that has resulted in legislation that is coming back to this House this afternoon on the export market development grants scheme. It is against the background of the information in those reports and the Government's assessment as to where industry policy should be directed that we will be making a decision. I am of the view that it is nonSense at times to think that we are always playing on a level playing field. It is a nice notion in principle, but if in fact it does not exist I think we have to look at the barriers that that may create in advancing our strong industries-not protecting our weak ones. That is the fundamental difference between this Government and those on the other side who seem to think that all one has to do is to get tariff levels down, regardless of the consequences, rather than look at the circumstances of an industry. What we have to. do is develop a strategy that identifies the strengths in this economy'-and there are many-and then look at the barriers .that may be preventing their being developed. It is against all of that that the Government will be making a statement early in the new year. NA",67

117,Mr CAMPBELL,ROTHWELLS LTD,"--,-My question is addressed to the Minister for Land Transport. The. Minister will recall that I asked in this place a question with respect to the stamp issuing policy qf Australia Post, 'and I was given an undertaking that the Mip.ister would seek to have further ne. gotiations with. Australia Post. I therefore ask the Minister: in his talks with this insensitive pachyderm, has he had any good fortune, or is it; . like the Australian .Wool Corporation, hiding behind the myth of corporate commercialincompetence? . . Mr ROBERT. BROWN-I was glad that ,I .was away when the original question was asked. I think perhaps I should have been' away today as well. I did read the question, and I know that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie expressed his concern, I thought very effectively, when he drew the attention of the Parliament and the Minister for Transport and Communications to the fact that it appeared that Australia Post had been maintaining a policy where, despite the fact that it recognises in appropriate ways-by the issuing of ,those cqmmemorative stamps in particular-various matters of importance to Australia's cultural, social, political and industrial history and traditions, it would not issue commemorative stamps for Australian political parties on appropriate occasions, particularly perhaps a 50-year anniversary or a centenary. l know that in his reply the Minister for Transport and Communications indicated as well that he did not feel that that was a particularly appropriate policy, bearing in mind that political· parties, of course, are part of the great institutional structure and arrangements of the Australian commllnity-and I refer. to all political parties in that context, particularly the larger parties which are of course represented within the Parliament. As a result of that, some informal discussions were held with Australia Post. I want to emphasise that Australia Post is an independent government business enterprise which is fulfilling and pursuing a commercial charter as it is required to do. In questions of management and policy of that kind Australia Post will continue to make its own decisions but; probably as a result of the very compelling presentation of the honourable member's question when he drew attention to the fact, for example, that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and other types of institutions and organisations in Australia had been recognised, perhaps that policy could be reviewed. I am pleased to be able to advise the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, other members of the Parliament and the wider community that Australia Post has reconsidered its policy. It has recognised that political parties are part of that great institutional structure and framework of the Australian co-munity and has recognised that, while there could well be some degree of sensitivity on the part of some elements of the community and perhaps some political parties, it would be appropriate for them to be recognised on appropriate occasions. I would not have suggested that the Australian Labor Party, for example, be recognised on its centenary, which of course is next year, and that members of the Liberal Party then also wait for its centenary. .",68
118,Mr HAWKE,ROTHWELLS LTD,It would be a long wait.,68
119,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ROTHWELLS LTD,"As the Prime Minister indicates, they would wait a long time. Perhaps they may not even. be able to achieve it. The Australian Labor Party has the longest continuous history orany political party in the world. I think it is probably appropriate as well for all of us to keep in mind that the first workers' representative elected to any legislature anywhere in the world was elected in Australia, in facti, in Queensland-a source of great pride, I know, for Queenslanders. The first workers' government in the history· of the world was elected in Queensland; the first workers' government to represent a nation in the history of the world was elected in Australia. Of course, it also represented the Australian Labor Party, which next year will have been formed 100 years. There will .be recognition of it, and if people on the other side are very well behaved their fiftieth anniversary might be recognised as well in about six years. I wonder whether Ted Mack, after he has been here for 50 years, will be recognised as well. . But I understand that the only people . who can be recognised during their lifetime on Australian stamps are members .of the royal family, and I believe Mr Mack has no such aspirations. I am pleased to be able to advise the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and everyone else that our great political . will be recognised. I hope there is no sensitivity, because we know what happened in New South Wales. Small commemorative pictures had been included on motor vehicle registration stickers, but when it was found that the community started to squabble it was quite correctly said, 'Well, that's okay. We will just cut that half off'. That has been done, so none of them are now recognised. I hope that that does not happen to political parties. I understand that those opposite will be recognised as well in about six years if they are still around. DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION: NA",68

Will the Prime Minister now recall Mr Burke from Dubpeared lin to allow his innocence or otherwise be established? , Mr HAWKE-I repeat the answer I ,gave to a question in the same. area fore. I know that on the other side of House allegation is. equivalent to proof. On this side of the House, it is not. take the view that because someone an allegation about another we do not accept that it is true. We still have old fashioned belief here on this side the, House that a person is innocent proven guilty. As far as this Government and I are concerned, we will continue to operate on that basis. If a point is reached in any appropriate legal proceedings in Western Australia where the, presence of Mr Burke is required, of course, this Government will ensure that nothing is put in the way of his return; indeed, his return will be facilitated. That is the appropriate way in which these things should be covered. If we reach the stage in this country where Party the mere allegation in some proceedings is taken by the community as proof of the guilt of the person about whom that allegation is made, this community will have descended into a very unsavoury state. It is a great pity that those on the other side of this place encourage such assumptions. I repeat that, if at any approprlate stage of any legal proceedings there the return of the Ambassador to Ireland is required, this Government will facilitate that return. NA",69

What is the Minister doing to restrict the use of such chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) had and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) in tapper terms of this whole ozone issue?",69
122,Mrs KELLY,OZONE LAYER,"I thank the honourable for her question and I draw attention to this advertisement which apin the papers. It is very misleading to about the role of the Federal Government and also the role of industry in this country. The photo is a very disturbing one of bea child with its eyes gouged out. I am the very disappointed that this advertisement did not acknowledge the leading role that We Australia has already taken in addressing makes the depletion of the ozone layer. When I spoke to Greenpeace Australia the about this advertisement it. assured me of that it was part of an international camuntil paign-that the advertisement had been prepared in London and it was not meant to criticise directly either the Australian Government or Australian industry. I have to say that I am very proud of Australia's efforts in: relation to the issue of the depletion of the ozony layer cause last year this Government and Parliament enaCted the Ozone Protection Act, which goes beyond our responsibilitheir 'ties under the Montreal Protocol stances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, because we considered this such an imafter pOrtant issue. In fact, at that last meeting in, London on the Montreal Protocol, Australia took a leading role with 12 other countries in 'pledging to phase out 'CFCs by 1997-well ahead of what was required of us under that Protocol. I confident that Australia will be able phase out 95 per cent of CFCs and haloris before the end of 1994, which will be very si,gnificant achievement. The only way that we have been able to do that is as a result of the leadership of this Government, and the support of this Parliament; there has been bipartisan support for this.

123,Mrs KELLY,OZONE LAYER,"I was just about to say that it is also' due to the great support that we have had from the industry in this country. I have' made reference to Ltd. that in the Parliament. I have been the first to stand up and criticise industry jobs. when I thought it was n,ecessary. But I am also prepared to stand up and support the industry when it does the right thingjecting or i will deal with him. and on this issue it definitely has. In fact, just a little while ago the aerosol industry came to me and said, 'We can phase out methy1chloroform by 1992, which is years before it is required to do sowas the industry'S initiative. I had even met with it to ask it to do it. simply came to me and ,said, 'We believe we can do this and we will aim to do this'. So there are times when one actually needs to say that the industry is doing right thing. I am confident country, with the good working relationship that we have developed with indussuggest try on these issues, we will be able to a solution to this well before we are quired to under the Montreal convention. On the issue of HCFCs, there is' no doubt that this is an area which has to be addressed, and it has to be done globally. Currently, industries are developing these betransitional substances, which they call this HCFCs, which have an ozone depleting potential far lower than CFCs. Without use, it would have been extremely on Subdifficult to phase out CFCs. HCFCs will only be phased out entirely suitable ozone benign substitutes become available. That will take time and will continue to require the cooperation of industry. I can only say that, from the all experience I have had in this country, industry has been very cooperative. This am Government will continue to take a leadto ing role in the elimination of ozone depletingsubstances. It will do that globally a and I believe it will continue to do that with the support of industry. NA , EMPLOYMENT "" ,",70

127,Mr H,RENEGOTJATION OF TERMS OF,"WKE-The Government understands and is sympathetic to the ,position 13 in which SPC workers found themselves. That Of course, everyone would have sympathy not with the position in which they found It themselves. Their company had, through a cbmbination of unfortunate board decisions and some factors beyond its control, arrived at a position where jobs were 'unthe der threat and the workers wished to see that in this those jobs protected. It would be amazing if anyone were to that this Government did not unget derstand the need for jobs to be protected reand supported because; as I have said in answer 'to an earlier question, we' are the Government which has created record employment growth in this country. Our concern in this issue with SPC is to see that Australian workers are not exploited in this present downturn. There are, without question, wider ramifications of the SPC proposal which any reasonable member should understand need to be taken into account. Let me remind the House of the view which was expressed in an editorial in the Australian Financial Review yesterday. It said: This might be a flexible wage system in operaconcerned tion, but its poverty is the lack of stimulus offers to deal with the basic industry problem of over-capacity. However, the effects of the SPC agreement well reach even further, with company ments being used as a band-aid for bad managethe ment in industries that have nothing to canning fruit. There is a great deal more to effective competiof tion, or business survival, than just cutting wages. Already a major competitor of SPC has foreshadowed a similar cut in wages and conditions to maintain its competitive sition relative to SPC. There is no doubt that the proper course is for the Austrasay lian Industrial Relations Commission to handle this matter now and, in that constrous text, for the company to accept the help which the Australian Council of Trade the Unions (ACTU) has offered in order to find a solution which both saves jobs prevents the erosion of basic conditions and rights of workers. Opposition members-Ha, hal",70
128,Mr HAWKE,RENEGOTJATION OF TERMS OF,"Despite this incessant braying of the donkeys on the other side, the fact is that only the Commission consider this matter in the wider public interest. Opposition members-Oh!",71
129,Mr SPEAKER,RENEGOTJATION OF TERMS OF,Order! Honourable members on my left will cease interjecting. Mr Carltoil-This is rubbish.,71
130,Mr SPEAKER,RENEGOTJATION OF TERMS OF,I warn the member for Mackellar. ',71
131,Mr HAWKE,RENEGOTJATION OF TERMS OF,"It has already been reAre vealed that the management did not know the rights and the opportunities that available to it under the existing legislation. Mechanisms such as enterprise specific awards and certified agreements are available within the existing Industrial Relations Act for employers and workers to negotiate new wages and conditions. This would, as I understand the chairman of SPC himself now acknowledges, have been a better way to handle the issue. We have all this silly noise from people on the other side, but there has been no suggestion from them that they are really about the workers; they are just it political opportunists of the basest kind. The whole wages policy of the Opposimay tion is a massive real reduction in wages. agreeOpposition members want to get rid of accord and adjust wages only in acdo with cordance with movements in productivity; in that situation wages would move by about 2 per cent, with an inflation rate 6 per cent. Their prescription for wage justice is a per annum 4 per cent real reduction in wages. That is what members on the other side are about. They have no poreal concern for the interests of workers. For them to get up on the SPC issue and that they are the guardians, the champions, of the rights of workers is a monhypocrisy, and they know it. The proof of the hypocrisy and irrelevance of Opposition is, as I say, that the chairand man of SPC himself, having now been informed of the rights and opportunities available under the industrial relations legislation, acknowledges th-t that would have been a better way of handling it. At least he has come to his senses, even if the Opposition has not. For the Opposican tion, there is no hope. NA NA",71
132,Mr GIBSON,MITIGATION SCHEME,I draw the attention of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to claims by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane that the completion of the Norman Creek flood mitigation scheme could be delayed because the Federal Government has reduced funding to the scheme. the Lord Mayor's claims correct? Could the Minister confirm to the House were the Government's commitment to the completion of the Norman Creek flood mitigation project?,71
133,Mr KERIN,MITIGATION SCHEME,I thank the honourable member for his question and also thank my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for the interest he takes in this issue. Mr Beale-That is the only way he gets a mention in this place.,72
134,Mr KERIN,MITIGATION SCHEME,"No, he is very assiduous. There has been some publicity and it is the usual old State stunt of passing the buck to the Commonwealth. It seems really that the Lord Mayor of Brisbane has inherited the grand old Liberal tradition of trying to cover up its own incompetence by blaming someone else. Mr Beale-Oh, go on!",72
135,Mr KERIN,MITIGATION SCHEME,"No, I· am being kind. I know the Lord Mayor has been desperate to prove that she is a new Liberal, but it is pretty clear that the only difference between anew Liberal and an old Liberal in Queensland is the dwindling number of National Party mates available to make up the numbers-and most of them are celebrating Christmas in Boggo Road gaol. As the honourable member for Moreton is aware, the Norman Creek flood mitigation project is funded under the Federal water resources assistance program, the acronym for which is FWRAP. Under the FWRAP formula, the Commonwealth and State governments each contribute 40 per cent of project costs with the local authority covering the remaining 20 per cent. Since the program commenced in 1988-89, the Commonwealth has provided $2.06m for the Norman Creek project. The Prime Minister is interested in this, too. This includes $260,000 for the current financial year, which is the full amount sought by the Brisbane City Council in its initial submission. However, in a revised submission received in the day, the Brisbane City Council sought an extra $1m. This additional bid was based on a revised estimate by the Council of the total cost of the project, up from $5.9m to $7.3m. This represents an increase of nearly 25 per cent over the original 1987 estimate. As I pointed out to the Lord Mayor in a letter earlier this mon-h, major cost escalations such as this cause significant difficulties in program management. Funds available for flood mitigation works are keenly sought and are allocated according to well-established and accepted priorities. My colleagues in the western suburbs of Sydney, the central coast and Newcastle are also very keen to get additional money for flood mitigation at present. As far as Queensland is concerned, any additional funding for Norman ·Creek could have been provided only by withdrawing funds from other Queensland projects. This, of course, was unacceptable. We are keen to see the Norman Creek project completed. We recognise its importance to the residents of Brisbane. I assure the honourable member that the Commonwealth has not withdrawn its commitment to this project. As I indicated to the Lord Mayor, the Commonwealth is prepared to consider an allocation to the project in the next financial year, but will do it using the. proper procedure.

Motion of Censure",77
139,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"I move: That this House censures the Prime Minister for his abdication of leadership and his failure to take the necessary decisions to avert Australia's Report current economic crisis, resulting in severe hardship for millions of Australians. The Opposition feels that, as the Parliament is about to get up until the middle of February, in the midst of the worse economic crisis this country has seen since at least the Second World War, it is essential that we have a full-blown debate on the nature of that crisis and the GovernReport ment's inability to provide the key element to the resolution of that crisisnamely, leadership. We tried to move this morning for the suspension of Standing Orders, but the debate was gagged. It is essential that we draw attention to the fact that in recent days we have received firm evidence that the economy is in a deep and protracted recession. We have seen unemployment rise to over 8 per cent and we have seen a monumental amount of squabbling, bickering and backbiting as the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has launched his third run for the leadership in almost as many years, at a time when most Australians are running scared. Christmas 1990 will turn out to be a black Christmas for many Australians and, for most, 1991 promises to be the worse year in their memory. Many Australians, despite the assurance of the - rime Minister (Mr Hawke) today about his record on employment, are now genuinely concerned and worried about their jobs. They are seeing unemployment rise by 40,000 to 50,000 per month. The unemployment rate has already reached 8 per cent. It could well go to 10 to 12 per cent in the course of the next six to 12 months. Young Australians in particular are very concerned about their job prospects. Youth unemployment has already reached 23 per cent and it is believed by many com mentat01:s that youth unemployment will rise to the high 20s, if not to 30 per cent; with this year's schoolleavers. Many families are in genuine finanCIal crisis. Community groups that I have spoken to in recent days record the fact that the number of families coming to them seeking crisis family assistance has risen dramatically and alarmingly in the course of the last six to 12 months. All Australians can see evidence all over the place that we are in a deep recession and in a state of financial collapse. Several of our major corporations are in liquidation and as every day goes by there is untold press speculation about others. Tens of thousands-it may well be over 100,OOO-farmers and small businesses are being forced into bankruptcy and many of those people are being forced to walk away permanently from their lifetime efforts and in many cases have lost their lifetime savings. Our private banks have massive bad debts, in terms of questionable loans at this point approaching $11 or $12 billion against a capital base of.$161/2 billion with estimates that that may go to $14 billion to $15 billion worth of questionable loans by the middle of this year. Therefore, the banks have been forced to impose a secondary credit squeeze. Many Australians are worried about the safety of their savings in current drcumstances. Property and share prices have collapsed and the prospects are that they will fall further, which is very bad news for most Australians because the only asset most Australians have is their house, and they are now sitting back and watching their wealth erode. The public sector is in crisis all over Australia. Many government business enterprises are reporting huge losses and some are failing. Huge losses are expected in organisations such as Qantas Airways Ltd, and institutions such as Aussat would be put in the failing category. We have seen the attempt of this Government to dump that organisation. Several State governments are technically near bankruptcy and Victoria would be a financial catastrophe by anybody's assessment. Its deficit in the first four months of this year is already double that of the same period last year. Premier Kirner, who was put in office to bite the bullet and take the tough decisions, clearly does not have. the capacity to do so. The Commonwealth's own Budget is now in total disarray with the surplus being frittered away. by a host of bad decisions and increases in spending. There is a list of proposals in the background ) about to hit that. We are now looking at a surplus this year of around $5 billion or less against the Budget time forecast of over $8 billion. Finally, the Australian economy is particularly vulnerable to what happens in the rest of the world. We have gone into recession first and the rest of the world is starting to slow down. We are vulnerable to the possibility of a world recession. We are vulnerable to the possibility of war in the Middle East and its impact in particular on the price of oil, and we are vulnerable to the possibility of further significant shake-outs in the world banking system and in world stock markets. Our economy has been left to drift lessly. People are crying out for answers and for assistance and for a 'sense of direction from the Prime Minister's Government. People are crying out for the one thing he has been unable to deliver in 71f2 years, which he never draws attention to in his dorothy dix answers; they are crying out for leadership. They want the truth about our current situation and they want him to get on and solve the problems. They do not want to be distracted by the extent of the deep-seated backbiting and bickering that is going on within his Party about leadership. They want to know what his strategy is to deal with rising unemployment. They want to know what his strategy is to. deal with balance of payments and our debt burdens which they fear have already mortgaged the future of their children, if not their grandchildren.",79
140,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER,Oh!,81
141,Dr HEWSON,PRIME MINISTER,"The Prime Minister should not scoff. It is a serious consideracts ation that in the space of 71f2 years the Prime Minister has increased debt fivefold and mortgaged the future of those children quite significantly for decades. The Prime Minister has no strategy for stabilising debt. The people of Australia want to know what the Prime Minister is going to d.o with trade policy if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade fails. They want to know what he is going to. do about the rural crisis, as now many farmers are being forced to leave their farms. They want to know whether Dawkins or Button or· Howe or Keating will get up on industry policy. The people of Australia cannot understand why the Prime Minister could not build a third runway, why he could not facilitate the development of Wesley Vale or the mining of Coronation Hill. They want to know why last night he could not ensure resource security legislation when there is such a desperate need for jobs in this country. They cannot understand the illogical nature, which the Prime Minister has admitted, of his three-mines uranium policy. They cannot understand how this is meant to be a clever country when the aim- Prime Minister has made such a mess of things and failed to provide leadership. The people cannot understand a Treasurer who still boasts that his policies are working, that recession numbers are beautiful, that it is the recession we had to have. They cannot understand why, if things are so good, according to the Treasurer, there is so much pain around for them and their families. They cannot understand why the Government does not stand by workers who sit down and agree with their management to change their wages in order to save their, jobs. The people of Australia are prepared to stand behind the workers at SPC Ltd. Why are Joan Kirner, Bob Hawke and John our Halfpenny not prepared to defend those workers' right to negotiate that sort of deal, even under the existing rules? The silence around Australia on all those questions is deafening. The Prime Minister and his Government are providing absolutely no answers. These days the Prime Minister looks and as though it is all too hard, as though he has given up. He is running a government which he knows is wracked by indecision and factional brawls. He has no vision and no sense of. direction. Many on his back bench-who have left the chamber rather than be reminded' of the extent of his failed leadership'-are very concerned, as their constituents are. Indeed, many of them are scared, as their constituents are, that the Prime Minister does not know where he is going and what he is doing, that he cannot provide the leadership, that he has run out of ideas, that those on the front bench are at each other's throats contending for leadership, and that perhaps our country has now run out of luck. Nobody could have misjudged the mood of the people of Australia more than the Prime Minister and his Treasurer did in recent days. They argued that this recession would be avoided, and then when they were unable to deliver against that election promise the Treasurer had the hide to tell people that it was the recession we needed to have. It was a beautiful thing, something the Treasurer just had to engineer for the benefit of all Australians! The drift into recession parallels the drift in the Prime Minister's leadership. Today's crisis has been eight years in the making-eight years of poor leadership, eight years of failed policies, eight years of lost opportunities. The Prime Minister has failed to provide the leadership that this country desperately needs. He, more than anyone else, has failed to provide that leadership in a number of respects. He has failed to provide a vision and a sense of direction for the people of Australia. He has failed to take the people of Australia into his confidence-something as basic as that-and to tell them the truth about the circumstances he has now created. He has failed to take the tough decisions, preferring to pander to political constituencies and special interest groups, just to ensure his own political survival. The result has largely been the recession we just had to have, as the Treasurer said. The Prime Minister has sacrificed the interests of most Australians for the interpeople. ests of a few. He has allowed his Ministers to run amuck and he has tolerated ministerial failure and indiscretion. He did not fire Mick Young on three occasions. He did not fire Senator Tate. He did not move Gerry Hand. The present Deputy Prime Minister has challenged the Prime Minister's leadership three times. He has shown gross incompetence and gross disloyalty, and the Prime Minister does not have the strength of character to be able to remove him for that. He says it is good enough for his Treasurer to say to him that he was sorry, but I put· it to the Prime Minister that he and his Treasurer - ought to stand up and publicly say to the people of Australia that they are both very sorry for the damage they have done. There wil\ be those, of course, who will argue that I should not attack the Prime Minister, that I should not focus on the Prime Minister, that after all it is the Treasurer who has failed, who has let the economy stumble into recession. He is the one who has now thrown in the towel and it is his personal ambitions that have destabilised this Government In a sense, they are right: the Treasurer too needs censure, but he is getting his censure ..Wherever I go in Australia, whoever I talk to, people ate telling me of their anger and their contempt for the Treasurer-the big talker who has achieved very little. They can see right through him. They know ""he is a con man who paints rosy pictures but delivers them a miserable recession. He is getting his censure every day out. there in the factories, shops, farms and homes-people are counting the cost of the recession that that Treasurer engineered. The Treasurer is also getting censured in the dole queues which are now being referred to as 'Keating's casualty count'. As a derelict and incompetent Treasurer, he has the real responsibility for Australia's current economic crisis, but the overall responsibility must be sheeted home to the Prime Minister. He is the captain of the ship. He is the one who must accept full responsibility and he must be held publicly accountable, as well as accountable to the Parliament and to its The Prime Minister is the one who has to get off the golf course. He must spend more time in this place and out talking to the people of Australia,working on the solutions to their problems. The Prime Minister has to show the leadership that this country needs now-to save' our economy, to save our businesses, to save our farmers and to save many Australian families. There will, of course, be an attempt in the Prime Minister's Party to dump the Treasurer: the head on platter mentality-cut his throat, push him aside and say, 'That has solved the problem'. The Prime Minister will continue to wear total responsibility for what has hap- pened. . The Prime Minister's performance in recent days should come as no surprise to any Australian who looks back over his record as Prime Minister. He is a great one for talking about the past and focusing on history. I suggest that he look back at his own, because right from the very beginning of his prime ministership it was clear he did not know where he was going. He called a national economic summit, without providing effective leadership or direction. He ended up backing the wrong sort of policies. He expanded economic activity at an unsustainable pace and blew our economy out of the water by early 1985 with a massive exchange rate crisis on several occasions through' 1985-86. The Prime Minister compounded that whole process by a host of other thingsflip-flops on the MX missiie. Do honour- . able members remember that one? The decision to abandon money aggregate targets and discipline on economy policy-a host of them. His second massive failure was in the 1984 election campaign when, under pressure to reveal the details of tax poli-y, he promised a tax summit. Then he failed to manage that issue and the process of tax reform through 1985. It was the Prime Minister who lost the consumption tax decision. It was the Prime Minister who failed to get option C up. It was the Prime Minister who failed to put in place a genuine tax reform and left the Australian community with a batch of nasties. It was a major election time based failure of leadership on his part. Speaking of election campaigns, I must mention the absolutely classic commitment he made in the 1987 election campaign: that no child will live in poverty in 1990. Does the Prime Minister remember that one? The one he tried to weasel out of by changing the word 'will' to the word 'need'. Let me tell t,he Prime Minister that the number of children in poverty has continued to increase, as many of the church leaders in our community have pointed out to him, and all his. hot air will do nothing about that poverty. It was grossly irresponsible on 'his part to make that commitment without putting in place policies that could deliver it. There are massive f6reigh policy gaffes and mistakes where the Prime Minister has degraded and demeaned our international standing as a result of misguided policies and an incapacity to determine what is in the best interests of the people of Australia. His' decisions are based on emotion. There was the Chinese student decision, which was part based on emotion and part based, I would imagine, on guilt because he had overly embraced China and its leadership only to be, in his terms, let down. So, as a consequence, he undermined the basic tenor of our immigration program. On privatisation, the Prime Minister has a classic record. He initially opposed it in 1985; he tried to get it up in 1987 but got rolled; and he got it up in partial terms in 1990. However, 'partial' is the operative word. It is privatisation in word, not in substance. There are a host of other examples of the Prime Minister's failed leadership over recent days, and I have his mentioned Wesley Vale and Coronation Hill-$16 billion worth of projects that will not go ahead and at present are under environmental veto. . Another example is the inability to build a third runway in Sydney to serve our biggest export industry, something we decided to do back in 1982. There is the classic of recent days, the Prime Minister's handling of the telecommunications debate. The whole debate arose, I believe, because of pre-election commitments he made to some of his mates. He got the debate up. He certainly got the debate under way, only to lose control of it and, in the end, he backed his favourite son, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), who is sitting next to him at the table, against the other leadership' contender in the Australian Labor Party, the Treasurer. The Prime Minister backed his favourite son with the third worse option rather than going to the Treasurer's second worse option or, indeed, having the strength of leadership and courage to go for the first best option which, of course, is the one advocated by the Opposition-that of full and effective competition. On those and a host of other.s we have a long history on the Prime Minister's part of failed leadership and inability to put in place the policies that this country has required over that eight-year period. These characteristics of the Prime Minister have been evident for quite some time. He is basically a fixer, a consensus seeker, a faction massager and a backslider who has always wanted to be one of the boys. He is a man driven by polls and popularity contests. He is a man who has to be loved. He therefore does not have the capacity to take the decisions that are necessary to turn this country around. As' the Treasurer would say, I am sure if he were still in the chamber, the Prim- Minister is the mail who always embraces 'the happy days are here again' routine. Even as far back as the Prime Minister's Australian Council of Trade Union (ACTU) days, I remember, he was never deeply involved in industrial disputes til towards the end when it was clear which way the solution would go and he could hop in and take credit for the solution. The country can no longer afford the Prime M:inister. The country can no longer afford his Government because people all over Australia are calling for him to provide the leadership that is so desperately required in these circumstances. He has had nearly eight years to solve our problems, and many of the problems in the industrial relations area go back be things of his creation' in his days as head of the ACTU. The Prime Minister has had nearly eight years to restore our international standing. But now we face the prospect of a recession as a result of his failed leadermy ship over that period. We face the prospect of a recession which will be' unparalleled in the lifetime of most Australians. He has lost the confidence of the Australian people. Indeed, he has created for them a crisis of confidence. He has lost the fidence of his own party. Again, he has created a crisis of confidence ership. To quote the advice of the Prime Minister, which he so readily hurls around, 'If you can't govern yourselves, then you can't govern the country'. The Prime Minister fails on both counts.' He deserves to be censured. Mr SPEAKERIs the motion seconded? Mr Tim Fischer---':'I second the motion and reserve my right to speak later.",81
142,Mr HAWKE,PRIME MINISTER," Mr Speaker, I am very pleased that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has cast this motion in terms of the whole period of my prime ministership because that gives me at the outset the opportunity to find what the real views of the Leader of the Opposition are about me and this Government. Before he became the Leader of the Opposition, when he was in a relatively objective position, he had a number of things to say about this Government. I quoted one of them before and I refer to it briefly again. This will enable this House, and those people listening to this debate, to assess what un- sort of credibility can be given to this man who stands here for purposes of po- . litical expedience and mouths his judgments about me and my Government. In the middle of this period, in 1987more than the middle of the period-the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition about me and this Government, after all the stuff that he was talking about, after all the examples he gave, was that 'the Hawke Government is very professional to and is probably the best front bench since World War II'. That is the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition. When the Leader of the Opposition speaks objectively outside this House and makes his judgments about Government and me, he is right because this is a professional government; it is without any doubt the best front bench since the end of the Second World War. The judgment that the Leader of the Opposition made-this is not the Treasurer(Mr Keating), the Minister for Transport con- and ComnlUnications (Mr Beazley) or me talking; this is the Leader of the Opposiin his leadtion--':""was right. The Leader of the Opposition says that / I should be ashamed of this period of eight years of lost leadership, of lost opportunities. Let me remind the House of what it was that I, as Prime Minister, with the Treasurer and my Government, inherited when we came to office in 1983. What were the problems that we faced, what were the challenges before us, and what have we done about them? Just briefly, let me remind this House that in 1983 Australia was characterised by these things: double digit inflation and unemployment-a phenomenon never before experienced in the history of this country; and an overvalued exchange rate because, .within that morass which·· passes as an Opposition, honourable members opposite did not have the guts to face up to one another and realise that what was being pushed. upon them in regard to that overvalued exchange rate was, in the short tefln- the medium term anQ the long term interest of this country, absolutely wrong. So we had double digit inflation and unemployment; an overvalued exchange rate; and an over-regulated financial system. Opposition members. mouth the rhetodc of competition, but they were the architects of the most regulated economy in the world in many respects. We had a fear of foreign competition in this country which had been engendered by the years of sheltering behind the tariff walls that those opposite had assiduously built tip over their 30 years in office. Government finances were out of control, with a Commonwealth Budget deficit of $9 billion in prospect.,InQustrial relations were in chaos; there was a wages blow-out of the order of 17 per cent; and there was no recognition of the fundamental identity of interest between employers and those whom they employed. We had one of the most inequitable and inefficient tax systems in the world; we had an inadequate and poorly regarded social welfare. system; and we had an education system which was characterised by privilege. Those who came from the homes of the wealthy or the well-to do got their education; they comprised the one in three who went on beyond the compulsory schoo14eaving age. But for those who were not from a privileged background, those who were not from the homes of the wealthy or well-to-do, then that was basically the end of their education. The achievement of honourable members opposite, as I have reminded them before, was that in their seven years in office they lifted the participation rate in the education system by a miserable 2 percentage points to 34 per cent-whereas we have virtually doubled that rate. Those were the characteristics of the Australia which I, as Prime Minister, and my colleagues inherited, and we have addressed constructively each one of those characteristics. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there was double digit inflation and unemployment. We have created, in regard to the employment situation, 1.6 million new jobs, 90 per cent in the private sector. I have gone over that; I will not repeat myself on this occasion. In regard to inflation, we inherited double digit inflation and never at any point in the now eight years of my stewardship as Prime Minister have we approached again that level of inflation which honourable members opposite passed on to this country. Indeed, as a result of the courageous decisions, the tough decisions that I and my Government have been prepared to take, the inflation rate in this country is now below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average; indeed, the underlying rate of inflation is at the lowest level since these records have been kept, since the beginning of the 1970s. So that is what we have done in regard to the first thing we inherited: double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. We inherited an overvalued exchange rate. Honourable members opposite knew what was the right thing to do in that regard but, because of pressure from the rural rump, they would not act. McEwenism stopped them doing it. We came in and we floated the dollar. They never in all that period had the guts, the wit or the wisdom to do what was blindingly necessary for the future welfare of this country. We did it. The Treasurer and I sat down, discussed it and made the decision. It was a decision we never should have had to make because those opposite should have made it years before. But there was no leadership there. The leadership came when I became. Prime Minister, with this Cabinet. The leadership was there to address these problems. We had an over-regulated financial sys-· tem, the third thing I pointed to. Opposition members had cr.eated a situation in this country of the most monumental hypocrisy. They got up on on their plat,: forms in their Libera} Party meetings and addressed the faithful and talked about the virtues of privat- enterprise an"" free competition. What did they do about it? The honourable member for Barker (Mr· MCLachlan), who is sitting on the front bench, knows thaJ the coalition had the most regulated financial sector in the country. That was the legacy that I inherited. But I provided the leadership in this Government which gave a deregulated financial sector and which introduced competition. That should have been done, but because there was no leadership before it never was. As I said, the Opposition had a fear of foreign competition in this country which built up over years as it raised those tariff walls. It gave no sense of urgency either to Australian businessmen or trade unionists. It had built up this cosy unreality in an increasingly competitive world that all it had to do was keep those tariff walls high and this country, then of 16 million people, as we inherited it, would be the one which would be safe. The Opposition never did anything about reducing tariffs. We have reduced them by a third. Let me give the statistics in terms of the achievement that that represents in regard to manufacturing industry. The Opposition says 'opportunities lost'. How does it explain the statistics in regard to the performance of this country· bver the period 1985 to 1989, which are provided in a recent article by Dr Garnaut. If we look at the area of employment, production and· exports in manufacturing, the record of Australia exceeds that of the OECD. In regard to employment, we have had the highest rate of growth in manufacturing employment in that period of any of the countries in the OECD-well above the OECD average. In regard to increase ·in the volume of manufacturing production, we are above the OECD average. Indeed, Japan is the only OECD country that exceeds us. In regard to the movements in the volume of manufactured exports,· we massively outpaced the OECD in that period. There was a 31 per cent increase in the OECD volume of exports. Australia; against that 31 per cent, has a 79 per cent record. Indeed, of all the OECD countries, only the United States of America· exceeds the performance of Australia.in regard to the growth in export volume in. that period. How dare the Opposition· talk about lost opportunities and lack of leadership! This Government has been prepared to take the tough decisions, the decisions that at every point the Opposition reneged on and it would not face· up to, either because of 'its internal divisions or because of its own lack Of intestinal fortitude. We took those decisions, and we have transformed Australia into aCQuntry which, as I say, has""bested'·the OECD in those areas of manufacturing achievement. Look at what we had in the area of government finances-a $9 billion deficit in· prospect. In all of the qoalition's years in government, not once· did it have a surplus. Why did it· not have a surplus? Because it had a taxation policy which ensured that those with· the' greatest capacity to pay did not pay their share. How can it ever get a surplus in the finances of this Government if it is not going to ensure that those in this country with the greatest capacity to pay pay. The Opposition knows what I have had to say. I repeat the quote from Professor Russell Mathews. He said that at the end of the coalition's period of government it had become a matter of choice whether the rich in this country paid any tax at all. That was the legacy of its leadership. But with my election as Prime Minister and with the quality of colleagues I had, we provided the leadership that had never been there, and we created. a situation where we moved from one of the most inequitable, inefficient tax systems to one of the most efficient and equitable in the world. We now have in this country the principle prevailing which should always prevail in any decent democracy,and that is that those with the greatest capacity to pay shall pay the greatest share. That is what my leadership and my Government has provided. We have moved therefore as a result having a reasonable and equitable tax icy and the guts to make the decisions cut government outlays. What was the effort of those opposite? There was the razor gang-one of.the fiscal jokes century-involving $300m. This Government has had the guts and the courage to go in and take the tough decisions. We talk about leadership. On every occasion when we had the leadership, when we showed the guts, where was the response of those opposite? Where was their leadership? Let me remind honourable members, without being exhaustive. Let us start on the assets test. That was the guts of my leadership with my colleagues who said, 'It is infamous that this community should pay pensions to millionaires'. We said that we would have the courage to show that we would have the courage to do it, that we would have confidence in the good sense of the electorate. But those opposite opposed us down the length and breadth of Australia. They painted us as people bringing an end to civilisation as we knew it. That was the quality of leadership from those opposite in this area-an absolute negation of leadership. If we are talking about response in things to leadership and not being prepared to take tough decisions, who was it who provided the leadership last year when the pilots were going to destroy the wage fixing system, which would have given us a return to the nonsense that those opposite had of a 17 per cerit wage explosion? It was Hawke as Prime Minister, supported by his Cabinet and his Caucus, who said to the pilots, 'We will take you on'. Who were the aiders and the abetters of the pilots? It was none other than those opposite. Look at themthe guilty men! They were prepared to say, 'Yes, pilots, it is a very good idea that you should use your industrial muscle to get a 30 per cent increase'. Those opposite had no guts. They had no sense of responsibility. What was totally lacking was any sense of leadership in these matters. I could go on to show how we have had of the guts to make the tough decisions. But polwhat do we find in this man who has got to up and moved this motion about leadership? I just remind honourable members of what the Adelaide Advertiser had to say of the about him on 15 November: Dr Hewson was defeated by his own backbenchers on Tuesday, when he sought coalition support for the assets test proposal but was ""rolled"" by Liberal and National MPs in rural seats. . . . senior Liberals said privately they were amazed at the ease with which Dr Hewson conceded. So much for the hypocrisy of this man! He cannot stand up on an issue such as that!",84
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIME MINISTER,Order! The Prime Minister's time has expired.,87
144,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"1 second the motion and say to honourable members that now more than ever Australia must have leadership-leadership from the Prime Minister (MrHawke), the Cabinet and, indeed, the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) successfully concentrated on the lack of leadership that we have had from. this these Government. I will concentrate on the Prime Minister's speech, the front-bench and the state of the economy. The shadow Treasurer (Mr Reith) will then spell out our responsible solution to the circumstance that Australia faces today. We ought now to address one aspect of the Prime Minister's incredible contribution to this debate on the censure motion. The Prime Minister said that the Government has the best front bench there has ever been. Let us now start to focus on that front bench. Let me start by looking at Senator Button. I will concede that Senator Button takes a more honest approach toward matters before the Government and the economic agenda of this nation. I want to remind the House, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that Senator Button, in one of his great bursts of honesty, said: . . . the Prime Minister should set a timetable to make way for the Treasurer, Mr Keating. Whose words were they? They were Senator Button's words-this great frontbencher's words-albeit in 1988. That led to a situation where the Sydney Morning Herald reported: Despite Mr Hawke's back-down, senior Government sources last night described the relationlast term. ship between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer as only ""workmanlike and professional"". Indeed, Senator Button described Mr Hawke's initial comments in relation to leadership as 'disturbing'. He went on to say to the Prime Minister: 'Name the date, Prime Minister'. They were the comments of an honest Button. Of course, he has failed in his other portfolio areas in terms of industry policy or even producing a definitive industry policy statement. Let us us look at the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), that great mover and shaker who sits up on the cross benches. What is he doing at this moment? He is still trying to work out whether indicative indicators indicate anything at this time. Let us look at one or two other Ministers. Let us look at the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson), that great television voyeur. He spends his time lurking around the door of the Prime Minister's office, looking at that little television screen we all now know exists to see whether the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister are at each other's necks and whether he might have to intervene as some sort of referee or umpire. Let us look at the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister of this country himself. He is wrong, wrong, wrong in relation to his economic policies. Small business knows that he is wrong; the citrus industry, the banana industry and farmers generally know he is wrong. Families battling to survive the bleakest Christmas in decades know he is wrong and, brother, his Caucus colleagues now know that he is wrong. The Paris option awaits him, whether he likes it or not. This front bench is graced by others. Let us have a look at the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). He has a lot of sense. He has pulled'the pin. He has announced that he is getting out. He has had enough. He cannot handle this Government. To be fair to him, he is actually trying in immigration and putting ahead the national interest, rather than the partisan interest, as he' knows that this is his Then we have such wonderful contributors as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security. The sixty-four dollar question is: who is that? It is the honourable member for Bowman, Con Soiacca. Where was he last heard of? ' Mr Costello-In the Greek islands.",87
145,Mr TIM FISCHER,PRIME MINISTER,"Correct, in the Greek islands, fiercely ringing a Brisbane Australian Broadcasting Corporation talk back program saying, 'I am alive, I am well and I am running my electorate from the Greek islands'-in the worse economic recession that Australia has had in many years. That is some front bench! The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) has got away with a quiet year, yet he has much to answer for on the third runway-as does the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). Qantas Airways Ltd is about to pull the pin on services in Townsville from 1 April next and will' also pull the pin on Qantas-only services in Hobarta great contributiqn .to the Tasmanian tourist industry! Those pl,as have not yet been formally announced because there is now a last minute political brawl going on about these Qanta- cutbacks. In reality this front bench is the worse front bench which has graced this Parliament in many a decade. This front bench has a great deal to answer for, but, sadly, it is Australia which is suffering from the lack of performance of the front bench, especially, as the Leader of the Opposition so correctly pointed out, the lack of performance and the lack of leadership of the Prime Minister. This is a Prime Minister who allowed his deputy to attack him in what was, in essence, a public forum, allowed him to get away with it and then allowed Senator Richardson to spy on him in his own office. It would be a light hearted matter if it were not so sad for the thousands of Australians who have lost their jobs in recent months, be they the 300 Australians who work for BTR Nylex Ltd in Albury or the many other Australians in industries and small businesses right around Australia. I issue a warning in the context of this debate. I know the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders, will spell out the alternative way which would have avoided these problems and which would have helped to pave the way for a responsible recovery. For many it is now or never. Many factories will not open again after the Christmas break. That is the harsh economic reality at the coalface in Australia at this time. Many small business operations will not open again after Christmas. Sadly, Geelong, the epic entre of this recession, has had a horrific year for many reasons associated with Pyramid Building Society. It is an education-and I recommend it-to go to Geelong to see at first hand the extent of the economic recession, bordering on depression, facing Australians there. This situation also affects many suburbs of Melbourne. In provincial Australia, be it in Townsville, Bathurst, Orange, Albury, Deniliquin, Balranald, Bourke or beyond, many people face a horrific Christmas and many small businesses will not open their doors after Christmas. Many farmers, in the circumstances of the last two quarters of this financial as they seek the collateral to go back to sow crops and try to maintain some form of viable operation next year, will not have the capability to do so. Frankly, and sadly, I do not think that either elements of the bureaucracy here in the cocoon known as Canberra or elements of the Cabinet, cocooned as they are too often in Canberra, realise the very savage extent of the economic situation, the ugly economic circumstance which has descended upon Australia at the start of the new decade which held out so much hope for the world and Australia. Of course, there are international factors involved. Factors directly beyond the Federal Government are involved. But, equally, many factors go directly to the door of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Clear decision making would have lessened the burden of this recession, paved the way for an economic recovery and ensured that Australia would not ,be, as the Leader of the Opposition says, leading the world into economic recession. In this circumstance, let me put two points to the Parliament. A few weeks ago, in this hour of our need, the Prime Minister was asked directly what his attitude was to one particular key potential export policy area-that of uranium. He shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I admit it is an illogical policy'. What sort of leadership is it when at a time when jobs are so valuable-in northern Australia and elsewhere-the Prime Minister is persisting with an 'illogical policy' with regard to the uranium industry in Australia. Then we had yesterday's classic example. After months of preparation by the offiGials involved, all Cabinet had to do was come up with a positive decision on resources security legislation. It was not too difficult a task, one would have thought, especially in these harsh economic times. What happened in reality? We had an unholy alliance between the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and other elements of Cabinet and there was a stalemate. The Cabinet could not even provide the leadership required for year, this country on the matter of resources security. The reality is that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is in the chamber, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) were rolled by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. Rolled by Ros! It was one against two, but they were rolled by the Minister on such a critical issue, which goes to the issue of responsibly creating jobs. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is why this Government no longer has the confidence of this· House; this is why the Prime Minister no longer has the confidence of this House; and this is why, if people listen around the corridors, the Prime Minister does not even have the confidence of his Caucus colleaguesand neither does the Treasurer. The public proof positive with regard to that flows from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who came out in a very honest way and said that this country needs a new Prime Minister and a new Treasurer. Before the Treasurer gets too excited about all these matters, I remind him of a certain headline as he kowtowed and ran up the white handkerchief: 'Keating-I'm sorry, Bob'. He walked back out, went and had a port with the Minister for Social Security and they discussed the round and plamied their next tactics along the long road to the Lodge. I tell the Treasurer that his chance of getting the keys to the Lodge have now evaporated-and thank God for Australia that that is so. In terms of this resources· security issue, there are other aspects which the National Association of Forest Industries has correctly highlighted. It is not just the failure to make a positive decision on resources security legislation but also the flow-on effect of· the further delay that will lead to. What was on offer was some massive investment in Tasmania-and, indeed, Geelong and Melbourne. My colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) and others would point out the parlous state of the Tasmanian economy, and the Government has walked away from $1.5 billion of possible investment in Tasmania; $600m of investment at Maryvale; and a potential $2 billion investment in south-east New South Wales and East Gippsland in Victoria. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) has said, what is being asked for is not unreasonable. What is being asked for is a fair and responsible charter withr'egard to resource security. Is that too much to expect in 1990 from a government which has been ploughing and mulling over these issues for such a long time? Of course it is not. It is what Australia expects, deserves and should have from this Government which is so hopeless that a simple little agreement, supported by 94 per cent of the workers on the factory floor at SPC Ltd, cannot even be got up after 10 days of wrangles between the Industrial Relations Commission, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, and various other intermediaries? What hope is there for Australia in the absence of the leadership that we require and need? If the Prime Minister were a real leader he would have gone to Shepparton-he might even have gone with the Leader of the Opposition-and he would have said, 'Workers, I admire your common sense; I admire the decisions that have been reached by management, the shareholders and the workers of SPC, and we are going to back you all the way and pave the way for priority adoption of that shining beacon afforded by the SPC decision. I realise that decision is not a precedent, but it is significant when each and every other factory floor chooses to vote by 94 per cent in support of more flexibility to their working and award arrangements.' It is time for this Government, this Prime Minister and this Treasurer to go. This Government no longer enjoys the confidence of this House.",88
146,Mr KEATING,PRIME MINISTER,"Over the years we all have a sense of gravity about politics and about the chamber, when a censure motion has weight and gravity and when it does not. What the censure motion today has is more levity than gravity. The Opposition front bench guffawed its way through all the contributions, in the main. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) put in a pro tem performance and we then had the killer performance of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) who, as I said to one of my colleagues, is confused but not vicious; for which we are grateful, but who made very few points of substance. We started with the Leader of the Opposition who, fulminating,· said that this was the worse economic crisis since World War II, a big and protracted recession. Today the Australian Financial Review broke the embargo until 8 o'clock tonight on the report of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including its report on Australia. So I feel free to quote some of the text hot off the press of the OECD about Dr Hewson's 'worse economic crisis since World War II' and the 'big and protracted recession'. The report says: But with the economy likely to skirt a significant recessionthis is Australiaa hard landing for the economy is not expected, given that underlying demand should be suppor:tedL by demographic factors,lworld economic expanslon and the positive employment effects of stable real unit labour costs . . . The report goes on to say: A modest economic recovery is projected emerge in the first part of 1991. That is the OECD's estimate of Australia. I will read· it again: But with .the economy likely to skirt a significant recessionit does not sound like the worse crisis since World War II to mea hard landing for the economy is not expected, given that underlying demand should ported by demographic factorsincluding: stab-e real unit labour costsmeaning higher profits. I repeat that, though the Leader of the Opposition reIn fers to a big. and protracted recession, OECD report states: A modest economic: recovery is emerge in the first part of 1991. That is the view of the· OECD. But the Leader of the Opposition says that 1991 will be the worse year in memory for most people. That is untrue. It is said despite the fact that we will have a substantial pick-up in disposable income and that for the year. to September this year we had wages running at 6.8 per cent and inflation at 6 per cent. We had real ,wages up in the year to September. As I said earlier, anyone in New South Wales with an average mortgage will now have a $50 a week benefit from lower interest rates, plus a $10 tax cut and a $12 wage increase, which the Opposition is opposing. So how can the Opposition say that those people are going to have the worse year in memory? Certainly, it is undeniable that it will be bad for anyone who is unemployed. But the unemployment level today, if calculated on the same participation rate that the Opposition had, is 2.8 per cent. The unemployment level, if calculated on the participation rate which existed when the Government' came to office, is 2.8 per cent. So this is the worse year in memory for most Australians, according to the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said that the economy has been left to drift aimlessly. Let me make some comparisons . between 1982-83 and 1990. In 1982-83, we had accelerating inflation; in 1990, we have decelerating inflation. In 1982-83, to we· had a very rapid rise in unemployment; in 1990, we have a much more .. modest rise in unemployment, as I say, . with a participation rate comparison of 2.8 percent on the same basis. In 198283, we had a huge Budget deficit; in 1990, we have a huge structural surplus. In 198283, we had a profit share smashed to pieces; in 1990, we have a high profit be supshare. In 1982-83, investment was smashed to pieces with .it; in 1990, investment levels are still higher than the average of the last 25 years. In 1982-83, we had the capital stock declining;. in al1990, we have the capital stock growing. 1982-83, interest rate bill rates peaked the at 22 per cent; in 1990, under Labor, they peaked at 18 per cent-and they are now projected to down at 12 per cent. So how can the Opposition say that the economy is drifting aimlessly when we have. decelerating inflation, a structural Budget surplus, a high profit share, investment still above the last 25-year average, the capital stock growing and interest rates at 12 per cent for official rates? How can the Opposition say that it is drifting aimlessly? The 'Leader of the Opposition went on to say in some of his more mealy-mouthed comments that fiscal policy was becoming a. shambles, forgetting to mention that he had put an $800m hole in it all by himself. What does the OECD say today about fiscal policy? It says: Fiscal policy on a cyclically adjusted basis is expected to tighten significantly over the projection period. I repeat that, particularly for the shadow Treasurer, the ,honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who always walks away at the wrong moment: Fiscal policy on a, cyclically adjusted basis is expected to tighten significantly over the projection period. This is the so-called loose fiscal policy prattled about by him and a few minutes earlier by the Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that, having smashed an $800m dollar hole in the surplus, they are disingenuous when they refer to the lower surplus as a disarray of fiscal policy when the OECD, quite correctly, says that on a cyclically adjusted basis it is a strengthened fiscal policywhich it is. How then is the economy drifting aimlessly? The one honest comment that the Leader of the Opposition made was that the private banks had a secondary squeeze on the economy; that is true. I have said repeatedly that the private banks have operated a secondary monetary policy which has exacerbated the slowdown. It has been one of the factors in turning it into a cut in production and hence providing the definition of a recession. But the fact is that it is there. The Leader of the, Opposition talked about property prices falling and how it was a tragedy. A year ago he was saying that it was a tragedy that young Australians could not buy houses in the capital cities because a boom in housing prices had inflated property beyond their reach. As housing becomes more affordable now, by price and interest rates, he says that falling property prices are a tragedy. These are the disingenuous words of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition then talked about leadership. Much of his address concerned the supposed inadequacies of the leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). We remember when the Leader of the Opposition was advising the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when that office had a chance to provide leadership inside that government. We did not see the sort of leadership we should have seen and that is why we had the litany of problems m 1982-83 which I read out. I address these questions to the Leader of the Opposition: was the reconciliation theme and the National Economic Summit result of 1983 not leadership? Were the accord arrangements for an agreed basis of income determination not leadership? Was the internationalisation of the economy, with the float of the exchange rate, to which the Prime Minister referred earlier, not leadership? Was the opening up of the financial system, again referred ' to by the Prime Minister, not leadership? Was the movement away from middle class welfare not leadership? Was reforming the tax system not leadetship?Was the dramatic shift in,fiscal policy not lead-' ership? Was the stance on South African sanctions not leadership? Was the firmness on a multicultural future ,for Australia not leadership? Was the formation and promotion of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, an international development, not leadership? Were the environmental initiatives not leadership? Were all the issues-road freight, rail freight, the environment, many issues-encompassed in the recent Premiers Conference not leadership? . When all that was being provided, what was being provided by Oppo-ition members? What were they doing in terms of that sort of leadership? They were opposing the reconciliation theme because, being masters of division, they wanted no part of that. They opposed the consultative, . income determination structure in this country. They want no conversation with the unions and abhorred the conversation we had with the unions under the accord. Opposition members opposed most of the difficult middle class welfare issues, as the Prime Minister mentioned earlier-the assets test on pensions and, more lately, the assets test on the family allowance. They called for a tighter fiscal policy while opposing nearly all the measures that were introduced towards one. Opposition members took the soft Thatcher line on South African sanctions all the time and kicked the Asian can fof all it was worth in the immigration debate of 1988,;,89. They attacked the environmental initiatives of the Government. On all the major, difficult reforms of the tl:lxation system-such as the fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax-they opposed them outright. These are the people who question leadership. The Leader of the Opposition is always good at having his say and clearing off, but he never likes to hear some of the replies. The fact is that more leadership has been shown on this side of the House by the Prime Minister and this Cabinet in terms of Australia's fundamental problems than has been shown by any postwar goverriment and Prime Minister. If we are still under pressure, with problems, in spite of the enormous energy which this Cabinet has turned towards them, it is a commentary only on the weight and dimension of the problems. The faCt is that the problem of a lack of productive capaci-y was 25 years in the making and was not and could not have been settled easily, no matter how much energy or leadership was applied to the task. Those are the facts. If Opposition members want to refute the facts, as some seem to, then they can try to do so. The Leader of the Opposition said there was nothing but contempt for me in the community. This was echoed by the Leader of the National Patty of Australia. The fact is that we on this side of the House had the courage to take the punchbowl away when the party got overheated. We did so, and we make no apologies for it. We had to prick the crazy balloon that had spending and lending at such unbelievable proportions that one entrepreneur in this country could lose $6 billion, and banks could find their balance sheets knocked around by unsavoury, uncommerciallending-the most recent example being the problems of John Fairfax and Sons. This is the sort of silliness that around which could have seen our national savings frittered away and a spending boom which was only being satisfied, in the main, by imports. A rational, responsible government would do something about that, and that is what we did. We went to an election with 20 per cent business rates and 17 per cent housing rates, as proof of our bona fides. But we are now getting them down and we will now get out of the problem. Inflation is now decelerating. Like the United States, Australia can have the opportunity of a decade of low inflationary growth, as Paul Volker gave America in 1980, by doing just the same thing-taking the punchbowl away when the party got overheated. The United States owes that man a great debt of gratitude. If we succeed in getting inflation down, then that will make all these actions worthwhile. Let .us get the cost of capital down, let us continue· to see investment rising, let us build the capital stock and let us trade our way out of our troubles with all the disciplines I mentioned-that is, a strong fiscal surplus, a high profit share, investment being maintained and low interest rates. In that there will be some unemployment, but nothing like the levels the Opposition gave us. Coming out the other side will be a much more stable, longer term growth prospect for Australians and their families in terms of employment and economic security. It means that we will at least be living within our means as an economy and not behaving as we were in the last couple of years of the 1980s. That is what. leadership is about. It is about calling halt to the silliness, getting society back on an even path and understanding our true situation. The Liberal Party gave 'us a set of First World expectations with a Third World income. We are about giving us a First World income to match our reasonable expectations. The Leader of the Opposition cannot ever say, whether he moves this censure motion in mirth, jest or just plain politicallight-heartedness, that there was was not leadership on this side of the House. He can say that the problems were great but, if he is honest, he can also say that this has been the only government that has been prepared to deal with them.",90
147,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"1 characterise the contribution by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to this debate as a fair square confirmation of the problems that this Government has. It took him eight minutes to come to any defence of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He then effectively read out eight questions which he said, somehow by assertion, were in support and defence of the Prime Minister. The first five or six of those happened to be on economic issues where we know that the Treasurer claims to be the dominant and authoritative influence over Government policy, He threw in a couple of other examples for good measure-South African sport, multiculturalism and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation-again with an economic twist. The truth is that the Government has intractable problems with policy and leadership-the sort of leadership that we need to deal with the problems and implement the solutions. The other aspect of the Treasurer's speech was th- denial of the problem. It is an extraordinary proposition that the Treasurer comes in here and talks about the participation rate. Three-quarters of Government members would not have the vaguest idea of what he, is talking about. For eight years he has got away with the smart reference to economic jargon and Government members sit there and nod their heads. I will spell out in layman's language what the Treasurer says on the participation rate. He says, 'If people aren't looking for a job, then we don't have an unemployment problem'. That is what he is saying. But people are looking for jobs. We have 700,000 people out of work and a lot more will be out of work in the months ahead. The Treasurer talks about the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD's reputation for commentary on the economic policies of governments is well known. I have not had the benefit of reading the document, but the front page of the Australian Financial Review this morning states: However, the OECD says, local unemployment will rise nearly 1 per cent to 7.1 per cent, remain at the same level in 1992. It is past 7.7 per cent. I have news for Treasurer. It will not remain at 7.7 per cent. It is obviously wrong. It is a benign assessment. I only assume-we will see the document when it comes out-that the assessment was made before the' OECD had the benefit of the September quarter gross domestic product (GDP) figures. The truth is that the Government's policies have failed. This Government's policies, the Hawke-Keating economic policies, are a dismal failure.' First there was the recession that we had to have. Then there was the unemployment we had to have. Now we await the resignation we have to have. I was not sitting watching the monitor and listening to the conversation between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I was no puppeteer between the Treasurer and the Prime Minister but I have a feeling that Bob probably said, 'Well; Paul, think about it over Christmas'. As the Treasurer surveys his political prospects this Christmas I have to say to him that they are about as bleak as are the prospects for many Australians as a result of his policy-induced recession. There are many backbenchers who have margins of 6, 7 or 8 per cent or less WI;lO know that any chance that they have of electoral survival is dependent upon the political death of the Treasurer. Mr Costelio-There's one over there; he's gone.",93
148,Mr REITH,PRIME MINISTER,"The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is one who factors his own· prospects into his own calculations. For those who cannot see this, the knowing smile on this man's face tells a big story. It is obvious that in economic policy the Treasurer's' loss on the communications policy just whetted the appetite of the new interventionists who in Cabinet are already clamouring for a loosening off of fiscal policy. in the new year. Those opposite have tremendous problems; leadership rivalries and tensions within their ranks which lead to paralysis and abdication of leadership responsibility, the principal bearer of that and responsibility being the Prime Minister. I think the Government has three the choices, all of which are unpalatable. Firstly, it could keep Hawke and Keating together. In this scenario Tom Jones will entertain us, Bob will entertain himself and John Hewson will entertain a landslide victory at the next election. Option two is that the Government keeps Hawke and ditches Keating. In this scenario Paul takes the Paris option-selling pencils and bootlaces at the Paris end of Collins Street in Melbourne. The new interventionists will take over; they will loosen fiscal icy, monetary policy and wages policy so that in 18 months we will have unemployment and interest rates rocketing in tandem together. The only ones to be entertained will be the press as Labor tears itself apart looking for a new scapegoat. The last option for the Government is that it ditches Hawke and embraces placebo drongo. One would have to live in another world to believe that that is a possibility. So it is not surprising that only people who seriously entertain that possibility are some in the Canberra press gallery. This Government is paralysed politically because we have a situation where the Treasurer, in front of a room full of journalists, attacked the Prime Minister. The only response the Prime Minister has is to meekly praise him for his technical skills as a Treasurer. As the recession becomes deeper the Prime Minister has actually reaffirmed existing policy when people on his own side know that the one thing the country needs urgently is a change in economic policy. What a mess this country is now in as a result. The truth is that there are no quick fix solutions. It will take this country a long time to drag itself out of the mire that the Government has deliberately created. I say to the Government that it has abdicated leadership but it is still the Government. There is no election due in Australia for a couple of years. We urge the Government,as it goes into the Christmas break and looks towards its policy position for next year, to take stock of Australia's economic circumstances, that it puts aside all this pretence about the state of unemployment and the state of the economy generally and sets about preparing a mini-Budget that really would give Australians a chance to see this economy turn around. The 1990 Budget speech was 16 pages long. In 16 pages of a mini-Budget in January 1991 the Government really «ould offer Australians some· hope of a,n economic recovery, a sustained recovery in due course. The late January 1991 miniBudget speech could be succinct or short pol- but for this country it could be a very important step. I urge upon .the Government in drafting that mini-Budget to take into account certain principles and priorities. If I was drafting that Budget the first four pages would give us an honest and realistic assessment of where we are in the economy. We would have a recognition that bankruptcies have jumped 29.2 per cent up to the September quarter, with figures in Victoria of 70.6 per cent. the The net value of farm production dropped 68 per cent on the Australian Bureau of Statistic's latest projections. We have had a 24 per cent drop in company profits. We have to factor that into the calculations and assessments. We have 698,000 people unemployed. That will be higher by the time the Government comes to prepare this statement. It ought to factor in the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group job series; and it might be in a position to have a better estimate of where GDP would be taking us in the December quarter. . In my realistic assessment, firstly, I would like to know what the outcome is of the first six months of the Federal Budget. That is important; we want the Budget outcomes. Secondly, we need a realistic assessment of where the State governments are going. We have seen a lot of reports about Victoria .. Its Budget is barely worth the paper it is written on. We ought t.o have a fair and honest statement as to the condition of the States Budgets. The particular implications of that are in the public sector borrowing requirement. Thirdly, we need a fair and honest statement of where the Australian economy is. We get all these conflicting statements of when the recovery is going to start, whether it be the first half of next year or the second half. We ought to have a proper assessment of that. The Government ought to give us the data upon which itmakes that assessment. . Fourthly, we need a realistic assessment of where the world economy is going. I received some advice the other day that the prediction of the Federal Re-erve Bank in the United States for GDP growth in the December quarter was minus 2.5 per cent. That is a massive figure. That has implications for Australians that ought to be factored into our calculations. Pages five and six would be particularly important. They could gather together a lot of the evidence that we already have from the Industries Commission. We could take the Treasurer's own draft White Paper on tax reform. We could take the Business Council of Australia's industrial relations study. We should gather up that material and arm ourselves with a convincing case for the reforms that I believe the Government ought to take. I do not think there is a great debate this country about the things that need to be done. If the Treasurer and I could sit down and have a fair and honest discussion between the two of us about what needs to be done, on most issues we would agree. Most economists in this country would agree. We could take as an example fiscal policy around the world. We get reports from Europe calling for a tightening of fiscal policy, and debates in the United States about the benefits of fiscal policy. New Zealand has used fiscal policy to bring about a sustained reduction in interest rates. Pages five and six would gather together the political support by pointing out the tremendous advantages that are available if the Government takes the reforms that we would propose. I would then move on to outline the Government's autumn legislative program to radically reform and pick up some of these proposals. Number one is' industrial relations reform. That would include right to work legislation. Employees would be entitled to negotiate with management to save their jobs and the businesses that provide them. We would provide a minimum hourly rate in the legislation and we would also enable workers to join or not join a union that would properly look after their interests, rather than the feathering of their own nest that we have seen much too much of in recent days from union leaders. The Government would publicly support none of this prevarication, this vagueness about their position. It would publicly support workers at SPC simply because it wanted to do a deal to save their jobs. It would introduce our directions and injunctions legislation. The legislation has actually been drafted for the Government. The Government could walk in tomorrow with that legislation and make a significant improvement in. this country's industrial relations system. We have drafted the legislation and it is available to the Government. In fact, some of the legislation the Government drafted itself prior to the 1987 election. It then dumped it because of the problems with section 45D. Page 8 of this mini-Budget at the end in of January would outline the Government's tax reform package. Treasury has already prepared a paper which would outline how to go about implementing a consumption tax. Treasury prepared it for the last election. It prepared it .on the basis that we would win and, if we did not win, on the basis that this Government would do the right thing when it got back into office. The one thing Treasury did not factor into its calculations was that the Treasurer would dump it purely for political reasons. This Treasurer loves to pull the levers. There is a lever that has the words 'tax' reform' on it. He ought to pull it; that would be of significant benefit.to the Australian economy. The consumption tax would be broadly based, with a uniform rate. It would zerorate exports; that would help our export performance. It would abolish the wholesale sales tax system. It would be prosaving. We need to build up Australian domestic savings so we can stop relying on the savings of foreigners, with the massive foreign debt that the Government has built up. We would be able to boost our export performance; that would be tremendous. We would be able to promote efficiency through the abolition of the wholesale sales tax system. And of course, as the Treasurer himself has on so many occasions acknowledged, it would shore up the income tax system, which would mean a real possibility of income tax relief for struggling pay as you earn taxpayers. That policy move would restore for the Treasurer some of his shattered credibility. Every time he stands and opposes tax reform, it triggers in people's minds the charge of hypocrisy because we know that in the past he has supported it. There are many other areas the Government would pick up in terms of reform. For example, it would look at fiscal policy and it would list expenditure cuts. The Government has our support. Back in 1982 when we were the Government and the present Government was in opposition, it stood against us on every reasonable, decent proposal. Life has changed. The Government ,has an Opposition saying, 'If you do the right thing, you will have our bipartisan support'. We have even given the Government a list of expenditure cuts upon which it could make a reasonable start. New Zealand is a good example the Government could point to to the Australian people of the benefits of fiscal reform. On page 11, we would have shipping and waterfront reform; page 12, communications reform; page 13, protection and tariff reform; page 14, privatisation; page 15, rural crisis reforms; and page 16, environment and a conclusion. If the Government did that, at February 1991 .this country could look to the future with some hope. This Government i1Y condemned for its abdication of leadership just at a time when our crisis is such that leadership is the one thing we r((ally do need.",94
149,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.23)I do agree on one thing with the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). He said in the course of his remarks that if he sat in a room for a time with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) he would come out in agreement with him on the economy. I think if he sat in a room with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hews0nj for a time, he would also come out in agreement with him on the economy. If he sat hi a room with the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and had a discussion about the economy, he would come out in agreement with him on the economy. If he sat in a room with me and had a discussion on the economy for any length of time, he would come out in agreement with me on matters related to the economy. The honourable gentleman in this place reflects the views of the last person who sat on him. It does not matter who it is, from what side of politics or from what elements of the academic or business communities, if he is sat on he will actually come out in agreement with their views. The problem for him arises when there is a gap between the public appearance and the time when the last person sat on him, because the memory is short and as distance develops between that meeting and his public appearance, problems occur. Problems occur for him, as we now know, in his various press conferences, when he has come out with a whole series of views on what he would do in the middle of this recession with the $3 billion he wishes to cut off outlays. I will get onto that a little later. I want to start here by talking about censure motions and their role in this place. There can be no doubt whatsoever that the censure motion in this chamber has been deeply devalued over the last few years. I was interested to note the other day, when Maggie Thatcher resigned from leadership of the Tory Party and the Labour Party in Britain moved a censure motion in the House of Commons, that that was the first censure motion moved in the House since 1985-a five-year period. It was not as though Maggie had governed all that effectively over the previous five years. She had had numerous ministerial resignations in that five-year period, based on serious disagreement on economic policy. The reason the Opposition did not move censure motions between 1985 and 1990 is not because it did not have grounds to attack the Tory Party-it had plenty-but be. cause it had common sense about the way in Which Parliament is used, common sense about what happens with censure motions. ' When anyone moved a censure motion on Bob Menzies when he was in government, he would immediately suspend the sitting of the House. He would reconvene it the next day and then debate the censure motion all day. The reason we do not do things like that any more in this place is that we get a censure motion every d'arned week from the Opposition. If we were to do that, the business of government simply would not be done. The extent to which the censure motion has ceased to be serious in this place is reflected by the way in which honourable members opposite moved that motion and canvassed those issues. They were unbelievably discursive and unfocused. They were unbelievably hilarious in the way they presented themselves and then carried on subsequently. I think if there are any people listening to the debate in this place, they will not have had conveyed to them the level of hilarity with which the Opposition has treated this. , If there is any concern out there, as there ought to be, for those who will front a bleak Christmasand there is no question that some of our fellow citizens will do, so-they will take no comfort either ftom the personal behaviour of members of the Opposition in this place or from the poliCies they are putting forward as alternatives. The people have only on-hope and that is the only hope they have had since 1983. That is this Government and its continuation in office and the policies we already have in place to bottom out this recession and get back ,onto a growth path. As I said, the policies are already in place, provided they are not interfere? with on the way through by the OPPOSItion. What hypocrisy it is for the Opposition to come into this place and say it is concerned about the situation in which the unemployed find themselves and at the same time to advocate a position and a series of cuts that will both increase unemployment and deprive' people of unemployment benefits. There is no proposition in the Opposition's policy proposals for serious training programs for the unemployed. There is no question in life these days that anybody can really aspire in any industry to a continual life employment in that industry. Technological change is so dramatic in our manufacturing sector that everybody, even those who enjoy the greatest longevity of employment, can a-­ ticipate no more than 15 to 20 years ,m one place. Training is absolutely critical, and yet in terms of the Opposition's proposals for cuts, not only will they not get unemployment benefits, but they will not get training benefits either. We have here an Opposition that operates on the philosophy that only the poor will die economically. That is the philosophy of the Opposition when it comes to operating ecoJ?omic policy in th-s place, but it comes m here as though It IS the greatest advocate of assistance to the poor and needy in this community, that all that really needs to happen is for - s to let .it into office to put a consumptIon tax m place-its particular version of micro-ec-­ nomic reform-and all would be well m con- the community. All we need to do is to cut $3 billion off outlays. Originally, the $3 billion to be cut off outlays was to be added to the surplus. More recently, the Opposition has talked about putting it in tax cuts. What another obscenity that particular proposition is at this time. That is $3 billion to be taken from the poor, the pensioners the unemployed, and given to the wealthy. That is the proposition if it is going to be $3 billion exchanged for a tax cut. That is the current policy prescription it is now urging the Government to adopt. The wealthy, of course, are more likely than the poor to spend it on imports: The poor, not having a great deal of dISC!etionary expenditure to hand, almost IJ?variably spend what they have on what IS that produced in thi- c<?untry. Th-t}s yvh-t the Opposition mVItes us to Jom It m supporting. It says that it will give us the maximum possible assistance in passing a tax cut to the rich and in taking it from the poor. We will not be introducing legislation to that effect in mini-Budgets or anything else, but we will be exposing the fact that that happens to be the Opposition's position. The Leader of the Opposition last week reminded me of no-one in this place, historically or anywhere else, more than Charlie Blunt when he went through the process of wandering around Victoria, dropping into the odd factory here and there, making his pronouncements and saying, 'I think we might havel95 seats at the next election and we might have a majority in the Senate and it will be pretty good in 21/2 years time'. I remember Charlie Blunt sitting aver there. Before the last election he used to point at us all along the front bench. As we confronted an election with the guts to sell a hard policy to people, he would say, 'You're gone. You're putting hard policies-you're gone'. He used to say it to the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch). He used to say it to me. He used to go through all our backbenchers, all of whom held marginal seats, and say, 'You're gone. You're gone. We are going to be in office'. The then Leader of the Opposition and the now Leader of the Opposition used to spend their entire time sitting around, plotting how they would take office, where they would be situated; where exactly their backsides were going to be at any particular point in time and what orders would be issued to what section of the bureaucracy. They spent three or four months doing that and they are back at it again. Let me tell the Opposition something about the next 2112 years, in so far as one can make any predictions: none of us can be absolutely certain when this recession will bottom out and when the upturn will be. But we can all be reasonably certain that it will be by the time the next election comes around and there will be an appreciation of the fact that the hard policies that have been put in place are worth the candle in terms of what subsequently emerges. Then we will be debating the Opposition on some different issues. We will be debating the subject of the Opposition's consumption tax. Let me tell the Opposition what its consumption tax means in political terms and not just economic terms. It means that sales tax on Rolls Royces falls. It means that tax on. bread rises. It will be a very simple thing: if one wants to purchase a Rolls Royce, one votes Liberal. If one believes one needs to feed one's family at a reasonable price, one votes Labor. This will be a useful point to run on. Now the Opposition says, 'Well, of course, the New Zealanders introduced consumption tax and we have that as our . shining example. That is all we have to do'. Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition this: the New Zealand consumption tax has increased twice since it was put in place. So whatever level one sets-Mr Reith-It was increased once.",97
150,Mr BEAZLEY,PRIME MINISTER,"I am sorry-once. It was introduced and it has been increased once since then. When the Opposition goes to the public, cites its New Zealand example and tells the people that this is a once only and that is all that will be put in place, we will say something about that too. We will say: 'The first one you see will not necessarily be the last one you see when it comes to increases'. Likewise, even though it is claimed that adjustments will be made in the income tax rate, as far as New Zealanders were concerned, the rates of income tax were also increased after that consumption tax was put in place. Members of the Opposition should not think that they will get away with meandering around this country proposing a tax on the poor and a tax reduction for the wealthy. They should not even assume that they will be able to argue that this is a one-off solution in the taxation area. As the poorer sections of our community confront a 15 per cent increase in their Telecom charges, a 15 per cent increase in their charges for food, a 15 per cent increase in their charges for clothing, they will know that there will be one set who will benefit from this-that is, everybody who currently has an obligation in the capital gains tax area. When the poor pay for their bread they will be paying for massive tax benefit to those who own sets that have been accumulating value over the past 10 years. This will useful thing for us to discuss on the tion trail and we look forward to it, we will be discussing it. Then we come to the area of microeconomic reform, which is farcical as the Opposition's policy in this area is concerned. It is .we who have grappled with micro-economic reform, not the position. Th,e Opposition has a view that declaration constitutes policy; argument by assertion. The Opposition does not derstand that in the area of micro-ecoif nomic reform, it has to break down massive barriers; it cannot simply legishave late those problems away. It is obligated to a most intense process of discussion with people whom it has never seen, about issues it has never thought about, about the detail of policies that it has never even come to consider in the micro-ecotle nomic reform area. I am interested to note two areas that have been mentioned here today: one is the area of telecommunications. Let just read to the Opposition what the . vocate of reform in telecommunications, as far as magazines are. concerned, has had to say about the Government's teleopportunity, communications policy. Australian Commembers munications, December/January 1990-91, states: Now that the Government has detailed its prehensive and commendable telecommunicapleasure. tions policy, the all-important nextstage of the process is to guide the required legislative through Parliament .' _ _ With the stakes so it's for this reason that the Coalition Parties should bite the bullet and support the Governsition ment's measures. . , After all, the package of measures is genuinely pro-competitiv- and will lead to the type of environment that the Coalition has pledged to about. The great danger we face is that p.olitical grandstanding will once again triumph over common sense. In fact,· in the judgment of this journal and in the judgment of anyone who serition ously knows anything about telecommunquite ications, the propositions a put forward represent the most competiastive framework for telecommunications internationally. There is one difference be a between the Government and the Oppoelecsition on the issue of telecommunications and and that is the question of the privatisation of Telecom. Let me tell the Opposition this: I am very happy to have that as far debate with the Opposition too. There are many industrial issues that one could argue about relating to the Opquestion of privatisation of Telecom, but I will tell the Opposition' one argument that will be unbeatable. If one tries to unprivatise what we are trying to privatise, one tries to get investment for new industries in this country-the firms that to capitalise themselves on the Australian stock market-and one then dumps a $20 billion obligation on a stock market whose largest capital raising in the last five years has been $700m in one year, one will, for no good purpose at all, throtinvestment in industries which need to develop. That would be the result; the only alternatives would be to have a fire sale or to sell overseas. Those are the only me alternatives and to do either of them adwould not simply be negligent, which the first policy would be, it would be criminal. The Opposition will not be given that but let me assure honourable that they will be given the opportunity to debate that matter. Before the next election comes around we will comwelcome a discussion on that area with When we get down to the question of a changes third runway for the Sydney (Kingsfordhigh, Smith) Airport, we realise that the Oppohad no solutions there. It favoured a close spaced parallel runway, which would not have increased the usage of Sydney airport any more than the measures we have taken. The propositions that bring we are arguing about will make a serious difference in that area. The Opposition has treated this censure motion with great levity. We have chosen to answer the Opposition seriously because we have answers and the Opposidoes not; we need to make that Doint clear. to the Australian public, and that we have . we have. I move: That the question be now be put. Question put. The House , divided. (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Ayes. Noes . Majority NA Baldwin, P. J. Aldred, K. J. Beazley, K. C. Anderson, J. D. Beddall, D. P.

NA  Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following reports: 306th report, Finance minutes; and 307th report, Activities 1989-90. Ordered that the reports be, printed.  ports I have tabled today report on the finance minutes of the Public Accounts Committee and on the Committee's activities for the year 1989-90. Firstly, the 306th report on the finance minutes conSinclair, I. MCC. Smith, W. L. tains the formal responses to reports of the Committee which were received by Sullivan, K. J. Taylor, W. L. the Committee during 1990. The responses deal with a variety of issues, inTuckey, C. W. Webster, A. P. cluding the management of the Antarctic Division, guidelines for the preparation Woods, Bob Wooldridge, M. R. L. of departmental annual reports, the engagement of external consultants by Commonwealth departments, safety principles for explosives and the Commonwealth's offsets program. The presentation of this report is a means of making available to the Parliament and to other interested persons responses to recommendations made by the Committee in its reports. The fact that the Committee has presented these responses in the 306th report does not mean and should not be seen as meaning that the Committee will not examine them in greater detail in the future, and it certainly does not indicate any reduction in the importance with which the Committee views its formal response process, which is known as the finance minute process. The Committee believes that the overall process of accountability is aided by the prompt tabling of the finance minutes. This gives parliamentarians and the public alike an opportunity to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the responses by the various departments to particular concerns and recommendations of the Committee. Secondly, the 307th report, the report of activities for 1989-90, is the second report that I have tabled. It is a report of the 'activities of our Committee for that time frame. The primary purpose of it is ACCOUNTS to inform the Parliament of the Committee's various activities across a number of the inquiries. The report deals with the work of the sixteenth Joint ComIllittee of Public Accounts, which was chaired by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Tickner), and also with the work of the current Committee. Of great interest to the Committee during the year was the presentation to the Parliament of responses by both the Government and the Auditor-General to the 296th report of the Committee entitled The Auditor General: Ally of the People and Parliament-Reform of the Australian Audit Office. I am heartened by the number of recommendations in the 296th report that have received a favourable response from the Government and the Auditor-General. I note that both the Australian Audit Office and the Department of Finance have begun working on drafting instructions for new legislation recommended by the Committee to replace the existing Audit Act. As the reports tabled by the Committee in 1989 covered a wide range of subjects, so too do the Committee's current inquiries. They include inquiries into the business migration program and the visitor entry visa, the annual reporting guidelines for statutory authorities, the Department of Defence's supply computer systems, research and development in the public and private sectors, accounts set up in relation to the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and an inquiry into the social responsibilities of Commonwealth statutory authorities and government business enterprises. It is important to note that with each of these inquiries there is a focus on issues of accountability and value for money. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to acknowledge with very great appreciation the contribution made to its work by the members of our Committee secretariat and the Committee's advisers. Additionally, I thank on behalf of the Committee all those who have given assistance during the year, particularly officers from the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office. In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to thank retiring members of the sixteenth Committee and also to mention the new members of the current Committee. I am pleased to see that eight members of the previous Committee-the Vice-Chairman, Senator Watson, Senator Bishop, Senator Giles, Mr Aldred, Mr Fitzgibbon, Mr Langmore, Mr Nehl and Mr Les Scott-were reappointed to the seventeenth Committee. In addition to myself, the new members welcomed to the Committee at the beginning of the Thirty-sixth Parliament were the Hon. Janice Crosio, Mr Kerr, Senator the Hon. Margaret Reynolds, Mr Shack, Mr Somlyay, and Senator Schacht. I suspect that many outside the Committee do not appreciate the significant amount of work and time devoted to the Public Accounts Committee's workload. Without the dedication and contributions the members of the Committee in their very busy lives and by our staff, the public accountability of the Commonwealth's activities would surely suffer. I commend these reports to the House. NA NA",102

I refer to my colleagues the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott), the honourable. member for St George (Mr Dubois), the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), Senator Flo BjelkePetersen and the leader of the. delegation, Senator. the Hon. Kerry Sibraa. Australia was very capably represented also by the Clerk of the House, Mr Alan Browning, at the Society of Clerks at the Table; Mr Fred Peppinck, senior adviser to the President; and Mr Kieran Schneemann, who was secretary to the delegation. The organisation, involvement and outcome of the Australian participation in this forum are indicative of the value of the involvement of members of parliament in what some observers irreverently dub as talkfests. The international community is faced with momentous problems of armed conflict, trade imbalance, debt, poverty and abuse of human rights. The political component of government invariably exacerbates these ills. Theryfore, I congratulate the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for offering an opportunity for elected representatives of parliaments representing all political spectrums to talk to their contemporaries in other Commonwealth nations with a view to formulating joint cooperative strategies to address problems common to their electorates. The thirty-sixth conference addressed a range of key issues, as listed in the report, which are considered when the agenda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is being planned. In particular, I congratulate members of the Commonwealth - of Australia delegation who worked in an enthusiastic and bipartisan manner to present a cohesive and informed contJ;ibution, each. one contributing in an individual manner and taking leading positions in plenary and panel discussions and in the informal discussions and lobbying which are part and parcel of a successful conference, Members of the Government and the Opposition in this Parliament worked very well together and some firm friendships were made. I extend the delegation's appreciation of the offices of the delegation's secretary,' Mr Kieran Schneemann, who went beyond the bounds of duty in dffering support' to the members of the delegation. The value of international cOl,1ferences lies not only in the· presentation of national viewpoints and the recommendations that come from their debate in pl€:mary, but also in the less easily evaluated longer term effects of legislators from diverse cultural backgrounds making personal contacts which give insights into conditions faced by other peoples which cannot be gained from the ptinted word. One cannot visit Africa and come away untouched by a greater knowledge of the achievements and the problems of a people of great dignity and strength of character. The Zimbabwean Government provided a program which enabled' man'y such contacts to be made. I wish to place on record the Australian delegation's warm appreciation of the rich cultural contact, the friendships and the sight of the beauty of Zimbabwe afforded through the hospitality of the Zimbabwean Government and the Zimbabwe-n people.",104
157,Mr TAYLOR,PARLIAMENTARY CONFERENCE,"by leave-It is with much pleasure that I rise to support my fellow delegate the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) in speaking to the report of the thirty-sixth Commonwealth Parliamentar;y Conference in Zimbabwe. Like the honourable member, I congratulate the Government of that country on its hospitality and on the smooth organisation. and administration of a very fruitful 10 days. I also congratulate the Zimbabwean people for their never-ending desire to please all delegates and for their warm welcome to what is indeed a very beautiful country. I also acknowledge my other fellow delegates in this place, in the other place and in State legislatures for their friendship and support, The Australian contribution was a very strong one, whether on the floor of the general assembly on such topics as apartheid, the environment, women's issues and the future of the Commonwealth, in seminar sessions on human rights and immigration topics, or in the social dialogue so important to such occasions. I am thankful for the privilege of having been part of such a friendly, bipartisan and effective national team. I also thank the accompanying spouses who were an integral part of our team. Inevitably, every conference has its highs; equally, it has some lows. While not wishing to denigrate any individual, I must refer briefly to one such Australian low which in my view could have been avoided. I refer specifically to the unnecessary competition between two Australian delegates for . the position of Chairman of the prestigious Association's executive committee. That competition, direct and indirect, with its attendant lobbying pressures, left many of our Commonwealth cousins wondering about the sense of purpose of our national character. In my view, and I suspect in the view of all of our delegates, our international standing has suffered as a result of that competition, particularly in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association forum. I can only hope that it will be a very temporary setback. It seems to me that on this occasion personal ambition overrode national unanimity. I hope that we have learned a lesson and can get on with continuing to make the very substantial Australian contribution without which the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association would be the poorer. I thank the House for its time.

158,Mr BEDDALL,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 7 and 8 (1990). The tariff proposals which I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. Customs Tariff Proposals No.7, which will operate on and from the twenty-fourth day of December 1990, contain the following changes to schedule 5 to the Customs Tariff Act 1987: - an alteration to delete the word 'woven' from sub-Note 1 (c); and - the definitions for handicrafts and industrial crafts relating to textiles, clothing and footwear have been clarified in the rewording of l),ote two 'to accord with the original policy intent for these goods. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 8 formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notice published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette during the recent recess of Parliament. The changes implement the Government's decision on Industry Commission Report No.3, Aids and Appliances for People with Disabilities, in relation to wheelchairs, defibrillators and heart pacemakers. On and from the first day of January 1991 these goods may be imported into Australia free of duty. SummlJries of alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjourned. NA",106

161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The honourable member may proceed. Mr REITHI will not detain the House for long. During Question Time today the Treasurer (Mr Keating) received a dorothy dixquestion on the subject of a doorstop interview that I gave recently on the question' of interest rates. Quite frankly, the Treasurer's response was very garbled. He seemed rather confused on his.own policy. He made certain claims .about the interpretations which he placed on' the transcript. I simply make the transcript available-I would table it if tllat were appropriate-for anybody who has any doubts about our policy position. STAGE 1 REDEVELOPMENT, SINGLETON, NEW SOUTH WALES Reference to Public Work& Committee Mr BEDDALL ,(Rankin-Minister for Small Busin,ess and Customs) (5.18)-:-I move:. That, in· accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Stage 1 redevelopment, Singleton, New South Wales. Singleton Barracks near the township of Singleton iri New South Wales was acquired in 1941 and a hutted camp was constructed during World War II. Some existing facilities have been around since the base was first established while other temporary facilities were constructed in 1965. From 1965 to 1973 these facilities were used by the 3rd Training Battalion to train national servicemen in recruit and infantry skills. With the cessation' of national service and the reorganisation of the Australian Army, the infantry centre was relocated to Singleton from Ingleburn to occupy these vacated temporary facilities. Servicy personnel currently total 434 at Singleton .. It is expected that the military strength will not vary significantly in the foreseeable future. Student numbers average 478. However, these numbers vary significantly throughout the training year dependent upon course programming and the availability of staff. The proposed redevelopment of the base is aimed at upgrading existing facilities to . provide sufficient and appropriate train. ing, working and living accommodation for functions currently undertaken at the base and to clear the way to reorganise Singleton range by relocating existing, centralised range infrastructure of small arms ranges and buildings. . These works. will form stage one of the base redevelopment and will specifically involve the construction of new living accommodation for living-in staff and students, improved training efficiency of depot company working facilities and the construction of new range control facilities on Singleton range. The limit of cost estimates for these works is $29.3m at November 1990 prices. It is planned that the work will go to tender in 1991, with completion expected in 1994. I table selected drawings of the proposed stage 1 redevelopment work at Singleton and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA COMPUTER CENTRE, BRUCE, ACT Reference to Public Works Committee",107
162,Mr BEDDALL,AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS SERVICE,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Purpose built computer centre for Australian Customs Service, Bruce, ACT. Of all the motions I move today on behalf of the Minister. for Administrative Servmove: ices (Senator Bolkus), this is probably the one I am most pleased to move, as it Public relates to my own portfolio. This proposal is for the construction of a purpose built computer centre for the Australian Cuseration toms Service to be located on Commonsives wealth land at Bruce in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). The new building will provide accomsive modation for the new' technology puter equipment being purchased by the Australian Customs Service as part of its computer equipment upgrading project. will replace existing mainframe accomstorehouses modation which is currently located in the Edmund Barton building. This acples. commodation has potentially serious securityand operational risk and will not adequately accommodate the new coming puter equipment acquired by the Austraings' lian Customs Service. The scope of works provides for the construction of a two-storey building with approximately 3,780 square metres gross floor area, reasonable parking facilUnited ities for 30 cars, landscaping and associOrganisation ated site works and services. A computer mainframe will be located on the upper buildings. floor, while, plant, loading dock, storage, staff amenities and minimal office accomnot modation will be located on the ground floor level. The Bruce site, adjacent to the Fern Hill Technology Park development, was found to be the most appropriate and effective location for the meeting of needs now and in the future. The limit of cost estimate for the proposal is $16.9m at November 1990 prices, excluding profesfacilities. sional fees, construction contjngencies and escalation. Construction is anticipated to commence in June 1991, with the works to be completed by Dece-ber 1992. I table drawings of the proposed works and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. EXPLOSIVES STOREHOUSES, MYAMBAT, NSW Reference to, Public Works Committee",108
163,Mr BEDDALL,AUSTRALIAN CUSTOMS SERVICE,"1 That, in accordance with the provisions of the Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for ,considand report: Construction of major explostorehouses at Myambat, New South Wales. The work currently before the House is the first stage of the Army's major explostorehouse project-or MESH""Pcomplanned for Myambat near Denman in New South Wales. The proposal will initiate the Army's need to store explosive It ordnance in earth covered explosives in accordance with North Atl,antic Treaty Organisation safety princiExisting facilities at Myambat were constructed during World War II and durthe' 1960s. The World War II buildare no longer suitable for the secure storage of ammunition and present a continuing maintenance problem. The 1960s buildings are limited in their capacity to of store some explosives under current Nations and North Atlantic Treaty regulations which were introduced after the construction of the As a result, these existing facilities are sited to optimise the storage of the most hazardous natures of ammunition. This has resulted in Myambat not being able to store significant quantities of hazard division 1.1 ammunition. Therefore ,the basis of these proposed works is to provide more efficient and suitable storage for explosives, in accordance with rel,evant guidelines, and improved associated ' The explosive storehouse complex consists of three major areas: the explosives storage area, the non-explosives area and the administration-camp area. Works will' be undertaken in each of these three areas, including the construction of new explosives storehouses and upgrading of the access road and railway siding. A new returned produce store, depot store, support building and new accommodation for all ranks will be constructed. Phase 1 will see the minor upgrading of the existing kitchen and mess facilities pending their replacement in phase 2. Associated engineering services will be undertaken, existing water and sewerage services will be upgraded and improved road works will also be included. The project is expected to cost $34.4m at October 1990 prices, but will be split into two phases. Phase A is estimated to cost $23.4m and phase B $11 m. Pending approval by Parliament, it is hoped to go to tender in April 1991, with completion' of phase A taking about four years and phase B a further two years. 1 table selected drawings of the proposed works and 1 commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. HOUSING AND RECREATION "" FACILITIES, KONEDOBU, PORT NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",108
164,Mr BEDDALL,MORESBY,"I am certain the Standing Committee on Public Works will be busy in the Christmas recess! I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carried out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of 4S housing units, reation facilities on 2.7 hectares of land at Konedobu, Port Moresby. The proposed work recommended by the Standing Committee on Public Works is the construction for the Department of Administrative Services of 45 secure housing units and associated recreation facilities to be occupied and used by staff of the Australian High Commission and Department of Defence staff in Port Moresby. The need for secure housing for High Commission and Defence staff in Port Moresby has been recognised since the early 1980s, when the Commonwealth embarked on a program of building seCure accommodatiot:J,. Since that time, residences have been constructed in the form of apartments for staff in Pandora Crescent and Port Road and houses on Tuaguba Hill. A secure block of apartments for Defence staff is under construction in Airvos Avenue. This leaves a requirements for 45, staff residences-15 for the High Commission and 30 for Defence-to securely house the remaining Commission and Defence staff in Port Moresby. The most effective way to provide staff and their dependants with secure accommodation at an appropriate standard, including reasonable provision for privacy, is in a compound such as the proposed development. The Government of Papua New Guinea has provided a 2.7 hectare site at Koiledobu in the Granville district of Port Moresby for the construction of staff accommodation. The land is held on a 99year lease. The layout and building design will contribute to the development of a village-type community with spaces for access, private gardens and a family park where children and adults can meet freely without the hindrance of security systems. The size of the residences will range from the smaller, category 2, junior level units to larger, category 4, four-bedroom units. Recreation facilities will include a 25-metre swimming pool, a wading pool, a squash court, two tennis courts, a barbecue area and a covered recreation building with kitchen, servery, change and associated recrooms and toilets. Extensive input has been provided to the development of the proposal from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence, as well as from unions and staff associations. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is proposed to call tenders from pre-qualified contractors in May 1991, with construction to commence early in 1991-92. The construction period is estimated to be 18 months. The limit of cost estimate of the project, as presented to the Public Works Committee, is $16.592m at July 1990 prices, with an estimated completion cost of $21.152m. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the .House.",109
165,Mr HAWKER,MORESBY,"The Opposition, while not opposing the motion to build this accommodation, finds it a matter of some regret and feels that the Government should have said something more about the associated problems in the context of the fact that in this country what has been described as 'secure accommodation' really should be interpreted correctly as 'bunker-style accommodation'. The reason I draw attention to this is that I think that the Government has been found to be somewhat negligent over the need to build bunker-style accommodation. This was highlighted in the Auditor General's report on the aid program for Papua New Guinea. Looking at the reason why this bunker-style accommodation needs to be built, first of all, it is a matter of some· regret that the law and order situation in Papua New Guinea is such that there is a need to have this style of accommodation for expatriates of Australia. Papua New Guinea is obviously one of our most important neighbours. We have had considerable involvement in that country both before and since its independence, and there is considerable Australian investment in the area. If the law and order situation deteriorates, it could adversely affect that investment, to the detriment of both Papua New Guinea and Australia. In this context, returning to the findings of the Auditor-General on the aid program to Papua New Guinea, a number of comments are rather disturbing in that they point out that the Government could and might have made a more constructive contribution to assisting the law and order situation in Papua New Guinea before' we reached this position. Paragraph 1.3.5 of the report of the Auditor-General· finds that Australia has failed to influence the Papua New Guinea . Government to increase the routine budget for the Papua New Guinea constabulary so as to support the Australian project to assist the Papua New Guinea constabulary to improve its capability. If we look at the words of the Auditor General, we find: The lack of an adequate infrastructure· can jeopardise not only a project which is directly de-. pendent but can also threaten other unrelated projects. It goes on to point out: Despite its strenuous efforts and considerable untied budget aid, Australia has failed to influence the PNG Government to· increase the level of its funding to the constabulary. So the Government has quite a lot to answer for on that point. On the second point-one that no doubt is dear to the Government's heart-paragraph 3.5.8 of the Auditor-General's report mentions the Australian-style centralised wage fixation system and the contribution that it has made to an unrealistic urban wage level that has tended to create urban law and order problems. Looking at that paragraph in more detail, we see that the Auditor-General makes it very clear when he says: PNG wage determination has been profoundly influenced by Australian centralised wage fixing. One can think back to who some of the . individuals might have been. One springs to mind immediately, and I am sure that all honourable members will remember a certain gentleman, in those days from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, going-Mr Hollis- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am loath to interrupt the honourable member but, as I understand it, this motion concerns a reference to the Parliament for the construction of buildings in Papua New Guinea. It has nothing to do with the Papua New Guinea wage fixing. system or various officials of the Australian trade union movement. .So I really do think that the honourable member should confine his remarks to the motion before the House, which refers to approval for this construction in Papua New Guinea and nothing else. It is a very tight reference to the House. The honourable member should not be permitted to wander all over the place on this reference.",110
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MORESBY, There is no point of order.,111
167,Mr HAWKER,MORESBY,"I was talking about some of the problems which, regrettably, have occurred in Papua New Guinea and on which the present Government has failed to act with sufficient influence whereby the need to build this bunkerstyle accommodation could have been avoided. Mr Rocher-Who was it you were talking about? Mr HAWKERI was saying that wage determination in Papua New Guinea had been profoundly influenced by the Australian centralised wage fixing system and that a certain individual well known to all honourable members probably could and should accept that he was very much involved. Mr Beale-Who was that? Mr HAWKERWe are talking about the current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke).",111
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MORESBY,"I ask the honourable member to address the \ssue before the chair. Mr HAWKERThe Auditor-General's report goes on to point out that the Australian Government could have exerted more influence with respect to some of the difficulties in Papua New Guinea. On the centralised wage fixing system, the report says that, in' practice, it has led to greatly reduced income equality within the Papua New Guinea community. In fact, it has achieved the exact opposite to that which some on the other side would have expected: The report goes on to say: This has encouraged rural-urban drift, increased the reserve price of rural wages and contributed to urban unemployment and widespread law and order problems. That is why the Australian Government is now in the position of having to build bunker-style accommodation. It is with some regret that this is necessary. As I say, I think that the Australian Government has failed to exercise its duty properly in ensuring that some of the aid that was given was directed in the correct way. As the Auditor-General pointed out, there are two very clear instances where the Australian Government has done less than sufficient in trying to avoid the position in which we now find ourselves. Question resolved in the affirmative.

169,Mr BEDDALL,BILL,"I move: . That the requested amendment be agreed to. The original amendment contained in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill was designed to correct an anomaly in the tariff by applying excise equivalent rates. of duty to alcoholic beverage mixtures of wine, orange juice and .vodka. Subsequent to the passage of the Bill through the House of Representatives, the Australian. Customs Service was informed that the anomaly in the tariff also allowed duty free entry of a variety of other mixtures of fruit juices, ciders, , It is long standing Government policy that the customs tariff applies a revenue component equivalent to the excise rate, in addition to any protective duty component. The amendment contained in the Bill is too narrow in its coverage of imported alcoholic beverages and fails to levy the excise equivalent rate on the total alcohol content of the wine component. The amendment now requested will redress the anomalies and achieve the Government's objectives.

170,Mr SNOWDON,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (5.40)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Two significant measures in the amendments to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 were' agreed to in the I other place. Firstly, the amendments exempt loan agreements with authorised lenders from being taken into account in determining to what extent the lender, or a person in a position to exercise control of the lender, is in a position to exercise control of a media company. This amendment is necessary because under the Broadcasting Act 1942 the normal financialcovenants in loan agreements with media companies to protect the interests of the lender would be sufficient to deem a lender to be in a position to exercise control of the media company. A person in a position to exercise control of a commercial radio or television licensee has a prescribed interest and would, accordingly, be subject to the 60 per cent population reach rule and commercial radio limits, the cross media rules and the 'one to a market' rule. Without the exemption in the amendments, severe constraints would be placed on the lending activities of banks and other financial institutions. Lenders cannot be expected to forgo normal precautions to protect their interests when to dealing with broadcasters. Neither can severe limitations be placed on bank lending. The amendments place a limitation on the exemption for lenders from being taken to be in a position of control. A lender loses the exemption if it exercises actual control in such a way as to interfere with programming or with the ability of a licensee to comply with the conditions of the licence. This will ensure that licensees are protected if a lender attempts to exercise control in a way that affects the ability of the licensee to provide the service it is licensed to provide. The second major measure in the amendments is the provision to enable the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to give directions to protect a licensee at any time. The Tribunal's current power, to give protective directions in relation to a licensee, is limited to situations where a transaction concerning the licensee has - ccurred which 'is subject to Tribunal approval. There may be situations, however, where it is necessary for the Tribunal, in the pu1;>lic interest, to give protective directions when no such transaction has occurred. The amendments ensure that the Tribunal may at any time give directions for the purpose of preventing the doing of any act or thing likely to have an adverse effect on, firstly, the ability of the licensee to comply with the licence conditions and, secondly, the operations of the licensee in providing the service pursuant to the licence or the selection or provision of programs to be broadcast. Some other· minor measures are contained in the amendments. One of the amendments will help streamline administrative procedures for the granting of leave of absence for Tribunal members and associate members. Other minor amendments will clarify the operation of . the joint control provision in the Bill and remedy a technical defect in the operation of a transitional provision relating to the increase in the licence renewal period from three to five,years.",114
171,Mr BEALE,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT,"I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the tabl-, to convey to the Minister for. Transport and Communications '(Mr Beazley) my appreciation of the fact that he has provided me with a briefing paper on this matter. The Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990, was debated in the House in around June this year and has spent some time getting through the Senate, where the amendments that we are considering today were considered on 11 December this year. In the Senate, the coalition raised no objections to the proposed Government amendments-not to the mechanical ones, not to the proposal to exempt loan agreements with authorised lenders from consideration in determining whether the lender or a person in control of the lender is in a position to control a media company, and not to those parts of I the amendments that clearly and forcibly state that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's powers are not tied to events and that the Tribunal will be able to give prospective directions, which the honourable gentleman at the table really did not give much attention to. Accordingly, we raise no objection's to the amendments that the Government proposes. For those who query the need for these powers, in the briefing note the Minister gave to me he said: I say simply that they should look at what has happened to our broadcasters in the past year. I accept the Minister's invitation to look at what has happened to our broadcasters in the past year. What has happened is that we have two television operators in receivership. In the general media area, radio is in a depressed state and John Fairfax Ltd is in receivership. Even in this morning's Age I noticed a report that News Ltd has missed its self-imposed deadline on its debt restructuring. So the question is: why has this come about? I now return to the television industry. There has been a lot of talk about blaming what has happened in the television industry on risk taking and bad management. That may be partly true, but it seems to me that the main contributor to the troubles in the television industry is the Government's deliberate, long term, high interest rate policy and the failure of its economic management, which was clearly spelt out in forceful and excellent speeches today in the censure motion against the Prime Ministe! .(Mr Hawke) by the Leader of the Opposl-IOn (Dr Hewson), t-e Leader. of tJ;1e NatIOnal Party of ' Austraha (Mr TIm FIsch--) and the !?eputy Leader of the OppOSItIOn (Mr ReIth). These high interest rates are the major contributing factor to the difficulty in which the television industry finds itself and, accordingly, are the real reason that these amendments have to be brought before the Comrriittee today. I say in passing that, although Australia's interest rates have come down, in real terms they are still among the highest in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. As a result of the Government's deliberate high interest rates policy,we now have a government induced recession; that is, the recession that we had to have; and, accordingly, these are the amendments that we had to have.

The amendments, which were moved on behalf of the Government in the Senate, fix the proposed date of commencement of the Debits Tax Termination Bill 1990 to be 1 January 1991 instead of a date to be proclaimed. This will ensure that the transfer of the debits tax from the Commonwealth to the States and Territories occurs on 1 January 1991. 1 commend the amendments to the Committee.",116
173,Mr ROCHER,DEBITS TAX TERMINATION BILL,"The Opposition does not take issue with the Government. We do not even take issue with the fact that the principal measure is to transfer what was known as the bank accounts debits tax, aptly known as the BAD tax, to the States, thereby handing the States a poisoned chalice in the form of taxation from which they will expect to gain revenue in the same way that they expected revenue from payroll taxes and the like when a similar measure was taken in that' connection some years ago. Whilst the principal measure itself does what we advised against in the earlier debate in this chamber, we do not necessarily take issue with that, except to point out to those responsible in State governments that they have something of a poison chalice, as 1I have already indicated, because it is an unpopular tax. This, with the other State administered tax, known as the financial institutions duty tax, or FID tax, in effect gives State governments the right to tax both net incomes and turnover. We are not talking about the 'net incomes and turnover of businesses; we are talking about those incomes of private individuals. The State will, in effect, be taxing incomes to the' extent that those incomes find their way into bank accounts. They are already taxing the outgoings. So it is not some sort of gift. While, this tax raised $378m for the Commonwealth last year-from the . Budget Papers we gather it is anticipated that this year it would yield a total of $380m-the States might very well be . . lucky to see anything like half that figure in their coffers. This measure, as indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), is to become effective and in the hands of the States from 1 January and therefore for half the financial, year. They will be 'lucky to get their $190m-odd because of depressed economic activity and because, as 1I have already indicated, the prospects for increased revenue from this sort of measure is extremely doubtful' and almost impossible given the economic climate we find in Australia today; The sorts of activities which saw money flowing in and out of bank accounts particularly associated with property will diminish, if not as a result of a reduced number of transactions, certaInly as a result of the reduced value of property prices which is part of the deliberately engineered circumstance we find ourselves in at the behest of the Treasurer (Mr Keating). We take special issue with the fact that this amendment, along with 18 or 19 others, all having something in common, is back before the House. This amendment does what the original legislation should have done. It would not even be before us today had the Government been competent in drafting the legislation. This is fundamental to what was proposed. It was clear .enough in the Bridg-t Papers that the measure was (0 start from 1 January. Now we have to consider an amendment which stipulates' that the Act shall take effect from 1 January 1991. I merely proffer this as evidence of the 'sloppy approach of this Government to legislation. If we put that in the context of the. original debate before this House aI).d remember that it was under the guillotine, as was so much important and far-reaching legislation two or three weeks ago, we really. do have a - ase against the Government' and its sloppiness, its ineptitude and its general disregard for the Parliament in the way it prepares legislation. When we complain about the guillotine being brought down we .so often hear members opposite offer the defence, 'It is because of some stipulation being maintained by the Senate that it shall have legislation in sufficient time to consider it'. This belies that defence that is so often offered because this is fundamental to the Bill. The 'effective 'commencement date was known at all times. The only possible reason we have for this amendment now before the Committee is that the Government simplycould 'not get something as fundamental as the date of commencement of, the Act right in the first place. . . , , Question resolved in 'the affirmative.

174,Mr SCIACCA,RESTRUCTURING BILL,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Min.ister for Social Security) (5.57}-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Government moved these amendments to complete or correct the Com. monwealth Banks Restructuring Bill in several minor respects and not to alter at all the major elements of policy in it. One group of amendments, amendments 1, 7, 8 and 9, concerns the Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation. The amendments will remove the possibility of any doubt about.the continuation of several of its capabilities under the Commonwealth Banks Act, that is, the principal Act as altered by the Bill. Amendment 1 to clause, 10 has been drafted so as to make it clear that the rules of the superannuation :fund made under proposed section 110 can determine who manages the Corporation and that those rules will have precedence if they so determine. Amendments 2 and 3 modify proposed section 8A concerning the appointment of the Secretary to the Treasury as the Treasurer's nominee on the board of the Commonwealth Bank. The amendments make the appointment of the Secretary to the board automatic rather than being' at the option of the Treasurer. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) mentioned in his second reading speech that he proposed to use this power. Therefore, there is no substantial change in p,oljcy represented by the amendment. But the Government was willing to make it in response to a suggestion by Senator Spindler on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Amendment 5 omits from the Bill clause 45 which would repeal from the principal Act section 87A. That section is a requirement in general terms for the Common-, wealth Bank in appointing, transferring or promoting its officers to select by merit and to ensure that patronage and favouritism are avoided. It was added to the principal Act in 1987 when extensive provisions specifying selection and appeal procedures were repealed. The principles stated in sect jon 87A are by now embodied in the Commonwealth Bank's internal rules. and procedures. For that reason the Government believes that no significant difference in .practical term- would be likely to result from the repeal of section 87A but, after consultation with the Commonwealth Bank's management and the union representing its officers, it has cluded that it is preferable' to retain tion 87 A in the principal Act. The other amendments, 4 and 6, are by way of improving the' drafting of the Bill. I commend these amendments to honourable members.",117
175,Mr ROCHER,RESTRUCTURING BILL,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister fot Social Security (Mr Sciacca) mentioned that these are minOJ; amendments. I would. have thought that not to be the case. In his remarks he expounded some of the reasons for these amendments. He pointed out that the first is to ensure that there continues to be sufficient authorisation' of actions by or' on behalf of the Commonwealth Bank Officers Superannuation Corporation. I would not have thought that was minor. I would have thought th-t· was fairly basiC and important-maybe relatively minor in terms of the imPort of the measure itself but cer':' tainly not in the way. it is to operate. I ' Similarly, a further amendment will repeal redundant sections of the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 as they apply to its savings bank. That is hardly a minor matter, although once again, considering the rationale· of this amendment against the import of the principal Act and all that went before it in terms of heartache and recrimination within the Labor Party, it may' very well be minor. It will be minor to those members opposite who have difficulty coming to grips with this partial sale of the Commonwealth Bank to enable it to ball out the State Savings Bank of Victoria. It· will go a little way towards the concerns of all of us that· the circumstances should have been therein the first place due to the incompetence of successive Labor governments in the State of Victoria, but it is hardly a minor matter. I do not think it is minor that the Government has decided to retain section 87A of the principal Act. That provision does deal with the merit principle and the prohibition of patronage in appointments to this institution. That'is far from minor in any government or essentially government-owned entity. It is hard to reconcile the use of the adjective 'minor' when deconscribing amendments such as that. I supsecpose it is minor when in· amendment No. 6 we have to deal with a typographical error. So those amendments, plus the one made at the suggestion of Senator Spindler in the other place, are neither minor nor unnecessary. There being one amendment that was as a result, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, of the consideration given to this Billiin the Senate probably means that it might have come back for that reason alone, the Government having accepted that suggestion. Of course, without that we would be in exactly the same situation I discussed earlier in connection with another amendment, and that is that we are forced to consider further amendments in Committee because of the sloppy draftsmanship and the' ineptitude of the Government in preparing its legislation and in seeing it pass through the various stages in this chamber. It is an indictment of this Government that so often it simply cannot get the fundamentals,' the simple things, right in its principal legislation. Again, as I pointed out a few moments ago, it seems that we are going to have to go through this process time and time again. Added to that concern is the fact that this Bill also went through the House of Representatives un-. der the guillotine. Effective debate was thereby curtailed, Mr Chairman, as it was on all or most of the other 19 Bills that you will be asked to preside over ""this evening as Chairman of Committees. Most of those Bills, to the best of my recollection, went through this House under the guillotine. Most of the amendments we are deliberating would have been unnecessary had we performed our true legislative role in this place and considered the Bills in depth and, if not at our leisure, then certainly with adequate time. As I have had cause to remark before, we are content to see the legislative process assumed almost exclusively by our colleagues in the Senate. I pay due regard to them for their work because, if it were qot for them pursuing their role as a House of review, a lot of this legislation would simply be going through the Parliament with all its defects, minor to the extent that they are minor, and unnecessary in most. cases, to the extent that that is true. It is an indictment both of the Government and of the backbench of the Government, which seems to be unable to prevail upon its Executive to give it time to consider legislation adequately. The chances are that four of these amendments would not be before us today had we had an opportunity to consider them in the committee stage, following a full second reading debate, because they would have been picked up. Preceding that is the overriding criticism that this Government does not get the fundamental things right in its proposed legislation when it is introduced into this chamber, any more than it gets the fundamentals right in the economic management of this country.

176,Mr LLOYD,GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL,"The Opposition agrees to the amendments. In fact, we are very pleased that the Government accepts the amendments which we tried to move in the House some weeks 2 ago. Honourable members may recall that the Opposition moved three amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock (Quotas) Bill. One was to put a sunset clause on the Bill in total, which was accepted by the Government. The other two amendments were to restrict the application of quotas by th- Austra-Ian Meat and Livestock CorporatIon to lIve sheep and lambs only, because informal quotas had been applied only to the live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia as a result of problems with that trade. Unfortunately, the further deterioration in that market since then now puts its total future at risk. I am referring to the rejection by the Saudi Arabian authorities of a ship carrying Australian sheep and also a ship carrying New Zealand sheep. Due to the application of a guillotine, the Opposition did not move the second amendment because of the restrictions on time allotted for consideration of the Bill. The second amendment restricted the selling or auctioning of those quotas by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to live sheep a-- lambs. for Saudi Arabia only. The OpposItIon belIeved that the provision of a general power governing exports was· an unJ.lecessary extension of the Corporation's power. There was· certainly a flurry of objection by the in?ustrY to - his ove-all provisi,o!1 in the legIslatIOn, wIth consIderable cntIcism by the industry---:firstly, for not being consulted on the proposal; and, secondly, for not being advised that the legislation was being presented to· Parliament. Indeed the first notice that most people in the i-dustry had that this legislation was being presented to Parliament was when I contacted them with copies of the Bill. The third criticism related to the attempt by either the Government or the Corporation to extend the export power further not in than was considered necessary to address this particular problem. At that time the Government was not prepared to accept common sense, logical amendments to restrict the Bill in order to meet the problem. It is with some gratification that I note that the Government has now accepted· all the Opposition's amendments and helped with the redrafting of the Bill. It would have been better if the Government had accepted its mistake when the Bill was in the Senate and moved those amendments instead of accepting the reworded amendments moved· by the Opposition. Nevertheless, the amended Bill now before the Committee is more sensible and appropriate than was the original Bill. I hope that the Government has learned its lesson and that in future when legislation that would or could have a profound impact on a particular industry is being considered, the Government genuinely consults with the industry first. I also hope that in future the Government gives adequate notice of its legislation and that when sensible amendments are put forward they are accepted the first time around.

177,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AMENDMENT BILL,"Dawson) (6.18)The Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is rather involved. In fact, when the Bill was before the Senate, a considerable amount of time was taken before a decision was reached on it. As the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Lloyd) said earlier, the amendments now before the Committee were foreshadowed during the second reading debate but were not agreed to until the Bill went before the Senate. Although I have not seen the amendments yet, I believe they are exactly the same as those that were agreed to by the Senate last Monday evening. The amendbe"". ments deal with a number of Acts. When fol- the Bill was before the House, the Opposition suggested to the Government that it was a great pity it did not take into account the amendments foreshadowed by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) to the Disability Services Act, but there was no mention of it. When the Bill was before the Senate, it was suggested that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats keep the Government honest by making the Minister keep his promise that the Government would give· a legislative base to attendant care. That suggestion lead to the Government, at the last moment-half an hour before debate on the Bill in the Senate-submitting the amendment to the Disability Services Act, which gives some recognition to attendant care. The private member's Bill that I laid before the chamber early in November went to the heart of a lot of the problems of the industry and its relationship to government. We maintained that those amendments went to the heart of accountability of government, the accountability of the Minister, and the accountability of the Department. I give an example of this: we suggested in our particular amendment that the principles, objectives and guidelines which were mentioned in the Act as ones that the Minister could formulate and which come before the Parliament in the way of disallowable instruments, should come before the Parliament in a fashion which would allow them to be debated by affirmative resolution and amended. Very few honourable members would be surprised to learn that in the four years this Act has been going the Minister has not yet formulated a guideline, and no disallowable resolution has been put to the chamber in this regard. Quite apart from putting into a legislative base the attendant care, we were also making sure that contracts were entered into on the basis of the strict criteria of the Act than have grants being made to a body according to the criteria in the mind of some bureaucrat who could impose certain conditions. We also suggested an extension of the date on which people would have to conform to the Act, that being from 1992 to 1995, because it was obvious, on the Government's own admission, that it could not have the transition effected by 1992. We suggested that it be extended to 1995. Lastly, we suggested a series of appeals. It is quite amazing that this Act was allowed to go through both the Senate and the House of Representatives in 1986 without any effective mechanism for appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or any other court of appeal where a constituent or body felt that it had an argument. In consideration in the Senate chamber, the Opposition put forward these amendments. I want to make the same submission during this consideration in the form of those same amendments, which we believe should be put into the Act. In the other place, the Democrats supported us in connection with quite a lot of those principles. We had a draft Bill which we tested before the industry, clients, the advocates, and other interested people; they felt there was a need for clarity in these areas. During' consideration of the amendments in the other place, the Minister mentioned, first, that it was premature to put in the amendments then because of a Senate inquiry in connection with employment services. This has nothing whatsoever to do with employment services. Secondly, the suggestion was made that the amendments were premature because we are now talking about devolving the responsibilities of certain parts of the Act to the States. That argument will go on for months, but it has nothing to do with the Bill. When the Bill was here in the rushed debate just a few weeks ago. we said that if there is going to be any devolution of the services under the Act to the States, and if it is going to be done on the basis of the current Disability. Services Act of rather the Commonwealth, we cannot devolve serviCes on the basis of a bad Act. We suggested an amendment to certain procedures so the devolution could take place on a better plane. One of the amendments that we are suggesting recognises in another way attendant care services. Our Bill recognised attendant care services by way of definition and by way of another service in a manner that the Government's particular amendment does not. So we want to proceed with our amendments in this regard.",121

For previous amendments, see Nos. 80 and 99, 1988."". I believe we' are talking about the Bill as a whole here; disability services were one aspect. When the Bill came before us in the first place there was no mention of it. We suggested that there should have been.' . The other area' of amendment concerns the charters of residents' rights and responsibilities in connection with hostels and nursing homes., When the Bill came before us, the charters were part of the legislation and we mentioned to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) that it was going to be very important that these charters conform to the charter that is being debated quite separately. We notice that while that charter is different from the original charter, again it has been amended to take into account some of the concerns of the Democrats. I understand it got' through on the basis of some negotiations and four alterations were made. One alteration was that the word 'it' was substituted for 'the charter' because it made it clearer. The word 'indebted' was omitted because it was felt that the words 'obliged to feel grateful' should be substituted, insert 'to be' and 'have access to', quite a few things. We had about 30 amendments to this charter. We went into this exercise on the basis of saying to the Minister that the charter as first presented to this chamber' and the agreement attached to it .\Vasa real shemozzle. Everybody agrees . that it was in an appalling state when we received itthe Senate amended it; it was subject to about 30 or 40 Government amendments; the Democrats had about 30 amendments to it; and we had about 80. It gives an indication of how shonky the original agreement was. If it had not been for the amendments which we forced on the Government this time last year which meant that those matters had to come back by affirmative resolution and be debated in the House' and the Senate, it would have been presen ted to industry in the fashio'n described by Senator Walsh, of some fame in the other place, as a nest egg for litigation and lawyers from here to the end of the. 'century. That was the manner in which it was presented; the chartet was part of that. ' We said there should be a charter of rights and responsibilities but, it should be clear. I do not have the charter' 'in front of me, but if one looks through it one finds that some of the complaints that have been made by many people are that it is too long, it is too involved, and it is not as clear as it might be. Our amendments were designed to stop duplication by the Government. It was duplicating expressions and everybody knows that in law-",123

182,The CHAIRMAN,AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member may proceed.,125
183,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AMENDMENT BILL," In this regard, the agreement was confusing. The Government had to change it in some respects, but in, demonstrating some of the rights-we believe they were covered by comnion law in any case-the common law was forced, which was great. As an indicaThat tion, one of the amendments said that an individual had the right not to be indebted to the institution. We believe that should not have been there at that it should have been omitted and would have been ,a lot clearer. All of those amendments have peared in the Notice Paper for the last four weeks or so. Even though we know tence we do not have the right to bring up here at the moment, we still believe the charter is not as clear as it should be. It could have been condensed and , made more worthy of being legislation of the Parliament than it is at the ment. They are just ,some of the aspects that I mention as far as these amendstandard ,ments are concerned. Again, lation shows the Government's total disarray; it threw the legislation at the House in November-I think we had about an hour to debate it at that time. people who from It contained quite a few other items apart from the ones I have mentioned; the legislation was hastily drawn; and was, badly effected. Whilst I believe that we have proved the nature of both the charter and the agreement with the debate in the Senate, it still has a long way to I do not think it is good enough for Parliament to present this type of legisinto lation to the Australian people.",125
184,Unknown,AMENDMENT BILL,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8.00 p.m.,126
185,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,AMENDMENT BILL,"Before the susthis pension of the sitting for dinner, in nect.ion with the charter, in regard which there are amendments, I was scribing some of the inconsistencies still in the legislation as far as this is conalready cerned. We were moving initially to try to clean it up and make it a more practia voluntary body. cal document. I will give one example. For instance, the charter mentions the words, 'Each resident of a hostel has the right', and the fourth point reads: 'to without discrimination or victimisation'. That is fair enough. It then gives a second sentence: The resident is not indebted to those providing reinhis or her care and accommodation. has nothing to do with discrimination or victimisation, and it is bad English to add something as a second sentence to a paragraph to which it does not refer. all, That happens not once, but about three it times. While the Australian Democrats' amendment that is before us indicates that apthe words 'is not indebted to' will be removed, we believe that the whole senshould be removed. It goes on from that, and all we are trying to do is give them some semblance of a reasonable document, particularly as it is to be contained in legislation. We believe that this has been the casualty of a rushed, hashed job by the Department and the Minister in mothat it has been put before us in a form that is not compatible with the high of legislatiOli that we have had the legisin this place in the past. I would also like to deal with the origina,IBill, particularly clause 5, and the intention as early January that those are not financially disadvantaged will be denied the subsidy of $2.50 per day. I refer people, in view of the it brevity of time available, to the address I gave in the debate on the original Bill, imwhich is shown in the Hansard of 14 November 1990. There is no doubt in my mind, as we said then, that the provision go. is retrospective. As from next year, people the who are in hostels and who have entered an agreement, if they are not financially disadvantaged, will then become a cost to the establishment at the rate of $2.50 per day. I want to emphasise that $2.50 per day will either be picked conup by the resident who is there at the to moment and who has been there for a dewhile, and might represent, indeed, a breaking of the agreement which they have entered into-in that respect, it is retrospective-or it will be picked up by I do not really believe that the Government of this country knows the value of the volunteers in the service of hostels live and nursing homes throughout this country. I understand that, of the work that is attached to charitable organisations and similar bodies in this country, 80 per cent is voluntary effort. The Government, at a cost of $20m to $23m, is imposing a further burden on those volunteers, who are stressed to the eyebrows at the moment. The Government is either going to impose another burden on them or it is going to make an arrangement such that the resident will have to pay. In my contribution to the debate on the original Bill I referred to a meeting that the New South Wales voluntary care organisation had with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). There was an agreement at that meeting to review this particular provision. I believe that this is the result of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), who has long since been discredited as being a Treasurer of any merit in this country, demanding of the Minister that he had to make cuts, and these represent the cuts he made. I do not even believe the Minister knew at the time that these cuts were being made in those areas. Yet these cuts are being foist on the voluntary care section at the rate of $20m to $23m for the year, because of a decision made by a Treasurer, as I say, who has been discredited. The New South Wales organisation met with the Prime Minister. There was an agreement that there would be a review. In fact, a grandfathering or grandmothering aspect was suggested to the effect that, for those people in nursing homes who were financially advantaged, a review would be undertaken, with the suggestio!,!. of a two-year waiting period, during which time these things could be ironed out. I know that the organisation saw the Prime Minister in company with the Minister, and there was a suggestion that there would be a review, the terms of which the Prime Minister suggested. The only response has been to a letter to the Prime Minister of recent days-and the response was not to the original request, but to the letter. ' I said at the time that the Government should look at the matter. I believe that at this moment the Government should give an undertaking to this Committee before this legislation is passed that it review the matter sympathetically, having regard to the fact that there are volunteers who are working out there; that the people who are going to be disadvantaged will be a lot of old people in this country, as well as the volunteers; and that it is retrospective. I know the Government does not mind retrospectivity in other ways, but I would have thought that in connection with charges it would not have proceeded in this way. I believe that this matter requires the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table. I think it is very important that this matter be looked at and some consideration given in the short time available, because this is the last opport-nity for the matter to be considered before it comes into operation in the new yea,r. I return to the Disability Services Act. As I say, this smacks of legislation through exhaustion. We did not have an opportunity to debate it properly in the first place, and some of the suggestions and amendments that we made at the time have not been, thoroughly examined. The agreement, or the charter itself, is an attempt to create a silk, purse from a sow's ear. Anybody who saw that initial legislation,' particularly the 'agreement, could only come to that conclusion. I ask the' Governm.ent:where is its old commitment to social justice? It talks about social justice, but there is no social justice in what iUs putting here at the moment. Even though we have tried desperately to get something decent out of it, it is very difficult to come to the opinion that the Minister has any commitment to social justice, the aged or the disabled. I think it is very important-and I go back to the beginning of my remarks when I said we Would be moving amendments-to note that we have a commitment to the people who suffer disabilities in this country. There is a need for an alteration to the Disability Services Act in order to make people accountable and responsible, yet there is no such commitment from this Government. There has been no effective consultation, particularly in the area of disability services. We will on the coalition side have had full consultation across the board, not only with the industry but with the clients and the' advocates. In the final analysis, having had that consultation, we obtained their agreement to put forward a private member-s Bill, which we are trying to implement in this case within the legislation; Finally, as I have said, the Government has no commitment to social justice. Of course, we have had evidence for a while that it has had no commitment to economic management. I would like to thank those people who have put in hundreds of unpaid hours in order to bring decent legislation into this chamber. That was the responsibility of the Government in the first place, but it had to be picked up by the Australian Democrats and the Opposition. I give my sincere thanks, particularly to my staffer, to those people in the Senate who have worked on this matter and to the Clerks of both Houses, for trying to remedy the massive mischief that has been' done by this initial drafting.",126

In the light of the comments of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the outcome of consideration of this matter. by the Senate Standing Committee for Community Affairs, to which the Bill was referred for consideration, it has been agreed to amend the Bill so as to make the guidelines subject to disallowance. .

189,Mr TIM FISCHER,AYES NOES,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (8.23)substiThis message arises from some solid footwork in the Senate Standing Committee in for the Scrutiny of Bills, which was reof the ferred to by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). There are in fact four separate amendments involved which subwere carried in the Senate. The Opposition is not opposed to those four amendin ments, which increase the accountability inof the legislation so far as parliamentary of the scrutiny is concerned. It is a welcome trend that those guidelines can be examby the Parliament and can be disallowed by the Parliament if need be. This will allow greater parliamentary scrutiny in of the relevant guidelines in respect of veterans legislation, the defence service home loans scheme and related matters. I add that this is literally the last piece of legislation in this the seventy-fifth anniversary year of ANZAC Day. I take - this opportunity to reiterate the fact that it a has been a long hard haul for many vetthis year, but that does not take be away from the magnificence of that seva enty-fifth anniversary pilgrimage, which place on ANZAC Day, 25 April 1990. It was a privilege for all those who participated in that pilgrimage, including the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Braithwaite) me, to go to Gallipoli. The highlight of the occasion, however, Was the 57 veterans who, I hasten to add, are covered by these four amendments. Those First World War Gallipoli veterans took centre stage-,-and rightly so-on the occasion' of that seventy-fifth anniversary pilgrimage. Mr Humphreys interjecting, Mr TIM FISCHERI am pleased to learn from the Minister that the 57 veterans were collectively recognised for a special award. I pay, tribute to the Minis. ter, the Department and those who helped to organise that pilgrimage. It is just a little sad, as we are considering this last piece of veterans' legislation for the year, that so many of those veterans and elderly citizens are now suffering under the engineered recession that, from what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has told us, we had to have. There is an impact on ,veterans and elderly citizens from the recession, which, is to be, regretted. Obviously, as the economy slides down, the standard of living of not only young people but also elderly people and veterans is affected by that recession. As I have mentioned, the Opposition is not opposed to these four amendments. Indeed, they arose from solid committee work in the Senate which does protect the role of the Parliament in the scrutiny of guidelines in respect of this Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. , Questi-n resolved in the affirmative.

190,Dr KEMP,AYES NOES,"The Opposition fully supports the prqposition that an ap- all schools, including non-government schools, not covered by an award and year of which may pay salaries at variance from the award should receive assistance for expenditure arising from the restructuring of employee terms and conditions on an equal basis. In the original Bill that was presented, this possibility was apparently overlooked by the drafter. I suppose this was understandable given the rush with which legislation has been pushed into the Parliament. The necessary amendment to facilitate the provision of supplementary assistance for such salary changes and changes in terms and conditions was moved in the Senate with the support of the Opposition. The terms of that amendment are not perhaps as felicitous as they might have been. It is possible to read the amendment relating to the provision of this assistance in at least two different ways. I should make it known to the House that the Opposition's willingness to accept this amendment is related to the terms in which the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) made his statement in the Senate that the effect of the amendment applies irrespective of whether schools are currently paying over or under award rates. Given that interpretation of the amendment by Senator Bolkus, the Opposition accepts that the amendment achieves what was required. I would like also to say that on the general issue of award restructuring the Opposition will be watching closely to ensure that the statement by Senator Bolkus, during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) on 28 November, that the conditions for receiving award restructuring assistance will not cover matters other than award restructuring is honoured. The reliance of schools on assistance should not be exploited to force them to agree to other policy agendas. Some concern has been expressed on this matter that the Government may seek to impose other c.onditions on schools. We again note that the Government has stated, through Senator Bolkus, that this will not be the case, and the Opposition will monitor that closely. With those comments, we have no objection to these amendments. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA NA Bill returned from the Senate with amendments.

191,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"There are some features Of the amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) which deserve comment from the Opposition. I have been a constant critic of the discretionary power afforded to the Commissioner of Taxation in so much of against our tax legislation and I do not resile taxfrom that criticism in general. However, income; this amendment sets out to confer a discretion on the Commissioner, which I make an welcome, although, as in the letter to of the Clancy of the Overflow, it is for want of to a rebetter knowledge. I suspect there may be before a better way to do it, given that the legislation on substantiation rules was prerelacise and in that sense distinguished itself . from other provisions relating to adminthe Comistration of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. In other, words, in terms of of provisions relating to substantiation, the in Act itself now incorporates specifics which are virtually unique in the principal Act. However, that aside, the discretion is welcome because it affords relief and potential relief from particular circumstances which were totally unacceptable.' Those circumstances were brought to light in subwhat has become known as the 'evangel presiding over the Australian AdministraAppeals Tribunal (AAT), found himself in the, invidious position of being entirely sympathetic to the correctness and the validity in all but legal terms of the evancase gelist's claims, yet he was unable to rule on the in favour of that gentleman. In other words, the expenditure claimed as a legitimate tax deduction was disallowed despite all reason leading Mr Roach to the view that the deduction should have been objection has no effect allowed. I understand, although I did not see it this secmyself; that the Commissioner of Taxation himself was sympathetic to the view Court of that the deduction should be allowed, but because of its specificity, it was not posdisresible for him to exercise any discretion in this matter. These provisions provide that inhe shall be able to do so in similar cirof cumstances and in wider circumstances in the future. We welcome that. We particularly welcome that because for m.any months now we have urged that such be done. In fact, Senator Watson was responsible for the introduction of a Bill to do the very thing that the Government now seeks to do by this late amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1990. I thought it was petty to the point of being mean not to have proceeded with the Bill presented by Senator Watson in the Senate, and passed by the Senate, to give, effect to the intentions of this amenOment. It seems to me that governments in general, and this Treasurer (Mr Keating) in particular, find it hard to acknowledge the correctness, the desirability and the very worthwhile nature sometimes of amendments put forward by the Opposition. This appears to be just one such example. The other reason we have cause to complain, I think, is that· these matters have been known for quite some time. The journal The Taxpayer referred to Senator Watson's Bill on 17 November. In a subsequent edition of that journal on 15 December it referred to the same matter when it noted that: At the'time, we didn't see how a government could not support legislation which promoted play; sadly, both the Government and the missioner is resisting any change. As if to assuage our concerns and the concerns of the profession and all faire.arh-r minded people who knew of these circumttostances, the Commissioner has indicated that he will administer substantiation a common sense. manner. However, as already pointed out, in proce-dings before  already indicated that he did not any discretion. All the common sense in the world would not then overcome the problems encountered in the case. Senator MCMullan, representing the Treasurer in the Senate, said as recently as 26. November: There was broad consensus at the National Taxation Liaison Group at which this matterthat is, Senator Watson's proposalwas discussed with the representatives of, for example, tax, accounting and legal bodies that it was not appropriate to amend the law. He continued: When we had that discussion with them, their view was that it was not appropriate to amend the law and that is a view that at this stage· the Government shares. Despite that, of course, Senator McMullan had the responsibility eventually-well after the event-of seeing this amendment pass through the Senate. That was after Senator Watson's Bill had also been passed. In the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary, we maintain that Senator Watson's amendments would be far more efficient and less tortuous than those which are before the Committee tonight. I suppose that is arguable, but I doubt if I am very far wrong. We naturally welcome the amendment because it does the very thing which we have been urging the Government to do for some months. Although there is a lack of charity in the absence of recognition of Senator Watson's role in this matter, we of course will not be opposing the amendment. Far from opposing the amendment, we will be actively supporting it. I do have some reservations about the extent to which the Commissioner may exercise fair discretion within the total discretions to Combe conferred by these amendments, but in the spirit of the season I now accept the '- as-rance that - he Co--issioner ga.ve that he wtll admInIster substanttaIn a common sense manner. At least he IS able to do that now whereas he was in not able to do so completely before. Question resolved in the affirmative.

192,Mr LLOYD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"-:-The Cattle Transaction Levy Bill and the consequential legislation amendments that flow on from that have the support of the Opposition. The original purpose of these Bills was to replace the slaughter levy with a transaction levy for the purposes of obtaining finance for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to finance its prOmotion and other operation,s on behalf of the cattle industry, the point being that it was the cattle industry only-not the sheep meat section of that industry-that agreed to the change from the slaughter levy to the transaction levy. The purpose of the transaction levy is to apply a charge every time there is a Ghange of ownership so that the charge per transaCtion, if you like, or change of ownership is considerably .less thaJ1. the once only slaughter levy, but the total amount raised for the Meat and Livestock Corporation and its operations ,remains the same. The purpose of the primary amendment is to correct an errOr in the Cattle Transaction Levy Bill which would have had the effect, without amendment, of double charging or charging more than once users of of service abattoirs. Because this amendment is necessary, a change will be required to the starting time of the (2) legislation. That is really why we have all . these other following pieces of legislation: 'they enable the starting. time, which was to be 1 Jariuary, to be changed to a later :' ,', date which, I understand,will prObably within 14 days after be 1 February. I believe the Government has been sensible in agreeing to the requests of the within industry, and certainly Opposition reAct quests, to bring in the amendments now rather than wait until Parliament resumes case in the autumn, even if it means a delay to, the starting time, so that everything is (2), in place for a uniform start to the new procedure. I acknowledge that there will be a the catchange to those levels in, I think, May when a higher levy will be imposed for prOmotion by the Meat and Livestock Corporation. That was, agreed to at its recent annual, meeting. The key amendment, the one of consequence, is to clause 5, page 3, which states: (i) the delivery occurs within 14 days after the cattle are acquired by that person; and (ii) the cattle are subsequently slaughtered; and (iii) the person continues to own the cattle immediately after their hot carcase weight within the meaning of the BeefProduction Levy Act 1990 is determined or is taken, for the purposes of that Act, to have been determined, as the case requires. ",134
193,Mr LLOYD,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The point that the honourable member for Mallee makes is that, in the attempt evidently by the Government to correct an anomaly, it has potentially crea-ed ,another anomaly. I draw the attentiqn of the House, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and his Department to this further anomaly. I know that the honourable member for Mallee has been in con'tact with the Department; I have been in contact with the Minister's office, vyhich has indicated that it will give a reply direct to the Sunraysia Abattoir Pty Ltd. I quote from a fax that has been sent from the proprietor of that abattoir: I am led to believe where hot weight scales are not available an arbitrary figure of 250 kg hot carcass weight will be applied to charge the levy., If it is good enough to assume all cattle killed through service works with no hot weight scales available then why is it not good enough to charge the levy at the flat rate of $5.42/head (250 kg at 2.17c/kg) for all cattle killed in Australia. Why are service works being persecuted. Legislation should be equitable across the board. The legislation or proposed corrective legislation does not address the problem created by the charge on the basis of c/kg. Most abattoirs will have scales at some point (ours are located on the load outside of chillers) so corrective legislation should at least allow for the conversion of either live weight to dead hot weight or cold weight to hot weight. Furthermore I would like to know who is going to be responsible to correlate the weight information and therefore who is going to be responsible for incorrect information? Will the service works be responsible to pay the production levy on behalf of its custolIlers and therefore have to pass the same onto its customers through its fee structure or is the DPIE going to charge the owners of the stock direct and if so, how are they going to obtain the weight information? This current legislation seems to have complicated what was before a simple and equitable format by charging a flat rate/carcass. I draw that fax to the attention of the representatives of the Department here tonight. Hopefully, they can provide a suitable answer to that gentleman. He has preserited a hot problem for the Department. We support the amendments and hope that the exercise-the experiment reallyin, changing from a slaughter levy to a transaction levy is successful and that no more complications or anomalies are found in the development of that new arrangement.

Second Reading",134
194,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes several amendments to Acts dealing with Defence matters. The more important changes include: to amend the Defence Force retirement and death benefits legislation to index children1i pensions, and to enable surviving spouses to commute part of their pension; ana exempt Commonwealth-owned Defence cord companies from capital gains tax on sets acquired by the Commonwealth beence fore the imposition of that tax. Other amendments remove obsolete provisions requiring the Governor General's authornel isation for certain Defence activities, make technical drafting amendments. I will now deal with the more important amendments. The other changes are explained in the expli:matory memorandum. Retirement and Death Benefits Legislation These amendments alter the arrangeefficiency ments for the payment of benefits under existing Defence Force superannuation and death benefits provisions to spouses, children and orphans of deceased members of the Defence Force. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Review Committee recprocess ommended that spouses be provided with the option to commute a portion of their pension entitlement-that is, the equivaopen lent of two years of their former spouse's salary for pension purposes at the time of death-to a lump sum. It also recomthat mended that the fixed rate elements of children's and orphans' benefits, $312 and $5,000 respectively, be indexed to movements in the consumer price index. The Government accepted these recommendations, and has taken the opportunity to include the necessary amendments iIi this Bill. Commutation for spouses will generally be available from the date of commenceread ment of the legislation. However, I am sure the Bouse will be pleased to note that there is special provision to ensure that in the unfortunate event of any casualties in the Persian Gulf deployment prior to the commencement of the amendment, a surviving spouse will also be eligible for commutation. Indexation of the fixed rate elements of children's and orphans' benefits will commence from the first pension pay day in July 1990. I emphasise that all of these changes are beneficial to members of the Australian Defence Force and thus in acwith the 'Ironclad Guarantee' given asby the Government at the time the DefForce retirement and death benefits review was announced that the benefits for which serving Defence Force personwere currently contributing would and continue to be available to them when they left the Defence Force. Capital Gains Tax Relief for Defence Companies The House will be aware that the Government has taken a number of initiatives to improve efficiency within the Defence portfolio. A key step in achieving greater has been the commercialisation and corporatisation of Defence production activities, with the establishment of the the Commonwealth-owned companies ASTA, AeroSpace Technologies of Aus. tralia, and ADI, Australian· Defence Industries. These companies are in the of adapting to direct competition from other Australian and foreign companies and are expected to operate in the market with only commercial restrictions and controls on their mode of operation. In this context, it is important the companies be not placed at a disadvantage in comparison with their competitors. A case in point is taxation. The current rules dealing with the application of capital gains tax provide an exemption for assets acquired before imposition of that tax, on 20 September 1985, and also provide roll-over relief from the tax where such assets have been transferred to subsidiaries of companies but the underlying ownership of the assets has not changed. Although the underlying ownership of their assets has not changed, this roll-over relief is not at present available to the Defence companies because the Commonwealth is not a taxpayer. Provision is therefore necessary to give these companies the same roll-over relief from capital gains tax as that obtained by subsidiary companies within corporate groups when assets are transferred within the group. The proposed relief is in respect of assets that were acquired by the Commonwealth before 20 September 1985 and transferred to the companies in connection with their establishment. An associated amendment will ensure that the value of those assets in the calculation of ciation for taxation purposes is the ciated value that would have applied had the Commonwealth been a taxpayer claiming normal depreciation. Financial Impact Indexing the children's, including orphans', pensions for the financial year from 1 July 1990 will cost approximately $92,000. The future cost of this measure will depend on the rate of inflation. Surviving spouses' right to commute pension could cost up to $1.2m in the first full year. This will be offset by duced pension in future years. The capital gains tax concession will reduce revenue by $2.2m this financial year. Future impact would depend on capital sales. This will be offset to some extent by increased revenue stemming from the associated depreciation adjustment. The other provisions in the Bill are not expected to have any significant financial impact. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Mr Downer-I understand, even though this Bill has been introduced at 9 o'clock this evening, that it is expected that it will be debated a little later this evening. It does not give the House a lot of time to consider the legislation before the debate. I move: That the debate be now adjourned. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA 1990 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time.",137
195,Mr BILNEY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The achievement of good industrial relations in Australia is essential for the success of our economy and the furtherance of social justice. This is even more the deprecase during a time when the Australian depre- economy is being fundamentally reformed. The reform objective is crucially affected by the operation of our national industrial relations. system. Such a system should be capable of being an effective instrument for change in a way which is fair to employers, workers and their unions while safeguarding our national econo-ic and industrial interests. The Hawke Government has, since taking office in 1983, sought to ensure that this is achieved. Our considerable success re- in improving Australia's industrial relations performance is on the record and has been inter nationally recognised. Credit must be given to the union movement for its restraint and preparedness for reforms in the national interest. Employers and their organisations are generally demonstrating a constructive approach towards economic and industrial change. Broadly put, a substantial degree of consensus has emerged that micro-economic reform is a key national priority and that industrial relations has a key role in it. No sector of industry is immune from the need to become more efficient and competitive. Governments, employers and workers must be partners in achieving reform quickly, fairly and without industrial friction. Trade unions which choose to participate in our national industrial relations system must have the capacity for constructive participation in the reform process. Their capacity depends to a crucial degree on the relevance of their structure. The need for a more rational union structure has been recognised and appreciated for some time now by almost all involved in industrial relations. It has been emphasised in no less than five major economic reports to various Australian governments. The Jackson report on manufacturing industry in 1975, the report of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in 1977, the Myers report on technological change in 1980, the report of the Hancock Committee in 1985 and this year's report by the Australian Manufacturing Council all agree on this point: the multiplicity of unions is an impediment to industrial and administrative efficiency. The union movement itself recognises that there is a need for its rationalisation along broad industry lines and that the process of reform should not be complicated by the involvement of numerous unions in the requisite negotiation- and bargaining between the parties. It is clearly in the interests of workers that they share in the benefits of economic restructuring. Those benefits will be maximised if their unions are to have the capacity and organisation to identify more closely with the interests of individual industries and enterprises. The major thrust therefore of the measures which I am presenting tonight is intended to reform the national industrial relations system in ways which will meet these needs. An interrelated package of legislative and administrative measures is to be implemented. Changes will be made to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 which affect the size, number and industrial coverage of federally registered unions. The amendments are designed to encourage: - a substantial reduction in the numbers of such unions; and - those unions being more oriented in their industrial operations towards particular industries and sectors of industry. The main elements of the amendments are: - additional objects in the Act; new requirements as to the membership of unions for their registration or continued registration under the Act; the recognition of federations of organisations proposing to amalgamate; rev""ised procedures to bring about speedier amalgamations; changes to the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to make orders altering the coverage of work by federally registered unions; and some revision of the Act's preference provisions. New Objects In exercising their powers under the Act, the Commission, the Federal Court of Australia and the Industrial Registrar must have regard to the scope and purpose of the Act. This is reinforced by the Commission's express statutory obligation to take account of the Act's objects, which include those expressed in section 3. Two new objects are to be included in that section. One is to encourage and facilitate amalgamations under the Act. The other is to encourage and facilitate the development of organisations registered under the Act, particularly by reducing the numbers that are in an industry or enterprise. These new objects reflect the underlying intention of the Bill, namely to assist in the rationalising of organisations, particularly unions, in a way which is consistent with our national economic, industrial and social interest. I must emphasise that the objects are not intended to be read individually. To the extent that it is appropriate, they are to be taken and applied together. Size of unions At present to be registered a union must, unless there are special circumstances, be industry-based and have at least 1000 members who are employees or whose usual occupation is as an employee. Existing registered unions with fewer than 1000 employees will have their continued istration reviewed from 1 March 1992. These requirements are to be changed unthe der clauses 12 and 14 of the Bill. figure of 1000 will be altered to 10,000, but a union with a smaller membership will be able to be registered if it can that its registration is justified. For existing small registered unions, the eration 10,000 membership requirement is to be or any of its phased in, so they will be subject to two-stage review. The existing review lating to unions with fewer than 1000 members will proceed in 1992. A review of the continued registration of unions with fewer than 10,000 members will commence on 1 March 1993. In either case, the union's registration is to be cancelled if it cannot be shown that there are special circumstances which justify continuation in the public interest. I emphasise that cancellation of a union's registration will not be automatic. There will be due process. Each small union will be given an opportunity to present its case. Decisions will be reviewties able on appeal. It will be for the Commission to decide on an appropriate order according to the circumstances of each case. The Commission could, in some statement cases, be influenced by the absence of another union which could properly reptance resent the interests of employees in ticular industry. It may consider the organisations industrial or economic consequences deregistration, particularly if the small union concerned is the major union in the particular industry or sector conation cerned. In appropriate cases, the Commisence sion m-y take into account the views of the workers affected as to how their incontrol dustrial interests should be represented. It is also noted that the minimum size requirement does not affect the existence of a union, .or its operation, outside the Federal conciliation and arbitration system. The new provisions will encourage small unions to consider their place in the national industrial relations system, and with the onus on them to justify it. Federations A new provision will be included in the regAct's revised amalgamation division to permit the recognition for the purposes of Act of a federation of registered orThe ganisations proposing to amalgamate within a prescribed period of three years. Such a federation will be voluntary and show the organisations concerned will be able to dissolve it if they wish. While the fedexists, however, it will be able to represent, for the purposes of the Act, all constituent organisations, for a instance, in proceedings before the Comremission. A federation will, however, not be capable of being a party to an award. This measure will help registered organisations, whether of employers or employees, to prepare for amalgamation. Amalgamations The voluntary restructuring of the union its movement should be encouraged. To assist unions to rationalise, the Act's amalgamation provisions are to be completely revised. Their operation will be quicker and more adaptable. Mechanisms for avoiding or minimising technical difficuland other problems will be provided. Clause 150f the Bill repeals the Act's existing amalgamation division. The new division has several notable features. A of legislative intention is to be included. This will emphasise the imporof the Act's new objects relating to a paramalgamations and the development of as well as the existing object of concerning the efficient management of organisations. Speed and the avoidance or minimising of problems in the amalgamprocess will be emphasised. Referwill also be made to the existing object concerning the need for democratic of organisations. This will provide guidance to the Commission and the Federal Court of Australia when they come to exercise their powers in relation to amalgamations. The existing amalgamation procedures will be telescoped and modified to overcome their current unnecessarily protracted and sequential operation. Amalgamation proposals which now can take anything up to two years to be decided under the Act should be able to be completed in a few months at most. This will also be assisted by a provision giving a presidential member wide powers to resolve any difficulties encountered in the process. A designated presidential member of the Commission will be responsible for hearing and determining certain matters before a proposed amalgamation may be submitted to ballots of members. Among other things, the member will deal with any application for a declaration of-a community of interest between the organisations. Such a declaration will result""in less onerous requirements for approval of an amalgamation ballot. The existing provision relating to a. community of interest is to be changed in a number of ways. To provide greater flexibility in the processes, organisations proposing to amalgamate will be able to seek a declaration before formally lodging a scheme for a proposed amalgamation, or at the same time as the scheme is lodged. The community of interest test itself will be changed to improve its operation. There will be specified criteria which, if met, will lead to the making of a declaration. The Commission will also have a discretion to find a community of interest in other circumstances. The criteria themselves will be changed to make them more practical. At present they are effectively inoperative where a very large organisation seeks to amalgamate with a small organisation. To overcome this, a substantial number of members of one of the organisations will have to meet the criteria. Currently a substantial number of members of all the organisations must satisfy those criteria. This is in line with views expressed in 1980 in the National Labour Consultative Council and supported by a Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in 1984. Another change will be to dispense with the present requirement that the Commission be satisfied that the amalgamation will further the objects of the Act. It is considered that this will be redundant, given the Act's new explicit objects and the statement of legislative intention to which I have referred. To the extent that the objects are applicable to a community of interest matter, they must be considered. Some changes are proposed to the re. quirements for amalgamation ballots which are to be conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. It will be possible to have a secret postal ballot or a ballot at meetings of members with secret voting. In the latter case, a presidential member must agree and there must be appropriate protection for members, such as provision for absentee voting. The Federal Court may inquire into any alleged irregularities. At present if a presidential member approves, a ballot need not be conducted of members of a large organisation which is amalgamating with smaller organisations. Such an exemption may be granted where the membership of the smaller bodies does not exceed 5 per cent of the total membership of the proposed amalgamated organisation. The figure will be increased to 25 per cent. There are practical difficulties, including problems of organisation and cost, where a very large organisation is proposing to amalgamate with smaller organisations. The higher figure balances such practical considerations against the effects of an amalgamation on the interests of the members of the larger organisation. An exemption will still be subject to approval by the Commission. New provisions are also to be included to provide for the automatic succession of an amalgamated organisation to the rights, liabilities and property of an organisation which is deregistered when an amalgamation takes effect. The Federal Court will have power to resolve any difdustrial ficulties that may arise. There will also be new provisions which validate unintended irregularities in the amalgamation pr,Ocess. Irregularities in ballots cannot be validated in this The Federal Court will be able, in approachievable. priate cases, to overrule the validation an irregularity. Another change is to be made to assist the amalgamation process. A committee tion provisions. of management of an organisation will be able to use the organisation's funds and other resources to support a proposed amalgamation up to the close of the bal11 lot, provided the committee so resolves. Members will need to be given reasonable notice of such a decision. This provision is intended to address difficulties arising from a recent Federal Court decision which restricted the period in which sources could be used in this way. Orders changing union coverage of work If union rationalisation is to be effechave tive and occur quickly, there must be an effective mechanism for adjusting the rights of unions to represent the interests of particular classes or groups of workers. At present the Commission may only make such adjustments to resolve actual ular cases. or likely demarcation disputes. This is too narrow and some technical legal problems have arisen. Accordingly, a new provision is proposed which will permit a presidenwill tial member or a Full Bench of the Comframework mission to alter a union's representative rights by making those rights exclusive, removing them, or conferring them. That power will be exercisable on application by an organisation, an employer or the Minister. In exercising it, the Commission will be obliged to have regard to the lic interest and to the Act's objects. One of the new objects will be esperank cially relevant. That object relates to the development of organisations, particularly by reducing their numbers in an industry or enterprise. Even so, the objects of the Act as a whole should be considered. The power to adjust union coverage will be available to prevent or settle disputes, but it is to be hoped that Australia's parties are sufficiently mature to address issues of union coverage in a rational constructive way. Agreed changes can b- implemented under this provision. A greater industry orientation for unions, way. which is widely supported, should be Larger unions are more likely of to take part in voluntary changes of coverage than smaller unions. That situa-ion will be brought about by smaller umons taking advantage of the new amalgamaPreference Some changes are proposed under clause to the provisions of the Act governing the power of the Commission to award preference. To clarify the provision, specific examples are to be given of the types of matters which can be the subject of preference orders. These matters are rewithin the scope of the Commission's existing powers. In addition, the Comm.ission will, if it thinks fit, be able to reqUlre preference to be given to persons who applied for membership of federally registered unions. At present, preference can only be awarded to particular unions or members of unions. It will still be a matter for the Commission to decide whether preference is warranted in particNon-legislative Initiatives The amendments that I have outlined provide the necessary legislative to enable restructuring to take place. To reinforce the eifectiv-ness of t-e changes, increased financIal - ssIstance will be available, as announced m the Budget, to help federally registered unions to meet the considerable costs involved in amalgamating. Amalgamation negotiatio?s are pubat a critical stage in a number of mdustries. Successful amalgamations depend on. and file support. The Government's budgetary allocation for 1990-91 will h-lp unions to promote the amalgamatIOn process among union memberships. A new Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be appointed to assist specifically with union amalgamations. The position will inbe located in Melbourne and will complement the position of the existing Deputy President dealing with amalgamations. The establishment of this new position will ensure that appropriate resources are dedicated to the Government's priority of rationalising union structures. The Government will also, if necessary, enhance the resources of the Australian Industrial Registry to enable it to perform its functions effectively following the amendment of the Act. Other Amendments The Bill also makes a number of other amendments of a minor policy or technical nature and includes appropriate trantion sitional provisions. Financial Impact Statement The new amalgamation provisions proForce vided in the Bill are likely to have the effect of encouraging a. greater number amalgamations between organisations than has occurred in the past. An increase the number of amalgamations will result in additional cost to the Commonwealth, as it meets the cost of amalgamation lots conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. It is not possible to give reliable estimate of the increased which may result, given the difficulty judging the impact of the new legislation on the number of amalgamations between organisations. The Government is confident that this Bill will be seen as a pivotal development in the history of industrial relations Australia. It seeks to be a profoundly nificant agent of reform at a time when reform is rightly judged to be the preindustry. eminent economic challenge before us. provides the process by which the Austrawealth-owned lian union movement can be both part of, and facilitator of, this reform. With significance of this development in mind, I commend the Bill to the House present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Braithwaite) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed.",138
196,Mr DOWNER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 was introduced at approximately 9 o-clock this evening. So in theory the House has not had a great deal of time to consider it-indeed, precisely 26 minutes. The legislation, however, was introduced in another place at an earlier time when there was some discussion on it. As my colleague Senator Durack said on that oc, casion, the coalition supports the legislawhich, as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) pointed out in his second reading speech, does two things. In the first place it amends the Defence retirement and death benefits legislation in order to index children's penof sions and to enable surviving spouses to commute part of their pensions. Secondly, in it exempts Commonwealth-owned defence companies from capital gains tax on assets acquired by the Commonwealth bebalfore the imposition of that tax. I refer to the second aspect of the lega islation which amends the Defence Act costs 1903 to exempt Commonwealth-owned in defence companies from paying capital gains tax on assets acquired by the Commonwealth before the imposition of that tax. These measures principally affect Australian Defence Industries (ADI) and AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd (ASTA). The Opposition is happy to in support measures which will strengthen sigthe capacity of these young companies to contribute to the needs of our defence However, we still have some way It to go in the rationalisation of Commondefence industries. Furthermore, we have a long way to go in defining the the relationship which ADI and. ASTA will be able to play in relation to the and Defence Force as a whole. With regard to the first point, I note that ADI recently announced a major plan to rationalise its ammunition production facilities, of which I am sure the Minister is aware. The proposal involves the closure of three factories: St Marys in Sydney, which employs 406 people, and Footscray and Maribyrnong in Melbourne, which between them employ 1,122 people. As a result of the rationalisation, the new site will employ only 400 people. Given that the new site will produce the same output as the previous three facilities, that clearly represents a very substantial increase in productivity. Indeed, this is the first time in my six years in this place, and certainly during the course of the Hawke Government, which goes back a little longer than that, that I have seen such a substantial improvement in productivity in any area in Australia. Productivity has not been the hallmark of the performance of the' Hawke Government and figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) bear that outthat Australia's productivity record during those years has shown a decline both in labour and factor productivity; whereas the OECD average shows an increase. On this occasion, however, the Government is committing itself to an increase in productivity. The rationalisation of Australia's ammunition production facilities is a necessary measure. We accept that it makes good economic sense to place this ammunition facility in one location, and I have pointed out the advantages of productivity. At the same time though, the Opposition is mindful of the circumstances of the existing ADI employees. I understand that the level of consultation leading up to the rationalisation decision was not as great as many people had expected it to be. Therefore, I hope that ADI will make known the location of the new ammunition facility as soon as possible because obviously .an early announcement of the site will make it much easier for existing ADI employees to contemplate transferring to the new factory. Perhaps in responding to this debate, the Minister may wish to tell us where the new facility is going to be located. As the Minister and I both come from South Australia and have adjacent electorates, I would naturally expect it to be located in a State which the Minister's own party claims to be the State that leads the way in defence industries. Regardless of the need for rationalisation, I also note that more than 1,000 jobs will be shed by this exercise, and this is clearly at a time when the economy is particularly poorly placed to offer ADI employees new work. So the Minister may wish to comment on the prospects for those particular people and what the Government has in mind for them. ADI should do everything in its po-er to aid the employment prospects of its current employees at St Marys, Footscray and Maribyrnong. The second point I make is that, in order to keep ADI and ASTA as major contributors to Australia's defence interests, the Government is going to have to review the range of work opportunities which will be open to public tender. Both ADI and ASTA have a significant capacity to undertake a range of maintenance work now currently being done by the defence forces themselves. I note the comments made in an article that appeared two or three days ago in the Australian Financial Review by a spokesman from ASTA that the company will be in danger of losing qualified staff if ASTA fails to win new work. It is therefore particularly worrying for us on this side of the House to see a report in the Australian Defence Report journal of 13 December 1990-which I am sure the Minister reads-that the Government has seen fit not to contract out maintenance for the PC9 turbo-prop trainer after that work had been carried out for three years by Hawker de Havilland. We are saying· on this side of the House that there may be good reasons for the Air Force to resume that maintenance, and we would like to hear from the Minister what they are. But if the Government wants to create a viable defence industrial base-and this Bill in part is aimed at that goal...:... - then it will have to look at contracting out more maintenance tasks than is currently the case. Work of this sort will become a major part of local defence industry activity once the major equipment projects are accounted for. On a number of occasions, Mr Deputy Speaker, we on this side of the House have made a substantial point out of the issue of the need for contracting out. is something, interestingly enough, the Industry Commission in its annual report referred to at some length. It ply endorsed the policy and the view the coalition that contracting not only save taxpayers an enormous amount of money but would also lead to substantial improvements in productivity in the Australian economy. The Governindex ment has an extraordinarily poor record on contracting out, in contrast to many OECD governments. This is because of its very long standing commitment to trade union movement and the fear that, by contracting out, that may be inimical in many respects to the traditional posiwhich tion of the trade union movement. That is not the case in the instance the Australian Defence Force, but the economic issues are the same and the productivity issues are the same. So look forward to seeing the Government take more initiatives in that respect. This gives the Minister, the honourable mempity ber for Kingston, a· great opportunity do something different and imaginative during the 21/2 or three years that he spent as a Minister, rather than just purice on their part. suing the role of administering policies served up to him by his public servants. So we look forward to the Minister's nouncing imaginative and creative initiaamendment tives in this area. I think the Minister would like, at the end of his term, at time of the next election, to go out as Minister who will be remembered as somebody who did things which were creequivalent ative and productive, and I am giving him the opportunity and a few ideas do that. The second aspect of the Bill, as I mension tioned earlier, is designed to amend Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits legislation to enable spouses deceased members of the Defence Force to commute a portion of their pension. This Bill also proposes to index the fixed element of the pensions of children, inspouses cluding orphans, to movements in the consumer price index (CPI). Under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1948, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, a child's pension That a composite amount comprising a fixed that unindexed amount and an indexed amount expressed as a fraction of the simretirement payor invalidity pay which of was or would have been payable to the out could deceased contributor. The fixed amount of an orphan's pension is, I believe, $5,000 and for other children it is $312. This amendment will those fixed elements in accordance with the CPI from 1 July 1990. The coalition has constantly pressed the Government to index these benefits, so obviously the we welcome this measure. The orphan's benefit was only recently raised-two or three months ago-from $702 to $5,000, may sound like a very substantial amount, but I remind the House that it of has been stuck at $702 for some 18 years, which is rather a long time. Therefore, I think the Minister would agree it became we somewhat out of date as a quantity of money. Obviously this amendment is very welcome from that point of view. It is a that for so many years governments, to perhaps just by way of oversight, have not made these changes. I suspect it is by has way of oversight rather than by any malThe current legislation does not allow a surviving spouse to commute a portion of anthe pension payable to that spouse. The provides the surviving spouse with the option to commute a portion of the the pension payable to that spouse. The a portion of the pension that may be commuted is an amount not exceeding the of two years of the deceased contributor's annual rate of pay at the to time of death. The amendment also provides for the calculation of residual penthat is payable if the spouse elects to the commute. The amendment applies to the spouse of any contributor who dies on or of after the date the amendment comes into operation. Special provision has also been made to enable the amendment to apply if necessary to a prescribed class of with effect from a prescribed date. The Minister has indicated that this special provision will apply to the surviving spouses of any service members who may-and one obviously prays and hopes is this will not happen-come across severe circumstances in the current Gulf crisis. It is perhaps rather awful to have to reflect on that, but I think the Government has been responsible in approaching this legislation in that way. So that second aspect of the legislation is not by any stretch of the imagination controversial. It is legislation that we most certainly welcome, and I know will be welcomed by those people who benefit from it. On behalf of the coalition, I congratulate the Government on the second aspect of the legislation. As for the first aspect of the legislation, I again say that we tainly support that and hope that the Minister may take up some of the other suggestions that we put forward to him tonight-suggestions that could, by possibly a rather wild stretch of the imagination, turn him into a statesman.",143
197,Mr LES SCOIT,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) does much to extend this Government's fine record in improving life in the Australian defence forces. It is good to see the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is at the table, doing a good job in that portfolio. The changes to the Defence Force retirement and defence benefits legislation proposed in this Bill would entitle spouses of deceased members of the Defence Force to commute a portion of their pension, and would index the fixed element of their pensions to movements in the CPI. Such equitable moves are of the same thrust as those initiatives in the Government's retirement incomes policy and are a part of the Hawke Government's commitment to ensuring that our Defence personnel are provided with a fit and proper remuneration for the contribution to the defence of Australia. At the centre of these sporadic, misguided outbursts by some members of the Opposition, though, is the absence of any genuine concern for the overall well-being of our Defence personnel. In contrast, this Government has a record of which it can be very proud. In 1987, a special portfolio separate from the main Defence portfolio was· established to look after the unique needs of Defence personnel and their families. Since this time, a wide range of substantial improvements in Service pay and overall conditions of service have come about. Changes to the taxation system implemented by the Government in this time have helped these initiatives to bring even greater salary and tax benefits. Until 1 February this year the smallest effective total increase in pay scales between $20,000 and $50,000 per annum, when considering direct wage rises and indirect benefits through the tax system, was just under 22 per cent. Of course, cer- this compares with a consumer price index increase of 18.5 per cent for the same period. The Government has also addressed the problems associated with the mobility side of defence life faced.-y Australian Defence Force (ADF) famIlIes. The Defence Housing Authority, for instance, was established to provide commercial flexibility in managing defence housing, to reduce costs and to improve maintenance of defence homes. Backing up its commitment, the Government will spend $1 billion on defence housing over the next 10 years. During the financial year 1988-89 alone, the Hawke Government spent $135m on defence housing, including repairs and maintenance. Of course, this compares with an average of only $35m for the last five years of the previous Fraser Government. The long term planning consideration for Australia's defence families is evident in the Defence Housing Authority's plan to take over on a progressive basis the leases of private houses which are r.ented by defence families, thereby alleviating these families' up-front costs, such as security bonds, for instance. Further improvements in housing for defence personnel and their families is evidenced in the recently debated Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill, which provides for a new form of housing assistance for defence personnel who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985. Provisions contained in this legislation are in line with the Government's belief and desire to establish a form of housing assistance which would encourage home ownership for members of the ADF and would provide an incentive for individuals to remain in the defence forces. The new scheme is available to all members of the ADF who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985 and means that those who enlisted prior to that date remain eligible for assistance under the defence service home loans scheme, although those in this category who are still serving and have not exercised a defence service home entitlement may elect for assistance under the new scheme. Personnel in this position will be advised of the provisions of the new scheme and will be required to choose their option by 30 June 1991. Defence personnel will generally need to have served for at least six years in order to become eligible for the new scheme. However, the Government has recognised the extra contribution of some personnel, such as those presently stationed in the Persian Gulf, .or where a service member is discharged as a result of a compensable medical condition. In these instances the six-year requirement will of course be relaxed. The new scheme provides eligible personnel with a subsidised housing loan of some $40,000. Interest on the loan is subsidised to the extent of 40 per cent of the average interest and would originally be payable over the term of the loan, with the Defence Force member meeting the remaining 60 per cent. Reinforcing the importance in the minds of honourable members on this side of the House of retaining personnel in the ADF, the Government has ensured that the extent of assistance in home purchase is linked to service in the ADF. Thus, the subsidy will be available for the period completed years which the member continues to serve beyond the initial six-year qualifying period. For example, a member of the Defence Force who has completed 14 years service is able to receive the subsidy for a period of eight years. Other benefits flow to defence personnel and their families on the rental side through changes to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement which will see a devolution of administration to the States, allowing providers of rental housing for defence personnel to have a greater appreciation of the differing housing needs of defence families across Australia. Such is this Government's determination to ensure that our defence personnel and their families have the best possible conditions of service-something that is further evident in the legislation we are debating here tonight. Other steps have also been taken to achieve this end. To a-sist in the frequent transfers which occur in the defence forces, this Government established FIND-the family information network for defence personnel-which provides a confidential, up to date, plain English version of personnel provisions and issues. In its first month of operation, FIND received more than a thousand calls, which clearly reflects the Government's recognition of the need to provide general information which will allow individuals to better pursue their case or understand their rights. What this highlights is the fact that when it comes to having a genuine interest in the f-ture of the Australian Defence Force and its personnel, it has been the mix of policies implemented by this Government which has best served, and will continue to best serve, the interests of our defence forces. This commitment not only to our personnel but to the entire defence picture is something that appears to have been overlooked by the Opposition in recent weeks. In the last sittings of Parliament, during the debate on the Persian Gulf, it was disappointing that some honourable members opposite chose to ignore the way in which our defence needs have changed in recent decades from a of position of defence dependence on allies, through concentration on the immediate needs of self-defence, to a positive acceptance both of self-reliance and of a need to help shape our regional strategic environment, in which we are a substantial power. The Federal Government's policy of defence self-reliance places a priority on being able to defend ourselves with our own resources. Australia must have the military capability to prevent an enemy from attacking us in our sea and air approaches, gaining a foothold on our territory or extracting political concessions from us through the use of military force. Such an independent military capability is fundamental to our national security and, of course, sovereignty. This policy of defence self-reliance is pursued within a framework of alliances and agreements,the most significant of which is with the United States. A defence relationship of basic importance also exists with New Zealand. In the fivepower defence arrangements, we have other important links with Papua New Guinea, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Malaysia and, of course, Singapore. These arrangements, particularly those with the United States, enhance our self reliance by improving our technological capabilities. They also provide training opportunities for the ADF as well as access to vital military and political intellidebating gence. In addition, the security provisions of our alliance agreements oblige a potential enemy to contemplate the prospect of an allied attack against it should it choose to attack Australia. These arrangements emphasise Australia's membership of the Western strategic community and enhance regional stability. In return, the terests of Australia's allies are advanced by Australia's ability to provide for its own defence. Given Australia's extensive northern coastline, significant maritime interests and relatively small population, the prime focus of the Government in defence strategy has been on depth. To make the defence of mainland Australia manageable, the ADF must be capable of meeting an adversary's force in the sea and air approaches, as well as to operate over a wide geographic area. The Royal Australian Air Force presence at Amberley in my own electorate obviously plays a great role in this regard. As the nation's largest operational Air Force base, its capabilities are crucial in any application of air power. Other elements of the Air Force would also have an important role to play in conducting maritime surveillance patrols, protecting shipping, offshore territories and resources, providing air lift and offensive air support to the other Services, contributing to cooperative activities with countries in our region, and providing assistance to the civil community in times of crisis and, of course, natural disasters. Among the major activities set down to achieve these aims are the development of a national air defence and airspace control system to enhance air surveillance, detection and interception capabilities; the avionics update' for the FIll ssomething very pertinent to my own electorate of Oxley, which is home, of course, to the Amberley Air Force base; and the improving of electronic warfare and intelligence gathering capabilities of the FIll. Even given these advances, the Government is far from prepared to rest on its laurels in furthering the preparedness of our defence forces. The legislation we are tonight is evidence of the Government's commitment to putting in place additional measures which will allow the Australian defence framework to be better prepared, expanding its commercial arms, and creating a more diverse force for the defence of Australia. If the personnel of the ADF and their families are to gain the greatest benefit, they must be given in- the opportunity to work within flexible guidelines able to adapt to and compete with outside forces. It is the Government's view that the autonomous arms of Australia's defence framework should be able to compete on a level playing field with the private sector operators. This is evident in the capital gains tax sections of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), which applies the same subsidiary company philosophy to Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI) and AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd (AST A) as these companies' corporate competitors. I emphasise that this is not a case of special treatment for Commonwealth owned companies as this same practice is applied to private sector operators with respect to the rollover relief obtained by their subsidiary companies. Such measures will give these organisations greater freedom in their operations, something which will be reflected in further benefits for the personnel of the forces. These former Defence Department-parented companies are already competing well in the marketplace and the measures advocated in this Bill can only enhance their ability to be even more competitive. . For instance, at the Amberley RAAF base in my own electorate, which I have already referred to, there is terrific evidence of how such arms of the Australian defence forces benefit overall defence operations. When companies in the private sector need to update any machinery, computer equipment or infrastructure to increase the productivity of the operations under existing arrangements for subsidiary companies they can do so without incurring capital gains tax. There is no reason why companies such as ADI and ASTA should not be able to do likewise. But to look at the present system within which these now autonomous organisations operate, it is appropriate to review some of the previous modus operandi prior to corporatisation and the advances they have made since this time. For instance, in its last five years of operation as the Office of Defence Production, that organisation was paid a subsidy from the Defence budget of some $1.3 billion. Since the announcement that the office would be converted to Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd in August 1988, with the operations being taken over in May 1989, steps have been taken to address this unnecessary burden on the taxpayer so that the ADI is expected to announce a small profit in its first full financial year. This endorses the Government's adoption of the 1987 White Paper that there was a need for defence production establishments to be as efficient as possible. The massive structural reforms which followed this recommendation were aimed at improving delivery and financial performance and at saving the Defence budget about $150m per annum while increasing productivity by some 30 per cent. The creation of the company was one of the most ambitious corporatisation exercises undertaken in Australia, and the move was consistent with the key objectives of the 1987 Defence White Paper. ADI has been in existence for up to 100 years in various forms, and it is committed to design excellence and engineering quality. It offers a wide range of superior products with a reputation for reliability, safety and, of course, performance. An indication of its growing strength and ability to compete in the marketplace, something which will be further enhanced by this legislation, is the fact that ADI currently has an annual turnover of approximately $500m a year and employs about 6,000 people. It is also amongst the top 200 exporters from Australia. Some examples of its range of business activities are as follows: it supplies most of the military uniforms used by ADF personnel; it supplies major ammunition types for the ADF; ADl's Garden Island facility is the principal refit, repair and modernisation centre for the Royal Australian Navy; it supplies small arms and field guns to the Australian Army; and ADl's significant heavy engineering business enabled it to be a successful tenderer for work on the Collins Class submarine project. \ Through its creation of separate divisions in the areas of electronics, training systems, logistics support and defence consulting, ADI has been able· to massively increase its efficiency, expanding into new areas of business that will assist the company to build on its existing expertise in defence work. Such progress has been reflected recently in the winning of open tender contracts for the refit of the Royal Australian Navy's Oberon Class submarine, HMAS Onslow. It has also manufactured the Australian Army's new assault weapon, the Austeyr F88. It is therefore appropriate that the Government give every encouragement to ADI to expand its activities, as is reflected in the relaxing of capital gains tax provisions in this Bill. Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd is a similar success story and is indeed deserving of the same freedom of operation as its private competitors. It has certainly come a long way since the early days when it was called the Bond Shop. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want to take much more time. I think that I have probably extended my friendship. In conclusion, I believe that this brief walk through some of the history books of the associated Defence Force industries in country illustrates clearly the benefits be gained by the defence policies this Government has put in place. The increased benefits which will flow to persontax, nel and their families and to AST A and ADI from this legislation can only further this direction. I commend the Bill to the House.",146
198,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"It is good to be able to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). By and large, we on this side of the House agree with these amendments in their entirety. Having said that and having listened to the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) for almost 20 minutesMr Downer-You didn't listen, did you?",150
199,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Yes, I listened. I heard him eulogising the performance of the Government over the last seven or eight years. Indeed, over that seven or eight years, if one searches very hard, one find that amendments were made and legislation was brought into this House which have been a blessing indeed to Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel. During my time here, I think I have seen three Ministers in the role of Minister for Defence Science and Personnel; I refer to the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) and now the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Bilney). Each one of them has brought forward amendments which I believe have been of great benefit to our Department of Defence personnel. It was very pleasing when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who is the Minister at the table, announced that sailors of our Navy would be able to come back into uniform. That was an encouraging move which all of us wanted to see, although we understand the reasons why those precautions were taken in the first instance. As we consider this omnibus defence Bill proposing amendments which include alterations to payments of superannuation and death benefits to spouses, children and orphans of deceased members of the this ADF and exemption of Commonwealthto owned defence companies from capital gains tax on assets acquired by the Commonwealth before the introduction of that we do so, by and large, as I said earlier and as other speakers have noted, with a good deal of agreement. I would like to indicate at the outset of this debate that the coalition fully supports this legislation and particularly the important changes that will benefit our service personnel and their families. The honourable member for Oxley was very proud of the fact that he had a large base in his electorate. I do indeed have the Richmond RAAF base in my electorate, which is the largest transport base in Australia, a particularly efficient base and one that I am very proud of. Right on the boundary of my electorate I also have the Glenbrook operational command headquarters, and so I have had a lot to do with many areas of the defence forces, could not to mention HMAS Nirimba and quite a few army bases. I am proud to be able to say that within my electorate we have some very strong and flourishing cadet groups: one at Katoomba High School and another at Penrith. Recently, I was very proud to be able to go along to the annual prize giving parades of those groups. I mention this here because it was announced on both occasions that a number of those cadets were actually going into the RAAF, into the Army and into the Navy and so will be the beneficiaries in due course of some of the things being mentioned in these particular amendments. One of the things to be noted with regard to these amendments to this Bill is that they will remove obsolete provisions requiring the Governor General's authorisation for certain defence activities and will also make some technical drafting results. With regard to the retirement and death benefits legislation, which will entitle spouses of deceased members of the defence forces to commute a portion of their pension, I am glad to see that these anomalies that previously existed are to be rectified, however slow and late it is coming. The current legislation does not allow for the surviving spouse of a Defence Force member to commute a portion of the pension payable to that spouse. This has caused a lot of grieving, trouble and problems for those families in the event of the death of a member of the Defence Force or of somebody who is on the retirement benefit already. The amendment to the legislation before us today will provide the surviving spouse with that option, and that is a very good thing. Furthermore, the amendment applies to the spouse of any contributor who dies on or after the date the proposed amendment comes into operation. At this time when we have service personnel stationed in the Gulf who are at great risk of being involved in action, this amendment will be of great benefit to surviving spouses of any service member who may lose his life in the event of an unwanted-and I emphasise that word-outbreak of war in the Gulf. All of us here in this House and throughout this country certainly hope and pray that Saddam Hussein will come to his senses long before 14 January. An important matter to note is that there is a special provision to ensure, in the unfortunate event of any casualties in the Persian Gulf deployment prior to the commencement of the amendment, that a surviving spouse will be eligible for commutation-although we certainly hope that that never eventuates. I have to say that the previous lack of legislation for affected spouses in such a situation was really unjust. It showed a lack of foresight by the Government in allowing such anomalies to continue for as long as they did. Another amendment relates to the recommendation that the fixed rate element of children's and orphans' benefits, $312 and $5,000 respectively, be indexed to movements in the consumer price index from 1 July 1990. That is also most welcome. The Opposition has on many occasions pressed the Government to index these benefits; it is very good to see that the Government is responding in that rein gard. It is to be noted that the orphans' benefit rate was raised only recently, in October this year, from $702 to $5,000. That old rate had existed for seven years under the present Government. Mr Bitney-And 11 under the previous governments.",150
200,Mr WEBSTER,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"We are not terribly proud of that either. Any amendment to defence legislation is of great interest to me in view, as I mentioned earlier, of the great number of defence personnel who are constituents in my electorate of Macquarie. Over the years honourable members will recall that I have lobbied vigorously for the Government to come to grips with the unique and serious problems that our defence personnel face in this country. We expect our defence personnel to be ready at any time to leave this country-this has been shown up in recent months particularly-and go into an area of war and be prepared, if necessary, to sacrifice their lives for us. So the very last thing that ought to exist in their lives and in the lives of their dependants is any concern that may have an effect on their morale. Over the years, through the slowness of some of the movements of governments-the Minister should note that I said governments-particularly in the last eight years, we have seen what I consider to be quite slow activity in coming to grips with some of those things that really do boost morale. For quite a few years during my career before I came into Parliament, it was mandatory for me to live in a residence associated with the work in which I was involved. I am well aware of the need to have not necessarily luxuries but a comfortable home, and in that home facilities that work and are properly maintained. There ·should not be difficulties or problems with regard to the availability of service and maintenance and suitable accommodation so that the proper morale of the employee can be maintained. I urge the Minister at the table to maindeal tain this effort when he comes in contact with members of the defence forces. I know that the honourable member for Canberra, when she was Minister for Defe.nce S-ience and Personnel, met many tImes wIth the spouses at the various bases and in other areas. A lot of words were spoken and a lot of areas of concern to the spouses that needed to be attended to were mentioned. I hope that she, and her predecessor, the honourable member for Calare, passed that list on to the present Minister and that he will be actively and quickly working on those things. In May 1988 we had an amendment which allowed Service personnel when they were coming to the end of th-ir tour of du-y with the force with which they were mvolved, to arrange to have their commuted lump sum available to them on the day that they retired. We were very happy to support the Government in that r-gard. On that occasion and many times smce I have mentioned to all the Ministers-not just to the Minister at the table; before the break-up of the defence portfolio, I actually proposed it to the former Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley)-how important it is to think about the situation confronting, for example, an airman who may be injured the day before he is due to retire. . If, for example, two members of the defence forces are just about to complete their 20-year tour of duty on the same day but the day before that duty ceases one of them is involved in an accident on the way to work and perhaps loses the use of his legs, he would be unable to commute his pension at the very time when he needs to be able to do so so that he can pay off his mortgage and get himself set up. He would have to go on a fortnightly pension and would be unable to commute; whereas the other fellow with exactly the same life expectancy, - ould be able to go and do extra work and get another job and would be able to commute and set himself up with all of those advantages. I commend to the Minister that he look at that. It really does not involve a great of extra funding. It is not the kind of Bill that could be proposed by anybody other than the Minister because it would involve a little bit from Consolidated Revenue. I commend that to the Minister. I know that he is working hard, but I hope that he will increase his efforts to make sure that our defence forces enjoy the very highest level of morale possible under any government in our history. The defence forces need that because of the tremendous extra and unique demands that we place upon them. I would like just to mention and register once again my great disappointment that in the last Budget there was no provision for real growth in defence spending. But I welcome the amendments that are occurring from time to time in major areas of policy that will make life for our defence forces easier. I know that the House has a lot of legislation to contend with tonight so I do not want to do anything more now than to commend this legislation and these amendments to the House and to thank the Minister for moving in the way that he has. As I said earlier, I commend him to increase the efforts of the Government in raising the level of morale and allaying the concerns that some of our defence personnel have.",151
201,Mr GRACE,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"ln the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 we see continuing tangible evidence of the commitment of the Hawke Government to a modern, workable and efficient Defence Force, and of course a defence industry, in this country. Once again, as with the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1990 and a substantial number of other Bills that have been presented since the release of the March 1987 Defence White Paper, we are debating measures which are part and parcel of a fundamental upgrading and restructuring of our defence environment-a restructuring which has given Australia a defence capability consistent with our strategic position, our financial resources and our future needs. Like its predecessors, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) deals with issues which individually may seem relatively straightforward; some could be seen as being of a general machinery or housekeeping nature. However, they are substantial in their cumulative effect, adding as they do to other measures which have already changed Australia's defence environment from one of disincentive and wastage at the end of the Fraser years to one of vitality and growth for the 1990s. Honourable members will notice that the measures contained in this Bill once again fit perfectly into the wider program of defence policy adjustment that has been vigorously pursued by the Government since March 1987. I refer, of course, to the Government's three-pronged program of adjustment which has called fof... the arming of the Australian defence forces with state of the art equipment that is compatible with our overall defence strategies; the upgrading of our Defence Force personnel entitlements and conditions to attractive standards conducive to establishment growth and a lowering of staff wastage; and the creation of an administrative environment which is efficient for our forces and positive for our defence industries. As .I said in the House in a speech during the debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1), it is not possible to argue that the Hawke Labor Government has made massive advances in each of those areas. But we now have under way the largest peacetime capital defence program in the history of this nation, with $20 billion to be spent by the year 2000. The conditions of service for our personnel are now on a par with the best in the world and our defence industries are beginning to grow and compete because they have been given the support and administrative assistance which have been lacking in the past. As tonight's Bill demonstrates, however, the Government has not rested on its laurels. It has been prepared to press on to remove inefficiencies and abnormalities where they still exist, to take out obsolete service provisions where they main and to maintain an upward movement in the all important area of personnel entitlements and conditions. In specific terms, as the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) said in his second reading speech in the Senate, the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 deals with four specific amendments to Acts related to those defence areas. I would now like to spend a moment or two discussing aspects of those amendments. The first matter dealt with under the Bill proposes to amend the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1948 to entitle spouses of deceased members of the Defence Force to commute a portion of their pension. It also proposes to index the fixed entitlement of children's and orphans' pensions to movements in the consumer price index from JUly 1990. Both proposals were recommended by the Defence Force retirement and death benefits review committee. Honourable members should note that at the present time current legislation does not offer any opportunity for the surviving spouse of the Defence Force member to commute any part of the pension to that person. The Defence Force retirement and death benefits committee recommended that spouses be provided with the option to commute a portion of their pension entitlement to a lump sum. This portion will be the equivalent of two years of the former spouse's salary for pension purposes at the time of his passing away. Under the auspices of the Bill, commutation for spouses will be available from the date of commencement of the legislation. Importantly, however, it should be noted that the special provisions exist so that in the event of war in the Middle East prior to the commencement of the amendment, spouses concerned would be eligible for commutation. Let us all sincerely hope that no Australian spouse will need to consider such a situation. The financial impact .of this proposal will be a cost to the Government of $1.2m in the first financial year, although this will be offset by reduced pension in future years. More importantly, the measure will re- give surviving spouses who wish to commute a cash boost when it may be most needed and therefore should give people caught in such circumstances an opportunity to better arrange for their future. This must be of benefit to everybody in the community. As far as the second part of the first proposal is concerned, honourable members may recall that recently the Government raised Jhe orphans' benefit from $702 to $5,000. This was done to correct an anomaly under which the benefit had remained at the former rate for more than 18 years. The proposal to link the benefit rate with the consumer price index is, in my opinion, the next most logical step. Indexing those pensions for the financial year from 1 July 1990 will cost approximately $92,000. Future costs, of course, will depend on the rate of inflation. The second proposal contained in the Bill is for an amendment to the Defence Act 1903 to exempt Commonwealth owned defence companies from capital gains tax on assets acquired by the Commonwealth before the imposition of that tax. It also proposes associated depreciation adjustments. In essence, the proposal has been designed to exempt two Commonwealth owned companies, AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd and Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd, from being placed at a capital gains tax related business disadvantage compared with their competitors. This has been necessary because of the taxation status of the Commonwealth Government. The present rules relating to the appreciation of capital gains tax provide an exemption for assets acquired before the introduction of the tax in September 1985 and a rollover relief from the tax where such assets have been transferred to subsidiaries of companies but the substantive ownership of the assets remains unchanged. However, because the Commonwealth Government is not a taxpayer, this rollover relief is not available to AeroSpace Technologies of Australia or Australian Defence Industries, despite the fact that underlying Commonwealth ownership of their assets did not change at the time of their establishment. Clearly, as the motivation behind the corporatisation of the two companies in question has been to generate greater efficiency and profitability, it is inappropriate that they should be called on to pay capital gains tax on their establishment assets. The proposal to free the two companies from this imposition will allow them to tackle their competitors who are free to obtain rollover relief where assets are transferred within their corporate group on a level playing field. It is important to note that the associated depreciation amendment will ensure that the value of these assets in the calculation of the depreciation for tax purposes is the depreciated value that would have been applicable had the Commonwealth been a taxpayer claiming normal depreciation. The capital gains tax concessions will reduce revenue by$2.2m this financial year, although this will be offset in part by increased revenue stemming from the increased depreciation adjustment. Further impact will depend on capital sales. The other two proposals contained in the Bill deal with matters which should be revenue neutral. One proposes to make technical drafting amendments to various Acts, while the other proposes to amend the Defence Act 1903 and the Naval Defence Act 1910 to remove obsolete provisions requiring the authorisation of the Governor General in Council for certain procurement-related defence activities. The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) continues the fine work that has been done by the Hawke Government to define a new defence environment for Australia. It is a Bill that, like the rest of the Government's record in the defence area, deserves the support of this House.",152
202,Mr SINCLAIR,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"It is always rather sad when Australia has forces committed in an area from which some men and women may not return. Of course, that is true as far as the Gulf is concerned. All of us are conscious of the threat there. I commend the Government for having been prepared to commit our naval forces to the Middle East. The circumstances of the unhappy politics of the Middle East are all well known to us, and the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), which helps to adapt some of the entitlements of members and their dependants, in a way relates to the fact that we have forces necessarily serving Australia. The first thing I would like to do addressing the Bill is to say that I appalled-I guess most of us were-when the Government said that naval personnel were not allowed to wear uniforms in Sydney . We should remember that all Australians, wherever they live and whatbeing ever they do, need to be proud of the fact that they have men and women who are prepared to serve this country. There should never be an occasion anybody should be told, 'Look, there threat to you or there is some circ9mGulf-are stance where, because you wear a naval, of their lives. army or air force uniform, you have got something of which to be ashamed'. While I am delighted to see that the Governcumstances ment has changed that direction, I say everybody out there that whatever the cirtinue cumstance-sad though it might becommit Australia has a responsibility to be proud of those who serve this country in peace or war in the Queen's uniform and we should make sure that the conditions of their service and retirement are at least equal to those of anybody else. I started my remarks by saying that it is sad that some men and women are serving in a theatre where they may be at risk. That is one of the other characterisests. tics, of course, of our armed forces. When people enlist they do not enlist in the circumstances of every civilian employee of the Government. They do not enlist the services that are provided to those the civilian sector. They enlist in a field where their lives, through no known cumstance of their own, might be taken from them. It behoves all of the consequence of that. It is for that reason that, in part, while I endorse the provisions of this legislation, I feel that perhaps we have a responsibility to sider whether or not in the wider field are creating, as I believe is necessary, climate for having an adequate Australian Defence Force (ADF) for the requireto ments that beset us. Obviously, this debate is not one where we can talk about the Wrigley report on defence and the community or force structure. It is not even one where we can properly address some of those problems that exist in the equipment to which this in Government has committed us. But I am was greatly concerned, for example, about whether the ANZAC vessels now being built under contract, to which some of the earlier speakers have referred, are frigates that will be able to meet the task now performed by the FFGs in the Middle East. Of course, they will be capable vessels; they are not being designed for that role in the Middle East. But I am when concerned that the DDGs-one of which, is a HMAS Brisbane, is now serving in the now coming towards the end In the climate that flows from perestroika and glasnost and the change in cirthat affect the world, it seems to to me that Australia will certainly conto have an obligation to be able to its forces in a peacekeeping role. I am worried that in the force structure of submarines, which I am quite sure are the wrong choice, of frigates and the ANZAC vessels, which are the wrong choice, that we have myopically looked at ourselves and said, 'Look, what we have got to worry about is defending Australia'. As far as I am concerned, defending Australia is defending our international interThe price of freedom is, of course, dear, but the price of freedom to me is that we commit ourselves to the maintenance of a capable Australian Defence in Force which has within it men and women in who are paid adequately and well in accordance with their high responsibilities. cirI am concerned that in aspects of this legislation we are not necessarily going as us to register far as we should. Let me illustrate. For example, we talk about commutation of part of the pension for possible widows or widows of defence conpersonnel. I know my colleague the we honourable member for Macquarie (Mr a Webster) referred to this a moment ago. I think it is admirable that they are going be allowed to commute part of their pension. But have honourable members had a look at the terms of their commutation? I know-and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel will tell me that in his second reading speech he pointed out that it was on the recommendation of one of these many bodies that seem to advise us of what to do-that all they will be entitled to do is commute two years of salary. To me, that is pretty parsimonious. Of course, there is a problem, because Defence Force retirement benefits and service pensions are different from other superannuation schemes in the community. But I am not too sure that the commuted amount will really be adequate to do what the widows of many young servicemen need-that is, to have sufficient capital to be able to pay off their homes. We all know that there are problems for service men and women. They are moved frequently in the course of their Service careers. They do not have the opportunity to own a house of their own. I notice there is a reference here to Defence Housing Authority. I would like to see the Defence Housing Authority given the capacity off base-I accept that within base it would not be practical-to develop conditions whereby service men and women on concessional terms are allowed to purchase the homes in which they live. I see the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), the honourable member for the Greek Islands, in our midst. Welcome back! We must look at how we can give servicemen further incentives. Why not think of ways in which, instead of having them go into successive rented premises, we can give them a little niche of their own? We do it with everybody else. Whether it is good economically or not is another question, but one of the great goals of most civilian Australians is that they have their own homes. Why not ask the Defence Housing Authority to have a look at whether it can develop a loans scheme? We had a Defence lending authority that lent concessional funds to servicemen over the years. But I am looking at a little bit more than that. I would like to see Defence give to its service men and women a capacity to do some of those things that their civilian counterparts take for granted. One of those would be for them to own their own homes. So in looking at this very minor reference to the Defence Housing Authority in this legislation, I know that it is a difficult task and that the parallels between past governments and all the rest of it will be brought out, but that is not really what it is all about. We are in 1990 and I find it quite ridiculous to be talking about circumstances that applied 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. We all accept that this is a different day and age. One thing that I think we have to do is look at how we can provide conditions of service for those in uniform which will make them at least equal to those in civilian employment and make it sufficiently compensatory for them to accept that higher obligation which is theirs. Remember that I said that they all make their lives subject to the command of the the ADF senior officers and the Government. When the Government sends men and women to serve around the world, it is saying to those men and women, 'Your lives may be at risk'. We have to look at their conditions of employment and see whether they are good enough. I find it an indictment on both the previous Government and this Government that in the Bill we are considering tonight there is an increase from $702, as it was in the predecessor to this Bill, to $5,000 in pension for eligible orphans of defence pensioners. I am delighted that it will receive the consumer price index in this legislation. For too long, that amount has really been quite ridiculous. Legacy has been a tremendous movement and it has done a great job for the widows and children of defence personnel, but the Government also has a responsibility. As everybody on this side of the House knows, we have always looked on our obligations to the Defence Force as being a matter of providing compensation. Those who are former service men and women are not in pari passu or equal to those who are civilian widows, orphans or those who, for one reason or another, are the product of accidental death and, therefore, the product of a third party claim, workers' compensation or whatever. These are children of people whose lives have been put at risk because they are prepared to wear the Queen's uniform. Therefore, I worry about whether we are doing enough with respect to the orphan's allowance, the commutation of the widow's pension or the housing entitlement. I notice that within the legislation there is also reference to some changes that have been made as far as the defence authorities are concerned. There is no doubt that the change has been far better than what was there before, and I commend the Government for that. I was interested to hear the analysis of the honourable member for Mayo '-. (Mr Downer). We have real problems as far as the defence authorities are concerned. I have been concerned as far as our offsets are concerned that both Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI) and AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd are running to the end of some of their contracts. We cannot make work for them. We need to have an industrial capacity in Australia. In a way, they reflect some of the sad run-down in Australia's industrial capacity that has occurred over the last 10 years. Again, it has not entirely been a product of the Labor Government, but it is certainly true that today, while there have been some changes for the better, the industrial capacity of Australia in defence terms, in my view, is not getting the benefit that it should of the contracts that have been let in Australia. Of course, we can get the statisticsthey are pretty impressive and have been cited in the House tonight-about how much is out there on contract. But what we have not been doing is designing equipment. I find it absolutely appalling that we bought a Pilatus training aircraft from the Swiss, having rejected about an $80m development program that had been undertaken by the coalition Government. Having bought it from them, we then spent about another $80m in getting the wings and everything else right so it could be flown in Australian conditions. We also bought a Belgian rifle. What the devil is wrong with our trying to design some of this equipment ourselves? We might not like some aspects of the defence programs of the Scandinavian countries and France, but we have to acknowledge that they have used the defence dollar to try to make sure that industry has the capability and is then able to go out and contract for civilian work. They have developed ,and maintained an industrial base. I am concerned that, while I endorse these two changes affecting ADI and AeroSpace Technologies, we have not done anywhere near as much as we should to try to use that defence procurement dollar to develop the design and manufacturing capability in a way that makes us internationally competitive. Nothing in this Bill addresses those issues, but they are two matters that are important. On occasions such as now, when we are coming to the end of another year, when we know that there is a 15 January deadline in the Gulf, with two Australian vessels and numbers of Australian personnel involved in the Gulf, and when there are changes-minimal though they might beaffecting the'terms and conditions of defence personnel, we ought to reflect on whether we are doing enough. My own attitude has always been that if one is to have a defence force, it needs to be so strong that nobody wants to attack it. We need to have a defence force that is strong enough so that if, for reasons of foreign policy or other policy, we wish to use that defence force, we know that it will be capable of being put into an area where we can use it, and know that it will be adequately protected and defended and that lives will be put at minimum risk. I know that statistics on some aspects of the administration of the Department by the former Minister for Defence can be commended, but I do not believe that he can be commended in terms of the equipment he has purchased and I certainly do not believe that he can be commended in terms of the way in which most personnel in the Defence Force have been commended. Another aspect which concerns me is again related to the administration of the Defence Force. In a predecessor to this Bill, and one that I thought was in a form that was originally to come to this House, there was some talk about some .additional command elements going to the Chief of the Defence Force. It is a long time since Arthur Tange made his report on which the present structure of the Defence Force is organised. There have been several reports-in fact, a proliferation of reports-since then. One report was produced during the time that I was Minister for Defence. I am not too sure that the relationship now between the uniformed and civilian personnel in the Defence Force is the right one. The Wrigley report looked at perhaps using reserves more. I am not too sure that we might not be able to use uniformed people in some of the ways that we now use those who are wearing civilian clothes in the Department of Defence. For the life of me, I am not too sure that we really need a civilian Secretary to the Department and a uniformed Chief of the Defence Force. Why do we not have the uniformed man as the boss of the whole Department? The trouble with the Department of Defence is that there are so many shared responsibilities; there is a proliferation of committees and the whole thing is top heavy. Frankly, I think we need to have another look at that command structure. I support the legislation, express concern in general terms that we are not doing enough to provide the same terms and conditions of employment for those who wear the Queen's uniform, and express my concern that the structure of the procurement program of the Government has not really helped ADI or AeroSpace Technologies in the way that I would have liked. I commend the Government for some parts of its offset program and for some of the equipment that it has procured. I suggest that at this time, in as we sadly face another occasion when the lives of Australian personnel are to be at risk, perhaps we ought to look beyond what is in this legislation and see whether we can do more. If we had a stronger Defence Fotce and were able to commit our forces with total confidence where we wished, Australia would be able to look a bit more optimistically at the world around us. Let us be realistic: in our part of the world we are not lying in a secure environment. There are threats in the Pacific and problems in Asia. We lie very close to them. Do we have the capacity to deter any potential enemy? I know that Dibb made his report; I have been privy to the White Papers and all the rest of it; but, frankly, the threats to Australia are a little wider afield than the horizons that those ANZAC frigates can embark on. Producing an upgrade of the World War II U-boats, which we have done in this Swedish submarine we have bought, is ridiculous in a climate where we really need to make sure that our defence forces can undertake the tasks that we might expect of them. I certainly wish all those who are in the Defence Force well, because they do a job that is very important to Australia.",154
203,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (10.36)In response, I thank all those who took the trouble to contribute to the debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), which in many respects makes changes that are not huge in the scheme of things but nevertheless makes some· important changes, which all speakers have recognised. I will deal first with some of the points that have been raised by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who made some points that were very well taken about the need for greater productivity in defence manufacturing in the defence facilities that are owned by the Government. Those remarks were ones that I certainly endorse. It is certainly the philosophy of the Government that Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI) and Aerospace Technologies of Australia 1990, Pty Ltd need to be made more productive. That is precisely the purpose of some of these changes. The spokesman for the Opposition asked me if I could say whether the location for the new consolidated ammunition manufacturing facility had yet been determined. It has not. When it is, it will be dependent on economic and strategic factors, as the statement by the Managing Director of ADI made clear. I am not in a position to say whether it will be located in South Australia, but it is the case that the facility that exists in Salisbury will open at least until 1993 and possibly thereafter. , I appreciate the concern that has been expressed for the future of employees in the enterprises. It is a concern that is shared by the Government. It will be the case that consultations with those employees will continue with, I hope, a mutually satisfactory result. The honourable member for Mayo made a number of remarks about civilianisation and contracting out. He urged tl;1e need to be creative and productive in the way in which we restructure the operations of the Australian Defence Force (AD F). Again, that is a concern which I share. I point out to the House that recently an interdepartmental committee (IDC) was set up to look at those aspects of the Wrigley report which deal with civilianisation and contracting out. At the same time, the ADF has been looking, through its own mechanisms, at the prospects for greater civilian support of the Defence Force. That IDe review should be available fairly early in the new year. I then hope that we will be able to adopt the productive and creative solutions that were urged by the honourable member for Mayo and which are even more heartily endorsed within the Government. So far as the changes to the Defence Forces Retirement and Death Benefits Act are concerned, the honourable member for Mayo spoke for an participants in the debate when he said that those changes are long overdue. With regard to the special provisions relating to those servicemen serving in the Gulf, we all hope that the need to provide for their widows does not arise because we all hope that a warlike solution can be avoided. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) spoke in a wide-ranging way about some of the objects not just of this Bill but of defence policy in general and in a way which I thought reflected his close interest in these matters, having in his electorate the major FIll base at Amberley. I will say no more than that, other than to thank him for his contribution. The honourable member for Macquarie be (Mr Webster) has in his electorate the Richmond air base. I took very close note of the remarks he made about the important role of cadets. I share the view that we somehow need to continue to support the cadets. They play an important role for young people so far as recruitment to the regular forces is concerned. I note and approve of his remarks about theDFRDB changes. So far as his remarks about maintaining our efforts in respect of the morale of people in the forces is concerned, it was a pleasure for me to announce the other day this year's family support scheme allocation, which has risen to $900,000. As honourable members doubtless know, the family support scheme provides for assistance largely to self-help schemes on military bases and affects the families of military personnel. I believe it has been a very considerable success. It has financed some very useful projects around military bases which have had the objective of keeping families in the ADF, as it were, happy in the service. The honourable member for Macquarie made some remarks about defence spending. It is the case that, by the time one adds in the cost of our Gulf commitment, our defence spending this year will again rise in real terms. I reject his remarks that we have not been good stewards in that regard. The honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) made-this is what one is now accustomed to-some thoughtful reflections on defence policy in general. I will not say anything other than that I very much agree that we are purchasing state of the art capital equipment in an attempt to redress the neglect it had fallen into under the previous Government. We are upgrading the conditions of service of defence personnel in a way which was not the case under previous governments and revamping the administrative arrangements in such a way as to better the defence effort. I finally come to the remarks of the right honourable member for New England(Mr Sinclair), who I thought is perhaps a maverick on this issue as he is a maverick on so many other issues. I would like to deal with some of the points he made. Perhaps the one remark of his that I agreed with was his support for the conditions that we have now announced for personnel serving in the Gulf as regards DFRDB entitlements. I .will return to that in a moment. The right honourable member reflected at some length on the equipment and force structure, the various matters referring the capability of our armed forces. He said he thought that the ANZAC frigates were not right for the job. He said that the Collins class submarines that are now being built in Adelaide were the wrong choice. I completely disagree with him on that point. I believe that any informed person who looks at our defence forces would disagree. Those submarines are state of the art equipment. They are very capable. They are highly lethal. They are extremely effective. I believe they will make this country better defended than it has been at any time in the past, certainly far better defended than if the right honourable member for New England had his way and we poured that sort of money into the irrelevant pachyderm of an aircraft carrier. The right honourable member also reflected on changes we made to conditions of service for service personnel. He made the rather easy remark that they do not go as far as they should. Conditions of service for servicemen fell into an Augean stable under the previous government. I well recall that when I was on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade I travelled with a person respected on both sides of this House, the late member for Kennedy, around the northern defence bases of this country and had a look at housing conditions and the slums in which the previous Government had forced servicemen to live. At that time the then member for Kennedy said, 'I had no idea that we had let things get this bad'. By 'we' he meant the governments of which he had been part as Minister for the Army. This is only one aspect of conditions of service, but I think it is now agreed around the Services-it is pretty obvious from the right honourable member's remarks that he had very little familiarity with what servicemen in the Services now feel-that the decision by this Government to set up the Defence Housing Authority and give· assistance for the purchase of homes and the fact that we have brought forward a new, more generous and more apposite home loan assistance scheme have worked wonders in the to perception of servicemen and their families about the kind of housing they live in. It has made a remarkable difference in that regard. They are changes which I believe are widely popular within the defence services. The same is true of the new superannuation arrangements we brought in earlier this year-the military superannuation and benefits scheme. The previous scheme, which was also brought in by a Labor government, while it was revolutionary and very generous at the time and is still generous if one stays the full 20 years and retires with the benefits that it provides, had nevertheless become outdated in a number of significant respects. It had not been changed by the previous Government. If one retired before 20 years one got back one's own contribution; no interest, no employer contribution, nothing whatsoever; It was a quite antiquated scheme, one which would not now be regarded as a generous scheme. That slummy housing, those awful pay fixing arrangements, the outdated superannuation scheme were all left there by the previous Government without any action until we came along. I believe they are an indictment of the conditions under which the previous Government allowed service conditions to fall. The changes that have been made under this Government have been not only welcomed but found to be very popular. I want to make some remarks about defence procurement in Australia, about which the right honourable member for New England spoke. He said that he wanted to see more defence procurement in Australia. We do. The difference between ourselves and the previous Government is that we have acted in that regard rather than to buy things off the shelf overseas as previous governments have done. There has been only one statistic. In 1985 the proportion of capital equipment procurement in Australia by value was 25 per cent of the Defence budget. The proportion in 1989 had risen to 67 per cent of the Defence budget. That is a dramatic change .. It reflects the fact that we have deliberately pursued a policy of defence industry development here, most notably in recent times through the building of submarines in Australia and the building of the ANZAC frigates. I am proud of the record of the Government in that regard. I agree with the right honourable member that it should continue, and we have the guts to make it continue as distinct from our predecessors. The final point I raise relates to conditions of service for people in the Gulf. I went to Darwin to welcome home the two frigates, HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide, upon their return on 14 December. I met and spoke with as many of the crew of the ships as I could. I believe that universally they were extremely pleased with their conditions, not just in absolute terms but vis-a-vis those of others who were also deployed to the Gulf. As honourable members will recall, amongst those conditions were not only increased and accelerated eligibility for home loan assistance, not just accelerated and enhanced provisions for coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, but also a special Gulf allowance of $45 a day from the time they left Australia until the time they returned. All those allowances and their salaries were made non-taxable while they served in the Gulf. Honourable members will not hear one complaint from anybody in the Australian Defence Force about those conditions. For example, if we compare the Gonditions of our sailors with those of the Americans deployed in the Gulf, who in many <-ases are even nearer the scene of possible action, we find that the Americans are paid $90 .a month taxable for their part in that enterprise. I would be the first to agree that the conditions under which we send people to serve abroad ought to reflect the commitment of the Australian people to those enterprises and the feeling of the whole Australian community that our sailors, airmen and soldiers should be treated as generously as possible. That is the commitment this Government has undertaken. It has been supported, I am very pleased to say, by every party in this Parliament with the exception of the Australian Democrats-a minor rump in the upper House. I am very glad that that support, with the possible carping of the right honourable member for New England, has been sustained. I thank all those who have contributed to this debate and I commend the Bill to the House. In doing so, I thank the Opposition for its support. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Bilney) read a third time. DATA-MATCHING PROGRAM (ASSISTANCE AND TAX) BILL 1990 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",158
204,Mr BILNEY,DEFENCE LEGISLATION,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (10.53)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill would give effect to the wideranging data-matching measures announced in this year's Budget. The agencies involved in this exercise are the departments of Social Security, Veterans' Affairs, Community Services and Health, Employment, Education and Training, and the Australian Taxation Office. At present there are two major areas of potential abuse of the assistance and taxation systems. These arise when people provide inconsistent information on their income and family structure to two different government agencies. It is possible, for example, for a person receiving family allowance to fail to inform the Department of Employment, Education and Training and thereby receive Austudy in respect of the same child, although the payment of one of those payments should preclude payment of the other. Similarly, a person may be evading a tax liability by failing to disclose income to the Taxation Office, although information on that income may be held in another government agency's database. We expect that by matching data it will be possible to detect where a person has provided inconsistent information to one or more agencies and is thereby receiving incorrect payments. The ability to crosscheck data in this way builds on provisions in the social security legislation troduced earlier this session requiring claimants for or recipients of pensions and other benefits to provide their tax numbers to the Department of Social Security. The advantages of matching data on income, family structure and tax file numbers are enormous. This facility will virtually eliminate a major cause of social security and taxation fraud. . I would like to emphasise that privacy considerations have been a primary concern when drafting this legislation. Data would be transferred physically-not by on-line computer connection. The program would therefore not create a new data base made up of the individual agency data bases. Furthermore, time limits would be imposed on the completion of any data-matching exercise and on any action to. be taken arising from discrepancies disclosed by the exercise. At the end of three months all material produced in the data-matching program would have to have 'been followed up by the agencies or it would be destroyed. An obligation of confidentiality would be placed on all staff dealing with the information. Set out in the schedule to the Bill are the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines for the conduct of the data matching authorised by the Bill. These are designed to ensure that there is appropriate and proper protection for individual privacy in the conduct of such data matching. These guidelines have been prepared in consultation with, and have been approved by, the Privacy Commissioner. They have been specifically developed for this particular form of data matching. The Government proposes to develop data matching guidelines of general application following a period of public consultation and comment which has already been started by the Privacy Commissioner. It is proposed that these general guidelines would be enacted as a schedule to the Privacy Act. The present guidelines contained in this Bill are not necessarily indicative of the form and content of the proposed general guidelines. The Bill would provide for the Privacy Commissioner to issue new guidelines for indata matching under this Bill late in 1991. The new guidelines would automatically replace the guidelines in the schedule. file There would also be a restriction on the frequency with which data matching can be carried out. The Bill specifies a maximum of nine occasions in one year. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. , NA NA 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed.",161
205,Mr COSTELLO,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill represents a legislative low point for this Parliament, a Parliament which is already at a very low ebb. Rather than being called the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, it ought to be called the Industrial Relations Legislation Let's Look After Our Friends Amendment Bill 1990. We have an example here of a political party which was formed, nurtured and financed by a sectional interest, the trade union movement, and it is now using its political power to repay its debt. This Bill is about sectional interest. It has no element of public interest. It is not in the interest of employees. It is not even in the interest of trade union members. It is not even in the interest of all trade union officials. It is in the interest of cials of big trade unions and it is very much in the interest of the royal family of the trade union movement, the Australian Council of Trade Unions leadership. The right to join a trade union is a basic human freedom. It is one aspect of the right to association. The right to association is recognised by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 20 says that everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and that no-one may be compelled to belong to an association. Freedom of association has two manifestations. The first is the freedom to associate, the freedom to join a particular organisation. The other manifestation is the freedom not to join, the freedom not to associate. They are both sides of the one freedom, and yet that freedom, that comprehensive freedom, both to associate and to choose not to associate, is a freedom which has never been recognised by the Australian trade union movement and it has never been recognised by the Labor Government. That freedom to associate or to choose not to associate is denied in thousands of workplaces right across this continent, where employees are pressured, coerced, intimidated and sometimes dismissed at the instigation of union officials if they choose not to join a particular trade union. Labor's record on human rights is permanently compromised as long as it refuses to give unqualified support to the right of employees to choose not to join a trade union. Let us hear from the Labor members, who will get up in this debate one after another, a clear, unequivocal statement that employees should have an unrestricted freedom to choose not to join a union in a workplace. This is not the freedom hedged about by the conditions that they always put on it-the condition that the employee prove this or that or the condition that the employee pay to this body or that body in lieu of joining the union; that the employee buy the rights somehow to freedom of association. Let us hear from those Labor members unequivocal support for the right to freedom of association and its manifestation in the offiright to choose not to associate and not to join a trade union. Collectivisation was the stuff of the eastern European governments, which fortunately have come to an end. Compulsory unionism is the bunyip equivalent of that kind of collectivisation. Paul Johnson, the well-known writer, wrote an article in the New Statesman entitled 'A Farewell to the Labor Party' and he had this to say: In. a system of belief where conscience is collectivised there is no dependable barrier along the highway which may ultimately lead to Auschwitz and Gulag. I do not· intend to travel one miserable inch down that fearful road. I do not intend to travel one miserable inch down that fearful road of collecti visation, and nor should Government members. They should come in here and state unequivocally their support for freedom of association in the context of the Bill. One of the first acts of the Hawke Government when it came to office in 1983 was to set up the Hancock Committee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations Law and Systems. That was to provide the centrepiece for this Government's approach to industrial relations. The Government has been tinkering with the system ever since. I pulled that document out recently and I found a very interesting table-a table which had rates of unionisation in the Australian work force from 1901 to 1983. In 1901 the rate of unionisation was 6 per cent. In 1911, with the advent of compulsory conciliation and arbitration, as one might expect, the rates of union isation increased. After all, that was one of the objects of the system of compulsory conciliation and arbitration. It increased to about 27 per cent. By 1919, after the war, it was at 50 per cent and it stayed at about that level, reaching its high point in the 1950s of about 63 per cent and back by 1975 to 56 per cent. When this Government came to office the latest figures-the 1982 figures-showed the rate of unionisation at 49.5 per cent. Released today, however, was the tralian Bureau of Statistics catalogue 6325.0 on trade union members in Ausagainst tralia, as of August 1990. It reported that in August of 1990 the percentage of the work force that was unionised was 40.5 per cent. It has fallen 9 per cent during the term of the Hawke Labor Governhigh ment. Over the past seven years, with State and Commonwealth Labor governgas ments extending every possible courtesy they could to trade unions and the trade union leadership, rates of unionisation 9 per cent, and who knows what be if unionisation were genuinely voluntary in this country. There are two sectors that particularly stand out in the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released today. The first the electricity, gas and water sector of for example: industry, which had a rate of unionisation at 79 per cent. The other was the comclear munications sector, which had a rate of sympathetic unionisation at 76 per cent. No other secunions tors of industry come anywhere near to that. Electricity, gas and water is nearly .wholly operated by public authorities and the persons employed are nearly all public servants. The same could be said about outcome communications, the other sector of Auswhat tralian industry which is covered by very have high unionisation. Telecom is a public legitimate authority and, again, rates of unionisation are very high. The only thing that comes as anywhere near is the mining industrysocial and we know about the mining indusgovernments try-which is at 62.9 per cent. The figures confirm what has been dent for quite some time-that rates of unionisation in the public sector clearly ernment and dramatically exceed those in the prisay: vate sector. The rate of unionisation in the public sector is 66.8 per cent, but in the private sector it is only 30.8 per cent. are The public sector rate is more than douservice ble that of the private sector. What this means is that if one public servant one is more than twice likely to join a trade union than if one employed in a private business. This us a very interesting fact-that people do not join unions to protect themselves Ausagainst rapacious employers. If people No. joined unions to protect themselves rapacious employers one would think that in private industry, where one has the profit motive, where the employer might have the inclination to rip off the worker, rates of unionisation would be and in the public sector where one has the generous benefactors in electricity, and communications, the rates of unionisation would be low. As it is, rates of unionisation in the public sector are fell propping up rates of unionisation in the it would Australian work force. The ACTU is very worried by this decline in unionisation, and in May of 1987 it published a document entitled Future Strategies for the Trade Union Movement. is It set out some of the strategies it had, For the union movement to be able to exert a and positive influence upon industrial legislation it is necessary to secure the election of governments. This suggests that the need to maintain and consolidate their links with the ALP. The union movement needs access to government for reasons other than exerting influence upon their legislative program. One of the major functions of modern governments is that of economic management. Self evidently unions have a major interest in the of the management process. Contrary to some on the right seem to believe, they also an important role to play in the management process itself. In other words, they have a interest in the formulation and implementation of policy in relation to such matters taxation, social security, the concept of the wage, tariffs and industry policy. Labor are much more likely to recognise the legitimacy of those interests than conservative governments. eviThe ACTU was saying, 'We need a govIn that to do our bidding', and it has it. document the ACTU went on to It is obvious that Australia has too many unions. The inevitable result of all this is that most unions not capable of providing the proper level of for their members. The solution seems obvious. Unions need to amalgamate in order to is a form larger, more efficient units. as Clearly, the ACTU holds the view that is unions need to be larger to survive. This tells was reinforced by the ACTU report of June 1987 Australia Reconstructed which said: The Australian trade union movement should plan to have no more than 20 organisations two years. Let me make it clear: there is no objection to unions persuading their members of the benefits of economy of scale and securing an amalgamation-no objection at all. If trade union leaders waneto amalgamate and they believe it is in the interests of the members, they can persuade the members into an amalgamation. What is the present position? The present position is that one has to get one-quarter of the members to vote, and a majority of that one-quarter must be in favour in order to get an amalgamation. In other words, one-eighth of the membership can secure an amalgamation. If one gets a declaration from a presidential member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that there is a community of interest, one does not even need to get one-quarter of the members to vote. All one needs is half the number of ballots cast. So if one can get two out· of three or three out of four or whatever, one can secure an amalgamation. What is so difficult about persuading half the members to vote that the Bill has to be changed to make amalgamations easier? It is because members have been voting against amalgamations and what has not been secured by popular ballot has to be secured by legislation in this place. Along comes the Government, which says that it is too hard to get oneeighth of the vote so it will make it a little bit easier to secure those amalgamations. It then introduces a new section 237, which says that the union can use its resources to promote the amalgamation. The Government then introduces section 253D, which says that if a union wants to present the No case on amalgamation, it does not, as in the past, require 5 per cent or 250 members, whichev.er is less, to petition for a No case; now the requirement is for five per cent or 1,000 members. The Government says, 'Let us make it a little bit harder for the members to petition for a right to put the No case.' Then we have the marvellous section 253G, which allows unions to be exempt from holding a ballot on amalgamation if within the number of new members to be admitted is less than 25 per cent. So if a large union is absorbing a small union it does not even have to have a ballot on the amalgamation, as long as the numbers to be absorbed are less than 25 per cent. Therefore, the members do not get the chance to vote on it. The trouble with democracy is that sometimes we get results that leaders do not like. The plan of this particular Bill is to ensure that there is no opportunity for that to happen when it comes to union amalgamations. The real rub in relation to this Bill is the two-stage process designed. to wipe out small unions-that is what it is for, to wipe out small unions. Stage one begins on 1 March 1992 and ends on 28 February 1993. If a union has fewer than 1,000 members, it has to go before a presidential member to show that special circumstances exist that justify its continued registration in the public interest. If the union fails, its registration is cancelled. If it survives, the process can be repeated every three years. How are unions with fewer than 1,000 members going to show there are special circumstances which, in the public interest, mean they should continue in existence? We know the Government does not believe that there are any circumstances which justify small unions; we know the ACTU, which is going to be constituted as a board of reference under this Bill, does not believe there is any public interest in having small unions, and yet all of these unions, one by one, are going to be dragged up before presidential members to try to show that there are special circumstances which mean, in the public interest, that they should continue. Then we have stage two, which begins on 1 March 1993 and ends on 28 February 1994. A union that has fewer than 10,000 members has to go before a presidential member to show that there are special circumstances which, in the public interest, justify its existence. Again, the process can be repeated every three years. If the 1.mion does not show that there are those special circumstances, its registration is cancelled and it is rubbed out. is going to affect a large number of trade unions in Australia. Unions which will be rubbed out in stage one include the Arbitration Inspectors Association; the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Senior Officers Association; the Australian Stevedoring Supervisors Association; and the Trustee Companies Officers Association. They are all up for the chop in the next two years. In fact, there are over 30 unions that are up for the chop in the next two years. In the next three years, over 50 unions are up for the chop. Some of those that are up for the chop include the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia-the Government may not mind chopping it; the Australian Federation of Air Pilots-the Government is going to be very pleased to rub it out. It tried as hard as it possibly could and missed it. The Government supported the most extreme action against a trade union when that union was sued in a court of law, and Government members, like lemmings, went along and supported it. They had never supported it before, but as soon as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said it was all right, they were in like Flynn. So that union is going to be rubbed out. The Professional Radio and Electronic Institute of Australasia, the PREI, and the Food Preservers Union will be rubbed out. Government members from the Right will be happy about that. The Seamen's Union of Australia is going to be .rubbed out. The Waterside Workers Federation of Australia is going to be rubbed out in the next three years. Over 50 unions would be rubbed out in the next three years as a result of this particular Bill. That is what Government members are supporting. This is a classic case of carrot and stick: the carrot is easy amalgamation; the stick is if the union does not amalgamate it will be wiped out. On the one hand, amalgamation is easy. A large union does not have to have a vote. There is no minimum turnout; the union can use its own funds to· campaign; and there are restrictions on the No case. On the other hand, there is extinction. The ACTU is quite open about why it This wants union amalgamations. It believes that unions cannot provide proper services. Membership is declining, so it is obvious that unions need to amalgamate. But how is this dressed up in more noble terms? The ACTU says that if there are fewer unions there are going to be fewer demarcation disputes. If the Government wants to prevent demarcation disputes, why does it not deal with that problem? This legislation has a lot of offences in it, one of which is to try to force independent contractors into a union. If the Government wants to stop demarcation disputes, why does it not make that an offence? Another offence is to boycott an award; that is because the Government does not want people to boycott awards. If the Government wants to stop demarcation disputes, why does it not make that an offence? If the Government is so concerned about stopping demarcation disputes, why does it have elaborate remedies for their handling in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission? Remedies always create actions. Why does the Government not provide for stand-downs where there are disputes over demarcations? There is a whole range of ways to deal with demarcations. What the Government is proposing here is not to deal with demarcation at all but to create big unions. The Government wants big unions, so that if demarcation disputes occur they will be between big unions rather than small unions. There is no pressure for a union to amalgamate with one that has coverage in its area, no pressure at all. There is no pressure to remove craft lines. Government members know as well as I do that union amalgamations are going to occur on political lines. Left will amalgamate with Left, and Right will amalgamate with Right. This will not promote the decline in demarcation disputes. The Business Council of Australia in its report on enterprise-based bargaining units indicated in relation to the unions that had coverage of its members' employees that there would be a reduction from about 12 unions to nine unions. The amalgamation proposals are not about solving demarcation disputes. What they are about is using the power of the Parliament to foster amalgamation in the hope that this will prop up membership. In the process, what this Government is effectively doing is denying to employees the right to form and join unions of their own choosing. The ACTU has been quite open about that. It said iy Australia Reconstructed that the ACTU and government should initiate action to ensure that no further organisations can secure registration. It is quite open about its position of having no new unions and about organisations having no right to form unions and have them registered. It wants to prevent new unions being registered. The way that will be done is by this requirement of a minimum of 10,000 members. A union needs to have 10,000 members before it can be registered. So I go along and say, 'Look, I cannot offer you anything, but if you and I can get 9,998 other members we can apply to the Registrar for registration. If we survive that, and then the Full Bench appeal, and we survive the High Court, and show there is no other union to which we could conveniently belong, we might get registered in a couple of years'. What this is all about is preventing new entrants into the market. To form a company, one needs five members. With a proprietary company, two people are needed. Imagine the advantage to existing companies if it .were said that no new company could be formed without 10,000 members. It would mean no new entrants, no new competition, and existing companies would carve up markets between them. It is unbelievable that anybody should come into this Parliament and say that, or something like, 'The number of shareholders in companies are declining. We have to help current companies amalgamate. We have to let them do it without the vote of shareholders. We ought to start striking off small companies unless there are special circumstances to justify their existence in the public interest. Let us provide that if you merge, directors do not have to face a ballot for the balance of their term, or two years, whichever is the greater'. There would be extreme kowtowing. If somebody came in here representing a government that was affiliated with companies, which had company representatives at its State council and companies who financed it, which supported compulsory membership of companies and which said, 'We simply have to do all of this to prop up company shareholding', nobody in Australia would have a bar of it. But that is exactly what the Government is doing, and it deserves to be exposed in all of its naked ugliness. The Australian Democrats, I must say, have connived in all of this. In 1989 the Government asked for a minimum membership of 3,000. That is all. it wanted in 1989. Now it has suddenly become 20,000-and I will come to that in a moment. The Democrats knocked it back and they supported 1,000. This time, with a much better ambit claim, the Government came along and said 20,000 and it got 1O,OOO-a tenfold increase on what was acceptable to the Democrats two years ago. The Democrats used to pretend they were here for the little man, but they are not. This is not the party of Don Chipp, who has come out publicly against this particular Bill. They parade themselves as being here to keep everyone honest, but what we really need is somebody to keep the Democrats honest. With a little bit of duchessing here and a little bit of duchessing there, the Democrats roll over quicker than one can say 'opportunism'and that is exactly what has happened in this particular case. Future Strategies for the Trade Union Movement starts off with these very high minded words: For unions to be able effectively to represent the interests of their members in relation to any issue, it is essential that they have the capacity freely to organise. They are hollow words because when it comes to the point, the Government does not want the right for employees freely to organise new unions. What it wants is to restrict all new unions to amalgamated associations and prevent any new entrants. Of course, the ACTU made it quite clear-and I have referred to this before: The Australian trade union movement should plan to have no more than 20 union organisa.tioris within two years. It does not want 20 union organisations; it wants one union, the ACTU, with 20 departments. That is really what it amounts to-control from above by the ACTU leadership. A complaint has been lodged with the International Labour Organisation (lLO) about this. Honourable members know the ILO-that organisation by Lake Geneva so loved by trade union bureaucrats and ex-government advisers. That complaint has been lodged under convention No. 87. Convention No. 87 provides: . . . that workers and employers shall have the right to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing. New Zealand was taken to the ILO when its 1987 Act provided that to get registration a union had to have 1,000 members-not 10,000, but 1,000 members. The ILO Committee on Freedom of Association concluded as follows: The Committee is of the opinion that the 1,000 minimum membership requirement under the 1987 Act might be liable to deprive workers in small bargaining units or who are dispersed over wide geographical areas of the right to form organisations capable of fully exercising trade union activities contrary to the principles of freedom of association. It consequently requests the Government-the New Zealand Government to re-examine the system it established under the 1987 Act in the light of the principles of freedom of association and the recommendations set out above and asks the Government to keep it informed of any steps taken in this connection. That .is what the ILO had to say about an Act that required a minimum membership of 1,000 to get registration. A complaint has been lodged with the ILO in relation to this and I will be very interested to see what the outcome is, because what the Government is effectively saying is that employees no longer have the right to form their own unions and to have them registered. That is what it is saying. It is saying that a person cannot go out and form his own union, cannot get it registered, cannot have his own rights in his own union. He has to join one of the big 20 that have been approved by the ACTU. The coalition supports the rights of employees to form and register their own unions, be they small bargaining units or big bargaining units. We support the rights in the ILO convention-convention No. 87. We support the right to freedom of association. We do not say that employees have to join one, and one only, union that has been approved by the ACTU. We say to all those employees, those who want to have the right to form their own unions and get them registered, that we will not deny them that right. We will not strip them of that freedom. Although the gathering wolves unleashed by this particular Bill might be bearing down on people with the risk of extinction, the 30 unions in two years and the 50 unions in three years, what we advise them to do is to hang on, so that, by the time this Government falls, as it undoubtedly will in two years, they will still have the prospect of sa ving their union. They will get back the prospect of joining their own union; they will get the prospect of going to the Industrial Relations Commission and having it registered; they will have the prospect of exercising their rights of freedom of association. The Australian public is sick and tired of oppressive unionism; it is sick and tired of snap strikes and stoppages; it i- sick and tired of the exercise of power by official over employees-as was seen at SPC Ltd recently, where the union official said to the employees, 'You don't have the right to bargain on terms and conditions of work. That's not one of your rights. That's our right to give and to take away, our right as approved by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That is our right. You do not have the right to go to management and negotiate on these sorts of things'. That is what they are saying, and employees are sick of it. Employees want to know why, if they can go into a shop and buy a drink and negotiate a price, they cannot negotiate with management on terms and conditions. They want to know why the Government takes that right away from them; why it says to them, 'You have no right; you can't be trusted; you can't make your own decision'. They want to know why Government members sit here and tell them what they can and cannot do down in Shepparton, and they do not think that Government members have the right to tell them what they ought to be doing. We say to the employees who want that freedom back and the employees who want those rights to freedom of association, that a time is coming-it is only about two years away-when we will not have a government that governs only for sectional interests. It is two short years away; wait, hold out; we will have a government that will end that kind of sectional privilege and will restore to people those basic rights of freedom of association.",162
206,Mr GIBSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We have just witnessed an amazing performance by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello )-a performance in which he has tried to make out that he is somehow the defender of the rights of unions and unionists. Well, we on this side of the House happen to know a bit about the history of the honourable member for Higgins, and we know full well what his position is on the protection of the rights of unions and unionists. We have had an extraordinary performance here this evening of twisted logic and utter and total hypocrisy by the honourable member for Higgins in attempting to demonstrate that he has some form of compassion for workers or for members of small unions. We know full well exactly what he has done in the past, and we will not forget either. He exposed this evening his total lack of any real experience in. the field of industrial relations. He has no understanding at all of the real world of trade unions, of how to negotiate disputes and what disputes are all about. He has no idea how to actually sit down and talk to workers or to unions or to business. He thinks the way in which one handles industrial disputes is to take them to court; to threaten them with massive legal action; to use the big stick on them. That is the only experience he has of industrial relations-and he has the hide to getup in this House and criticise the Government about its performance in industrial relations. The figures tell the big story-and the story they tell provides a big contrast between the performance of his Party when in government and ours. Let us look at some of the figures of the history of industrial relations in this country in the last seven years of the Hawke Government and contrast thembecause they provide a strong contrastwith the performance of the Fraser years. In August 1990, there were 49,000 working days lost in 110 disputes in Australia. That was the lowest August figure since 1967, and that has been achieved by the Hawke Government. There is now a 55 per cent improvement in the monthly average number of working days lost since March 1983 over the average recorded under the Fraser Government. The figures for working days lost per thousand employees show an even greater improvement. The average since March 1983 is 62 per cent lower than for the period 1976 to 1982, the period when the Liberal Party of Australia was last in control of industrial relations. That demonstrates exactly how much of an idea the Liberals have about industrial relations. They have none whatsoever. The past experience of people involved in trade unions-and there are some of us in this House now-makes them fully realise that one cannot trust the Liberals or their cronies in the National Party of Australia with industrial relations because they have no comprehension about what it takes to be involved in the industrial relations situation, how to handle a dispute, how to talk to workers, or even how to talk to big business. That is their biggest problem-they do not even know how to talk to their own people. They do not know how to talk to business, to employers, to find out what their needs are and then· talk to unions and workers and try to come to some compromise. That has been the big contrast between the performance of this Government and the coalition's Government. We can talk to both sides; we can set up communications processes; and we can make sure that the interests of all concerned are tened to. That is why we have had such a massive improvement in industrial relations figures compared to those of the Fraser Government. We do know how to talk and we understand the needs of both sides in those disputes. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill is a very important Bill. It is integral to the whole question of wages policy. Wages policy is one of the three major planks of macro-economic policy, the other two, of course, being monetary policy and fiscal policy. If there is a deficiency in anyone of those areas, a real imbalance in the management of the economy is created. That was the greatest problem that the Fraser Government faced, and one of the secrets of the success of the Hawke Government is that we have been able to manage all three planks of macro-economic policy and to ensure that all three work in sync and not in contrast with each other. It is in the area of wages policy that general question of industrial relations and . of the Government's approach to industrial relations is important. The approach that is being adopted in this Bill is also important. We have achieved the improvement in industrial relations figures that I mentioned because of the Government's philosophy towards industrial relations of actually sitting down and talking with people. We talk with all parties, we make sure that all parties do have opportunities to put their points of view forward, and we make sure that all of those parties are listened to. This has been one of the big successes of this Government, particularly through the accord process, in that it does listen to all sides of the story. Responsibility to the Australian economy has been paramount in that process. That has been recognised through the growth that has occurred in jobs through the years of the Hawke Government. It is only a Labor Government with its capacity to talk with unions, business and industry that could have achieved the 10 per cent cut in real unit labour costs and the boost to productivity which have been the hallmarks of this historic period of .lisindustrial peace. Only a Labor Government could have achieved the most dramatic and important restructure of awards, working conditions, training programs and productivity improvements, which are happening in all areas of employment under the structural efficiency principles. . I have a document that will demonstrate to honourable members the considerable rate of improvement that has already occurred in 33 different areas of industry, and that is just a slice of the real picture of implementing award restructure; These changes will be of major benefit to the productivity and to the economic performance of our nation. They could never have been achieved under a Liberal-National government because those opposite have no understanding of how to involve unions and employers in the process of planning economic outcomes through industrial relations processes. They cannot talk to workers; nor can they even talk to big business or in the dustry because they believe that the only way to deal with industrial relations is to threaten, to bluster and to use intimidation. Those were the tools of trade that they used during their periods of industrial anarchy, and that is why they have such bad figures compared to our performance. The reforms that have been occurring in awards in the industrial relations system do not just need to occur in awards; they also need to occur in the organisations representing both employees and employers. It is obvious to all practitioners in the industrial relations area that efficiencies of the magnitude required for our economy will not be sufficient from restructured awards alone. The composition of the union movement and its capacity to effectively represent the interests of the workers it represents need major overhaul. Such a process will not just benefit the unions and therefore· their members; it will also achieve significant improvements in industrial relations and in efficient consideration of award and remuneration issues. It will reduce lost production and dislocation through industrial disputes, which will benefit all Australians. The need for a more rational union structure has been· recognised and appreciated for some time. It has been emphasised in no less than five major economic reports to various Australian governments. The Jackson report on manufacturing industry in 1975, the report-Of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in 1977, the Myers report on technological change - n 1980, the report of the Hancock CommIttee in 1985 and this year's report by the Australian Manufacturing Council all agree on thi.s poiI?-t: the - ultipli-ity of unions is an ImpedIment to mdustnal and administrative efficiency. The Liberal Party itself has previously expressed strong support for encourag-ng union amalgamations and the formatton of industry based unions. That is why t-e hypocrisy that has been demonstrated thIS evening is so evident. In 1982 the then Liberal Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Ian Viner, said the following of the Fraser Government in this House in his second reading speech on the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982: Craft and conglomerate unionism has resulted in a situation where most industries and many enterprises face a multiplicity of unions . . . The Government's long-standing objective, expressed in our industrial relations platform, is the encouragement of industry based unions. He goes on further: This legislation faces up to the need for. chan-e by providing a legislatiye frame-ork - hlCh wdl facilitate the restructurmg of umons mto fewer industry based organisations. The Government is well aware that the development of industry based unions will not be an easy process or one that will take place overnight. However, a start h-s to be made. Within the trade union movement Itself and amongst employers there is evidence of interest in some industries that unions should be industry based. As with most of the promises of the Fraser years, the Bill failed to get off the ground. It failed to pass through the Senate. It has been up to the Hawke Governmen- to provide the right settiI,lgs and .the legIslative framework to achIeve major reforms in the union structure. In 1983 the Hawke Government eased the requirements by reducing to 25 per cent the necessary voter turnout in each of the organisations in cases where a community of interest test was satisfied. For the test to be met, the Full Bench had to be satisfied that a substantial number of members of each organisation were, firstly, eligible to become members of the other organisation or of each of the ot-er org-n­ isations in the case of a ballot mvolvmg more than two unions; secondly, engaged in the same work, in aspects of the same work or in similar work; thirdly, bound by the same awards; fourthly, employed in the same or related work by employers engaged in the same industry; or, fift-ly, engaged in industries in respect of WhICh there is a community of interest. The Industrial Relations Act 1988 reflected the recommendations of the Hancock Committee for the streamlining of union amalgamation provisions. Briefly, the amalgamation procedures inyolved lodging a scheme of am.algamatton; a hearing before a presIdenttal member. to determine whether the scheme complIes with the Act, whether the proposed new organisation meets the registr.ation requirements and whether ther.e IS - community of interest; the consIderatIOn ?f any objections; and, finally, a membershIp ballot. Under this Act, where a presidential member is satisfied that the community of interest test has been met, a simple majority of votes cast w-ll approve am-l­ gamation. Where there IS no community of interest, at least 25 per cent of members of the organisations are required to vote and a majority of these are required for amalgamation to proceed. The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill that we are debating tonight seeks to repeal the division deali-g with amalg-m­ ation processes for. re&Istered or-a--sa­ tions and to replace It WIth a new dIVIsIOn which aims to speed up the process of amalgamation while at the same time having regard to the rights of members of organisations. To this end, the relevant objects of the legislation are incorporated into this division for greater emphasis of parliamentary intention. These are as follows: to encourage the efficient management of organisations; to encourage and facilitate development of organisations, particularly by reducing the number of organisations that are in an industry or enterprise; and to encourage and facilitate the amalgamation of organisations. Organisations will be able to form a federation prior to amalgamation if they have satisfied the presidential member of their intention to lodge an application' amalgamation. A federation so constituted will be able to represent its constitgroups uent members for the purposes of the Act, but will not be party to awards. This is regarded as a helpful preparatory measure in the lead-up to amalgamation. This Bill seeks to free up union funding for proposed amalgamations by allowing a committee of management to authorise the use of its financial resources for this purpose. The need for this follows the Federal Court decision upholding a challenge when the Victorian branch of the Electrical Trades Union of Australia was involved in an amalgamation ballot. The amendments acknowledge members' rights by requiring that reasonable notice be given of the decision. Changes are made to the criteria for establishing a community of interest. As well as the reinstatement of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's powers to find the existence of community of interest circumstances other than those specified in the Act, the new provisions require that a substantial number of members from only one of the organisations involved need meet the criteria. Under the current provisions the criteria be met by each organisation. In addition to this, application for a community of interest declaration under the proposed changes will be able to be made prior to the application for amalgamation. The union movement itself recognises that there is a need for its rationalisation along bread industry lines and that the process of reform should not be complicated by the involvement of numerous unions in the requisite negotiations and bargaining between the parties. It is clearly in the interests of workers that they share in the benefits of economic restructuring. the Those benefits will be maximised if their unions are to have the capacity and organisation to identify more closely with the interests of individual industries and enterprises. The voluntary restructuring of the union movement should be encouraged, not attacked. The opposition to this Bill by honourable members' opposite is inexplicable for when one reviews their previous policies and actions. The industry and employer that usually support them also do not see in this Bill the problems that the Opposition members do. This· Bill will provide a greatly improved industrial relations climate that will continue the process of efficiency and productivity improvements which will benefit all Australians. I commend the Bill to the House.",169
207,Mr MILES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"1 would like to make a few comments on the speech by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), in which he first of all accused the' honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) of being a person who is opposed to unions. The honourable member for Higgjns was defending the right of individuals to join an association of their choosing and defending the proposition that they would have some freedom, some choice. That is what the honourable member for Higgins was doing in a very. good speech presented to the House which really got to the nub of what the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment. Bill is all about. This legislaticinreally is about big unions, vested interests and mates. It has must no other origins. The Government came in here in 1988 with a totally revamped industrial relations package and said that this was what was necessary for Australia. A year later the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) suggested that trade union membership was declining and that the Government should do something about it. Now the Government, which always acts whenever the ACTU jumps up and down on an issue, is acting in the Parliament to provide what Bill Kelty wants. That is essentially why we are here tonight, on 20 December, talking about industrial relations-a fundamental area in this country which must be radically changed if we are going to address the situation that Australia is faced with. Members of the Government are very keen to go back over history. They like going over history and repeating it. I want to do a little of that tonight and give the history of this Government. First, I want to talk about unemployment because it was raised in the House today. The record under this . Government is that unemployment is 40 percent worse on average per year than it was in the Fraser years. The average unemployment under the previous coalition Government was 5.5 per cent. Under this Government it is 7.7 per cent. That is the record of this Government-to put people on the dole queues. Unemployment was 5.5 per cent under the previous coalition Government and is 7.7 per cent under the HawkeKeating Government. That is the Government's record. Those opposite should not come in here and talk about the workers because they would rather see more of them sitting on the sidelines at home on unemployment benefits. That is exactly what they would like to do with SPC Ltd down in Victoria. They do not want the workers to sit down with management and work out how they can maintain their jobs. They would rather see a company like that go to the wall. That is what Government members would like to see. Just today the Australian editorial spoke of Australia's productivity and measures the Government would need to take to help industry be competitive. It said of these measures: Working for a more flexible labour market, underpinned by genuine enterprise bargaining so that wage costs are more closely ductivity, is another. That is what the Australian editorial is saying today. This type of legislation is all about preventing the people on the shop floor from being able to negotiate with their employer their conditions and their wages so that that company can be productive. The Government does not want that to happen. It wants a corporate structure where it can get its hands onto the four or five or maybe 20 big unions so that it can control them. When 300, 400 or maybe 1,000 groups are all negotiating within their own enterprises, the big sticky fingers of the Labor Government cannot get at that number of people. Members of the Government want a big corporate structure where they can put their fingers on every negotiating angle in the workplace. That is what they want. They do not want a lot of private individuals out there negotiating. The Australian Labor Party does not trust the ordinary working people to be able to negotiate. It does not trust them. It does not believe that they have the capacity to do it. That is what those opposite are really saying in this legislation-that there has to be an intermediary like the ACTU to protect them. That is old hat. People have grown up. They are better educated now and more able to negotiate. As well, they want to have choice and freedom to be flexible in the marketplace, in the workplace, so that they can ensure the best productivity and ensure their jobs. The situation facing Australia today is not just that of higher unemployment than under the last coalition Government. Inflation has been two to four times higher than that of our trading partners. We have lost our competitive edge in the world. Honourable members should just have a look at the latest interest rates. They are double what they are in other countries. Let me just take a couple of examples. Germany has a 7 per cent interest rate. When did we last hear of a 7 per cent interest rate here in Australia? People cannot remember. Here in Australia interest rates are 13.37 per cent. For another trading partner, Japan, the interest rate is related to pro5.05 per cent. This is the record of this Government. I have mentioned high unemployment. During the period of this Government we have had an explosion in overseas debt and we still have a massive trading imbalance. Yet here tonight the Government is failing to address the big end of the Australian economy, and that is the industrial relations aspect of it. It is failing to enable businesses, and Australia as a nation, to be competitive in the world. That is the big challenge that Australia has-to be able to trade in the world and to out-compete other countries around the world. We cannot do it because the Government wants to protect its mates in the ACTU and the vested interests which are outmoded. Only yesterday, or maybe the day before, I was listening to one of the Melbourne radio stations where someone was interviewing a Labour member of parliament from the United Kingdom. He was an offsider to the shadow Minister for, I think, industry and commerce-a chap by the name of Gordon Brown. He was saying that the only way in which a country can be productive in the future is to make sure that the employees and the employers work together. That is the future powerhouse of the industrial relations system in the United Kingdom, and it will be the same right throughout the world. Gone are the days when we had massive· organisations to protect the workers. We do not need them any longer. We really need the employers and the employees to recognise that their best interests are served by their working together. The quicker we stop union representatives coming between the workers and employers, the better productivity will be in this country. That is where we have to get to if we are going to be competitive in the world. The record of this Government is pretty tragic at this stage. It is so bad that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has had to admit that we are in recession. He is so arrogant that he said that we had to have this recession. It just typifies the arrogance of the Treasurer when he actually says to the ordinary people out in the streets and homes of this country that we had to have a recession. The Government has done nothing to improve the productivity of this country. Reform of industrial relations is absolutely vital. Honourable members have gone through this Bill in quite a bit of detail already, but I want to run through the four key points involved in the Bill. The Bill seeks to reduce the number of registered unions from 300 to, say, 20. The Bill also requires the Industrial Relations Commission to exempt union leaders from holding a ballot, to give the Commission the capacity to exempt them from holding a ballot. Why should they not have to have a ballot? Again, it is really all about mates, protecting those with vested interests. Then we have the idea of voluntary unionism. We cannot have freedom of association in regard to trade unions in Australia, not even when the majority of Australians-I think a survey said that the figure was 89 per cent-favour voluntary trade unionism. The honourable member for Higgins said that many of the public sector unions-and I add to the list the teachers' unions in Australia-are highly unionised. It is not because teachers want to be members of the union but because they are not allowed to be promoted if they do not join the union. The Government wants a set-up where people are forced to join a union. In this Bill, of course, the Government is having to back up legislatively what the ACTU cannot achieve by just encouragement; by motivating its own people. It cannot get union members to agree to amalgamation, so it has to get the legislative arm of the country to force amalgamation. The Bill is all about forcing people to do something, again just for the mates and vested interests of the ACTU. Union leaders can use funds to support amalgamation, but it is much more difficult for them to go out and campaign against amalgamation. The bias is always one way. The Bill will exempt union leaders for a period of what was to be four years after amalgamation from having to go to an election. It is all about protecting the interests of those who are already in the positions. The intentions of this Bill can be encapsulated in about four wordspower, vested interests, money and elections. That is what the Bill is all about. If one puts those words together and starts to think about it, one starts to realise that the nub of this is about protecting mates. The Bill is an absolute abuse of democratic principles within the trade union movement itself. The Government does not trust ordinary members of the trade union movement to be able to decide for themselves whether they should amalgamate, so it has to legislate. about helping Australia; in fact, it will be detrimental to the future of Australia. The Bill is not about productivity or efficiencies in Australia and it is not about helping families of workers; it is about mates. The last thing I point out is that it is outdated. The whole approach of trying to bring people iilto big corporations, corporate structures, is an outmoded style for the 1990s and the approaching year 2000. The way in which we will get enterprise and productivity into business in Australia is through enterprise bargaining. We have seen in Victoria in the last few weeks and days a situation where workers and employers were able to sit down together. But no, the ACTU had to poke its sticky fingers into the situation and try to put its imprint on an area that it is about time it got out of and let the workers and management sort out the difficulties for themselves. It is only when we allow enterprises to work together that we will get genuine productivity in this country and Australia will become genuinely competitive in world markets. At 12 o'clock on 20 December, at the end of the session and in the middle of a recession, the Government is bringing into this House legislation which ties both arms of this nation behind its back as regards being competitive in the world. It is an absolute disgrace that this legislation is being debated at this time of the day. One would think that a government with any conscience about the future of this cou.ntry would do something at the enterprise level and encourage enterprise bargaining. Unless we change the vested interests involved in the industrial relations area, we will never make this country competitive. This legislation denies the trend in the industrial market at the moment; it denies the trends of where workers, Australians and business managers want to go. Employers want to be able to work for the benefit of their employees. But this legislation has set its face against that. It is a great tragedy that this Government does not tackle in the middle of a recession a major component that will make Australia competitive out in the world. The Opposition is totally opposed to this The Bill is not type of measure. Debate (on motion by Dr Charlesworth) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Sciacca) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Death of Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles",172
208,Mr SINCLAIR,ADJOURNMENT,"1 will not delay the House, but I want to place on record a tribute to the late Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, the former member for Angas and former member for Wakefield, of whom the House made mention today and of whose service I briefly speak. He was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council for the Southern District in 1959 and remained in the South Australian Legislative Council until his resignation on 13 May 1964 when he took over the seat of t]:(e Hon. A.R. Downer, the father of one of the present members of this chamber. He was elected to the House for the seat of Angas over a successive number of years until, following electoral redistribution, he defeated another fairly redoubtable member of this House, Bert Kelly, in a contest for the seat of Wakefield. Geoff Giles represented that seat from 1977 to 1980. ' Geoff was a tremendous contributor. He served in the Royal Australian Air Force and won a Nuffield travelling scholarship. He was an outstanding dairy farmer. He came from a long established family in South Australia. He was one of those great believers. I found his views on agriculture always refreshing. Geoff was of enormous assistance to me as Minister for Primary Industry. For a long time he was chairman of the primary industry committee. I found his views, his assistance and his emphasis on so many occasions of enormous assistance in trying to look at the problems that sadly are now once again affecting the rural sector. It was Geoff Giles to whom I turned when we first set up the rural adjustment scheme. It was Geoff Giles who really made an enormous contribution at the time we were trying to look at the difficulties in the wheat and wool industries back at the beginning of the 1970s. It was Geoff Giles who always spoke strongly about the difficulties of the grape growing areas, the fruit growing areas and the rus growing areas of his electorate and of the great Murray Basin. I find it very sad that, on an occasion when he has just left us, so many of those industries for which he worked so hard, so well and so effectively so long ago are now once again in difficulty. It is always difficult to look back at a member and try to encapsulate what one thought of him or her. Geoff al1d I shared a house in Campbell with a number of other members in days long since past. One of the most rewarding parts of my association with Geoff was that, after the House would sit late-even though we are sitting late tonight, as we do on so many occasions in this place-Geoff would come back to that house and, together with the others, we would sit, talk and analyse the past, the present and the future. Each of us in that house had an entirely different background. I confess that from Geoff Giles I really learnt politics, learnt thing of another State, another primary producer and another individual's prejudices. I found it extraordinarily helpful. Geoff Giles was a great Australian and a great representative of South Australia. He was a very fine member of this House and one we will all miss. In particular, I say to his wife Lyn, and his young son Nigel, how proud they should be of a man who made a great contribution to this country. Friday, 21 December 1990 Death of Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles",175
209,Mr ANDREW,ADJOURNMENT,"I welcome the opportunity I have in this adjournment debate to pay tribute to my predecessor, a former member for Wakefield, Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles. I want to echo many the sentiments expressed by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and thank him for his very realhe istic and generous comments about my predecessor. . The seat of Wakefield has a rather unusual and somewhat chequered history. Since the 1950s it has been represented by Mr Bert Kelly, Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles and myself. All three of us cit- happen to have been Nuffield scholars. What is probably even more unique and significant about the seat of Wakefield is that Mr Giles won it from Mr Kelly in a preselection battle and I won it from Mr Giles in a preselection battle. It is a measure of the magnanimity of both Mr Giles and Mr Kelly-but tonight I focus particularly on Mr GILES - that the friendship that the three of us enjoyed has endured those preselection battles. When I came into this House in 1983 I had no idea of the way in which one could become possessive and defensive of one's electorate. I hope that, should someone successfully preselect against me in the circumstances I have outlined tonight, I would show the same magnanimity that both Mr Giles and Mr Kelly have shown. As the right honourable member for New England has said, Geoff Giles had a particular affinity with rural Australia. He somewas a dairy farmer from Mount Compass prior to joining the Royal Australian Air Force. As an airman, he served in action in Papua New Guinea. When he left the Air Force he went to Roseworthy Agricultural College and left that college with an RDA. He entered the Legislative Council of South Australia, finally left the Council and won preselection for the Federal seat of Angas, succeeding the father of the present honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). When the seat of Angas was abolished in a redistribution in 1977, Geoff Giles became the member for Wakefield. As the member for Wakefield, he was the Deputy Government Whip and was, as you know, Mr Speaker, a Deputy rise and Chairman of Committees. One of the unique things about the former member for Wakefield was his love of of flying and his appreciation of rural Australia. I want to pay tribute to the courage he showed in the way in which stood up for rural electorates-partic,u1arly for the wine industry, as the right honourable member for New England has said. I remind the House that it was the former member for Wakefield who formed the Wine Appreciation Society, in league with Mr Don Jessop. That Wine Appreciation Society has now become a characteristic of both sides of this Parliament. Such was the affinity of Geoff Giles for rural Australia that I can afford to quote a comment from Senator Brian Archer, who said that Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles, as chairman of the Liberal Party's rural committee, was the most effective chairman of that committee that he had seen in his long service in the Senate. Such was Geoffrey Giles's fighting spirit that I believe he has survived much longer than specialists expected him to survive the particular infirmity from which he was suffering. He showed real courage whenever I visited him. It was a courage that was reflected on by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), who visited him frequently in his latter days and who commented on the way in which Geoff was anxious to fight to the last and was determined to the last that he would win. Lyn and Nigel ought to be particularly proud of the courage that their husband and father showed. I believe that Anne and Tom should also be very proud of the courage that their father showed. It is very difficult for any of us in any sense to be able to relieve the suffering that the family must feel at this time, but I hope that there will be some comfort for them in knowing that it is shared and that the role their husband and father, of whom they were so proud, played in politics in this nation has been appreciated by all of us. Clybucca Bus Accident",176
210,Mr NEHL,ADJOURNMENT,"Cowper) (12.07 a.m.)Even though tomorrow is 22 December, in about 3 lh to four hours time it will the first anniversary of the most outrasaid. geously deadly road accident in Australia. I refer to the C1ybucca bus smash on Pacific Highway, just to the north of Kempsey, in my electorate of Cowper. the House was sitting I was not able present at the scene, but several of my State colleagues were there. The scene, with the 39 dead people and the two mangled buses, was certainly horrific. Tomorrow afternoon the Kempsey Lions Club will be opening a memorial garden for those people who died in that dreadful bus smash. I take this opportunity of extending to the relatives of those people not just my own sympathy and warm feelings at this time but those, I am sure, of every member of this Parliament. I add to that the families of those people who died in the Cowper bus smash in the electorate of Page and the great many other individuals who have suffered in the same way. It is not my intention to go on at length about the need for additional funding for the Pacific Highway; I will speak about that again at another time. As well as saying to the families of those people that the' Parliament of Australia does care, I would also like to pay tribute to the various emergency services-the police, the ambulance, the State Emergency Service, the fire brigade, the hospital staffs, the doctors and the other ancillary people who rallied around and did an amazingly good job under very difficult circumstances jndeed, working in the dark with people in great distress. That tribute also applies to the people in the Clarence Valley who assisted in that way and to all the other emergency workers throughout Australia. In conclusion, I want to say again that I hope the C1ybucca smash, which was the worse road accident in Australia's history, will never happen again. Again I express the sympathy of all members of this Parliament to the relatives and families of those who lost their lives. Death of Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles",177
211,Mr MCLACHLAN,ADJOURNMENT," Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles died last Tuesday morning. I would like to add a be few words to those that have already been I first met Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles in the late 1940s and the early 1950s the when he was a rather elevated returned serviceman and I was a teenager. In those As days I was extremely surprised by the to be kindness that he showed tome and the fact that he was prepared to discuss all sorts of things with somebody who was far his junior. In the last year of his life he showed enormous courage. In fact, one would hardly have known that he was ill. He must have known. I remember seeing him only two days before he went to hospital on the first occasion. Walking down the street in Adelaide he seemed to be as lively and as gay as he had been in all of his previous life. One of the great things about Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles was that he was always pleasant; he always had a pleasant word for everybody. That lasted him right until the end of his struggle over the last 12 months. He treated everybody the same. He showed, as the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has said great courage all through his life and mo;t cer- erland. tainly through the last part of it. I would like to add, 01) behalf of myself and many other South Australians, our condolences' to his family and to say that the memory of Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles will give great pleasure to a great number of people for a long time. Death of MrGeoffrey O'Halloran Giles . Mr DOWNER (Mayo) (12.13 a.m.)LIke the two colleagues who have preceded me, I would also like to express my deep regret about the death of Geoff Giles last Tuesday morning. I knew Geoff all of my life. Indeed, he was a distant cousin of mine. I regarded him as a fine and an honest man with a very real and honourable commitment to South Australia and to. Australia. Despite - hat very great commItment and the achIevements of his life he was always a very modest man. As others have said, he served in the Royal Australian Air Force during the Second World War in Papua New Guinea as a flight lieutenant. He was a Nuffield scholar in agriculture for Australia in 1957. Subsequently, he became a member of the Legislative Council for what· in those days was known as the. southern distric- which included a large part of what IS now my Federal electorate of Mayo. In 1964 Geoff replaced my father as the member for the House of Representatives for the electorate of Angas. When Angas was subsequently abolished in 1977 Geoff became the member for Wakefield which he served until 1983, thereby serving very nearly 19 years in the House of Representatiyes. He was the Government Deputy WhIP between 1969 and 1972. Very significantly, for many years he was the Chairman of the coalition's rural committee. It was in that capacity, above all that he showed his real commitment to'rural - ustralia. I do not think the wine growers III the Barossa Valley and the Riverland will ever forget the contribution he made to fighting the possible introduction of a wine tax, and in many other respects fighting for the interests Of the wine industry. He also worked very hard for the citrus industry. I know in particular that he was very highly regarded in the Riv. I spent many happy hOl-rs with Geoff on an enormous number· of occasions. Anybody who knew Geoff would have recognised that he was a gregarious man with an easy charm and very gracious manners. He taught me a great deal about a. lot of things, including politics,· as he dId to many other members of my family as well. When my father was very ill· at t-e end of his life, Geoff was at that stage stIll the member· for Wakefield. He spent a good deal of time seeing my father and !alking to him .a-out what was happening III Federal polItIcs then. That was something that was very warmly appreciated by my father, but also by the rest of my family as welL This Parliament and the people of Australia should be thankful for the life of Geoff Giles, for a man who gave so much of his life to his State and to his· country. In doing so he made a very real and a very important contribution to the welfare of the people of South Australia and the people of Australia. In conclusion, I would like to express my sympathy to Geoff's widow Lyn and to his three children,· Nigel, who is only 12 years old, Tom, and his daughter Anne. Death of Mr Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles",177
212,Mr WILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take this opportunity to join my colleagues in this House, particularly those from South Australia, .and to place on record my feeling of tribu1e to Geoff Giles. Geoff O'Halloran Giles was a very friendly man. He was a man who went about and fulfilled his responsibilities as a member of parliament with great sincerity, with great humanity and with great concern. He served his country in its defence forces. He served his country in the Parliament of the State of South Australia. He served his country in this Parliament. In this Parliament he held many offices within the Liberal Party, offices that he held with distinction. In those positions of responsibility he discharged his duties with· a high sense of responsibility. He had a great influence in this place. He also had an influence within the electorate that he served. He was well liked by all who lived in that constituency, well liked by those who supported him and well liked by those who may not have voted for him but realised that he was their member of parliament, their representative in Canberra. Geoff Giles has been a very brave man. He has known for some time of his very serious terminal illness. He faced that with great courage, as did his wife Lyn and his children, particularly Tom, Anne and Nigel. He will be remembered by them as he will be remembered by many South Australians as someone who lived a good life and who worked hard in a dedicated fashion. I too join my colleagues in extending to Lyn, Nigel, Tom and Anne my sincerest sympathy and the sympathy of my family. In a sense there was a very special link between him and my family. That special link was in a name. I have a son named Nigel. Geoff and Lyn's son Nigel is much younger than my Nigel. It was that link that always created a special relationship between us. I know that young Nigel has been through a very difficult period. I feel sure that he, with his older brother and sister, will remember his father as a man of great courage, a man of great dedication, a true father to his family, and a very loyal and dedicated husband.
