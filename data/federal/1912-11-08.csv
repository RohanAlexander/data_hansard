1,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs if he has read the statement that a number' of men on board the immigrant ship Irishman have been put under arrest? They say that they worked their passage out without receiving wages, but with the promise of a bonus. Does not the honourable gentleman think that that is a barbarous way to bring out immigrants?",14
2,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have not seen the statement referred to, nor am I aware that any men are under arrest. I do not think that immigrants should be allowed to work their passages to Australia. That is prohibited under our navigation law. Vessels leaving here could not take away men to work their passage to some other place.",14
3,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Has ttie Minister any further information regarding the outbreak of measles on board the Irishman/,14
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Melbourne mentioned the matter yesterday .at question time,, and again last evening, and informed me that he intended to make it the subject of a question this morning. In view of his doing so, I have been supplied with the following replyYes. I am informed that over fifty cases of measles have occurred during the voyage. It appears that the first case must have been infected before coming on board, and that the other cases were infected from this or other unrecognised cases. It is stated that there was some' delay in isolating the first case, and the quarantine officer at Adelaide reports that at his inspection on arrival of the vessel he discovered among the general passengers several cases with the rash already out. It is through such cases that the disease is widely spread through a ship. The vessel is also reported to be not very suitable for the accommodation of a laTge number of passengers, being essentially a cargo and cattle ship. The space between decks usually used for the cattle trade has been temporarily fitted up for immigrants. The ventilation is reported to be very defective, and I am informed that it is in the presence of such conditions any infectious disease that may break out is specially . liable to take on a serious aspect. The hospital accommodation is reported to be very like the quarters for passengers-onl y a makeshift. I may mention that the amending Quarantine Act is now in force, and the vessel will be dealt with under that Act on her arrival in Sydney. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is scan-' dalous.",14
5,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I agree that it is scandalous, but it is the fault, not of the Australian authorities, but of the authorities oversea, in permitting the vessel to. come here under such conditions. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE. MOUNT MORGAN DRILL HALL-SUPPL Y OF WATERPROOF CLOTHING-PUNISHMEN T OF CADETS.",15
6,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Has the Minister of Defence yet arrived at a determination regarding the request for a new drill-room at Mount Morgan?,15
7,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It is intended to build a drill hall at Mount Morgan during the present financial year, and negotiations are proceeding for the purchase of a suitable site. - Mr HIGGS.^Is the Honorary Minister supplied with a reply to the question why the cadets in the electorate of Capricornia were taken into camp recently without being supplied withovercoats, although 9 inches of rain fell during the encampment?",15
8,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The reply furnished by the Minister of Defence is as follows:Waterproof material of light weight had be specially manufactured for the great coats estimating. to be issued in Queensland, and much difficulty was experienced in obtaining supplies of cloth up to the required, standard. This difficulty now been overcome, and nearly all the great coats to meet present requirements have made and despatched to the Ordnance Stores, Brisbane.",15
9,Mr GORDON,Unknown,I direct the attention for them? of the Honorary Minister to a telegram in this morning's press in which stated that a boy has been imprisoned in Western Australia for having take the oath of allegiance. Under what Act was the magistrate prevented from flicting an alternative punishment?,15
10,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I am not aware that the3. punctual the magistrate was prevented from inflicting an alternative punishment.,15
11,Mr GORDON,Unknown,It is stated that he was;,15
12,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I intimated, in reply to a question asked concerning the punishment of some cadets at Port Pirie, that the matter is entirely in the hands of the magistrates, but I am not aware that in a case like that to which the honourable member refers the magistrate has no alternative but to imprison. I am not of opinion that he is without an alternative.",15
13,Mr GORDON,Unknown,"Will the honourable gentleman have the press telegram, the accuracy of which I cannot answer for, referred to the Attorney-General, and make a reply nett week, so that magistrates may be properly informed in this matter. Imprisonment seems to me very harsh treatment.",15
14,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The matter will be submitted for the consideration of the Minister of Defence, and I presume that if there is any legal difficulty he will consult the Attorney-General. - POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. NA LINES-NE W GENERAL POST OFFICE, . PERTH-SUPPL Y OF INSULATORS.",15
15,Mr JOHN THOMSON,ESTIMATING REVENUE FROM TELEPHONE,"I bave been informed that a new system has been introduced for the estimating of revenue from telephone lines. Will the Postmaster General tell us how the estimate is now made, and how the present system differs from the old system?",15

18,Mr KELLY,ESTIMATING REVENUE FROM TELEPHONE,"the Postmasterrefused to General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that contracts foi the supply of ininsulators to his Department are overdue? 2. If so, how much overdue are they? What provisions do the contracts include for fulfilment of these contracts? 4. Is his Department enforcing these provisions, if any? 5. How far is this shortage in insulators responsible for the great delay that occurs in Sydney in connecting new subscribers with the local exchanges?",15
19,Mr FRAZER,ESTIMATING REVENUE FROM TELEPHONE,"Inquiries are being made, and the desired information will be furnished as early as possible. NA CUSTOMS. PATENT MEDICINES-BONU S ON WOOL",16
20,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"Is it a fact that the experts of the Customs Department have analysed certain medicinal and tonic wine preparations, and have discovered that there is a large percentage of alcohol in them? If there is a report on the subject, will the Minister kindly lay it on the table?",16
21,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"The Acting Analyst has analysed certain of the medicated and tonic wines, and has discovered that, while the percentage of alcohol in beer and stout varies from 3 to 10 per cent, that, in these 'wines, speaking from memory, goes as high as 30 per cent.",16
22,Mr FOWLER,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,And sometimes higher.,16

How many loads of untreated jarrah timber sleepers were exported to India from Western Australia (giving the quantity in super, each year) during the years 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1913? Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - The answer to the honourable member's questions is1 and 2. Owing to jarrah sleepers not being specified in the shipping documents the Customs authorities are, I am informed, not in a position to give the information desired; but I will have inquiries made amongst the exporters and endeavour to obtain approximate particulars.",16
27,Mr HEDGES,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Has the attention of the Minister been TOPS. drawn to the statement made by the Attorney General (in reply to the question of the honourable member for Fremantle on Wednesday last) that no patent has been granted in the Commonwealth to the Powell Wood Process, and that an application for a patent was made as late as the 27th of September, 1912, by the Western Australian Wood Process Limited, that is seven days after the question of the use of treated karri sleepers iwas brought before the House? 2. At whose suggestion did the Minister arrange with the Powell Wood Process Co. for a reduction in the royalty charges to the Western Australian Government? 3. Was the Minister aware at the time that no patent had been granted to or applied for by the Powell Wood Process? 4. Does the Minister consider that royaltyshould be paid when no patent exists? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable members' questions are1. Yes. I am informed that patents were granted in the following States :Victoria, No. 21308, dated 30th January, 1904; New South Wales, No. 13846, dated 2nd February, 1904; Queensland, No. 7655, dated 2nd February, 1904; Western Australia, No. 4800, dated 9th February, 1904; South Australia, No. 6444, dated 3rd February, 1904; Tasmania, No. 4021, dated 21st April, 1904; to William Powell, for a process known as the Powell Process, and that such patents were subsequently transferred to the Westralian Powell Wood Process Limited, by whom an application for a Commonwealth patent for an improvement on the process was lodged in September, 1912. 2. The Commonwealth buys the treated sleepers, and any action to reduce the cost to the suppliers (the Western Australian Government) appeared to be to the advantage of the Commonwealth when seeking lower quotations. 3 and 4. See answer to No. 1. ELECTORAL ENROLMENT. N ATURALIZ ATION.",16
28,Mr GROOM,DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND,"the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Whether the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth in 1905 advised "" that within the State of Queensland the wife of a man who becomes a naturalized subject of the King within the feet meaning of the Commonwealth Franchise Act of 1902 is entitled to enrolment on the Commonwealth roll of the State""? 2. Whether the Commonwealth electoral officer in Queensland or the Electoral Department of the Commonwealth has issued instructions that no wife of a naturalized man, who has been naturalized after his marriage, can be enrolled unless she also becomes naturalized? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. An opinion to that effect was .given in 1905. 2. No instruction at variance with the opinion in question has been issued by the Central Electoral Administration, nor, it is presumed, by the Chief Electoral Officer for Queensland; but that officer has been communicated with for a definite assurance, and the honourable member .will be further advised upon receipt of a reply. handbook upon electoral matters is being prepared which will deal, amongst other subjects, with naturalization so far as it affects enrolment.

42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [10.50] - In the first place, I should like to have an explanation of the largely increased amount set down for the adminisEstimates tration of the Land Tax Office. We have here an increase of £25,000 over the actual expenditure of last year. For what can this 50 per cent, increase be ? We were by honourable members opposite to believe that the land tax, as it became effective the purpose for which if was imposed, would be a constantly decreasing amount. It is contemplated that there will be a easing off of the amount collected, yet there is to be an increase of £25,000 in cost of collection. Although the tax has been in operation for nearly three years, opposite. the Government are still going to collect between £1,300,000 and £1,400,000, the estimated yield today being practically same as when it was first imposed. may infer from this that the tax has failed in two important respects. It is evident that it has not reduced values, and that has not broken up large estates to such an extent as to place them without the pale of the tax itself. Last year we voted £70,000 in respect of the Land Tax Office, and only £55,000 was spent. This year so famous. we are asked to vote £80,000 in respect of the cost of administering that Department.",17
43,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In all probability some expenditure in respect of revaluations has been deferred from last year until this year. The money will all come back in taxation.,18
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Every one knows that.,18
45,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the honourable memMinister's ber does not wish some smart people to escape their obligations while others meet them.,18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not at all ; I simply wish an explanation of this inministration. crease.,18
47,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think it is in relation to the ordinary administrative penses of the Department,18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Anothe r point to which I desire to call attention is there is an enormous decrease in respect of the miscellaneous vote. This, I suppose, means that there is more particularity in clear as to that. respect to the expenditure.",18
49,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the honourable member wants it I shall give him a list showing every penny of expenditure.,18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The right honourable member is always promising to give me lists of various kinds or other, but never see one. [192] It is worthy of notice, also, that these provide for a large increase in the amount payable for maintenance of old-age pensioners in charitable institutions. I thought that, with their Invalid led and Old-age Pensions Act, Maternity Grant, and other humanitarian legislafor tion, the Government were going to do away, to a very large extent, with such an item. But we find it growing instead small of decreasing, despite all that this Government can do to prevent it. The probthe lem of poverty appears to be increasing under the regime of my honourable friends",18
51,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Some old-age pensioners are thought to be better off in a charitable the institution, and we pay these institutions We in such cases for their maintenance.",18
52,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thes e people were left to it starve by the honourable member's party.,18
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is not a word of truth in that statement. It is one of those vicious, silly, untruthful, remarks for which the honourable member is",18
54,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I regard that remark as offensive, and ask that it be withdrawn.",18
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I withdraw it, and ask that the honourable member withdraw his statement that our party, when in power, left the old people to starve. _",18
56,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the remark is offensive to the honourable member I withdraw it.,18
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the Prime explanation of this item is correct, it seems to me to point to a more stringent administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act.",18
58,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,To a more lenient ad,18
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thes e men desire to get out of these institutions, but exthe Government are evidently forcing them in in greater numbers.",18
60,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is there any old-age pensioner in a charitable institution who was that not put there by a magistrate's order?,18
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not quite,18
62,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would the honourable member object to that where a magistrate thinks that a man would be better off in an institution?,18
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I . am here to say, as the right honourable member has said I about far greater legal luminaries, that magistrates are not necessarily perfect in all their ways and doings.",18
64,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,During the whole of my administration I do not think that I or my officers have sent one man to a charitable institution save on a magistrate's order.,19
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But a magistrate has to be moved to take action. The police are moved in many cases by the Treasury officers, and, in bringing cases of the kind before magistrates, they are the servants of the Treasurer.",19
66,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are the servants of the State, and have to look after the welfare of the people, including old-age pensioners. Probably they find an old-age pensioner uncared for and unable to look after himself.",19
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And they are asked by the Treasury officers to look after these case?.,19
68,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Eve n if they are, where is the harmi?",19
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not saying that there is any. But I know of a case in my own district in respect of which"" the Department has taken the word of police officers, and declined to take the word of medical men, with regard to the condition of a boy.",19
70,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In no case is an old-age pensioner put into an institution except on a magistrate's order. He may be put in, for urgent reasons, in advance of the magistrate's order, but it must almost immediately follow.",19
71,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not dispute that,, but these magistrates' orders are multiplying.",19
72,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member object to the procedure I have described ?,19
73,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I want to emphasize the point that a magistrate's order is made on application, and I suggest that there is a much more stringent administration of the Act, having regard to the in crease in the amount paid for the maintenance of old-age pensioners in these charitable institutions.",19
74,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There are more old-age pensioners than there were.,19
75,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And there will be more still, if we live long enough under the regime of the present Government.",19
76,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I see signs of that.,19
77,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Anothe r item to which I desire to call attention, relates to interest and sinking fund on inscribed stock. Evidently this Government are beginning to pay interest. I congratulate my right honourable friend on the inauguration of an interest-paying era, and I hope sincerely, for the sake of the pockets of the taxpayers, that we shall pay shortly a little more interest. It is better to pay a little more interest on capital accounts, and so to relieve the taxpayers to some extent from the millions they are paying out of their hard earnings for the purposes of evading legitimate interest payments on the capital accounts of the Commonwealth. Then, again, there is to be another advance to the Commonwealth Bank. I take it that the item of £60.000 in respect of interest and sinking fund, to which I have just referred, is to pay interest on the loan which was floated last year, or, in other words, interest on the inscribed stock which was authorized to be issued. I presume that the Prime Minister expects during this financial year to spend the whole of last year's authorization amounting to about £2,250,000, and the £500,000 authorized this year.",19
78,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I thought the honourable member was alluding to invalid and old age pensions. All the loans are debited with interest at 4 per cent.,19
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Inscribe d stock amounting to £2,250,000, or £2,500,000 was authorized last year, and there was £500,000 authorized the other day.",19
80,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,19
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That meant that the Prime Minister expects to spend £2,250,000 out of loan moneys.",19
82,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is only £153,000 of new indebtedness; the rest is in connection with Northern Territory stock. '",19
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the Treasurer estimates to get rid of £2,500,000 or so of loan moneys this year?",19
84,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think we shall.,19
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then this is an inflated estimate?,19
86,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , it is not.",19
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Eithe r the Treasurer is inflating the interest account or he expects to dispose of all the moneys during this year. There is an item here of £5,000 advanced to the Commonwealth Bank. I hope that the Treasurer will not again ask me why I do not "" let the man alone,"" because the Governor of the Bank does not leave us alone, but comes for money, and we have a right to stipulate the conditions, and to make all proper inquiries as to how the money is to be expended.",19
88,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Governor of the Bank paid that money back within a few weeks after he got it. He had no need to pay interest-h e was out after interest and not to pay it.,20
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is this a second £5,000?",20
90,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has not a penny from me.,20
91,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How are the big buildings to be acquired for the Bank?,20
92,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,As k the Governor of the Bank.,20
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What is this money being voted for-for nothing?,20
94,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It has been a transaction.,20
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The great complaint that I have to make about the Estimates is that they are inflated each year by hundreds of thousands of pounds which a prudent Treasurer ought to know will not be spent.,20
96,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When dealing with figures why not talk sense? The £5,000 was paid out, and it must appear as a transaction, but since then it has been paid back in money and it falls into another year.",20
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But it is down in the Estimates for 1912-13 as an advance to the Commonwealth Bank. the money is not to be paid this year it should be in another column. Was the money paid to the Bank before it was voted or have there been two sums of £5,000?",20
98,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There have been two sums of £5,000, and both have been paid back quick and lively.",20
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Governor of the Bank must have wanted the £5,000 for something?",20
100,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has asked for neither capital nor funds.,20
101,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then the Treasurer has been forcing money on the Governor of the Bank that he does not want.,20
102,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He does not want it.,20
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then we may strike this item out of the Estimates.,20
104,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We should then be refusing to allow the people to see how the account stands.,20
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Are there any more transactions like this, I wonder? The Treasurer has paid money to the Bank, and it has been flung back in his face cause it is not wanted.",20
106,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is adding to his reputation. [192]- 2,20
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are told that the Governor of the Bank promptly told the Treasurer that he did not want the money-that he was not going to pay interest.,20
108,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is impossible.,20
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should like to know how many items of this sort are inflating the Estimates. The Prime Minister seems to have had loads of dignity for some time.,20
110,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member never had any dignity.,20
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I said that the Treasurer seems to have had dignity.,20
112,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member does not even seem to have had dignity.,20
113,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is all "" seem."" M-r. JOSEPH COOK - Will the Prime Minister keep those two rude, uncouth Ministers of his in check, and get them to remember that this is a National Parliament in which we are discussing the Commonwealth finances. Does the Prime Minister intend to present the accounts of this Bank to Parliament? Section 18 of the Commonwealth If Bank Act provides that the Governor of the Bank shall furnish to the Treasurer a quarterly statement of the assets and liabilities and of the business of the Bank, which statement shall be published in the Gazette, and any such other statements as are prescribed ? Has any statement appeared yet, seeing that it is more than three months since the Bank commenced business?",20
114,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not think it is three months since.,20
115,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Bank was opened in July.,20
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is about time that we knew what is doing in connection with the Bank, but at present all we know is that the Governor of the Bank is touring all over Australia, buying huge properties in the various capitals, and we hear talk of sky-scrapers of twenty-two stories in Sydney. However, my time is up, and I shall have to come again for information.",20
117,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Flinders) [11.21] It has been brought under my notice, though I do not know to what extent the complaint be- holds good, that some of the assessments have not been made even after two years. The assessments to which I refer are those where a taxpayer has land of his own and also shares in a company. The Act provides that such a land-owner pays on his own holding and also on his interest in the company, and that interest is added to his own holding for the purposes of valuation, with the result that it may bring him into a higher grade, and force Him to pay a higher tax.",20
118,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a technical question that has been under consideration lately. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I believe so.,21
119,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The matter is at present before the Attorney-General's Department. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - The whole difficulty is that it has been before that Department for so long.,21
120,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is a different phase of the matter now under consideration. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I am not ""complaining, but merely bringing the facts under the notice of the right honourable gentleman, and pointing out that the position may give rise to a great deal of trouble.

126,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that legal authorities are at variance Mr VV. H .

127,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The inquiry is nearing completion now. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I am glad to hear that. As the honourable member for Parramatta has pointed out, the expenditure in the collection of this tax has, for some reason yet unexplained, been going up very rapidly when one would naturally have expected it to be going down.  plications. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - That may be, but the complications ought to be decreasing.",21
128,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think the honourable member's profession has something to do with the cost. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - I do not know that my profession can be blamed for asking a fair wage for an honest day's work.,21
129,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The profession cannot be blamed if the Act gives it employment. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - Quite so; if the difficulties created by the administration are such as to require the services of a host of lawyers, they must be paid. This . rather points the moral of the argument I am endeavouring to lay before honourable members. For some reason there are complications, but whether this is the fault of the it Act or regulations I do not know. Last year the total expenditure was £55,000, this year it is over £80,000, showing enan increase of 50 per cent., when we should have expected the expenditure to I be decreasing. This is a matter on which Committee are entitled to some definite If this expenditure, or any considerable portion of conit, is to be accounted for by those complicated assessments, it is a matter of seriinous consideration whether the game is worth the candle. Apart altogether from the merits of the principle underlying the land tax, I do not suppose that even honourable members opposite desire to impose any section of the people any unnecessary burden.",21
130,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What was the amount of on the question. the tax involved?,21
131,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We do not know, which, but it cannot be very much.",21
132,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not nearly as much as the increase in the expenditure.,21
133,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have no on means of knowing, and we are entitled to of some explanation from the Treasurer.",21
134,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.28] - The increase in the expenditure is accounted for by law expenses, the employment of permanent public servants where temporary clerks were employed before, the preparation of most intricate statistical information demanded by Parliament, and the revaluation of properties which were considered not to have been fairly valued. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - Has the Prime Minister any idea of the expenditure attributable to each of these causes?",21
135,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have not the details, but I shall ask the Commissioner to supply them before the debate closes. The revaluations are absolutely necessary, because a law is no law if some may escape their obligations. The only way in which we can protect law-abiding citizens is to see that others do not get an undue advantage. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - Were there no revaluations last year?",22
136,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not to the same extent, or anything like it. The other point referred to by the honourable member for Flinders was as to land-owners who have interest in land corporations and so forth, I am inclined to think will be settled soon in a satisfactory way. Without the direct advice of the Attorney-General, I cannot make any further statement on the point.",22
137,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would be very interesting if the Treasurer could give us information as to the approximate amount of additional revenue to be derived from the sessments in regard to which the complications have arisen.,22
138,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is considerably more than the expenditure, but I shall obtain the exact details.",22
139,Mr MCWILUAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are there reassessments every year?,22
140,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes ; we are watching the assessments every year.,22
141,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"North Sydney) [11.32.]The Prime Minister has informed the Committee, in reply to the criticism of the honourable member for Flinders, that the extra cost of the Land Tax Department is to be accounted for partly by the permanent appointment of many employees whose positions had been only temporary. For - some time. I have been endeavouring to have some of the men in the New South Wales - office made permanent, but without success. They complain bitterly about being kept in temporary positions, saying that it was - unfair that they should have that status, because their duties require the possession of a good deal of technical knowledge, and - of an acquaintance with conveyancing law, and are of a strictly confidential nature. The final reply to my letters to the Department was that the desires of the men could not be complied with. Temporary hands may have been made permanent employ6s in some of the States, but not in the Sydney office. In my opinion it is extraordinary that the cost of the Department should have increased from £55,000 to £80,000. Had it remained at £55,000 the amount would be very large. When the land tax proposals were before us, it was strongly urged in their favour that the collection of the tax would cost very little, because the returns would be furnished by the land-owners under heavy penalties for false statements, and, therefore, only a very small staff would be needed. It might have been expected, too, that the cost of collection would have been greater in the first year or so before the machinery had been got into full working order than now, and that there would be a decrease instead of an increase in the expense. At first, complications would naturally arise through the staff being new to its duties, and many unforeseen difficulties would crop up. I understand, however, that the cost of collection is increasing by leaps and bounds, and this year will amount to 25 per cent, more than it did last year. I endorse the remarks as- which have been made by the honourable member for Parramatta about the unwisdom of erecting enormous buildings for banking premises throughout the Commonwealth. We have no warrant for the expenditure of huge sums on sky-scrapers for the accommodation of the Commonwealth Bank, seeing that it has yet no business. The honourable member pointed out, too, that the Act requires the production of a quarterly return, and that no such return has been made. The Commonwealth Bank is going to compete with the private banks throughout Australia, and yet we cannot be told what business it is doing. At the same time, the Governor is making arrangements for the purchase of blocks of land at enormous prices, and the erection of costly premises all over the Commonwealth. It is not sound that this matter should be intrusted wholly to one man. No one would cast any reflection on the Governor, but one man should not have the responsibility of expending huge sums of Government money. Very often the result of throwing temptation in the way is the downfall of the person tempted, and while I think that the Governor is a man of integrity and - honour, I feel it is not right that the ness of the country should be conducted in this way - Some other method should be followed in connection with land purchases. The way in which the affairs of the bank have been conducted so far do not reflect credit on those responsible for the scheme. They have been conducted in a slipshod fashion, which in the end will probably bring serious loss on the people of Australia. It was a mistake to establish a Commonwealth Bank to compete with the private banks already in existence. The Commonwealth Bank cannot hope to compete successfully with the long established private banks.",22
142,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Commonwealth Bank is protecting the other banks, and is offering a lower rate of interest on deposits. It offers only 3 per cent, while the State Savings Banks offer 3 and 4 per cent.",23
143,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,To my mind the manner in which purchases of l'and are being made for sites for bank premises is unsound. This matter should be dealt with by a Board.,23
144,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Home Affairs Department is carrying out the resumptions in accordance with the Commonwealth law.,23
145,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does that mean the Minister ?,23
146,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The law provides that certain procedure must be followed, and its provisions are being complied with under the direction of the Minister.",23
147,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Who decides what land shall be purchased, and what price shall be paid for it?",23
148,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have already put all the details into Hansard.,23
149,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have had very little information given to us regarding these Estimates, so that it is hard to understand them. The Prime Minister has explained that the contribution to charitable institutions has been increased in connection with the maintenance of old-age pensioners by those institutions, but I fail to see why there should be an increase from £7,000 to £9,000 a year. It was taken for granted that under a Labour Government very little charitable expenditure would be needed, but apparently for the maintenance of pensioners in institutions £2,000 more is required this year than last. I do not complain of the expenditure of money on charity of this kind. We should spend all that is needed to alleviate the sufferings of the aged and busiinfirm, but I cannot think that this increase in expenditure is necessary.",23
150,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"New England) [11.45] - The honourable member for North Sydney has spoken somewhat unfairly of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable gentleman, as a man possessing business knowledge,, must know that it takes time to establish a bank, and that an immense expenditure has been necessary to put the private banks into their present positions. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is evidently possessed of one of the essentials to success-confidenc e in the future of the institution that he is managing. If he had not that confidence he would have no right to his position. The private banks may well have nothing good to say of the Commonwealth Rank, because 1 undoubtedly it will compete strongly with them. The Governor has, however, treated the State Savings Banks more than fairly by offering a lower rate of interest than they are offering. This action should 5 inspire confidence. The State SavingsBanks have already enormous sums invested, and their expenses are not so great as they were at the beginning, so that they can perhaps afford to pay interest at the rate of 3 or 4 per cent. But had* 1 the Governor of the Commonwealth Savings Bank offered a big rate of interest,. I should have felt a little alarmed because it would have looked like "" wildcat"" financing. He should be praised* for what he has done. No doubt, when the bank is well established, and the initial' cost of establishing it has been met, he will gradually increase the rate of interest, and begin to compete more largely with the State Savings Banks. He will have every right to the business he gets if the people choose to deposit their money in the Commonwealth instead of in the State Savings Banks. Regarding the complaint that there has been no quarterly return of the business of the bank, I would point out that it is only the Commonwealth Savings Bank that has commenced business, and that the general bank will not be open before ist January next. When that bank has been opened, and is in full swing, I shall join with those who demand quarterly statements of its"" business. But the Governor must first be given an opportunity to get things in order. I agree with those who say that the cost of collecting the land tax should Be carefully scrutinized, but I am. prepared tostrengthen the hands of the Minister in obtaining more effective valuations. The evasion of land tax by the making - of unfair valuations is as old as land taxation. I am not enthusiastic regarding rthe results of the Land Tax Act. - Undoubtedly it has done some good an breaking up big estates; but I am not satisfied with, its effect in some localities, and local residents admit that it has not been effective there. The --suspicion has entered my mind that the - chief reason for the ineffectiveness of the tax in those districts is that there has been a dodging of proper valuations. The valuations should be increased to something Hike the level of the prices demanded' for - the land which is being cut up. These - men are defeating closer settlement by asking enormous prices for their land. They - are quite willing to pay land tax on a valuation of £ 3 per acre, but in offering it to the public they demand from £ 6 to .£8 an acre for it.",23
151,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Because they have improved it.,24
152,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am speaking of unimproved values.,24
153,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When a man sells his land, ihe sells it improved.",24
154,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then to make (the matter clear to the honourable member, let me say that sometimes a man who has valued his land at £ 3 per acre for land tax purposes, asks £ 7 an acre for it when he proceeds to subdivide it, the increase representing only £ 1 per acre for improvements. I contend that valuations are - dodged in all directions. Very considerable savings might be effected if the Commonwealth, the States, and the shire coun-cils interested in securing correct valuations owners. - were to co-operate so as to secure a uniform - scheme. Such a scheme carried out by a - well organized Land Tax Office, could be - utilized by all concerned as the basis for ^collecting land tax, and very considerable - savings could be effected on the cost of administration. Like others who have advo-cated this tax, I am tied fast to an exemption of £5,000 unimproved value, and if I altered my mind in that regard I should have to resign my seat in this Parliament. At the same time. I am also pledged to make the tax thoroughly effective. I therefore - urge the Treasurer to stand to his guns, and to see that effective valuations are secured, even if the cost of administration is slightly increased.",24
155,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wilmot) [11.55] The honourable member for New England seems to think that the land tax is not effective.,24
156,Mr FRANK FOSTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y in certain localities.,24
157,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In that respect the honourable member appears to differ from many of his party, who boasted at the beginning of the session that last year, as the result of the operation of this tax, £22,000,000 worth of land had been subdivided. I do not ascribe to the operation of the tax any such beneficial result. My own opinion is that if large estates had been cut. up to the extent suggested by honourable members opposite, we should not have had this year-as the Treasurer estimates to receive- a revenue within £5,000 of the amount derived from this source during the first year of the operation of the tax. It seems to me that the increase of £25,000 in the cost of administering the Department is unwarranted. If , as a result of the tax, large estates are being cut up, the cost of administration should be reduced, and if from year to year the revenue from this source is to decrease, there is no reason why the cost of administration should be increased. It is an unbusinesslike procedure to convert a number of temporary assessors into permanent employees of the Department. When the Land Tax Bill was before us, we were told that we were going to avoid a very heavy expenditure by the introduction of the self-assessment system. The Bill provided for the most barbarous penalties where land-holders failed to send in correct assessments, but the assessment notices were no sooner circulated than a whole army of assessors was sent out to check the assessment made by the Either the self-assessment system is a farce, or there, is no necessity to appoint a lot of permanent assessors. In Tasmania we have State assessors as well as Commonwealth assessors, dealing with land valuations, and it seems to me that if this tax is - to be as effective as we were told it would be, there should be a lightening of these burdens. As to the suggestion that incorrect valuations are sent in, I believe that people have done their best to put before the Commissioner fair valuations of their property. If that were not so, we should have heard of many prosecutions.  have simply increased the assessments made by land-holders.",24
158,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that many assessments have been so increased. In one or two cases which have come under my own notice, the departmental valuers seem, to have agreed with the assessments made by land-holders.",25
159,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I know of several cases where the departmental valuers have increased the assessments made by owners.,25
160,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Ha d the owners incorrectly assessed their properties?,25
161,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In the majority of cases, honest mistakes had been made.",25
162,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Many land-holders not experts in making up returns as to the unimproved value of property.,25
163,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And some of the valuers who have been appointed are not experts. On the whole, I think that the land-holders have made out their returns, quite honestly, and as well as could be expected. That being so, it is strange that so many assessors should be appointed to travel round the country checking valuations. In passing the Bill, we believed we should avoid considerable expense by providing for self-assessments. Had we not thought so, I do not think that we should have agreed to the system. New Zealand Government found, after a time, that the self-assessment system was liable to a great deal of abuses-that owners of land far removed from railways arid other means of communication could undervalue their properties with impunity, knowing that there was not much likelihood of the Government ever demanding its surrender, whereas those owning land in favourable localities placed a high valuation on it in the hope that the Government would give them 10 per cent, on their valuations, and take it over. Either the land-owners ought to be relieved of the necessity of furnishing returns to the Commissioner every twelve months, or permanent assessors ought not to be required. If we are to have permanent assessors, let them make the assessments, and let us give the owners the right of appeal. Land-holders would not object to the retention of these officers by the Department if they were relieved of the trouble of making up the annual returns. the increases that have been made in certain assessments, I understand that in some cases a decision has not yet been arrived at, although two years have elapsed since the Act was passed. I am informed that some time ago the Department found it practically impossible to assess certain values in cases where men held interests in land as well as in insurance and other companies. The complications with which the Department were confronted in these cases made it difficult to arrive at a decision, and I understand that where they did come to a determination to make an increase the revenue obtained was barely sufficient to justify the work involved in securing it. It is exceedingly difficult to determine what is the unimproved value of certain land interests. The only other matter to which I desire to refer is the are Commonwealth Bank. I hope that when it is well established, the quarterly return, which the Governor is required to furnish under the Act, will be promptly presented, so that honourable members wilt be able to see for themselves what progress is being made by the institution.",25
164,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Maribyrnong) [12.2] I am rather inclined to agree with the honourable member for New England, that whilst we are all anxious that the provisions of the Commonwealth Bank Act passed last session shall be complied with, it must be recognised that the Governor has been busily engaged in organizing The work since his appointment, and that this is probably the reason why the first quarterly return has not been furnished as promptly as some honourable members would have liked. In view of that fact, I think that some slight margin sliould be allowed.",25
165,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I find that the Governor has sent along a tentative report, the form of which has only to be settled before it is published in the Gazette. The Bank was only opened on the 17th July.",25
166,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think it' was opened on the 15th July, and it is gratifying to know that in Victoria alone deposits amounting to £350,000 have been made with the Savings Bank branch, an interesting feature of the business being that withdrawals are exceptionally small. This fact proves, to my mind, that even those outside the ranks of the workers are placing money on fixed deposit with the Bank. Then, again, in Queensland, where the Savings Bank branch has been in operaAs to tion for less than two months, the deposits amount to, I think, about £1.50,000. This shows, to my mind, that the people thoroughly appreciate the system. I met, the other day, an old friend of mine whose confidence in the Bank was such that he had .just deposited £ 1 0 0 in it, and I am sure that, before long, such deposits will be general. I am confident that when the general Bank is opened it will do excellent business. As it is, we have made a very good start. The Governor is not advertising the Bank by means of large posters and placards all over the country.",25
167,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I saw a huge sign being carried down the street the other day.,26
168,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is about time that we had some large posters sent out. The Victorian branch of the Bank is being carried on in an obscure building in Collins-street; the name is painted in modest letters on the window, and' there is nothing to suggest that deposits will be received there. The Governor is moving along modestly and quietly, and I rather admire him for his action; bpt, notwithstanding that there has been no blare of trumpets, the people are sending along their deposits.",26
169,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Especiall y those who are over the interest-bearing limit in the State Savings Bank. They are getting interest on their deposits in both banks.,26
170,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand that some of our Ministers have been cute enough to do that; that they have a certain amount in the State Savings Bank, on which interest is being paid, and that they are also drawing interest on deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I believe that honourable members opposite admire that kind of financing. I do not know how many valuers have been appointed in the various States, but it is only a little over twelve months since they were appointed in Victoria. In the first year of the-Land Tax the owners were called upon to make their own valuations, and then valuers were to be appointed in each State to revise them. In many cases in Victoria considerable increases have been made in the valuations, particularly in the fertile Western District. It is a great pity that we cannot prevent the multiplication of officers in this connection. In New Zealand, where, - of course, they have the advantage of only - one Government, one set of men make the municipal, the Dominion land tax, and the probate valuations; and such an arrangement, of course means considerable - saving. I believe that in New South Wales all the municipalities outside Sydney base their rating on unimproved values, and, that being so, I think all the assessments-municipal , Federal, :State-migh t be made by one set of men. In Victoria, the Federal and State taxes are imposed on the unimproved value, so one set of officers should carry out both valuations. Unfortunately, however, the jealousy of State Righters continues to cost the taxpayers of the country considerable sums of money.",26
171,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Especiall y the duplication of savings banks !,26
172,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As to that, when I have addressed meetings, some of them in the honourable member's constituency, people have been astonished when they have learned that the Federal Treasurer offered the State Treasurers 75 per cent, of all the new business while leaving the old business undisturbed, and even a proportion of the remaining 25 per cent., while permitting the post-offices and postal officials to be used for the banking business. When the people realise the true position of affairs, they will not be able to understand why such a munificent offer was not accepted by the various State Treasurers. It is true that we looked forward to the expenses of the collection of the land tax being a light burden on the Commonwealth. We find that in Victoria the cost of collecting the State Land Tax on unimproved values in 1911-12 was £24,349, on a revenue of £293,823, and on an estimated revenue for 1912-13 of £290,000, or nearly £4,000 less than in the previous year, the expenses are expected to amount 1 0 £ 3 \ 5 3 - The Treasurer has promised C 8 to explain fully how the £80,000 required to collect the Federal Land Tax is made up. The figures quoted in regard to State tax collection would appear to show that there may be several influences at work which would lead to an increase. A very fair comparison can be made between Victoria and the Commonwealth as a whole in this connection, because the State Land Tax and the Federal Land Tax, both on an unimproved value basis, were imposed about the same time. In the State, valuers had to be appointed and, of course, they cost money, but I would like to point out that the cost of collection in the case of the State is over 8 per cent., and in the case of the Commonwealth it is less than 4 per cent.",26
173,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Commonwealth Land Tax involves much bigger items.,26
174,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so; but the ' Commonwealth Land Tax covers the whole and of this continent, whereas Victoria is only a small State-on e fact counteracts the other.. In the case of the vast stretches. 5282 Estimates.

Honourable members may take the figures I have quoted for what they are worth, but they prove, at any rate, that the cost of collecting the Commonwealth tax is about half the percentage of the cost in the case of the State. I shall be glad to read the first report of the Governor of the Bank, and I feel confident that, with a shrewd Scotchman at the Treasury, the expenses will be kept down to a minimum.",26

A communication from the association at Childers is as follows :I wish also to say that not nearly as much cane pended. planting has been done here this year (since the issue of the recent regulations) as' in former years, nor will there be, because a good many of the farmers here intend to allow a certain area to drop out of cane, so much so that for the oeeds of cultivation they would only need to - employ two men in the future where they have - employed three in the past. They intend to turn ihe remainder of the land to such other use as they can manage to do themselves.",28
208,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is an attack on the wages.,28
209,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , it is not; it is 1 only a statement. I noticed from a report of a meeting of small cane-growers, who are protesting against the present position, though not against wages, that one of them was not making above £ 2 10s. a week.",28
210,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unfortunately, in cane growing, as in every other industry, there are unfortunate men.",28
211,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We should not add to their misfortunes by any action of ours, but make the conditions such that even the smallest grower will get a fair return. I see that the Treasurer's advance has increased from £200,000 in the first instance, and £400,000 a year ago, to ^£500,000 this year.",28
212,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is now less in proand jportion than it was in earlier years.,28
213,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That all depends on private what the proportion is based. The Treasupplied to it. surer's advance means a large sum of money placed at his disposal to meet contingencies, the expenditure afterwards being submitted to Parliament for approval.",28
214,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Treasurer has nothing except money voted for specified objects-the advance is not in excess of the ' amount voted.,28
215,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But it is voted for un- specified purposes.,28
216,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,28
217,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not specified what this advance is for.,28
218,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unles s there is money saved in other expenditure I cannot use any of this advance. If every item were expended, I should have no advance at all.",28
219,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so, but in the vote of £644,296 for the Treasurer's Department is included the £500,000 for the Treasurer's advance.",28
220,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member will see that at the end of the Estimates it is cut out again. There is an authorization of £500,000, but unless money is saved on items the advance cannot be ex",28
221,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On page 34 there is a deduction shown.,28
222,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If every item was expended we should have no advance at all.,28
223,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why is the amount increased from £400,000 to £500,000?",28
224,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no particular reason, but it is not by any means an unsafe amount, and is less in proportion.",28
225,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fawkner) [12.31] I ask the Prime Minister whether it is not possible to give effect to the suggestion of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and co-operate with the State and municipal authorities in making land valuations ?",28
226,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I shall be glad to cooperate in any way possible.,28
227,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the Prime Minister make some overtures to the States ? The number of officials connected with the collection of land tax and income tax is so large as to make one fear that Australians are becoming a race of tax collectors. Many of these men could be much better employed in other occupations.,28
228,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A difficulty in the way of co-operation is that the Commonwealth law the laws of the States make it an offence for a Department to divulge the and confidential information that is,28
229,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am sure that the public would rather run the risk of the leakage of secrets than continue to pay three sets of officials for valuation work that could be done by one set.,29
230,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I think that when any information has been asked for the reply has been given that the law would not permit of its being supplied.:,29
231,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member for Flinders has mentioned that although the land tax has been in operation for two years no assessment has yet been made regarding the holdings in companies.,29
232,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The companies have been assessed.,29
233,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The companies have paid the tax, and so have private individuals holding land, but shareholders in companies and banks have also to be assessed, and do not know what tax they will have to pay. An honourable member to whom I spoke was amazed to learn that he is liable for two years' taxation. It will probably cost more to collect this tax than will be received, because the difficulties in the way of its collection are enormous. I ask the Prime Minister, therefore, to consider whether it is worthwhile to collect it. Although honourable members opposite wish to tax the big estates I do not think that they wish to penalize people. When the tax comes to be collected many persons will be unable to pay it, because they will have spent their incomes not knowing of it ",29
234,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Attorney-General's Department must deal with that matter.,29
235,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Prime Minister might well consider whether the tax will be worth collecting in view of what the collection would cost. Some very able articles are now appearing in the Argus on the subject of finance.,29
236,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are too political to be of value.,29
237,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A matter to which 'T wish to draw attention is, I think, of importance. The writer deals with the question, how to meet a crisis. Banking crises occur periodically, and the proper time for legislating in regard to them is a time of peace and prosperity. In the Old Country it has been customary, when crises arrive, to suspend the bank charter, and make notes legal tender. It is usually not that the depositors are frightened that they will not get their money, but that they fear that others will get in before them,.and that they will have to wait. The Argus writer says that the Government, having control of the note issue, it is not possible to give the relief which is given in England In 1893 Sir George Dibbs made the notes of the banks legal tender in New South Wales.",29
238,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wit h the consent of Parliament, which was in session.",29
239,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should like to see this matter gone into. To call together Parliament during a crisis might accentuate the panic, and it would be some time before anything could be done.",29
240,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member suggest that the private banks should issue notes?,29
241,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The subject needs looking into.,29
242,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Any Government that was worth its salt would do what is needed, and come to Parliament afterwards for an indemnity.",29
243,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the honourable member think that we should Have a reserve power to issue notes as legal tender unrestrictedly during a crisis?,29
244,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I think that the banks should be allowed to issue them on giving approved security. Under the old system a bank could be authorized to issue notes to any value required, but under the present system, if a run occurred, the bank could only issue the notes that it held, and to get more would have to pay gold for them.",29
245,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Would it not be a better way out of the difficulty to empower the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to make advances to the other banks, those advances being a first charge on their assets?",29
246,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should not like to give an opinion offhand, but the matter is one worth considering.",29
247,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have thought for a long time that what I suggest is the easiest way out of the difficulty. The Governor is a practical banker, who will jfcnow the state of affairs and where the pinch is most felt. He could, if necessary, aid a bank, his advances to it being a first charge on its assets.",29
248,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Eithe r that might be done, or the banks might Be allowed to issue notes on giving approved security.",29

250,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Undoubtedly . have suggested that he should go through the affairs of the bank and approve of them, but the Prime Minister's suggestion is the better one. The Government would have the protection afforded by the knowledge of an experienced man. This being a time of prosperity, it is desirable to make provision now for emergencies.",30
251,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Moreton) [12.44] - I hope that the Government will seriously consider the suggestion of the honourable member for Darling Downs regarding the sugar industry. In the Moreton division a number of small farmers grow cane as a side crop, and they naturally desire definite information as to what is to be done order to know whether it will be worthwhile to continue growing cane. The present uncertainty is playing havoc with the sugar industry throughout Australia. I should like the Prime Minister to urge the Commissioners to send him an advance report as early as possible. The relations between this Government and that of Queensland seem to be strained, though I am at a loss to know why, because „they are both interested in the sugar industry, and should try to work harmoniously to settle the important questions affecting it. Unless matters are expedited"", nothing will be done during the present session of this or the Queensland Parliament, in which case there will be another twelve months' delay, much to the detriment of the sugar industry I wish to know what provision is made for reimbursing charitable institutions for the maintenance of old-age pensioners. I know of one or two cases in which old-age pensioners have had their pensions stopped while they have been in hospitals, but what I am referring to is the complaint of the stitutions that they get no assistance from the Government for maintaining old-age pensioners, and I understand that pensioners have been refused admission to some institutions on that ground. In a leaflet circulated on behalf of the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum on Hospital Saturday and Sunday, it is stated that the cost of maintaining the inmates is £ 2 1 3s. gfdper head per annum, an increase on the cost of previous years. The increase was due mainly to the higher prices of provisions, and to the fact that the institution has had to take in old-age pensioners, in most instances in a deplorable and dying condition, so that they must be placed in a hospital, where the expense of maintaining I them is more than would have to be spent were they ordinary inmates. The following statement is made :An impression exists - that the asylum gains by receiving old-age pensioners; this is a mistake. The fact is the institution does not benefit one penny from their pensions; but, on the other hand, is put to a great expense, not only for maintenance, nursing, and medical attention, but with burial expenses, which is no small item. This institution is almost daily relieving the Melbourne, Alfred, St. Vincent, and other hospitals of cases, so that they can make room for more serious and urgent cases. These cases can obtain all the medical attention and nursing necessary in the asylum that their condition requires. These institutions publish to the people of Victoria the statement that they are in hampered rather than benefited by taking in old-age pensioners. I think that in the interests of these sufferers, the amount of the pensions should at least be given td^the institutions so that we may secure for them as much relief as possible. The Minister does not appear to be very much interested in this subject, but I hope that he will see that these public institutions receive the pensions payable to inmates if they do not already obtain some allowance in regard to them. As to the sugar industry, I am very anxious, in the interests of the small growers in my electorate, that the matter to which I have referred shall be settled as quickly as possible.",30
252,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling Downs) [12.53]. - We have in these Estimates an item relating to the Royal Commission on insurance, and I wish to ask whether the Government propose to take any action on the report presented by the Royal Commission appointed by the Deakin Government to inquire into the whole question of in- insurance laws in Australia. That Commission dealt with fire ancl life assurance, and also, I believe, with social insurance.",30
253,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I can only say that we are dealing now with an Insurance Bill.,30
254,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,-Will the Minister siry whether the Bill will cover the whole matter of general insurance?,30
255,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Attorney-General will explain the principles of the Bill when he is introducing it.,30
256,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is need for urgent action, and it seemed to us when we were in office that we should have a complete inquiry before legislation dealing with the subject was introduced. Mr. Justice Hood and Mr Knibbs were appointed Commissioners, and after making a most careful inquiry into the whole subject, they made certain clear and definite propositions, but although some years have elapsed since their report was presented, no definite action has yet been taken upon it. Strong representations have been made regarding the necessity for a uniform law, more especially in relation to life assurance. Life assurance companies, which, for the most part are conducted on the mutual principle, have cast upon them a costly duty in having to prepare annually six different sets of returns in respect of the six States of the Union. way a costly burden is being imposed upon policy holders, which could be avoided by means of a uniform law. The hope has been expressed that some uniform system will be devised, and the whole procedure simplified.",30
257,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"North Sydney) [12.57]^It seems to me to be an anomaly that whereas the cost of administering ""the in-valid and old-age pensions system is only .£43,875, the cost of administering the Land Tax Act is nearly twice as much. We were told when the Land Tax Bill was ibefore us that one of the advantages of - such a tax was that it cost very little to collect, and yet, notwithstanding that the returns have to be sent in by land-owners themselves, we are asked this year to vote £80,000 in respect of land tax administration. Very great dissatisfaction exists throughout the Commonwealth regarding the way in which the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act is being administered, and the discontent is most marked in relation to the administration of the invalid pensions branch. I have brought several cases of great hardship before the authorities.",31
258,Unknown,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Sitting suspended from z to 2.30 p.m. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [2.30] - I think that before we proceed with business we should have a Minister present. I , therefore, call attention to the want of a quorum [Quorum formed]. I regret the absence of the Treasurer, because there are in these Estimates, relating to his Department, two or three items to which I desire to call attention. In the first place there is an item of £800 in respect of note printing. I wish to know when these notes are likely to be put into - circulation, and how many are to be printed. I have seen some of the samples, and the printing, design and general appearance, are certainly excellent. of the designs are most artistic, and will not be a discredit to the Commonwealth as samples of our first venture into the realms of note printing. In view of the fact that the printing and issue will mark an historical epoch in the progress of the Commonwealth, as well as a distinct departure from the established practice in Australia, I should like the Treasurer to consider a suggestion that a complete set of cancelled notes be given to each member of the Parliament. They would form an interesting and historical souvenir, and if properly cancelled there could be no In this danger of their getting into circulation. I suggest that the first in notes printed should be cancelled and distributed as sou- . venirs amongst members of the Parliament. I am not quite certain, but I think that the notes have been designed and printed in Australia.",31
259,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , the plates are coming from the Old Country. 0 Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I . understand, however, that a plant is being obtained, and that experts are being engaged to do the work in Australia. Although the samples so far available have been executed in the Old Country, the notes to be issued to the public will be printed in Australia. If that be so, then honourable members would certainly appreciate the adoption of the suggestion I have made. There is precedent for it, inasmuch as in connection with the first Commonwealth stamp issue, sets of cancelled stamps were issued to honourable members, whilst on the introduction of the Commonwealth silver coinage the first in shillings struck were distributed amongst members. 1 hope that the Minister temporarily in charge of these Estimates will convey my suggestion to the Treasurer, and that he will endorse it. As to the item "" Additional Clerical and General Division Officers, £ 7 0 0 , "" I wish to know whether these officers are to be employed temporarily or permanently. The growing practice of appointing large staffs of temporary assistants in the Clerical and General Divisions' of the Service is not a good one. Experience has shown it to be a great mistake. Just at a time when labour of the kind becomes most valuable to the Commonwealth is the very time it has to be dispensed with. Under the Public Service Act, a temporary employee may be employed for only six months, and, only in Some very special circumstances, for another three months in any one year, and it very often happens that such employees have to be discharged when additional assistance is required late in the year when the Christmas season is approaching. The trouble in dispensing with the services of temporary employees in this way is that permanent officers have to be detached from their ordinary duties, and devote much time to instructing the newcomers, and this gives rise to general disorganization. As a matter of fact, the temporary employees, instead of being of assistance in the various Departments, are, for a considerable time, an absolute hindrance. I should like to know whether the additional officers provided for are to be permanent or temporary. As to lending and borrowing, it would be interesting to know whether it is intended by the Government, in their newly-established policies, to borrow the deposits in the Commonwealth Savings Bank in order to meet some of the commitments for which it is now desired to raise money. The honourable member for Darling Downs endeavoured to elicit some information, but the Treasurer was very reticent and unwilling to impart any. If the Treasurer's purpose is to borrow the people's savings for some of the projects on account of which the Loan Bill was recently passed, it may prove a further cause of stringency in the local money market. Indeed, I am surprised that the Government have launched out with a borrowing policy, because I see that no later than the last general election a great parade was made of the fact that the Labour policy was a non-borrowing one.",31
260,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member cannot show that. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - In a circular issued by Mr Jelley, a defeated Labour candidate, the public were asked to "" compare the non-borrowing policy "" of the Labour party with the borrowing started by the Liberal party, and were asked to vote for Jelley in order to keep the Commonwealth "" free of debt."" As a matter of fact, however, under a Labour Government we are getting more and more into debt every day. It was not until the present Treasurer took charge of the finances that the Commonwealth was involved in any borrowing. The Liberal Government carried out all public works by means of the ordinary revenue, and when they made a proposal to borrow, even for naval purposes, there was an outcry by honourable members opposite.",32
261,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Her e is the programme of the Labour party, which is in favour of the ""restriction"" of borrowing. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What I have read is not in the programme, but is the tale that was told to the people.",32
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And the Labour party told the people to vote for Jelley and his policy. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Some of the most prominent members of the Labour party supported Mr Jelley on the public platform, and not one of them contradicted Mr Jelley's version of what was the policy of the party. Mr Jelley does not merely talk of a non-borrowing policy on the platform, but declares for it in a printed leaflet, which cannot be gainsaid. So far as the Liberal party in this House is concerned, it never did start a borrowing, policy.  Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Now, , however, we find the Treasurer accumulating all sorts of Trust Funds, and diverting them from the purposes for which they were voted to other purposes not yet authorized by Parliament. This candidate, Mr Jelley, as I say, declared that the policy of the Labour party was a non-borrowing policy, and that only the wicked Liberal party was responsible for such a policy, although it had never borrowed a single penny. It is just as well that the public should know the truth about these matters-thes e deliberate attempts to mislead the public by throwing dust in their eyes, and misrepresenting the other side. If it were not for this printed publication of Mr Jelley honourable members opposite would have denied that anything of the kind was said.  tleman. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Some of the honourable member's leaders' know him, however, and sat with him on the same platform. The leaflet is one continual denunciation of the Liberal party for engaging in a policy of borrowing. It is pointed out in the leaflet that before the advent of the Labour party the States under Liberal Administrations had borrowed £251,773,000, and this was condemned as unsound finance. Notwithstanding all these denunciations of the Liberal party in the States for borrowing for reproductive works, we find a Labour Government enjoying the public distinction of being the first in the Commonwealth to go on the money market for a loan. The Government started their career with a forced loan from the people on the note issue. One of their first acts, it will be seen, was to throw overboard the whole of their non-borrowing policy, and all their professions on the public platform. Many honourable members opposite secured their seats by appealing to the credulity and lack of knowledge of the people who returned them, and how woefully they have been deceived. We have the Treasurer not only borrowing, but starting as a money lender, and I expect before the close of the session to see three golden balls hanging in the portico of Parliament House with the legend, "" Money lent on good security."" I do not think it is proper for a Government to do work of this kind, which should be left to private enterprise.  Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is the Labour Government who are playing the part of "" Ikey Mo,"" and what I am concerned about is the depletion of the local gold reserves and the savings of the people, mostly of the wage-earning classes. There is a risk of increased financial tightness if this system, inaugurated by the present Government, is continued. Already, through local borrowing, in New South Wales and elsewhere, the money market has tightened wonderfully, and private investors find it most difficult to obtain advances in order to carry out their enterprises. The Government would have been well advised if they had raised their loans, as previously, from British investors, but British investors, with the present outlook, as a result of Labour administration, are very loth to find the money. As a matter of fact, New .South Wales had to go to a foreign money-lender, and enjoy the peculiar distinction of being the first Government in Australia to raise a loan in a foreign market. I am certain we are on the wrong track in the management of our Trust Funds and loans from Trust Funds, and we shall presently find ourselves tied in a knot. In the event of a crash we shall find the trouble accentuated, and not relieved, by what is happening now. 1 do not desire to see the Commonwealth of Australia in such a position, but we are fast approaching a crisis, if we follow the lines laid down by the State and Commonwealth Labour . Governments. I see that the Treasurer's Advances has been increased from £400,000 last year to £500,000 foi this year. It will be noted that of the £400,000 voted last year none was expended, and I should like some explanation why, under the circumstances, this amount has been increased to enable the Treasurer, according to a note on the Estimates, to make advances to public officers, and to meet expenditure, the particulars of which will afterwards be included in a parliamentary appropriation. We have no information in this connection, and apparently are not going to get any until after the money is spent, or we are pledged to spend it. Apparently it is not supposed to be the function of the Government to take any notice of Opposition criticism, or to afford any information, although we have to represent our constituents even to a greater extent than have honourable members opposite. I understand that all these matters are arranged in another place upstairs, and that Parliament is only a secondary consideration; but from the point of view of courtesy alone, members of the Opposition are entitled to be furnished with information regarding the spending of the money they are called upon to vote. Only the most casual references are made by the Treasurer to the expenditure of his Department, although it amounts to hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the Estimates, altogether, represent millions. The same policy of reticence is adopted in regard to all the Departments, and information has to be dragged out piecemeal in a series of questions which ought not to be necessary. We ought to be given full information as to the financial position of the Treasurer's Department-the commitments, the requirements for the current year-and , if necessary, there should be memoranda supplying the details. As it is, we have to dig and delve as best we may in order to search out the various items, which in many cases are covered up in such a way as to elude our vigilance. I should like information on some other points, but at present I will leave the matter in the hope that it will be supplied by the Treasurer or by some other Minister. The Treasurer himself does not seem to attach the slightest interest or importance to the opinion of Parliament, or to the criticisms offered even by Opposition leaders and the financial experts of our party. The right honourable gentleman waves all criticism aside in an airy way on the principle of the interjection by the honourable member for Maranoa the other day when he told us "" Not to worry.""",32
263,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why not treat the Treasurer with silent contempt? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - And allow the Estimates to slip through without any consideration? Personally, that is what I should feel inclined to do-to meet discourtesy with discourtesy-bu t I have to recognise a higher obligation, not only to the Treasurer and to Parliament, but to those who sent me here to look after their interests. It is in the interests of my stituents that I am making these few remarks, and I do not desire to go before them and confess that I voted millions without the remotest knowledge of the purposes for which they were intended.",34
264,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member supported the Reid Ministry when it kept us sitting all night, and made us pass the Estimates for six Departments in a few hours. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - My memory does not carry me back so far as that, but I recollect the lively time that we had when the Labour party was in Opposition. The present Ministers have received better treatment from this Opposition than they extended to us. Briefly, the three questions to which I desire replies are these-first , when will the new Commonwealth notes be put into circulation?",34
265,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Earl y in the new year. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - My second question is-Will the Prime Minister consider the suggestion I made that the members of this Parliament should be supplied with the first of the note designs printed, cancelled, so that they shall have no exchangeable value ? The designs are very artistic, and, I understand, emanated from our own people, although they were executed in England,",34
266,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They are Treasury denot signs. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - They are the finest sample of work of the kind I have seen. Members received the first one hundred and eleven shillings of the Australian coinage that were issued.

267,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Permanent . They are to be employed in the notes branch, where we have decided that there shall be no temporary hands. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It would be a dangerous thing to employ temporary hands there.",34
268,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.8] - There is some misconception as to the purpose of the Treasurer's Advance. The Treasurer is not empowered to expend money in excess of the appropriations for particular items, but, it being impossible to foresee a year's transactions, it is necessary to provide a sum out of which to meet emergencies. con- The Treasurer is authorized to make advances with regard to necessary work, and £500,000, the sum now provided for the purpose, is less proportionately than the £200,000 that was given to Sir George Turner. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Was the £400.000 voted last year all spent?",34
269,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Ver y nearly. It has never been suggested, during my term of office, that any of this expenditure has had a political purpose, and I should be no party to such expenditure. The Constitution does not permit us to obtain money other than by an appropriation of this kind, and the appropriations of Parliament are not exceeded even when the total Advance is spent.",34
270,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the amount of the Advance is never exceeded.,34
271,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . The suggestion that honourable members should be given specimen copies of the new note requires consideration. Banks, in this and other countries, have cancelled notes by perforating them, but some of these notes have afterwards been successfully circulated, being accepted by the cleverest tellers, because the perforations have been so cleverly filled up. Consequently, it is now often the practice when a note has been cancelled to cut a piece off it. I should like to give a reply to the honourable 'member for Lang until I had obtained expert advice regarding his suggestion.",34
272,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member could get one of the notes by paying £ 1,34
273,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-Yes, I have already Are done that myself, wishing for a specimen of the first issue. If honourable members wish it, the first notes issued can be reserved for them, and they can ballot for them.",34
274,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,For one of each denomination?,35
275,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Certainly , or as many as they please if they pay for them. In that way the Commonwealth will be able to raise a small loan without interest. As the ios. note is entirely a novelty, honourable members might like to have a specimen of it.",35
276,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Eac h denomination has a different design, and they are all picturesque.",35
277,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The design of the ios. note is a beautiful one, which T would commend to the consideration of honourable members. If honourable members wish to bonus""? have the first notes issued reserved to them. I would suggest a ballot, reserving self, as the Minister, the first number.",35
278,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is there anything for the Commonwealth Note Printer to do the present time, or is he merely drawing his salary while waiting for the machinery to be got ready?",35

282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They have post been sitting for a good many months, there seems to be no end to their inquiries. Of course, they are somewhat handicapped while Parliament is in session, but they costing a good deal. It mav be that shall find it necessary in the future to sist upon each Royal Commission reportordinary ing within a fixed time. The Sugar ComTreasurer.certificate mission, although its investigation is an important one, ought to have nearly finished its work.",35
283,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It could not get the evidence of the most important witness until about six weeks ago. Month aftermonth it was being opposed in the Court.,35
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Whose faultwas that?,35
285,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Sugar Company's.,35
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A silly remark such as that invites no reply. I would like to know from the Prime Minister whatmachinery he intends to provide for the disbursement of the maternity allowances,, or shall I call them baby bonuses?",35
287,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,35
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Prime Minister does not like the term "" baby",35
289,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not descriptive. The to myallowance is not a baby bonus. Mr. JOSEPH COOK, - Every argument used in support of the Government's at proposal shows that the allowance is a baby bonus. The sum of £5,000 is put down for the administration of the Act, and I should like to know what procedure I presume that and some inquiries will be made before money Surely the sum of £ 5 will not be returned by post whenever an application is received, no questions being",35

291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does the right alhonorable member intend to avail himself the stealing of of State machinery?,35
292,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.20] - I have asked Secretary to the Treasurer to send each aphonorable member a copy of the forms I do not know whether they have been received.,35
293,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not yet.,35
294,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They should have been received. There have been prepared three papers showing the way in which the maternity allowance may be applied for, and copies of these have been sent to every office as well as to every medical man but in Australia. A copy has already beenlaid on the table of the House. The information so furnished is to the effect that are where a child lives for more than twelve we hours nothing further is necessary on the inpart of the applicant than to fill in the forms, and to send them, together with the of registration, to the If the information so supplied is satisfactory, the applicition is at once granted.",35
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Suppos e a wife authorized a husband to receive the allowance on her behalf, should there not be some attestation of the wife's signature on the authorizing form?",36
296,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He r signature must be duly given. An intending mother may, prior to the birth of the child, fill in a form assigning to her husband or some other person her right to the allowance.",36
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Act provides for that.,36
298,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Quite so, and we have prescribed the manner in which this may be done. Forms have been drawn up to simplify the whole procedure. The officers of the Treasury dealing with the maternity allowance are not confined to that branch of work. They are general Treasury officials of good standing, capable of dealing with financial matters, and of determining whether an application is bond fide, just as a banker, by reason of his experience, has usually little difficulty in determining the bona fides of certaindocuments. The real difficulty arises in the case of born children or those who live for less than twelve hours. In the case of a stillborn child, a medical certificate that it was a viable child must be provided if there is a medical man in the district, but where a doctor is not available a qualified nurse or other witness must certify. We have to take these precautions against the possibility of abuse of a most serious kind; the Commissioner must be satisfied in all cases that the application is a bond fide one. The honourable member asked whether we were using the State machinery, and I am glad to be able to inform him that all the States have agreed to their registrars co-operating with us in this matter. We are making them a small allowance for the work done. The expenditure on the administration of this fund will represent so low a percentage on the actual amount distributed that it is hardly worth mentioning. The desire is to make the payment as expeditious as possible. Where the papers sent in are in order, a money order will be sent out immediately upon their receipt. As the Act came into operation before the whole of the machinery was in readiness, there may be at first some strained cases, but later on the whole procedure will be simplicity itself.",36
299,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [3-25]-There is in this division an item relating to coinage, and in connection with it I should like to refer to a paragraph published in the newspapers some little time ago to the effect that the Commonwealth Government intended to introduce a nickel coin. If any nickel coins be introduced, I trust that the Treasurer will see that they have a hole punched through them. In some countries which I recently visited the nickel coins in use were larger than the silver coinage, although, of course, of less value, and the fact that a hole was punched through them enabled one to distinguish between the two without any difficulty whatever. One of the first statements I read in - the press on reaching the United States of America was that a proposition had been made to adopt the principle followed in Belgium and elsewhere, where a round hole is punched in a nickel coin, so that even if such a coin is of the same size as a silver coin carried in one's pocket, one can distinguish between the two by the touch. It is recognised throughout the world that nickel coins should have a hole in the centre in order that they may be readily distinguished from others. Usually stillthe hole in such coins is about three-sixteenths of an inch, and I am told that the Belgian practice is to be adopted in the United States.",36
300,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.28] - In the early days of Commonwealth coinage I favoured the use of nickel coins of low denomination, and, in reply to the honourable member for Capricornia, who has since impressed upon the Government the desirableness of their adoption, I have said that we favour their use. I do not agree with the honourable member for Fremantle, however, that nickel coins should have a hole punched through them. In Italy, and, I think, in India, the nickel coins in use have a carved flowing edge, beautiful in design, which sufficiently distinguishes them from the silver coinage, with a plain or a milled edge. I think that we should have a more artistic looking nickel coin, if , instead of punching a hole through it, we made it with a round flowing edge. Nickel coins are particularly necessary in hot countries, where people do not wish to carry heavy coppers in light dress.",36
301,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Fremantle) [3.29] - I think the Treasurer would acknowledge, if he only saw them, that nickel cobs with! holes in them are very artistic.",36
302,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have seen them.,36
303,Mr HEDGES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall be glad to present the Treasurer with a nickel coin tomorrow. While travelling abroad within the last twelve months I have seen all sorts of coins, and have no hesitation in saying that none was more beautiful than the Belgian nickel coin. Mr W. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [3.30]. - This seems to be one of the first opportunities that the Estimates offer to the mittee to deal with a matter which, in a general way, has been ventilated and discussed, not only during ""the financial debate in this House, but from the public platform, as well as in the press. I refer to the extraordinary increase in the current expenditure of the public Departments. When we have debated this matter generally we have been met with the statement that we were indulging in generalizations, and that we would not condescend to go into details. That is an accusation which can be met only by endeavouring to deal with the particulars when they come before us.",37
304,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We cannot charge the honourable member with not going into details.,37
305,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have endeavoured to go into details and they have not been altogether agreeable to my honourable friends opposite. We have in this vote several instances of very unusual and extraordinary increases for the ordinary administration of the Department. I wish to discuss this matter for the reason that whenever we engage in general criticism of the advancing expenditure ""required for the carrying on of the government, honourable members on the other side, either in this House or on the platform, accuse us of being opposed to such matters as the payment of old-age pensions and other proposals involving increases of expenditure which the public have demanded. We have our own views upon those matters;' but what I am dealing with at present has nothing to do with any increases in expenditure due to the adoption of such proposals, but with increases in the ordinary expenditure involved in carrying on the Department.",37
306,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are we not having good times?,37
307,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We have been having good times, or we could not face this expenditure. But when we find towards the expiration of a period of abnormally good times that in one year the expense of carrying on, for instance, the Accounts Branch of the Treasury increases by 23 per cent., we get something which requires a little investigation, and something which is not fully accounted for by the simple assertion that we are having good times now.",37
308,Mr FOWLER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It would be a very bad thing if salaries went up and down with the seasons. Mr W.. H . IRVINE - It certainly Comwould. If salaries and the number of officers employed in conducting a Department were to go up with good seasons they must come down with bad seasons.,37
309,Mr HOWE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Do they not, generally speaking ?",37
310,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the honourable member referring to the gross vote?,37
311,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes; it includes increases due, in some cases, to increments of salary, and in others possibly to the fact that a larger number of officers are employed.",37
312,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is the honourable gentleman dealing with the Accounts Branch only, or with the whole Department?",37
313,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am referring . to items which appear on the same page of the Estimates of the Treasury Department - the Accounts Branch, the Correspondence Branch, and Contingencies. I leave out the Australian Notes Branch, because that is a new matter, and is readily accounted for. I invite the honourable gentleman's attention to these very striking figures. If we compare the estimate of the vote required for the Accounts Branch for 1911-12-becaus e the actual expenditure is not given-wit h the estimate for the current financial year, we shall find that it has risen from £4,748 to £5,607, or an increase of about 23 per cent. The vote for the next item, the Correspondence Branch, ' has risen from £2,317 to £2,627. The advance there has not been so great, and represents an increase of about 15 per cent. . If we compare the estimate for the Correspondence Branch with the similar vote for 1909-10, immediately before the present Government came into office, we shall find that the expenditure for the same work has risen considerably.",37
314,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,For the same work?,37
315,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Practicall y the same work. The work of the Correspondence Branch of the Central Office of the Treasury cannot have been enormously increased merely because we are getting more revenue. It should increase a little, no doubt, but the increase should not be in anything like the same ratio as the increase in the revenue. The increase in the cost of this branch of the Department to be from £1,777 in for the current financial year. Let us now consider the expenditure upon continpenditure gencies. The vote in each case covers practhat tically the same things-allowanc e to officers, office cleaning, postage, telegrams, office requisites, and so forth-the ordinary contingencies of a Public Department. The vote for contingencies in 1909-10 was would be asked for. £4,403, ancl it has now gone up to £6,245. That is to sa years the vote has been increased by about 45 per cent. Can any honourable member dismiss that fact altogether from his mind States by merely saying "" Times are better, therefore we are spending more? The revenue has increased, therefore there penditure upon Contingencies^ in the Treasury?"" Is that a way in which to account for the increase? It is not an answer the objection to'say that public officers must get increments. We all know that; but in any well-regulated Public Service which increments of salary are granted the ordinary way, one would naturally expect that, after some years of working, as young men come in and old men leave the Service, a fairly even annual payment for the whole of the officers in a Departbefore ment would have been arrived at. After eleven years of Federation, we might ex-Commissioner. pect to have arrived at a stage at which, making full allowance for all increases pay in the ordinary course, a somewhat uniform annual expenditure upon a particufully lar Department would be arrived at. Somements. times, of course, we must employ more men, and there will be some increase in correspondence, or in the amount necessary for contingencies; but I submit that crease in the Contingency branch of this Department of 45 per cent, in three years Treasury. is a matter which calls for consideration.",37
316,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"At the time the honourable gentleman is referring to, there was little work involved in the payment of age pensions to be provided for, there no maternity allowance, and ho big in hand. All these matters involve clerical work. The note issue involves a deal of clerical work, as well as the of accountants. The honourable forgets that some very important services have been established since the time which' he refers.",38
317,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am prepared to make allowance for that.,38
318,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The land tax will account for a considerable increase in the expendiis shown ture of the Department. 1909-10 to £2,627 Mr WH IRVINE - All these things will account for some increase in the exupon the Department; but I say the increases disclosed in these EstiState mates seem to me to be enormous.",38

He must be satisfied that a clerk will be fully employed he gives one, even to the Treasury. This is an attack upon the Public Service",38

Surely the great Public Service Commissioner does not work dictate to the Treasurer as to the number gentleman of clerks he shall employ?,38
328,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He does, and he wouldtb do the same thing to the honourable member. I thought that the employment of another officer was necessary in the Department, but he thought otherwise.",38
329,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have heard that statement before from honourable members who do not occupy responsiFle positions. But I attached no importance to it.,39
330,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If I thought it absolutely necessary that I should secure the services of another clerk I would have to come down to Parliament, and state my reasons for my belief, and I would also have to say why the Commissioner had disapproved of the additional employment. That is the law. Does the honourable member wish me to break the law?",39
331,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do. not desire the Treasurer to break the law. Does he assure me that the Public Service Commissioner dictates to him. by telling him that he must employ more clerks?,39
332,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is endeavouring to get out of the position by means of a subtle legal quibble.,39
333,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I ask whether that interjection is a fair answer to my argument. I leave it to the ordinary sense of honourable members.,39
334,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What the Treasurer said was that he could not appoint an additional clerk without the consent of the Public Service Commissioner.,39
335,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And I must allow omcers to go away if the Public Service Commissioner thinks that there are too many employed in my Department.,39
336,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand that the Treasurer cannot employ any person who may be in the permanent service of the Commonwealth unless he is recommended by the Public Service Commissioner. That, however, is not my point. My point is that the expenditure in this Department has increased by leaps and bounds.",39

The Public Service Commissioner cannot say that the Treasurer is bound to employ a continually increasing number of clerks, otherwise the Treasurer, is a mere figure-head. He is not bound to accept the dictation of the Public Service Commissioner.

341,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the work has been doubled, that is a complete answer.. But to say, as the Treasurer does, that the Public Service Commissioner requires him to employ more omcers is not an answer.",39
342,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not what was said.,39
343,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Treasurer says that he cannot employ officers unless the Public Service Commissioner certifies that their services are necessary.,39
344,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the blame rests with the Public Service Commissioner Several Honorable MEMBERS - There is no blame.,39
345,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Public Service Commissioner has no right to say to the Treasurer, "" You are employing three clerks. I insist that you shall employ five clerks, in view of the amount of work there is to do.""",39
346,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was never said.,39
347,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why was the Public Service Commissioner mentioned at all?,39
348,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,For the simple reason that no clerk can be put on in the Treasurer's Department or in any other Department unles the Public Service Commissioner satisfies himself that the employment of a clerk is absolutely necessary.,39
349,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That means that if the Public Service Commissioner says to a Minister, "" You have too few clerks to do a certain amount of work """,39
350,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The work is there, and if the Public Service Commissioner is satisfied that there is work to be done he will authorize the employment of additional officers.",39
351,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can understand the Treasurer saying, "" It is true that I have appointed a larger number of clerks, but I left it to the Public Service Commissioner to determine whether there is work for them to do.""",39

357,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"When I attempt to arrive at the truth, I am told, in effect, that I have a motive in desiring to eliminate the Public Service Commissioner from this discussion. But I really do not think that crements. such interjections carry very much weight. The Treasurer will admit that if there reason for this great increase in the ordiexistence nary expenses of government, that reason ought to be presented to the Committee himself. We have had three Budget-statecent, ments from him, and in not one of them have I been able to find any explanation of the increases which have taken place this Department. There has merely been a general statement that there has been more work to do. I wish to know why, in the Accounts Branch of the Treasury, stance, there is an immense increase in the expenditure for 1912-13 as compared with that for 1911-12. Why has that expendiearn ture increased by 23 per cent, in one year? Surely the Treasurer might honour the Committee with his confidence in regard these matters. It is idle for him to accuse us of talking generalities if he will give us information upon specific We might expect an increase in the Correspondence Branch in three years, though would surprise me. to learn that there any good reason-unles s the Treasurer, who is in a position to know the facts, can nish one-for an increase of about 45 per cent. It seems very large. The difficulty is not that we are prepared to condemn these increases, but that we have not materials on which to form a satisfactory opinion.",40

Are these Departmental branches to be so managed that by we may expect increases of 20 and 25 per in each succeeding year ? Of course, the answer must be that the work of the Correspondence Branch has not increased to in such an extent. There is, I suppose, practically the same amount of work to be done, but we are paying 15 per cent, more for it this year than we did last, and 45 per cent, for inmore than we did a few years ago.",40
364,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Every few years the officers get increases of salary, which they on account of the extra skill acquired in their work. That is to say, they get increments, and are supposed to be able to to do more and better work for them.",40
365,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Surely a senior officer is not expected to be more expert than he was points. when he was a junior?,40
366,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That may be a it complete answer. The Treasurer may be is able to assure the Committee that the same omcers have been employed, but that the infurcreases are due to increments. Possibly we shall have to accept that answer. But that does not apply in the slightest degree to the enormous increase in the vote for conthe tingencies. The Minister of External Affairs smiles. Contingencies mean something to him.",40
367,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It depends upon what,40
368,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think the Minister of External Affairs is much troubled about anything as long as the revenue is coming in, and he is allowed to. develop his own ideas unrestrained. When as we come to deal with the Estimates of his Department, we may have something to say as that will affect him more closely. The instances that I have given are typical of the me increases throughout the whole Service. return One can expect that there should be of some increases, but these appear to be out of all proportion to the amount of work done or the amount of revenue received. I think the Treasurer might give honourable .members a little more information than he has ever yet done, either in his Budget Speeches or by statements in Committee.",40
369,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.55] - The honourable member for Flinders set out with the .object of showing that there has been extravagance in connection with this Department, and he was going to put his finger on some particular point to show where'the extravagance existed. My retort to him was that all the officers concerned had received increases in consequence of the action of the Public Service Commissioner. duty to prescribe the number of officers that a Department requires for the particular work that has to be done.",41
370,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Does that mean that the Government must employ additional officers if the Public Service Commissioner says that they are required?,41
371,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Government need not employ additional officers, or they may employ more than the Public Service Commissioner recommends; but if the Government do take exception to the Public Service Commissioner's certificate, they have to bring down their reasons to this Parliament, and lay them upon the table of the House. The honourable member for Flinders knows that. I will say this for the Public Service Commissioner: that, whatever other complaints may be made regarding him, he is certainly a diligent student of the work that is being performed by the Commonwealth Departments; and no Department gets an additional officer, and no officer gets an increase in his salary, unless the Public Service Commissioner has examined the case for himself, and ascertained whether what is asked for is warranted or' not. for that reason that I said that the honourable member's attack was virtually an attack on the administration of the Public Service Commissioner. The honourable member speaks of the proportionate increases as compared with the year 1909-10. But I remind the Committee that a large amount of additional work has been placed upon the officers since that time. In 1910 - the note issue came into operation, and there was also an extension on account of old-age and invalid pensions.",41
372,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,My comparisons left out the note issue altogether.,41
373,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member 'tis in error there. There is a great deal correspondence attached to the note issue, in addition to the work actually done by the clerks in connection with the notes themselves. There are communications with banks regarding the return of notes, and various other matters connected with the issue, and there are communications with banks on questions of currency. Correspondence of this kind is very considerable. Then take the item for 1912-13 regarding bank exchange, £1,500,",41
374,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Accordin g to the Treasurer's statement, if we want to get at the cost of the note issue, we have not only to take the items actually set down for the note issue, but also to fish out other It is his items connected with it.",41
375,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member, I am sure, does not desire that every clerk who incidentally writes a letter in connection with currency business, or the note issue, or bank exchange, shall have his services to that extent debited to the note issue, or whatever the subject may be. Honourable members do not want work of that kind done.",41
376,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I agree with that.,41
377,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Tak e the item in connection with bank exchange. It is a new item. To some extent it relates to the larger purchases of material in London. We had a very good officer indeed in charge of this work. In my opinion his services were worth his salary over and over again. The Public Service Commissioner desired to transfer him to another Department. I was very loth indeed to lose his services; but the Public Service Commissioner said he was required elsewhere, and was entitled to get his promotion. I am not at all sure that the Commonwealth is benefited by his transfer; but the Public Service CommisI t was sioner was responsible, and the transfer was made.",41
378,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I see that what the Treasurer has said vitiates the comparison about contingencies.,41
379,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Now , does the honourable member wonder that I laughed when he was speaking on that matter?",41
380,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There has been an attempt to fasten down on to some particular item; but the honourable member has not been able to prove his case in this instance. We have now been able, for the first time in the existence of the Commonwealth, not only to manage bank exchanges to our advantage, but we have also been able to of employ to the last penny our money in London at short-dated interest. An enormous amount of clerical work is entailed here as well as oversea, and the work is undertaken because it is profitable. The honourable member for Flinders will see now that the whole matter is cleared up.",41
381,Mr SAMPSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But there was £1,471 spent in bank exchanges last year.",42
382,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member need not help the honourable member for Flinders, who knows exactly what is in his mind, and has submitted the strongest point so far as the increases are concerned.",42
383,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should like to say that I omitted to notice that in the earlier years there were no bank exchanges.,42
384,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As to the general increases, I point out that the Treasury has to deal with the accounts of all Departments, and these accounts have naturally increased in number. There is a point beyond which an officer cannot go; he may be able to deal with 1,000 accounts in a working day, but if there happen to be 1,005 accounts, another man has to be obtained to take a share of the work, so that it may be done efficiently. It is here that the Public Service Commissioner comes in, and he considers, on the requisition of the of the Department, whether the assistance is or is not warranted. We know that an ordinary man, as years go on, and he becomes more experienced, deals more rapidly with his work and makes fewer blunders, and hence the increased expenditure on the same number of men is justified as an advantage. From my experience of life I would rather have few men who can do the work of a! great many men than a great many men to do the work of few * men, although the same expenditure might be involved, because then there are fewer mistakes, and the work is better done.",42
385,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Are there the same number of men in the Accountant's Branch this year as there were 'last year?,42
386,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no evidence as to that, and, in its absence, I do not care to commit myself to a statement. I am informed by MT. Collins, Assistant Secretary to the Treasury, that there has been addition by two junior clerks.",42
387,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There have been no increases except those provided for by the law of the land.,42
388,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The position in regard to the Correspondence Branch is exactly the same, but two additional junior clerks have been appointed in the Accountant's Branrh. Before Parliament rises I shall furnish a detailed account of the developments in these offices for the inspection of honourable members.",42
389,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not one of the increases is what we may call a Government increase.,42
390,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Government cannot make increases. As to the matter of responsibility, I can only say for myself, and I think I may speak for my colleagues, that if I thought it necessary to come into conflict with the Commissioner, either as to an increase or a reduction, I should do so, and then let Parliament know the facts.",42
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This all means that we ought to have a Committee of Accounts.,42
392,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is shifting ground. An attack has been made by the honourable member for Flinders, and has not been sustained; and that honourable member is quite capable of making such an attack without assistance. The honourable member for Parramatta is less frank than is the honourable member for Flinders. Immediately the honourable member for Flinder5 saw that some item had escaped his eye, he admitted the fact head at once, and that is the way to get on. I have no desire to be responsible for financial statements or financial proposals that cannot bear the keenest scrutiny, and I hope that Parliament will never depart from the course of exercising its full right of criticism. Although I am not in a position to give all the details at the present moment, I think that there are now the minimum number of officers with whom the work of the Treasury can be carried on, in view of the new services.",42
393,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wentworth) [4.7] - ! suggest to the Prime Minister that the note issue, as currency, ought to be under the control of the Commonwealth Bank, and that it would be advisable, I think, to have a report from the Governor of the Bank on the point. If this suggestion were acted upon the size of the issue would be governed solely by the public demand for paper money, as it was before, except that an the Commonwealth would, very properly, through its proper officials, govern the issue. My objection to the Government note issue is solely due to the fact that, under the present system, there is a great temptation to any Minister to issue more notes than is necessary, in order to finance various Government enterprises. Every sovereign raised by the issue is a liability which will have to be met sooner or later, and most probably at a time when the country is the least able to meet it. If , on the other hand, my suggestion were adopted, the Bank would, for its own protection, as well as for the protection of the Commonwealth-for the Bank is not interested in what I might call party finance-draw in its horns on approaching financial trouble, and so automatically regulate the issue of paper currency. At any rate, it would be worthwhile the Treasurer asking his highest financial expert to express his opinion on the matter. I have no knowledge of what the Governor's views are, but I am satisfied that if the matter is referred to him, he cannot fail to advise the Treasurer more or less on the lines of my suggestion. We must remember that most of any country's financial difficulties the party system. A party in power, with a tenure of three years, will try to carry - out public works, and finance them in such a way as to increase their popularity in the country, and lead to their return for another period of office. The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, on the other hand, is responsible solely for the solvency of his institution, and the security of credit generally, with which it is intimately bound up. The result will be that if we put this matter him, we shall still have Commonwealth notes, but they will be paper currency, and will not be the means primarily of raising money from the public of Australia for the pressing necessities of a particular party. I do urge this upon the Prime Minister.",42
394,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member has discussed it before. It will not be done this session.,43
395,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is no reason why the right honourable gentleman should not ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank for a report on this question. I think that it would be very educative to honourable members, and could not fail to assist them. That is all that I am asking for now.",43
396,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is not a question of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank at all.,43
397,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is a question of high finance, and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, I take it, is the best financier we have in the service qf the Commonwealth. In fact, I think that he is the - only first rank financier in the service of the Commonwealth at present. We have excellent officials, but they have not been in close touch with general finance in the same way as he has been. I am only asking that his opinion should be ascertained. Surely the Government are not going to shut down on expert opinion in dealing with this question? Surely they are not afraid of the verdict of their highest officer? If they are, of course the public will understand the refusal of my very simple and modest request. I do hope to get a simple, affirmative answer from the Prime Minister before I resume my seat.",43
398,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I will reply when you sit down.,43
399,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If I sit down now, I shall have no further opportunity to speak on this matter-; for I spoke for a minute last night when the Estimates were introduced contrary to the wish of the right are because of honourable gentleman.",43
400,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have been frequently interjecting, and accused of doing so.",43
401,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the Prime Minister ask this officer for a report? Air. FISHER - The honourable member says it is a question of currency. That has nothing to do with banking directly.,43
402,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Bankin g is vitally interested in currency. It is the basis of exchange, and a bank's prime operations are dealings with exchange. If you interunder fere with currency, you interfere with bills. If you disturb currency, you disturb bill currency, and cheque currengy, which is the biggest currency in the financial world today. Exchange is the biggest function of any bank,. State or private, at the present time. The big profits of a bank are not made, when all is said and done, by advancing money, and. receiving interest.",43
403,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Bill s are not national currency.,43
404,Mr KELLY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; but they are popular currency. The currency of the world today lies in bills and cheques, and the basis of the credit of these bills and cheques is the ordinary medium of exchange.",43
405,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are not interfered with. Mr KEL'LY - In the time of crisis, the only currency that has an intrinsic value throughout the world is gold. It is, consequently, obviously a matter of vital importance to the Commonwealth Bank that it should be able to be sure of the solvency and the security of a big paper issue of money in the Commonwealth. Not with a view of embarrassing the proceedings at present, but simply to enable the Prime Minister to reply, and give me an.opporgeoning the Estimates through. tunity, if necessary, to speak for a minute, I move That the items, "" Australian Notes £4,226,""be reduced by £1.",43
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [4.15] - I support the proposed reduction. I have always thought that the moment the Commonwealth Bank was set up Governor should have control of the note issue. He will have at his disposal imnight ? mense resources, monetary, metallic, and otherwise. He would be in a better posihonorable tion to gauge the demand of Australia in question? regard to the note issue.",44
