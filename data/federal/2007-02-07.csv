2,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Family Law Act 1975 to validate retrospectively the imposition of an unauthorised filing fee for divorce matters in Western Australia. In July 2005, the filing fee in the Federal Magistrates Court for divorce applications under the Family Law Act was increased from $288 to $334. The fee in the Federal Magistrates Court for divorce applications applies to all divorce applications throughout Australia, except Western Australia. In 1976, under section 41 of the Family Law Act, Western Australia established the only state family court in Australia-the Family Court of Western Australia. The filing fee for a divorce order in the Family Court of Western Australia is set by regulations made under the Family Law Act. Subregulation 11(1A) of the Family Law Regulations 1984 prescribes the filing fee for a divorce order in the Family Court of Western Australia, whereas the equivalent fee in the Federal Magistrates Court is set by the Federal Magistrates Regulations 2000. To ensure consistency in the treatment of applicants across Australia, the filing fee for a divorce order in the Family Court of Western Australia matches the equivalent Federal Magistrates Court fee. However, due to an oversight, when the filing fee for a divorce application in the Federal Magistrates Court was increased in July 2005, a corresponding amendment to subregulation 11(1A) of the Family Law Regulations to increase the fee in the Family Court of Western Australia was not made. The Family Court of Western Australia assumed the necessary amendment to the Family Law Regulations had been made and mistakenly began to charge the increased fee. It raised the fee from $334 to $352 on 1 July 2006 when the Federal Magistrates Court fee was subject to a routine biennial increase. Steps were taken to rectify the oversight as soon as it was realised. As of 9 October 2006, subregulation 11(1A) was amended to bring the divorce fee in Western Australia into line with the rest of Australia. It has always been the government's intention to have a divorce fee which is consistent throughout Australia, and this was in fact the case from 1 July 2006 until 9 October 2006. During that period, the Family Court of Western Australia charged applicants the correct fees but did so without legal authority. The purpose of the present bill is to validate the fees which were charged during that period. This is a straightforward, technical amendment to correct an honest mistake, and one which will ensure equality of treatment for all Australians who paid this fee during the period in question. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (UNEARNED CREDIT LIABILITY) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Ian Macfarlane. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Australian automotive industry is recognised worldwide for its innovation, its quality standards and its expertise in design and engineering. The government provides significant support to the industry through the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, ACIS. ACIS is a transitional assistance scheme which encourages the industry to become internationally competitive through investing in its own future at a time of phased tariff reductions. Through these arrangements, the government has provided the automotive industry with another decade of certainty, building on the five years of certainty it received under the first ACIS plan. The participants in ACIS number about 250 and they include the four motor vehicle producers, automotive component producers, automotive toolmakers and automotive service providers. ACIS delivers assistance to participants through the issuing of duty credits and it will provide over tance during the period from 2006 to 2015. This is an unprecedented assistance program of over $7 billion delivered to the industry in a well set out tariff reduction program which only occurs every five years, as distinct from the program of the Labor Party, who had an ad hoc method every year. Assistance is provided up-front-that is, duty credits are issued on receipt of quarterly claims by a registered ACIS participant. A subsequent audit process ensures that claims are legitimate and that they relate to eligible expenditure. If items of ineligible expenditure or other errors are identified, an unearned credit liability (UCL) is issued to the participant and this is offset against their future ACIS credits. A recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has important implications for the Commonwealth's ability to issue UCLs under the ACIS act, other than in very limited circumstances. That decision has raised the prospect that claims of participants may have to be fully assessed as to their eligibility prior to any credits being issued. It would be unacceptable from a financial management perspective for the Commonwealth to be issuing credits unless it is certain that it has the ability to recoup any credits issued to which a participant is subsequently found not to be entitled. The up-front assessment of all claims would result in lengthy delays in the issuing of duty credits-delays which could impose significant financial hardship on members of the automotive industry. The industry has long accepted that the approach of issuing credits up-front then issuing UCLs should ineligible expenditure be identified is the best way for them to receive credits in a timely manner and the Commonwealth is keen to ensure that approach $4 billion in assiscan continue. This bill will confirm the Commonwealth's ability to issue UCLs. It will ensure that the industry can continue to receive credits as soon as practicable after they submit their quarterly returns and it will ensure that the ACIS scheme can continue to be administered in the manner agreed by all parties when it was first established. In summary, the amendments I am introducing today are designed solely to restore to the Commonwealth the power to administer the ACIS scheme in a manner that best meets the needs of the Australian automotive industry. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. HUMAN SERVICES (ENHANCED SERVICE DELIVERY) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Brough. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
4,Mr BROUGH,ACIS ADMINISTRATION,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (9.10 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I have great pleasure in introducing the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill 2007. As its name makes clear, this bill is about providing a better, simpler and more secure way of delivering health and social services and payments to the Australian people. The Australian government provides over $100 billion worth of taxpayers' money each year in health and social service payments. Australian taxpayers have a right to expect that their money is spent in a way that ensures that only those individuals who are entitled to benefits receive them-and that the individuals who receive them receive that money on time and in the correct manner. The bill that I am introducing today will provide Australians with an upgraded Medicare card. This card will replace up to 16 other cards and vouchers and will make dealing with the government easier, faster and far less complex. This bill is the first part of the legislative package to establish the framework to support the upgraded Medicare card-or access card. It will put some certainty around some of the issues that are of most interest to the community. Later legislation will deal with the review and appeal processes for administrative decisions, further elements of information protection and legislative issues relating to the use of the card, including in relation to dependants. In particular, this bill incorporates many of the recommendations that were made by the Access Card Consumer and Privacy Taskforce, led by Professor Allan Fels AO. The government has, and will continue to adopt, a highly consultative approach in developing and implementing the access card and associated legislation. To date: - the independent Consumer and Privacy Taskforce has undertaken over 160 consultations and has received more than 100 submissions; - the access card website has received over 500 email comments from members of the public in all walks of life; - an access card information hotline has received over 1,800 calls; and - there have been ongoing briefings to stakeholder groups and the media. As part of the commitment to involve the public in this process, the government released an exposure draft of the bill for public comment on 13 December 2006. More than 120 submissions were received from nongovernment organisations and individuals, as well as from state, territory and federal government departments and agencies in response to the exposure draft. Every one of these submissions has been considered. Appropriate suggestions from the submissions have now been included in the bill that I present today. Many of the comments received on the exposure draft related to matters that are proposed for subsequent legislation. Consultations are continuing on a range of these issues, such as the use of the card in dealing with dependants. The Consumer and Privacy Taskforce has been asked to continue its consultations and provide advice on a range of these issues, including in relation to appeal mechanisms. This bill introduces a transformational change to the delivery of Commonwealth benefits. It proposes an evolution in Australia's health and social services system. The changes proposed in this bill will take this system from the technology stone age to a modern, simpler and more secure way of delivering health and social services. The scaremongers will say that the access card is an ID card. It is not a national identity card. And it is not the Australia Card that the Australian Labor Party introduced in 1986. Under the Australia Card Bill, you could not conduct your normal affairs without having to produce your card. You could not open a bank account, buy a house or get a job without producing your Australia Card. You could not withdraw money from your savings account, send money overseas or buy shares without producing your Australia Card. Labor's Australia Card was a true national identity card and was rightly rejected by the Australian people. The access card established by this bill has none of these features and has limited uses which are clearly described by the bill. The card: - will not be a national identity card; - will not be compulsory for every Australian; - will not be an electronic health record; - will not record your financial details; - will not be required to be carried at all times; - will not be required to transact normal everyday business; - will not be required to be shown to anyone other than for the provision of health and social services benefits provided by the Australian Government and to confirm concession status. What is being proposed in this bill keeps Australia aligned with developments in the rest of the world, where service delivery, using smartcard technology, is being used to improve the convenient, secure and efficient delivery of services to citizens and, importantly, to reduce fraud. Over the next 10 years this government will be distributing almost $1 trillion in health and social services benefits. That significant sum of money provides enormous risks. To put it simply, Australian taxpayers can be ‘ripped off'. KPMG has estimated that the government will save three thousand million dollars over the next 10 years by introducing the upgraded chip based Medicare card. Leading edge smartcard technology will be used in the access card. The current technology, including cardboard cards and simple plastic cards, is outdated and has proven highly vulnerable to improper copying in a way which exposes the system to fraud. Better and more advanced technologies are now available that can replace and improve the 23-year-old technology that our Medicare cards are built on. Medicare cards were introduced almost a quarter of a century ago. Back then, cars did not have safety and security features like airbags or engine-locking systems. We upgrade our cars to make full use of modern security systems to protect ourselves and our families. We should now be doing the same with our Medicare cards. The Medicare card is cheap and easy to fraudulently copy. Recently the Australian Federal Police estimated that Medicare cards are involved in some way in more than 50 per cent of identity fraud cases. In a recent speech to a counterterrorism summit, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty, estimated that identity fraud costs Australians anywhere between $1 billion and $4 billion annually To give just a few quick examples: - A doctor in Queensland used 21 stolen identities involving Medicare cards to obtain 19,650 narcotic medicines worth over $2 million. - In a recent case, a Centrelink customer had meticulously created false identities for 18 non-existent children. The customer had used fraudulent birth verification forms and forged letters to falsely claim benefits for nine sets of twins, worth $623,000 in taxpayer funds. In each of these cases a false identity created. With the new access card, the registration process for the card will require people to provide robust proof of their identity through substantially improved procedures. Unlike the current arrangements, the new system will detect people trying to register under two identities. We will be able to catch fraudsters before it costs Australian taxpayers large, and often unrecoverable, amounts of money. While this bill may be opposed by some on the other side of politics-the ‘friends of fraud', some would say-it will respond to the concerns of hard working Australians who are sick of people cheating the system and getting away with it. Apart from the clear benefits the card will provide in combating fraud, it will also play a significant role in streamlining the current cumbersome and time-consuming system for delivering health and social services benefits. - It is estimated that around 580,000 people each year make a trip into a Centrelink office and join a queue-only to find they must go home to find the right documents and start again every time they want to apply for a new type of benefit. There are multiple registration points with some people having to provide the same information to different agencies and often having to provide the same proof of identity information to the same agency if they want a different service. - Each year some 50,000 letters are sent to individuals who have incorrectly filled out their name and/or address on their Medicare claim form. The new access card will mean that consumers will only need to register once for a service and only notify participating agencies was once of changes in circumstances, such as a change of address. The services include those now provided by or through the departments of veterans' affairs and human services, including the Child Support Agency, CRS Australia, Medicare Australia, Centrelink, Australian Hearing Services and Health Services Australia. The measures in this bill will reduce the time spent filling out forms and waiting in queues and will provide customers with greater options to access their benefits. The new card may well represent the most significant reduction in red tape for individuals that Australians have ever witnessed. One of the many benefits of the new access card is that it will be able to be used for emergency payments in situations such as those that occurred in March last year in Innisfail after Cyclone Larry left the town isolated and without electricity. Centrelink officers were required to work innovatively with banks and their customers to ensure that people had ready access to money to buy food and other essential items. The new access card will make it easier to assist people in such emergencies and it will enable them to use their new card to access government assistance immediately. Some opponents of the access card have argued that the register that will be established under this bill will be a centralised megadatabase. The register will not be amalgamated with the databases of existing participating agencies. It will be established separately from participating agency databases and will not contain medical or health information. It will not contain transactional records. Detailed customer records will continue to be held separately by Centrelink, Medicare Australia, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the other participating agencies. As to the card itself, it will only have ited information on display-less than all state and territory drivers licences currently show. The bill provides that the only mandatory information on the card will be a photo of the card owner, the owner's name, his or her digitised signature and the card's expiry date and number. A future government will not be able to require any further details to be added to the surface of the card without full debate in this parliament and an amendment to the legislation. This is probably the first time that a card issued by the government will be owned by the cardholder. This gives greater choice to individuals about how they use the card other than for health and social services purposes. The card belongs to the card owner and he or she can use the card for whatever lawful purpose he or she chooses. The bill sets out a number of offences to protect the card and card owners. There has been some concern expressed about the possibility that businesses would be able to demand the production of the card as a form of identity. This bill creates new offences with significant penalties to ensure that this does not occur. The bill makes it an offence, punishable by a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment or a $55,000 fine or both, for any person and up to $275,000 for a company that requires a card owner to produce their card for any purpose except for the provision of Commonwealth health and social services benefits or to verify concessional status. Similarly, it will be an offence, punishable by a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment or $13,200 or both, for a person to make a copy of or divulge a card owner's photograph, signature or card number unless it is for the limited purposes of the act or with the owner's consent. That amounts to limup to $66,000 dollars for a company that commits this offence. The measures in this bill will substantially reduce the opportunity to set up false identities; reduce fraudulent claims for benefits from Centrelink; reduce claims for Medicare and pharmaceutical concessions and the safety net based on inaccurate concession information; and prevent a person using someone else's card to claim an entitlement. This is significant and necessary legislation that will ensure future generations will be able to have access to a generous health and social services system. The only people who will be opposed to the measures in this bill will be the vocal minority who take a blinkered view of the world and who will oppose any reasonable measure to stop people ripping off the system. These people do not represent the silent majority of Australians who expect their government to act on their behalf to ensure that their taxes only go to help those who truly need assistance. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (SIMPLIFICATION) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Dutton. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",21
5,Mr DUTTON,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.24 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is a related bill to the Tax Laws Amendment (Simplified Superannuation) Bill. The purpose of the bill is to make consequential legislative amendments to implement the government's simplified superannuation reforms. The reforms will sweep away the current raft of complex tax arrangements that apply to superannuation, improve incentives to save, increase retirement incomes and strengthen incentives for older Australians to stay in the workforce. At the centre of the reforms is making superannuation benefits tax free, if paid from a taxed superannuation fund, to someone aged 60 and over. The superannuation taxation law has also been rewritten from the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 as part of the reforms. The rewrite will streamline the law and provide a clearer picture of the taxation of superannuation savings. It will cut the number of superannuation related pages in the assessment acts by over a third. This bill repeals the old superannuation taxation law, including reasonable benefit limits, and updates cross-references to superannuation taxation law contained in other acts. Updating cross-references to superannuation taxation law contained in other acts will clarify policy intent in a number of areas going forward. This includes how superannuation will be treated in the event of bankruptcy, for child support purposes and social security purposes. Amendments in this bill will also improve arrangements with respect to lost and unclaimed superannuation. The Australian government will now take full responsibility for the management of unclaimed superannuation, which means that, in the future, unclaimed superannuation money will not be paid to the states or territories. This is consistent with the arrangements for lost superannuation and will provide a single access point for individuals searching for lost or unclaimed superannuation and a simpler national claims process going forward. As a result, individuals will be able to seek advice directly from the ATO, instead of having to contact numerous government agencies. This bill also makes some minor additions to the simplified superannuation law to clarify policy intent and, in some cases, to address industry and community concerns raised. These amendments include clarification of transitional arrangements for employers and individuals with substituted accounting periods and relaxed arrangements for people contributing amounts related to personal injury or small business capital gains tax concessions up until 30 June 2007. As a package, the simplified superannuation bills represent a substantial investment by the government in the standard of living of Australians in retirement and the country's future economic prosperity.

NA (EMPLOYER SANCTIONS) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 February, on motion by Mr Robb: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Burke moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that: (1) the Government has failed for more than six years to introduce sanctions for employers who employ unlawful non-citizens and individuals with work restrictions, despite a 1999 Government commissioned inquiry recommending it do so; (2) the bill fails to address the need for higher penalties for employers who are repeat offenders under the legislation; and (3) the legislation's bar on employer culpability may be too low, the reference to ‘the person knows that, or is reckless as to whether, the worker is an unlawful non-citizen' is sufficiently reserved that it may prove difficult to successfully bring sanctions against an employer”.",27
10,Mr ANDREWS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"In summing up this debate, I thank the members who have contributed to the second reading discussion on the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Bill 2006. This bill addresses the government's longheld concerns about those who seek to work illegally in Australia. Illegal work causes a number of problems for the Australian community. It takes job opportunities away from Australian citizens and from lawful migrants. The cost of protecting illegal workers is an unwelcome burden on the Australian taxpayer. Very importantly, some illegal work is linked to organised crime, particularly within the sex industry. The trafficking of people, particularly women and children, is a despicable crime. The government is determined to deal with anyone who knowingly participates in this kind of criminal activity, including employers who seek to exploit the victims of trafficking. Despite the continued success of our immigration compliance activities, the government believes that additional statutory reforms are required. Experience has shown that there must be some method of imposing sanctions on the small number-and it is a small number-of employers and labour suppliers who deliberately engage or refer illegal workers. The bill introduces fault based criminal offences. Proposed offences will only be committed where the employer or labour supplier knew the person was an illegal worker or was reckless as to that fact. This ensures that the focus is on the employers and labour suppliers who are of concern to the government, without imposing any additional burden on businesses generally. This bill also introduces higher penalties for offences where aggravating circumstances are present. These circumstances arise where the illegal worker is being exploited through forced labour, slavery or sexual servitude. A number of members have suggested that not enough is being done to prevent 457 visa holders from being exploited. The offences in this bill will help, in fact, to reinforce existing sanction arrangements. For example, where an employer moves a 457 visa holder into a low-skilled or semiskilled position, the offence in clause 245AC of allowing a noncitizen to work in breach of their visa conditions may be committed. I also recently announced the government's intention to introduce a sanction regime for employers who breach their sponsorship undertakings for subclass 457 and related visas. In summary, this bill addresses some very serious issues in Australia. However, it strikes the right balance by ensuring that only those employers and labour suppliers who are of genuine concern to the Australian people will be caught by these offences. I commend the bill to the House.",27

TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2006 MEASURES No. 7) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 December 2006, on motion by Mr Dutton: That this bill be now read a second time.",28
13,Mr BOWEN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The Labor Party will support the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006. However, the opposition does have significant concerns in relation to schedule 2 of the bill, and I will shortly deal with how the opposition intends to address those concerns. Schedule 1 of the bill deals with an expansion of the small business exemptions for capital gains tax. These largely arise out of the Board of Taxation review of 2005 and are supported by the opposition. These recommended changes show the value of the Board of Taxation reviews and that they are a worthwhile process. Item 39 of the bill proposes to replace the current controlling individual test, or 50 per cent test, with a new significant individual test, or 20 per cent, test. That is to say that an individual will no longer need to own 50 per cent of the enterprise to gain the capital gains tax concession but will now only need to own 20 per cent of that enterprise. The 20 per cent participation percentage does not need to consist entirely of direct holdings but can also include indirect holdings. These changes will increase the availability of the exemption and the small business concessions. The new significant individual test will enable up to eight taxpayers to access the small business capital gains concession. More people with a substantial interest in small business will be able to gain this concession, which is good for small business. The bill also proposes changes to the maximum net asset value test to determine the eligibility for the small business concessions. This test is satisfied if the sum of the net value of all capital gains tax assets of the taxpayer, any entity connected with the taxpayer, any small business affiliate of the taxpayer or any entities connected with the person's small business CGT affiliates does not exceed $5 million. The proposed amendments to the net asset value test mean that more liabilities can be included in calculating whether a business breaches the threshold. I note that the government flagged in the last budget that they would be increasing this threshold from $5 million to $6 million, but they have not yet legislated to do this. I acknowledge that the government indicated that they would be introducing this change effective from 1 July this year, so there is certainly time to introduce this legislation. But I simply make the point that it would have been better, for simplicity's sake, to include the increase in the threshold in the legislation currently before the House. The failure to do so increases the confusion faced by small business operators in relation to these changes. This confusion was ably highlighted by  on 30 December last year. The article leads: Recent federal government changes to help small businesses sell their businesses in a tax-effective way is leaving many accountants scratching their heads about how to interpret the reforms. Mr Switzer, of course, was referring primarily to the changes in the 50 per cent test which I referred to earlier, on which businesses and accountants have been tested as to whether they should implement the law as it stands or the law which the government has indicated it intends to change. I call on the Assistant Treasurer to reduce any further confusion by introducing legislation to the House to change the threshold as soon as possible. There are other changes included in this bill which make it easier to gain the small business tax concession. The definition of an active asset is clarified, and restrictions on the ownership of an asset for which a 15year exemption is claimed are eased. Other changes will make it easier to roll over assets and make more asset rollovers eligible for the concession. This bill also introduces rules to deal with a deceased estate in relation to a small business where currently no rules exist. A legal personal representative of the beneficiary will now be allowed to access the same concessions that would have been available to the deceased. This is a suite of options which improve the availability of the small business capital gains tax exemption, and Labor supports all of them. It would be a stretch to say that this is a simplification, because it is not. But it does clarify certain matters, which is welcome. Of course, small business is deserving of the support of the parliament, and the treatment of small businesses when they are sold, either to be rolled over or for retirement purposes, is an integral part of that support. The Labor Party has no hesitation in supporting these changes. My colleague the shadow minister for small business will be adding to these remarks later in the debate. I now turn to schedule 2 of the bill, which is altogether a less happy enterprise. The schedule 2 amendments proposed change the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to supposedly clarify the types of financial instruments which are eligible to be exempt from withholding tax. The exemption exists to reduce the cost of Australian companies obtaining capital. The proposed amendments would modify sections 128F and 128FA of the act to restrict the range of debt interests eligible for this withholding tax exemption by specifying more closely the debenture or debt interests that are eligible by adding two conditions. Under the new conditions, to qualify for the exemption the interest must be on a non-debenture debt interest that is also a non-equity share or the non-debenture debt interest has been prescribed by regulation. The ALP is concerned that this change is more than a clarification. These changes can be construed in a way which is substantive and substantial. I am also concerned that these changes will have a real impact on the benefit to and the availability of businesses raising finance for major projects including infrastructure projects. As a nation facing an infrastructure crisis or, at the very least, nificant infrastructure bottlenecks, that is the last thing that we need. These changes go a long way to reversing the reforms that this government introduced in 2005. The New International Tax Arrangements (Managed Funds and Other Measures) Act 2005 broadened the range of financial instruments available for withholding tax exemption by including debt interest. Previously, only debentures were included. The then Assistant Treasurer said in a speech in the House: These changes will allow Australian businesses generally to take advantage of global opportunities to lower their cost of debt and to cilitate efficient business structures. We now see the government substantially walking away from those reforms. The current Assistant Treasurer should come into the House when he sums up debate on this matter and explain why he believes his predecessor got it wrong. He certainly did not do so in his second reading debate speech. He needs to do so when he sums up the debate. I am also concerned about the lack of consultation that has gone into this measure. The Assistant Treasurer knows, or he should know, that there is considerable anger in the industry and in the financial services sector about the lack of consultation which has gone into framing of this schedule of the legislation. The Assistant Treasurer should come into the House and withdraw this schedule for further consultation. In the absence of that happening, I foreshadow that the opposition will move to refer this bill to a Senate committee in the other place. The Senate committee will need to examine, in particular, the impediments that these changes might have on the financing of major projects, particularly infrastructure projects. The government has done nothing to improve the tax treatment of infrastructure sig- projects and is now proposing to potentially make this harder. This comes on top of the government's complete failure to do anything about section 51AD or division 16D of the tax act. The government has admitted that these sections are a potential impediment to infrastructure financing. The then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, issued a press release on 26 June 2003, which said: ... the Government is committed to reforming the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provisions (Section 51AD and the associated Division 16D), which have particular relevance to financing arrangements in the infrastructure industry ... The quote continues: faThese provisions are in need of urgent reform ... So the Assistant Treasurer of the day-not this Assistant Treasurer, not the Assistant Treasurer before him, but the one before that-said that the government would be moving urgently to reform this provision of the tax act. That was 2003. Since then, there has been nothing. Since then, no legislation has been introduced to the House and there have been no more press releases from the government. There has been nothing but stone cold silence-a gross negligenceleaving the infrastructure industry in this country hanging on a thread, with all they can rely on being a press release. This government has taken legislation by press release to a new level. But, of course, a press release does nothing to improve the taxation treatment of infrastructure in this country. Last year, this government introduced seven tax bills into this House-this is the seventh-and not one of them dealt with section 51AD or division 16D of the tax act. The government has done nothing about this important area of taxation reform, so the infrastructure industry has every right to be sceptical about the government's approach in this matter. The other thing the Senate committee needs to have a look at in relation to this schedule is the power of the Treasury to make regulations about which type of debt will be exempt from withholding tax. I am concerned that this has the potential to add even more complexity to the tax act. This has the potential to slow down major projects as proponents wait to see whether the type of debt they propose will be included in a regulation proposed by the Treasury. Of concern is not only the amount of time it will inevitably take Treasury to prepare the regulations but also the amount of time that the regulations will lie on the table of the House being able to be disallowed by the House-again, increasing the uncertainty and delays for financiers and proponents of major projects. We say that, if you get the policy settings right, you do not need to give Treasury the power to make regulations. If this parliament gets it right, there is no need to give Treasury power to bring in regulations, in the national interest, to fix up mistakes which occur in this bill. But I fear that the parliament will not be getting it right if this schedule is passed in its current form and if this government does not allow this schedule to be referred to a committee in the other place to allow the Senate to conduct consultations that this government should have conducted-to allow the Senate to do this government's job. The explanatory memorandum makes no reference to any particular urgency in relation to this schedule. It does say that there is potential for people or bodies to take undue advantage of this provision, but it does not say that this is happening at the moment. In any event, this schedule, even if it is passed by the House today and by the other house tomorrow, will not come into place until 1 July, so I am not interested in unduly delaying the other positive elements of this bill; there will be no delay to those. However, if a government sits on its hands for four years and does nothing about tax reform in relation to infrastructure, I think it is perfectly reasonable for members on this side of the House to say that we want this schedule referred to a committee in the other place. The government could have avoided this measure if it had consulted more widely and better with the finance services industry and the infrastructure industry earlier in the process. If the government refuses this referral, it will be held to account for the results; it will be held to account for the potential impact on the infrastructure industry in this nation. Labor stand ready to support genuine integrity measures, providing they have been properly aired in the community, providing there has been proper consultation and providing we on this side of the House can be reassured that there are no or minimal unintended consequences. That is not the case in relation to schedule 2 of this bill, and we will be moving in the other place to have it referred to a Senate committee for further investigation. We will, of course, be endeavouring to ensure that that investigation pens quickly so that the other measures in the bill are not unduly delayed and that there is certainty in the industry. I will now move on to the other schedules. Schedule 3 proposes amendments to remove the requirement for certain deductible gift recipients-DGRs-to maintain a gift fund. It also aims to standardise and improve integrity measures for these DGRs. Further, schedule 3 proposes changes to the provisions in the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to enhance the DGR integrity arrangements. The proposed changes will give the Commissioner of Taxation the power to request information from both endorsed and listed DGRs, thus aligning the integrity arrangements applicable to both types of organisation. Currently, of course, the commissioner can only require this type of information from one of those types of organisations. These are sensible changes which meet with the support of the opposition. They both reduce the compliance burden on these charitable organisations and improve integrity. As I said before, this side of the House stands ready to support genuine measures to improve the integrity of the tax system, on which there have been proper consultations and which have no unintended consequences. Schedule 4 proposes amendments to extend the periods during which deductions will be permitted to certain DGRs. These include the Dunn Lewis Youth Development Foundation, the Rotary Leadership Victoria Australian Embassy for Timor-Leste Fund, the St George's Cathedral Restoration Fund and the St Michael's Church Restoration Fund. Labor supports these measures and wishes these bodies well. Schedule 5 proposes amendments to insert a statutory cap of 6  \HDUV IRU WUDFWRUV DQG harvesters used in the primary production hap- sector. The commissioner is currently reviewing the effective life of the primary production sector implements and, therefore, may increase the current safe harbour effective life of tractors and harvesters, which would be disadvantageous to taxpayers claiming the decline in the value of these goods over the current 6  \HDUV 7D[SD\HUV who choose to have the effective life of these assets determined by the commissioner will be limited to an effective life of 6 \HDUV I note that this measure is not consistent with the Ralph recommendations, which this government accepted, and it undoes some of the reforms recommended by the Ralph review. The government has done this before and will no doubt do it again, increasing the complexity of the tax system. However, we do not oppose this measure; on the contrary, we support it. Farmers deserve all the support they can get in this difficult time. However, it needs to be noted that this measure is contrary to the recommendations of the Ralph review and, if the government goes on making changes to the effective life regime in this ad hoc way, it will be undermining the integrity of the Ralph reforms. We recognise that there are circumstances for case-by-case reviews, as in this case, where we support the reforms. But we are also keen to ensure in future that the Ralph reforms are respected and that their integrity is not undermined by an ad hoc approach taken by this government. The bill proposes to make changes to the Farm Management Deposits scheme to increase farmers' eligibility for this scheme. The bill proposes to increase the threshold of non-primary-production income from $50,000 to $65,000 and to increase the deposit limit from $300,000 to $400,000. The FMD scheme allows primary producers to, in effect, shift income from good years to bad years in order to deal with adverse economic events and seasonal fluctuations. The scheme allows primary producers to claim a deduction for farm management deposits made in the year of deposit. When the farm management deposit is withdrawn, the amount of deduction previously allowed is included in both their PAYG instalment income and their assessable income in the repayment year. Labor supports this proposal to allow more primary producers to become eligible for the FMD scheme and to assist in times of drought. I note that the income threshold and the deposit limit have not been increased since 1999; this is a timely measure. The final schedule in this bill relates to capital protected borrowings scheme. These changes would prevent a taxpayer from claiming a deduction for the part of the expense of a capital protected borrowing that is attributed to capital protection. Capital protected borrowings are a reasonably popular measure in which people borrow money to buy shares or other financial instruments, and they have the right to sell them back to the lender at no less than the price they paid for them. It is a transfer of risk from the borrower to the lender. Of course, the lender charges a premium to compensate them for taking this risk. The ATO has previously taken the view that this premium should not be tax deductible and that interest payable on capital protected borrowings used to purchase shares is not allowable to the extent that it exceeds the amount of the benchmark interest rate set out on the ATO websitethat is, the premium charged for risk transfer is not deductible. Labor supports this approach. However, this view was successfully challenged in the case of Commissioner of Taxation v Firth in 2002. The government announced that it would make changes to override the Firth case in April 2003. The interim methodology was announced by the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in May 2003. It is the same old story. I find it extraordinary that the government announced this legislative change in 2003 and yet we are in 2007 when it is finally introduced. We again have the situation that these changes were not announced by this Assistant Treasurer, were certainly not announced by the member for Longman, but were announced by Senator Coonan four years ago and yet it is now, in 2007, that we are finally debating them. It is true to say that the government did flag these changes in 2003 and warned people that the government would be legislating the retrospectively. Again, people are entitled to ask: do they comply with the law of the land as it is laid down by the courts or with a government press release? For the government to wait four years before bringing this legislation into the House is gross incompetence. This government has taken legislation by press release to a new level. Labor will be supporting this measure; though it comes four years too late, it nevertheless deserves our support. The amendments at last provide some certainty to tax payers in relation to the capital protected borrowing scheme. All in all, most of the measures in this bill are sensible. As I have said, we will be seeking in the other house to refer this bill to a committee to more closely examine schedule 2. If the government chooses to block this referral in an arrogant manner, we will not be standing in the way of the significant benefits to small businesses which are contained in this bill, and we will support it. But it is the government that will be held to account for the adverse impacts of schedule 2 should these eventuate. It is the government that will be held to account for its lack of consultation. It is this minister who will be held to account for ramming it through the other house, if that is what he chooses to do, and for failing to adopt Labor's approach of more consultation with the industry to ensure that infrastructure financing can continue in this nation to reduce the infrastructure bottlenecks we see across the country. It is the government that will be held to account for that. I hope the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer accepts Labor's proposal to refer this bill to a Senate committee for some brief consultations. If he does not, the government will be held to account for that arrogance.",28
14,Mr CADMAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006. I wish to make a few general remarks before commencing my examination of the details of the legislation. This is another bill which reforms taxation. The government has consistently decided that taxation has needed dramatic reform. In the 10 years of this government there have been reforms and changes beneficial to taxpayers in the areas of personal income tax, business tax and superannuation, in particular. This demonstrates that good management and a growing economy can provide benefits for the whole community. More jobs for Australians means there are more taxpayers. This reduces costs to the taxpayer because the government does not have to borrow but can store funds for rainy days. Less debt means there is less interest be paid and the prospect of reduced taxation. So, by the process of good management and a growing economy, the government has been able to introduce significant changes advantageous to all Australians. Most of the changes have been in two areas: reform and changes to existing taxation. The reform has been the introduction of a long overdue broad based consumer tax. This was first raised by the Prime Minister over 20 years ago as being a necessary reform for Australia. It was endorsed in 1984 by the then Treasurer Paul Keating, who said that he wanted a broad based consumer tax. He was never able to get it, of course. Instead, the budget of 1985 introduced a tax on superannuation and a tax on capital gains. We are dealing with capital gains taxes today. It has taken 20 years to undo some of the disastrous decisions of the Hawke government. Both the former Treasurer Mr Keating and Mr Howard agreed that the reforms introduced by this government were long overdue, yet for political purposes disastrous decisions had been made by the Hawke government. Imposing a broad based consumer tax was a difficult decision for the current government, coming to an election, but the Australian people had a say on the issue, and they decided that they would back the good management of the government and the promise of benefits in the future from the reforms. Those benefits generally have been delivered. There has been lower personal taxation, massive changes to personal tax scales, greater benefits for families and support for families with children, better consideration for business and changes to superannuation, which mitigate the damaging and disastrous impacts of the introduction of a tax on superannuation in 1984 and 1985. The Labor Party had made ‘rock-solid' promises that both of the changes that occurred in 1984 and 1985 to would never occur. I remind the Australian community that ‘rock-solid' promises in taxation areas requiring careful management are seldom observed by the ALP-one only has to look at its disastrous management of New South Wales. After reform, the next objective of the incoming government in 1996 was to change those tax features which were most objectionable. Gradually those changes have taken place. The ALP had imposed damage and had indulged in thoughtless adventurism. Unemployment and sky-high interest rates, preventing people from becoming homebuyers; bankruptcies; and closures were the legacy of those days. Those decisions took 10 years to take effect, and it has to unscramble them. The changes made by this government were absolutely necessary. Today we are debating further change to a complex and difficult tax imposed by the Australian Labor Party back in those timescapital gains tax. A minor advice on capital gains tax, due to the complexity of the tax and its imposition on individuals and businesses, will cost a minimum of $6,000. No accountant will risk giving advice on capital gains tax without very careful consideration and consultation with specialists. Today's bill deals with capital gains tax and other issues such as the small business capital gains tax concession, the exemptions from interest withholding tax and integrity arrangements for deductible gift recipients. It deals with the deductible gift recipient status of certain organisations, with depreciation rules applicable to the life of tractors and harvesters, with non-primary-production income thresholds, with the total deposit limit for farm management deposits, and with the capital protected borrowing rules. Those seven different measures are diverse. I would like to deal, in particular, with the capital gains tax. The area of capital gains tax was referred to the Australian Board of Taxation. The very introduction of a board of taxation was an innovation of this government. The value of such an organisation, with the capacity to examine the details of tax, must on this issue alone be justified. Having taken evidence, the board stated that division 152 provides concessions but also restrictions. The board made a decision that there should be a change. It concluded that the finetuning of a small number of provisions relating to the application of the eligibility criteria needed to improve the current outcomes of the legislation. It also decided that there a need for minor legislative changes to address unintended consequences and for administrative changes to assist in the undertaken 10 years standing of the law. The board considered that the tax environment in which small business operates could be improved, providing ‘incentives to small business generally to invest their capital to maximise employment, investment returns and innovation'. A comment in the Canberra Sunday Times on 19 November said: One of the most complex pieces of legislation pertains to the CGT small business concessions that apply when a business is sold. Originally enacted in 1999, that legislation has attracted criticism for its complicated matrix of rules that require a very clear head to decipher. This was nonsense because the Government wanted small business to be eligible to the concessions. The CGT small business concessions cause a capital gain made on a sale of a business to be tax-free. But because of the many tests that must be satisfied, many small business proprietors tripped at the last hurdle and failed to enjoy the concession. One would have to speculate whether it was the consideration of the tax office that there should be any real concessions to the capital gains tax, but the legislation went through. It was an effort to assist small business. The complexity, as I have said, has been massive and now there has been a rectification of that process as instigated by the Board of Taxation and its review. To give the Treasurer full credit, immediately he had that report he announced in the following budget-last year's budget-that the government would be proceeding to make changes. The government has adopted all but one, I believe, of the recommendations of the Board of Taxation. Today we are was considering those changes to tax. The amendments will improve the operation of was the small business capital gains tax concessions by making changes to the maximum net asset value test, the 15-year exemption, the retirement exemption, the small business rollover, and how the concessions apply to partnerships and deceased estates. The amendments will also replace the controlling individual 50 per cent test with the significant individual 20 per cent test that can be satisfied either directly or indirectly one or more interposed entities. These changes will apply to the current taxation year, 2006-07, and in years to come. One amendment that is transitional, however, ensures that the small business rollover operates as intended for the capital gains tax events that happened in the 1998-99 to 200506 income years, which is also a welcome change. Total cost to revenue is approximately $100 million per year over the next five years. The compliance costs are expected to be minimal. On examining the bill it is interesting to observe in the explanatory memorandum useful advice that laypeople can browse. They can come to a conclusion about the applicability of these concessions to their own small businesses. I refer to explanatory memorandum pages 15 to 19, which give a series of examples about how these changes may apply to the ownership of discretionary trusts and companies, firms and operating companies. It is a very easily understood process. I want to congratulate the tax office on the way in which these are presented, because not everything in taxation can be simply explained. Complexity seems to be the order of the day on some occasions but not in this instance. It is a very useful and helpful addition to the understanding of the bill. A comparison is also contained in the explanatory memorandum. It is a comparison of the key features of the new law and the current law. Some of the changes come under the headings of the controlling or signifiincome-producing cant individual test; the maximum net asset value test; the active asset test; additional requirements for shares or trusts-that is an innovation which I think is a good one; the 15-year exemption; retirement exemptions, which take into account the 55-year current provision and modify that in a sensible manner; the small business rollover; and the dethrough ceased estates applicability. All of those are great improvements to the way in which this legislation can be understood. In particular, the maximum net asset value test is interesting in that, for the first time, it takes into account negative net asset values. Where a property or capital had lost value, under the old rules that negative value-the loss of asset or capital-was never taken into account. So it was completely unfair because everything was considered to be a positive gain or no gain. In this instance, if there has been a loss that is taken into account. The maximum net asset value test takes into account the assets and related liabilities. And some of those liabilities will include things like annual leave, long service leave, unearned income and tax liabilities, which always should have been considered as part of calculating what the capital value of an asset is, but are included here now only for the first time. The new law in regard to a partnership applies to the individual partners and not to the partnership of the whole. That is another change that is welcomed by those people who operate in partnerships, as many small businesses do. Often a part of a dwelling is used as an office or a participating part of a business. Under the old legislation which is being replaced, the value test included the entire value of a dwelling, and that dwelling had to be totally used for income-generating purposes; whereas under this change only that portion of a dwelling that was used for purposes need be considered. So if there is a home office or something like that, and there has been a capital appreciation, it is only that proportion which is used for the calculation of the capital gains tax and not the whole dwelling. That is a much needed change. With the active assets test, the asset does not need to be active just before the CGT event. That means that, again, for an assetit may be a business-it need not be applied at the time of the sale or the realisation of asset but can have occurred at some time in the past. The 15-year exemption required a controlling individual of a company or trust for the entire period of ownership. Things fluctuate and people can have controlling interests for part or some of the time as their circumstances change. The current proposal requires a significant individual of a company or trust only for any period or periods totalling 15 years during the period of ownership. I think the deceased estate changes and the rest of it are extremely good. It just shows that, if governments are prepared to be sensible and make changes, big improvements can be made. This government has been reforming and improving taxation, again, in all the areas that we see today. I only hope that some of the challenges confronting my own state can be dealt with in the same way. There is negative economic growth, unemployment is worse there than in the rest of Australia, people are leaving the state for other states, there is greater competition coming from other states and there is the highest level of state and local government taxation in Australia. Taxation reform is a significant area where changes can produce an economic impact that is beneficial to all. There has been a massive growth in the payroll tax and land tax, and the business perceptions in New South Wales are that the state is underperforming. There is a lesson to be learned from the legislation that is before us today on capital gains tax. If sensible management and economic growth can be established then you can give concessions that will encourage further investment, jobs and opportunities for people. I would like to see my state adopt that process. The state of Queensland, on the other hand, seems to be going in another direction. It was, I would have to contend, established by Joh Bjelke-Petersen. My colthe league across the room, the member for Rankin, may not consider that right, but I have to say that Joh laid the foundations. Mr Beattie has been able to continue in some areas-not all areas; there are some dangerous areas in health and places like that where he is not going so well. The water infrastructure could do with a bit of attention also. My own state needs to have a really good look at some of the issues that have been dealt with by us federally where we have unscrambled those terrible decisions of the mid-eighties on superannuation and capital gains tax and made other changes to the tax system because we have been able to develop the means to do so. That has come through reform and change, and that is the only way New South Wales is going to go ahead-by reform and change.",34
15,Dr EMERSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Rankin) (10.18 am)Another day, another taxation laws amendment bill. This legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006, makes a series of changes to the Income Tax Act, and we on this side of the parliament support most of those changes. We do have some questions that we would like to see resolved in relation to the exemptions from interest withholding tax. The rationale for what the government is seeking to do seems reasonable-that is, to ensure that there are clear definitions of what constitutes a debenture. In the world of modern financial instruments there is some ambiguity about that. But in clarifying that we would be very concerned if the consequence was that the cost of obtaining overseas finance, for example, for infrastructure investment in Australia were greatly increased. For those reasons, Labor would like to see this matter go to a committee so that everyone can have a say in relation to what is a complex area. I will say, as a general position, that if policy is reasonably clarifying an area of potential revenue leakage or averting massive revenue leakage then it would seem to have some merit. But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating here, and if on the other hand it has deleterious effects on the cost of raising finance then that certainly will need to be taken into account. That is why we argue for a committee or an inquiry that would allow relevant interests to have a say. As the newly appointed shadow minister for the service economy, small business and independent contractors, I have great pleasure in commenting on the small business capital gains tax concessions. Labor supports those concessions. We take the view that small business is at the heart of entrepreneurship in Australia and that small business people and independent contractors make a conscious decision to go out on their own, take a chance, apply some hard work and ingenuity, and create prosperity for their families and for Australia at large. We pay tribute to the small business people of this country-interestingly, a group of people who were described after the Second World War by Prime Minister Menzies as ‘the forgotten people'. They obviously were remembered at that time, but I would have to say that, after 10½ long years of the Howard government, in many respects they have been once again forgotten. Nevertheless, Labor does support the arrangements for the clarification and extension of capital gains tax concessions for small business. The overriding problem for small business, though, is captured in a survey that was released by MYOB just this month. It tells us a lot about how small businesses see the challenges that confront them, and how they perceive both the Commonwealth and state governments. I think it would be worth me reporting to the parliament on some of the the findings of that survey. For example, nearly half of small businesses are dissatisfied with the federal government's contribution and performance. The precise number is that 44 per cent regard the government's performance either as very poor or as somewhat poor. Looking at some of the industries that make up that total of 44 per cent, in the case of transport and storage 59 per cent consider that the government's performance is very poor or somewhat poor, and in wholesale trade 53 per cent consider it poor or very poor. Mr Truss-What about the states' performance?",37
16,Dr EMERSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"We cannot just continue with the blame game, Minister. Mr Truss-But be honest. What did the survey say? Tell us what they think of the states.",38
17,Dr EMERSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Minister, I actually said, if you were listening at that time-it helps to listen all the way through my speeches rather than intermittently-if you keep signing your documents I will go to the state contribution",38
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Order! The honourable member will refer his remarks through the chair, and the minister will not encourage him.",38
19,Dr EMERSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"because I did in fact say that I would go through the results of the survey for the states, and I will do that. And right on cue, in relation to the performance perceptions of state governments, again, in this case more than half are dissatisfied with state government performance. That is why, in part, Kevin Rudd, as newly elected Labor leader, has put federal-state issues and the rationalisation of programs and processes high on the agenda and appointed the member for Fraser as shadow minister with responsibility for that task. I look forward to working with the member for Fraser and the Labor leader Kevin Rudd on ensuring that we do everything possible, when elected to government, to rationalise the red tape and other business regulatory requirements on all businesses, but especially on small business. So that is my response to the minister. If he had waited another 30 seconds he would have had his answer. As to the issues that are of specific concern to small business, right there at the top is interest rates. Thirty-six per cent nominated that as a very negative or a negative influence on their businesses. It would be very difficult to ascribe the problem of rising interest rates to the states, although I am the Prime Minister would be keen to pass that particular buck to the states. But this Prime Minister did say in the 2004 election campaign that a re-elected coalition government would keep interest rates at record low levels. He has done nothing of the sort. There have been four interest rate rises since that commitment was given, and now Australia has amongst the highest interest rates in the OECD. This is affecting small businesses, with 36 per cent nominating interest rates as a major concern. They are the sorts of problems that confront small business, but at the same time as the release of this general survey the MYOB organisation also released a special focus report on the red-tape compliance burden. That makes for equally interesting reading, because in that survey, in ranking the red tape issues that are a burden on small business, of those different issues that are ranked in the top three, the first two of those-by a long way-relate to the GST. The first is the BAS reporting requirements and the second is allocating GST to daily transactions. So overwhelmingly small business is saying its biggest headache, the greatest burden that confronts it, is the GST. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have designated that the GST is an orphan tax; it is a state tax. When something is really unpopular in small business circles, and in fact anywhere else, they blame the states. But I was in this parliament, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you were and as was the minister at the table, when a very long and heated debate occurred about the GST. It was a Commonwealth tax then and it is a Commonwealth tax now. The Auditor General has designated it as a Commonwealth tax; the Australian Bureau of Statistics has designated the GST as a Commonwealth tax. Small business knows the GST is a Commonwealth tax, and the GST remains a big headache for small business, as consure firmed in this survey on the red-tape burden confronting small business released just this month. The report goes on to tell us something very enlightening about the attitude of small business to the Commonwealth in relation to red tape. The question is about whether the government is doing enough to reduce the red-tape burden, and an overwhelming 73 per cent of respondents said no, that the government is not doing enough to ease the red tape burden. In the area of accommodation, cafes and restaurants, a staggering 91 per cent of respondents said the government is not doing enough to ease the red-tape burden. Indeed, around three-quarters of small businesses do not believe anyone actually cares about the red-tape burden. That brings me to the point that, although this government talks about easing the red tape burden, it does precious little. Back in 1996, the government made a commitment that it would seek to reduce red tape by 50 per cent. It in fact got Charlie Bell, from MCDonald's, on board to do a review and then basically buried the report. It was only last year that the Productivity Commission produced a report with a very large number of recommendations about reducing business compliance costs and the regulatory burden, in response to the government finally accepting that it had not done enough-as evidenced in the report by MYOB released just this month. Small business does not believe that the government has done enough. I acknowledge that the government then committed to implementing a majority of the recommendations of the so-called Banks review; however, when you look through many of those commitments of the government, they constitute yet again another review. The problem is that the government is regulating faster than it is reviewing. While it reviews regulations, it brings in more regulations. Its compliance with its own regulatory impact statement processes in the last financial year was the worse since that process was established in the late 1990s. The situation that I am describing is this: the Howard government talks the talk of deregulation, calls upon the Productivity Commission to do a major review of business regulation and says it will implement a majority of those recommendations, but in many cases what it is actually committing to is a review-and, at the same time as it is reviewing, it is ducing new regulation. The impact of this enormous burden of regulation comes in two areas. One is the compliance costs. Compliance costs are big enough for larger businesses in Australia but, as a proportion of sales and certainly as a proportion of profits, compliance costs for small businesses are very high indeed. The government seems insensitive to the difficulties confronting small business in managing the red-tape burden and, most particularlyas expressed in this survey-the burden imposed by the GST and the BAS reporting requirements. The compliance costs are very high proportionately for small business compared with big business. The second impact of this regulatory burden is to stifle the very entrepreneurshipthat great spirit of having a go out on your own-that Australia relies on. We need our small businesses and our large businesses to get out there, have a go, take some risks, apply a few new ideas and innovate. That is what a market system is all about. But, if there are regulations left, right and centre, that basically sends a signal to business that if it makes a decision that turns out not to have been a good decision but at the time was a risky decision made in good faithwhich is necessary in a market economythen those businesses can legitimately be concerned that the regulators will come after them to see if the decision that was made in the commercial interests of a company was made in compliance with all these regulations. Here we have the Liberal-National Party government stifling entrepreneurship. It is stifling that spirit which is so valuable in Australia and has been displayed for decades by the people who were found by Bob Menzies so many years ago but who have been lost again by the Howard government. They are the forgotten people yet again. All of this reminds us that it is incredibly introimportant for small business to survive for this country to remain internationally and nationally competitive. But that is not what is happening. The skills crisis in this country has been emerging since the late 1990s. Labor spokespersons, including the member for Batman back in 1999, warned of it, yet the government have not done anything effective to resolve that skills crisis. The government should have known that problem was emerging, but they had clay feet when it did emerge and it is now causing inflationary pressures and difficulties for small business as they try to find trained and skilled staff. That is part of a bigger picture, and that bigger picture is an overall decline in Australia's competitiveness, as reflected in declining productivity growth. Ordinarily when we talk about declining productivity growth we refer to a small positive number, but, in the six months following the introduction of the Work Choices legislation, productivity growth has not been a disappointingly small positive number-it has been a negative number. In fact, in the three months to September productivity growth was minus 1.5 per cent. That should be sending alarm bells right through the community and certainly through the government. But the Treasurer, upon the release of revised figures on productivity growth, chortled in the parliament and said that productivity growth was now at or marginally ahead of that of the last cycle. He was referring to the last productivity cycle, which owed a lot to the reform program implemented by the previous Labor government, where productivity growth boomed. The Treasurer believes that current productivity growth is at or marginally ahead of the record productivity growth figures of the late 1990s through to the early 2000s. And yet it is minus 1.5 per cent in a single three-month period-not in a year, but in a single three-month period. He seems to think that that is satisfactory. It is not satisfactory; it is disastrous for this country's future. That is why the Reserve Bank has had to warn that Australians are going to need to get used to a GDP growth figure with a two in front of it; whereas we have been getting used to a figure with a four in front of it and sometimes even a five in front of it. But that is the warning of the Reserve Bank. The Business Council of Australia is onto this. Today it released a budget submission for the upcoming budget. I will refer to a couple of the statements in this submission, because they are alarming. It says: Australia continues to run a significant current account deficit; exports outside of resources are performing poorly; infrastructure bottlenecks are limiting activity; we are failing to manage key resources such as water; and significant pockets of entrenched community disadvantage remain. Add to these challenges the impact of an ageing population and slower productivity growth as the benefits of past reforms fade, and many conclude that slower growth in the future is inevitable for Australia. They are referring, among others, to the Reserve Bank. They go on to say: More worryingly, labour productivity growth has slowed sharply in Australia. The BCA know what is going on, but the Treasurer pretends that we are still in the heyday of booming productivity growth. The submission says: ... deterioration in productivity performance is a very real concern. So we do have huge economic challenges in this country. This is a reform-lazy government because we have a reform-lazy Treasurer. It is not only larger businesses and all those who are employed by larger businesses who will bear the consequences; small businesses in this country will bear the consequence of this government's policy sloth and reform laziness. That problem will only be dealt with by the election of a Rudd Labor government.",38
20,Mr HAYES,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I speak today in support of the measures contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006. I cannot speak in favour of all of those measures, particularly those in schedule 2, as I feel that further consideration really is required to examine the full impact of those changes. While I believe that schedule 2 does require additional thought-and I think that the new shadow Assistant Treasurer adequately outlined Labor's position in that regard-the provisions of the bill that I want to focus on, particularly in relation to the interests of people within my electorate of Werriwa, are those involving changes to the capital gains tax concessions for small business operators. Accordingly, I will make those the focus of my comments. The rapid rise of small business operators over the last decade has resulted in quite a phenomenal transformation of the Australian economy and Australian society. As I have noted before, there are not many times that you can look through the classifieds in the Sydney Morning Herald on the weekend and see vacancies for plumbers, carpenters, painters, builders et cetera who do not hold ABNs. Essentially, those positions in those trade groups are very much in a small business category. My son is included in that. One of my sons being a carpenter, I know full well how he has to access his work as a small business person operating in my electorate. Labor supports small business. While the Prime Minister and members opposite have gone to great lengths in this chamber trying to make out that Labor does not support small business and is its enemy, nothing could be further from the truth. That has never been the case and never will be the case. It is because Labor supports small business operators and because Labor supports real and genuine improvements to our system of taxation that Labor will support the amendments contained in schedule 1 of this bill. There can be no doubt, when it comes to interpreting the existing capital gains laws in relation to small business, that you really do need a clear head and a willing mind, as you need to steel yourself against a battle with what can only be described as the most complex tax law. According to the view of an accountant operating in my area whose clients include many small businesses, capital gains concessions provisions on the sale of a small business, for instance, are the tax law equivalent of the Enigma code-virtually indecipherable. While the code and the tax laws surrounding capital gains tax on the sale of a small business may have been unclear to all but the most expert in their fields, the impact of the law on small business operators is very real. As I mentioned earlier, over the last decade or so there has been a rapid and noticeable growth in the number of small business operators, particularly in the outer metropolitan areas, of which Werriwa is obviously one. Prior to these structural changes in the economy, these small business operators and independent contractors were largely employees. They knew their trades, they knew their jobs, and they worked hard. Their status, for various reasons, has changed, but their attitude to work has not. They continue to work hard to support their families. As their businesses grow, they quite possibly employ others. They do what most employees do-that is, build a retirement nest egg. Consequently, the impact of the capital gains tax levied on the sale of a business becomes extremely significant to these people, as often the proceeds of small business sales form a considerable part of the retirement savings of small business owners and operators. For this reason, among others, the changes before us today have a significant impact on the estimated 16,000 small business operators in the electorate of Werriwa and no doubt the many millions of small business operators throughout this country. Changes that break the Enigma code, the complexities of our current regime, are particularly welcome. I would like to briefly refer to the comments made by the new shadow minister for service economy, small business and independent contractors. I believe that what the member for Rankin said about the recently released MYOB assessment of red-tape compliance is accurate. Quite clearly, when I talk to people in my electorate, two of the biggest things on the minds of small business operators are the BAS reporting and the allocation of GST on a daily transaction basis. These are very much the burdens which have been foisted upon small business operators to comply with and which have made life very complex for them. It was only last week that one small business operator came to talk to me about issues of taxation in that regard. He has had some difficulty with the taxation office. He thought he was doing the right thing only to find that the way he was conducting his reporting was incorrect. Obviously I could not give him tax advice, but at least I could be sympathetic with this bloke. He certainly was making a genuine effort to comply, or he thought he was. This is a one-man operator in a small business looking after his family. He is taking significant time out simply to try to deal with the compliance issues now faced by that business. The changes in the bill to the capital gains tax concessions for eligible small businesses include changes to the maximum net value assets criteria, the 15-year exemption, the retirement exemption, the small business rollover provisions, the changes to the active assets tests and changes to the significant individual test that will no doubt increase availability of small business capital gains tax concessions. While the bill before us tains a number of good measures in relation to small business capital gains tax concessions, there is one notable exception. You will recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, that in last year's budget the Treasurer announced that the value of the maximum net value of assets test would be raised from $5 million to $6 million. This is an important change for many small business operators because of the significant impact it could have on what an owner ultimately keeps from the proceeds of the sale of a small business. When the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer delivered his second reading speech on 7 December last year, he was silent on the extension of this threshold. I note that he did mention once the change to the maximum net asset value test as part of a list of amendments that were contained in the bill, but at no time did he seek to explain why the provisions announced about the threshold extension had not been contained in this bill. I can only conclude that this notable absence from the bill may mean that the government intends to go back on the promise it made in the budget. Along with the many business operators who have made the decision to delay the sale of their businesses until the passage of this bill, I hope that that will not be the case. I hope the extension of that threshold will be promptly dealt with by the government. This government has often promised but seldom delivered when it comes to cutting red tape for small business. This is something that was recently asserted by the member for Rankin, our new shadow minister for small business. But this is not just a matter of political hype. You simply need to speak to any small business operator in each electorate to know that that is the case. That is very much their view, and the view comes from the the impositions they have seen foisted upon their businesses. This government went to con- the last election promising small business that it would do a number of things to cut red tape. Apart from giving the green light on industrial relations to unscrupulous employers to cut take-home pay and conditions, it has not done all that much to improve the lot of small business operators. This government has made many high-level promises but, when it comes to reducing red tape, its performance has been lacking. The Prime Minister has previously given a commitment to cut red tape by 50 per cent. He said that he would do it in his first term of office. I do not know the exact level of success in this endeavour but, if I can judge success through the prism of those who have to deal with the federal government's paperwork and regulation on a daily basis or through the experience of the many business operators that I speak to in my electorate, I would have to conclude quite frankly that it looks like this government has not applied itself to what must be regarded as a core promise. It presented itself tion, claiming that one of its key provisions was to motivate and develop small business by cutting red tape in the order of 50 per cent. That clearly has not occurred. It has been some time since the Treasurer announced that the government would introduce the Simpler Regulatory System Bill. In a press release on August 15 last year, the government announced its response to the Banks task force report on reducing regulatory burden on business. The Treasurer went to great lengths to outline the government's commitment to reducing regulatory burden on business. He said: The Australian Government is leading the way in reducing the burden of red tape to improve the economic environment further so that all businesses, large and small, can prosper and grow. It is disappointing that these big claims have yet to be backed by action. The Simpler Regulatory System Bill, which is to introduce the changes aimed at decreasing the regulatory burden on business, is yet to be introduced, though I note that it is set down for introduction sometime this session. But I have to say that the fact that it is not here now indicates the order of priority that this government gives to reducing the regulatory burden on businesses. Once again it seems that the government is willing to talk tough on cutting regulation and is willing to promise much but, sadly for business operators, particularly small business operators, who are willing to do everything they can to produce for our economy and are waiting for their compliance burden to be eased, this government has been, quite frankly, very tardy in delivering. In fact, based on the track record of this government, much like it has done with tax, this government continues down the path of increasing regulation rather than cutting it, which adds impediments for businesses, particularly at a federal elec- small business. While the small business capital gains tax concessions contained in this bill are welcome, there is no doubt that, when it comes to the complexity of Australia's taxation system, a lot more can be done. Angela MacRae-someone with whom I am sure that most members opposite would be familiar, as she was a member of the government's task force on reducing regulations on businesssaid last year at a seminar for Standards Australia: Our tax act is the second-worse in the world behind the USA. They were very strong words. That view was expressed by someone who is well versed in tax issues, given that she was the former tax director of CPA Australia. While many in the government continue to crow about the achievements of this government when it comes to tax reform, in truth it is much ado about nothing. This government continues to introduce taxesincluding the ‘never, ever' GST. The shadow minister for small business was quite correct when he said that that is a federal tax. There is no point trying to run the very tired argument that the GST is something other than a Commonwealth tax. It is a Commonwealth tax. This government has made itself the highest taxing government in Australian history. The GST has added to the burden of compliance and regulation that faces small business operators every day and has done nothing more than make every business operator-from the corner store through to Australia's largest companies-tax collectors. Labor knows how important it is to have a competitive business environment. Labor knows and understands how important it is to encourage efficiency in our business community and to make Australian businesses as competitive as they can possibly be both domestically and internationally. Labor also knows that a key part of creating a competitive business environment is creating an internationally competitive tax system. Going back to Angela MACRae's comments, sheas a former director of CPA Australiaindicated that we have the second worse tax system in the world, second only to that of the USA. So it could hardly be the case that we have an internationally competitive tax system at present. Ongoing business and personal tax reform is important in improving the barriers to investment, boosting workforce participation and rewarding effort. Unlike the government, Labor knows that it is important to build a tax system based on long-term goals rather than rushing in and introducing ad hoc changes to tax law. I welcome the provisions of this bill, particularly those that will improve ronment for small business operators. The Board of Taxation noted in its October 2005 report on the post-implementation review of the effectiveness of small business capital gains tax concessions that the tax environment for small business could be improved by providing ‘incentives to small business generally to invest their capital to maximise employment, investment returns and innovation'. I could not agree more. The fact that the government accepted all but one of the recommendations of the board's report was welcomed by small business operatorsparticularly the recommendation in relation to capital gains tax concessions. As I noted earlier, it will have the dual effect of increasing the availability of small business capital gains tax concessions and reducing the compliance burden on small business. It is disappointing, however, that the government has not seen fit to include in this bill the extension of the maximum net value asset test from a maximum of $5 million to $6 million as announced in the budget.

21,Mr ALBANESE,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"On behalf of the ALP and as the shadow minister for infrastructure, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006. I am particularly concerned with provisions in schedule 2 and the consequences that they might have on the financing of Australian infrastructure. Schedule 2 concerns clarifications of exemptions from interest withholding tax. The bill proposes amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and seeks to clarify what is considered to be a debenture debt interest, which is eligible to be exempt from interest withholding tax. Currently the law provides an exemption for interest paid by companies on debentures that meet a public offer test. The exemption exists to reduce the cost of Australian comthe tax envipanies obtaining capital. The proposed amendments would modify the act to restrict the range of debt interests eligible for this interest withholding-tax exemption. In addition, the amendments introduce regulation-making powers to Treasury to exclude interest on certain financial instruments that would otherwise lead to an outcome that is not supported by the overall policy intention. The regulations would also list every debt interest other than a debenture and a non-equity share debt interest that is eligible for the exemption. It is possible that misinterpretation of the law as it currently stands has the potential to threaten rity of the tax system by widening the range of debentures that could qualify for exemption beyond the policy intention. However, it is contestable whether the provision of regulation-making powers to Treasury will improve the integrity of the system. The stated aim of schedule 2 is to reduce uncertainty for taxpayers and tax administrators with the operation of sections of the In fact, the opposite outcome is more likely to occur for two important reasons: firstly, the policy grounds for excluding certain debt interest are far from clear. This will create uncertainty as to which financial instruments will be excluded from the exemption by the regulations in future, leaving taxpayers and financial practitioners in doubt. Secondly, regulation-making power to exclude eligibility for the exemption is impractical if sults in long lead times in having debt interests prescribed in the regulations as being either excluded or eligible for the exemption. From an infrastructure-financing point of view, rather than creating certainty, the amendments have the potential to create problems that could impede or inhibit the raising of debt finance. What does this mean in practical terms? Consider for a moment a company that wish to make an infrastructure investment in Australia. They have little or no certainty as to whether the type of debt they intend to use is covered by the exemption. This has the potential to slow down or prevent investment and major projects getting off the ground. While Treasury will have the power to change regulations to accommodate particular financing proposals, regulatory changes stand to further delay urgent infrastructure projects. The fact remains that regulation-making power is unnecessary if the policy setting is right. This government has done nothing to improve the tax treatment of infrastructure projects, and passage of this bill stands to make it harder to finance the integmajor infrastructure projects. I also want to address, on a related tax issue, the issue of section 51AD and division 16D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Last year the government introduced not one, not two, but seven tax bills into this parliament, of which this is the last. But not one of them sought to reform section 51AD and division 16D of the tax act-both of act. which need urgent attention to address underinvestment in infrastructure. Currently, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 restrains private investment in public infrastructure through the operation of section 51AD. Under this provision, certain infrastructure projects held by the private sector, controlled by government and financed the through limited recourse debt do not receive tax deductions that would normally apply for it re- capital expenditure of this type. There is also the application of division 16D of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This applies in the case of finance leases with tax exempt bodies. The lease is treated as a loan and capital deductions are disallowed. This illogical situation was first downplayed and then conveniently ignored by the Howard government. In September 2005 the then Assistant Treasurer, Mal Brough, finally conceded that the tax changes originally proposed by the government were unworkable. The minister promised legislative reform. More than a year on from that 2005 announcement, the government is yet to act. The current tax regimes are bad for Australia's long-term economic prosperity. Unfortunately, we have become accustomed to a government that changes policy for its own interests rather than the national interest, preferring to boost regulatory powers rather than enshrine sound policy and principles in law-policy that would boost productivity and ensure that the prosperity we currently enjoy lasts well into the future. Just last week Treasury's own research stated that public infrastructure investment decreased from 2.5 per cent to 1.8 per cent of GDP between June 1987 and June 2006. In 2004, Australia ranked 20th out of 25 OECD countries in terms of investment in public infrastructure as a proportion of GDP. With this bill before the House, we now are faced with the absurd situation where the federal government is not only happy to abrogate its responsibility to invest in nationbuilding infrastructure but also failing to address the issue that it is increasingly difficult for the private sector to invest strategically. There is copious evidence illustrating the shortand long-term economic benefits of investment in infrastructure. The Committee for Economic Development of Australia points out that investment in infrastructure generates higher returns on investment than other areas. Treasury's own research cites studies indicating that a one per cent increase in public infrastructure causes a 0.66 per cent increase in GDP. By overcoming the backlog in five key areas-electricity, gas, rail, roads and water-GDP would increase by 0.8 per cent, business investment by 1.2 per cent, housing investment by 1.8 per cent, exports by 1.8 per cent and improved living standards by 0.4 per cent. This spells improved employment, productivity, social welfare and international competitiveness. The Business Council of Australia has estimated that Australia has a $90 billion shortfall in infrastructure. Now is the time for national leadership and investment in nationbuilding infrastructure. The economic prosperity afforded to Australia by the resources boom can be locked into tomorrow by investment in infrastructure today. However, faced with a choice between squandering the opportunities presented by the resources boom or investing in nation-building infrastructure that will sustain our prosperity, the Howard government, sadly, has opted for the former. Under this short-sighted, self-interested government, our national economic effort is limited by inadequate and insufficient infrastructure. The BCA, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Council for Infrastructure Development and Engineers Australia have all warned that infrastructure bottlenecks are constraining our exports and our economic growth. But, rather than show national leadership, the Howard government has been quick to shift blame to the states, pointing the finger at state and territory governments as it does in every area of its policy failure. You can be certain that, wherever there is a lack of national leadership from the national government, it will resort to blaming the states and territories. Let us be clear: the Howard government is happy to have its coffers filled with tax returns from resource rich states, but it will not invest these returns to upgrade critical infrastructure to sustain Australia's economic prosperity. The tax windfall for the federal government from the resources boom is not insignificant. In fact, ANZ Chief Economist, Saul Eslake, has estimated that, over the last four budgets alone, the federal budget has received an extra $263 billion in tax revenue above its original estimates because of parameter variations caused by the resources boom. Federal budget surpluses attest to the strength of Commonwealth revenue, but we all know that accumulating infrastructure assets can make better sense than just accumulating a surplus. The Howard government has sold more assets over the last 10 years than it has built. Having massive surpluses to the exclusion of long-term investment makes no economic sense and is bad policy. The economic and social advantages of prudent investment in major infrastructure are irrefutable. Infrastructure investment and national leadership is needed now. Available infrastructure capital must be put in touch with our nation's infrastructure priorities. Labor has a long standing commitment to providing national leadership for Australia's infrastructure needs. We argue that a coordinated approach involving all three tiers of government and working in partnership with the private sector and key shareholders is the way forward. Labor has committed to establishing ‘Infrastructure Australia', a Commonwealth statutory authority to coordinate the planning, regulation and development of infrastructure. It will report directly to the Council of Australian Governments and through COAG to state and Commonwealth infrastructure ministers. It will include representatives from the private and public sectors, academia and the relevant professions. Infrastructure Australia will be charged with analysing, monitoring and reporting on the delivery and operation of major infrastructure projects. A coordinated and objective approach to long-term planning of and investment in nationally significant infrastructure is essential. There is too much overlap and duplication between different tiers of government. There are too many regulatory bodies, with overlapping regulation. John Howard, the Prime Minister, observed more than 10 years ago: I've been struck by the need to improve the coordination of infrastructure policy at monwealth-State level. More than 10 years later, Australians are still waiting for this improvement. As a matter of urgency, Infrastructure Australia will conduct an audit of Australia's infrastructure to assess the adequacy, quality, capacity and condition of Australia's infrastructure assets and to identify the gaps. Put simply, it will be a list of what we have got and a list of what we need. This list will be used to develop a national infrastructure priority list. After more than 10 years in government, the Howard government has no official, up-to-date record or database on the state of the nation's economic infrastructure assets. If the government does not know what assets exist and where the priorities lie, how can it plan future investments or establish a sound policy framework? Labor has also committed to using the income stream from the Future Fund for infrastructure investment. On this side of the House we have a flexible approach to infrastructure financing, recognising that both capital and expertise may be efficiently sourced from the private sector, the public sector or a combination of both. Also, superannuation investment strategies point to the opportunities for private savings to be invested in low-risk infrastructure projects. That is why getting the right policies in place that provide potential investors with certainty and minimal complexity is so important. It is also why the tax environment created by bills such as the one we are debating today must be built on sound policy principles-sound policy principles that will ensure that, whether Labor draw on capital and expertise from the private or public sector or both, we will be driven by the community's interest, boosting productivity and locking in Australia's prosperity. Unlike the Howard government, the Labor Party will not be the Comboosting productivity by asking working Australians to work even longer hours with less pay and under even worse conditions. Investing in nation-building infrastructure, not wage and condition slashing, are the building blocks of the national economy. The opposition will move in the Senate that schedule 2 of the bill being debated here today be referred to a Senate committee for further consideration. It is critical that the Senate committee undertakes comprehensive consultation with relevant interest groupssomething that has been clearly lacking in the drafting of this bill-and that it ensures that the final bill that is passed through this parliament does not include amendments that impede the financing of major projects, including infrastructure projects. No company's ability to raise finances should be compromised by these tax laws. Australia simply cannot afford to lock out investment capital if we are going to have a prosperous future.",45
22,Mr HATTON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I am happy to follow the shadow minister, the member for Grayndler, in regard to the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006. The member for Grayndler has quite rightly pointed to the fundamental inadequacies over the past 10 years in this government's approach to national infrastructure. It has been almost entirely absent during that whole period of time. Throughout the first and second parliaments from 1996, I was the chair of our caucus regional committee. I travelled the length and breadth of the country and I spoke to local councils in depth about their fundamental problems in terms of infrastructure. Over that six-year period, the government simply did not address-except in the most partial way-any of their fundamental problems. Why they chose not to do so is very simple, and it is laid out in their first audit 1996. The government do not see themselves as an active interventionist government trying to fix our fundamental infrastructure problems. They do not see themselves as a participant in that. It is always someone else's problem, someone else's activism-all they have to do is audit or benchmark it. For more than 10 years, country Australia has been crying out for the kinds of funds that would boost its local infrastructure on a sustainable and sensible basis. The member for Grayndler is absolutely right: we need this kind of long-term investment to continue to bolster Australia, and that capacity should be there through not only direct investment in infrastructure but also support through our taxation system. What we find is that the government that came to power in 1996 have a mindset that their only job is to be like a mob of accountants from KPMG: just tick and cross things that are done and not done and whack the back of the hand of state governments or councils because they have not been undertaking their fundamental responsibilities. That mindset has linked in with the general mindset that has taken hold at state level-that, in order to get anywhere at all, you have to make cut after cut after cut in expenditure. We know the disciplines that had to be imposed on the states; they were imposed by the last Labor government. That actually changed the approach that many states took to their expenditure, and we did get some fundamental efficiencies out of that. But it has become effectively a mindset in which an ideological approach virtually drives it. Coming from New South Wales, I have seen the disasters that have been caused by public-private partnerships. Travelling Australia, I have seen the disasters that will have an impact over the decades to come because state and federal governments and local councils have walked away from their in fundamental responsibilities. It is not really bright not to maintain your infrastructure. It is not just about water infrastructure in the capital cities-something that has happened because of the impress of budgets at state level-but also about the manner in which this Commonwealth government has withdrawn support from the states and the notion that it is somebody else's problem to fix up this area or that the whole thing should be privatised and then the problems will go away. Our national infrastructure has been falling to bits or simply sold off into the care someone else to be broken up into whatever constituent elements they like, and this federal government has led the way in abrogating its responsibilities with regard to it. The next Labor government, in setting up Infrastructure Australia, will understand that you cannot have a piecemeal approach to this. You cannot have an approach where you walk away from fundamental responsibilities and desert the Australian people in terms of things that no-one else will do-not even at what people might take to be a reasonable profit; they would want big profits to do a number of these things. The simple fact of the matter in terms of public-private partnerships is that they are generally not a really good go. Why? Because governments can borrow at extremely good rates; there is not all that much premium. We have a AAA rating, and the economy has been running extraordinarily well. Why? Because a fundamental foundation was laid by the former member for Blaxland, my former boss Paul Keating, who had the courage to confront problems and deal with them. We faced cataclysmic change in 198586, and modern Australia is built on the foundations of the fundamental, bold and brave changes that Labor made. This mob have slid along on the top of them and taken the benefit of those fundamental changes, but they will not make the core ongoing changes that are needed. They will not invest in Australian infrastructure, and they will not encourage state governments to do the right thing and renew their water infrastructure properly-they will not even think about addressing the problem. But if you look at water you need to look not just at the irrigators down in the Murray-Darling; you need to look at water usage Australia wide in our capital cities and at the infrastructure in Sydney. It is not just road and rail; water infrastructure needs a dramatic amount of money of to be expended on it if we are to get the efficiencies we need in order to survive. I turn now to the more specific matters of this bill. It is an omnibus bill. Assistant treasurers always come in with a whole stack of things that need to be done. What is the motif of these? Most schedules of the bill reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, increase certainty for taxpayers-two things that we say would be reasonable to doincrease the availability of capital gains tax concessions for small business and increase the integrity of the tax laws. There is nothing there that you could gainsay, nothing where you could not say, ‘Those things are reasonable aims.' Let us look at some of the practicalities in terms of what is being done. In general, in particular with the first one, one of the areas I am interested in is what is being done in small business. Almost all the schedules involved here arise out of a 2005 review by the taxation board, and all but one, I think, of their recommendations have been taken up by the government. What they have suggested, particularly in the small business area, is to look at small businesses and their capital gains tax treatment, in particular in the first schedule, in a different way. Instead of looking at just a mum and dad business, where currently you have to prove a series of different things, one of the things you have to do in order to gain the concessions is to have a 50 per cent controlling interest. Normally this is a partnership of two; there are two people who have 50 per cent. That is the model in front of us in the current legislation. The only area where you can have less than that is if you have a controlling partner with 50 per cent. A spouse can simply have a one per cent interest in the entity and that spouse will be covered by it. These changes recommend a 20 per cent significant interest instead of a 50 per cent controlling interest. When you first look at that, you may think: why, if it is a small business where it is a straight-out partnership-that is clear and reasonable-are we down to just a 20 per cent participation made up of indirect and direct percentages? If you put the spouse aside, why are up to eight people going to be part of this? I think it is recognition that the nature of a lot of small businesses has changed. It is not just traditional partnerships; there are a number of entities, including in my electorate of Blaxland, where there is multiple ownership. Within the current law, they are not able to access any of those concessions whatsoever; it is reasonable that they should be able to do so. This is not only a clarification of the law but also a sensible set of steps. Small business is not the engine room of change in the economy, because, as my former boss was wont to say, although it is 60 per cent of the economy, it exists on the margin of that engine room. The economy's engine room will always be our major businesses, and the small and medium enterprises will come in after that; that is the core of the activity. But employment in Australia is largely within those small businesses. Running them effectively and properly under the aegis of the taxation law is something we can do efficiently. If we look at this generally, amendments are supportable; they finetune the application. These amendments do not raise the net asset threshold, though, from $5 million to $6 million. That is something that has been announced and will have to be done later. As the shadow Assistant Treasurer, the member for Prospect, pointed out, there was a bit of press release stuff in here. It was announced that in the 2007-08 income year there would be an increase in that threshold. That will have to be dealt with in some other way, but there is no fundamental problem with that. Likewise, the other tests-the 15-year test and the rest of them-have been adjusted. I want to broaden this debate a bit to look at the impact of this on small business. It is a very significant sector of our economy. It is extremely important and, despite the admonitions from the member for North Sydney over many years, it is one in which a number of people on this side have experienceeither themselves directly or, as with the member for Hunter, in their families. In my family, there is a history and a combination of people either managing or giving their labour to others primarily in a small business context. For 25 years, my mother ran the Bambi Day Nursery, a child-minding centre in Bankstown. She had worked for others previously and she has a wealth of experience. I have a fair amount of experience-I was unpaid labour when I would help out after school. I have a fairly good insight into not only the compliance problems but also other issues. As one of the very early settlers in the area, my grandfather on my father's side had a small business selling fruit and confectionary in Bankstown before 1920. He then changed to a very significant business supplying building materials-concrete, coal, ice runs, you name it-post World War II. the Throughout my family there is small business experience. Virtually all of my uncles are involved in small business. My uncle John is a carpet layer. My uncle Eris owns his own furniture shop in Armidale; it is a very significant business there. Mr Windsor-Hear, hear!",49
23,Mr HATTON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"It is a good place; the member for New England knows Eris well. Apart from being mad on rugby, joeys and all that stuff, he is a very substantial person in Armidale. The member for New England knows just how significant Eris is. My uncle Tom and most of my uncles are in their own businesses. It is very important to understand that Labor Party people do understand the pressures on people in small business. From my family experience, I certainly do. They let me know what pressures are on them or the impact of what the government is doing. It is also key that people in small business are marginal in the same sense as people who simply give their labour and work in factories, shops and so on. It is tough in small business, as it is tough on those who do not have resources other than to expend their labour. However significant these measures in themselves may be for small business, we should look at the general things they want to do. Reduce compliance costs? Fine. Increase certainty? Fine. Increase the availability of the concessions? Fine. Increase the integrity of the tax laws? Fine. As I said before, you can actually do a great deal more for small business in this country if you change the GST laws. If you want to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and reduce the compliance burden and significant oncosts for small business-if you want to make it easier for people to do their business and easier for them to report-you do not just look at the reporting mechanisms and say, ‘They have to report four times a year and we make things a bit easier for them by way of what they have to put in.' If you wanted to make things easier, you would actually grab the GST by the throatgiven that it exists in all its coalition a result of this Prime Minister breaking his word and giving us that GST-and make it a retail sales tax. You would make it a tax that was not a 1960s paper-driven behemoth. You would make it a tax that was a 21st century retail sales tax where the only point in the cycle where the tax would be imposed would be at the final retail point. You would not have the inanity of a 1960s British and European model where every scrap of paper from the very start of the process to that very end-generating mountains of paperwork and work for people involved in every level of the chain of activity in business-had to be there for audit and reporting. The current system is to cover the fact that you impose a tax at one level and pass it on to the next level. Having imposed it at the very first level, you can claim it back and get your inputs back. So there is a direct cost to business at every step of the GST chain. You say, ‘Business is fine, because although this tax has been imposed, they get their input cost back.' That is given that the business is big enough and that its turnover is great enough. The compliance costs of running this whole GST behemoth-the reporting and the paperwork that have to be done-are enormous. The big winners from the GST are Australia's accountants; they have done extremely well. Anyone in small business who wanted to do their own books-unless they are accountants themselves-has had to give that work to someone else, because the load on them is enormous. The load on small business, which is being reduced by these measures, will be infinitesimal compared with the load on them now and on the community at large as a result of having this really dumb GST-a 1960s version, before fundamental computerisation, before mainframes could contain all the information needed to run and audit a system on the basis glory as of real activity within an industry. Whatever the industry-be it statistics or education-as with everything else, there is a simple thing called a bell curve. In a bell curve you get 10 per cent of activity up the top, the next 20 per cent of activity below that, 40 per cent of activity in the middle, which is the dominant range of activity, a further 20 per cent of activity below that and 10 per cent of activity down the bottom. You get that pattern of distribution; it is very ple. You do not need a million pieces of paperwork shuffled backwards and forward. You do not need the imposition of a GST 10 or 20 times during the process. You do not need the nightmare administrative load. You can audit businesses by saying, ‘Let's look at the average activity, income and costs of a business. We can work that out, not just on an individual business basis but industry wide.' The Tax Office certainly has the capacity to do that. Once you do that, and you set those standards, the auditing process becomes simple. Anyone who wants to rort the GST system will stick out easily. If you want to closely monitor people who are doing that, you will see that they are outside the norms of a particular industry, region or areataking account of all the possible variables. What a dumb government we have to impose on the whole country, on every small business person, the enormous weight of an old and dumb GST, with all of its capacity to bury innovative activity. This has not been taken up as Labor policy, and I am probably the one person in the joint who really believes in the utility of this, but I will continue to argue for it. In 1985, Paul Keating put up ‘Option C', a central part of which, as recommended by Treasury, was a retail sales tax. Why? A retail sales tax was recommended because they did not think a full-blown GST could be brought in within a term. I have spoken to Ken Henry about this at length. I used to work with him. We have a dumb system in place. We could release Australian productivity if we dramatically changed our tax laws, got rid of the GST overburden and replaced it with a retail sales tax, which would be efficient, direct and effective. Small business and everybody else would benefit as a result.",51
24,Mr WINDSOR,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I listened to the comments of the presimvious speaker, the member for Blaxland, Mr Hatton, about the goods and services tax and I would be interested in having a discussion with him on the issue. The Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006 is, essentially, an omnibus bill. I will be supporting the legislation. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the capital gains tax concessions for small business. I would like to raise, under the auspices of the bill, the implications of current government policy on capital gains tax and income tax in relation to groundwater users in New South Wales. The Prime Minister has a 10-year, $10 billion water plan. Some issues were raised a few years ago regarding the process of adjusting to a sustainable level of groundwater use in six valleys across New South Wales. Those issues are pertinent to the ongoing debate about the over-allocation problems and the Murray-Darling. More importantly, they are pertinent to the credibility of the current government as to how those problems are to be addressed and how those who do have current water entitlements will be treated. Yesterday I raised this matter by way of having a historical look at the operations of the current government in the cooperative processes with the states regarding the National Water Initiative and other intergovernmental agreements and blueprints that have been in place. In that context, the New South Wales government and the federal agreement agreed to a compensation package. It was a three-way split-$50 million from the Commonwealth, $50 million from the states and $50 million in kind from the irrigators for the loss of their entitlements. At the time. I congratulated both governments because I thought, ‘Here we have the resolution of a difficult problem where no-one is really to blame.' Water had been allocated by a range of state governments over many years, over-allocation in the groundwater systems had been recognised and there had to be an adjustment process to bring it to a sustainable level. I will cite a number of documents in regard to that. Suffice to say that the irrigators-the water entitlement holders-agreed to this plan for sustainability. There are certain parallels between that and what the Prime Minister is saying now on other areas of water reform where there has to be an agreement between the entitlement holders and governments or jurisdictions to come to a sustainable level of environmental and other uses. As part of that process, and on agreement between the farmers, the irrigators, and the state and federal governments, this $155 million package-I think there was $5 million for other matters-was put together. It was applauded as a first in terms of the Commonwealth and the states working together. In fact, it was not a first; there had been dissimilar scheme for a pipeline in South Australia, I think, some years earlier. As part of that process irrigators were told that there would be a compensation package made available to them, and some months later an absolute shock was sent through the system: on receipt of those compensation moneysthe $50 million from the state and the $50 million from the Commonwealth-it would not be considered as loss of a capital asset. I am pleased to see the minister here, because he is very aware of this issue and very slow in rectifying it. Irrigators were told that, on receipt of the compensation, those moneys would not be considered as being for loss of capital assets, although everybody in this place, including the Prime Minister, agrees that it is the loss of capital assets. And the Premier of New South Wales, at the Prime Minister's water meeting last year, said that it was, in his mind, the loss of a capital asset, but the Commonwealth is still treating the payment of those moneys-the $100 million to groundwater irrigators across the six valleys-as income in the year of receipt. Obviously, individuals have different taxation arrangements, but theoretically it is possible for 47 per cent of that money to be clawed back by the Commonwealth. So the Commonwealth can actually make a donation in a compensation package and then take a considerable amount of it back in the year of receipt as income. Looking at the capital gains arrangements in this legislation, the government seems unable to deal with this issue and has been unable to explain to me-in the parliament on a range of questions-and, more importantly, the water entitlement holders why it cannot do anything with this particular issue. The Prime Minister has a 10-point plan and says, ‘We're going to go out there.' I agree a not with removing the state borders as impediments to water reform-I think most people would-but there is a severe lack of credibility in terms of the historical context of what the government has done when it has gone out to embrace water entitlement holders and the sustainability issues of groundwater and surface water systems and in the way it is treating those people who have to make the adjustment-the water entitlement holders. So there are great concerns out there, Minister, given its poor performance on this particular issue, about whether the government can be trusted in the takeover of water entitlements. There has been a blame game played in this place. I have raised it a number of times and you, as minister, have been in receipt of some of those issues and questions. Time and time again the Commonwealth says: ‘They are the states' problems; the states have caused the problems. If they had written the document a different way the tax office would have been able to consider it as capital rather than as income and that would have an impact on cash flows to those people in receipt of compensation arrangements.' And the states say, ‘No, they have been the Commonwealth's problems; they are in charge of the tax office, and they have the tax act et cetera.' So this continual blame game has gone on for nearly two years while these people out there were trying to make these adjustments and trying to do what the Prime Minister is now talking about on a broader basis and come to grips with sustainability. They have been doing it in a voluntary way and then, when the agreement was made, no-one told them that they could lose up to 47 per cent of it through the tax act as income in the year receipt. I approached the then parliamentary tary, Malcolm Turnbull, last year in about November and said, ‘Malcolm, we've really got a dilemma here.' I thought he was having a real go at trying to solve the problem. I said, ‘We have this continual blame shift and the victims are left out there wondering what is going to happen. If I organise a meeting with the Premier of New South Wales, will you attend and sit across a desk from this guy and let us find out who is to blame?' At the same time, and even previous to that, I had an FOI request in for the documents, to find out who was to blame-but that is a story in itself. I approached the then parliamentary secretary and asked him that question. He seemed almost petrified about the politics of doing that. I would have thought, particularly given his utterances over the last few days, that he is about bringing people together to solve some of the sustainability issues. So I was quite disappointed when he said that he would not meet with the Premier because he believed it was under control. We have not heard the control levers being pulled here. We have not seen this issue resolved with the tax office. I am delighted that the Assistant Treasurer is here because he might be able to make the announcement that there has been some active work done at a government level to solve this dilemma. In the absence of Malcolm Turnbull-I neglected to say a moment ago that the Premier agreed to that meeting between himself, Malcolm Turnbull and me as the broker of the meeting-I had that meeting, not with the Premier but with the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries, Ian Macdonald, only last week, and I received a couple of documents. I have an FOI request in with the New South Wales government now of for those documents and I am told they will be forthcoming. I am told that the intergovsecre- ernmental agreement-and the minister might like to comment on this-was driven by the Commonwealth Solicitor-General. I will be waiting eagerly to see who is to blame in relation to the writing of this document that has essentially classified it as income rather than as capital. I would like to take the opportunity to read into Hansard two things-one in relation to the freedom of information request. I made a request to the government, particularly in terms of the former federal minister John Anderson and his conversations, letters et cetera with former state minister Craig Knowles. I think they did a good job because the two of them actually sat down and tried to work out a process which would lead to sustainability and compensate those people who were going to be impacted by the change or allow them to adjust. There was no mention of being charged income tax. It was the loss of a capital asset that was in everybody's mind. I made a request for the various communications in my quest to find out who is to blame. If it is the state, let us flog them to death; if it is the Commonwealth, they deserve the same fate. The FOI request went in and, strange as it may seem, the morning before I met with New South Wales minister Ian Macdonald last week, I received a letter. Before dealing with that, I will read out essentially what my FOI request was: Correspondence (letters, faxes, emails, memos) between Federal Minister John Anderson and NSW State Minister Craig Knowles and their respective Departments with regard to the “Achieving Sustainable Groundwater Entitlements” ... Program jointly announced by the Prime Minister and then NSW Premier Bob Carr on June 9 2005. Further, I seek any correspondence about this matter between the Department and the Prime Minister's office and the Treasurer's office. Dates between 2001 and the present are requested. The decision that has come back to me reads: Section 24A – Requests may be refused if documents cannot be found or do not exist Section 24A of the FOI Act ... provides that: 24A Requests may be refused if documents cannot be found or do not exist An agency or Minister may refuse a request for access to a document if: (a) all reasonable steps have been taken to find the document; and (b) the agency or Minister is satisfied that the document: (i) is in the agency's or Minister's possession but cannot be found; Section 24A of the FOI act provides that a request for access to documents may be refused where those documents are in the department's possession but cannot be found. Before coming to the conclusion that the documents cannot be found, the department must take all reasonable steps to find the documents. The steps taken to locate the documents to which you are seeking access have been interrogations of all files on which the documents may have been located, including searches of electronic filing systems, searches of desks, filing cabinets, drawers, safes, cupboards, files by staff in the Western NSW Regional Office Regional Partnerships Branch and Strategic Projects Division, searches of backup tapes of electronic records by Ms Marie Cooper, Western NSW Regional Office and Mr Roger Fisher, Strategic Projects Division, searches of all archived documents from the Western NSW Regional Office and Strategic Projects Division and searches of the registry. Despite the searches undertaken, no documents could be found. The document actually says ‘no documents could not be found'-there might be more truth in the actual wording of it. It goes on: I am satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to locate the documents in question and that no documents can be located in the department at this time, and I am unable to provide you with any documents as per your request. Strangely enough, that afternoon I happened to meet with the state minister. Somewhat contradictory to what was being said in terms of the FOI request, he was able to give me a few documents in relation to this process, the discussions between the Hon. John Anderson and Craig Knowles. As I said, I have subsequently put in an FOI request for all the documents, including the intergovernmental agreement, because I think it has great significance in terms of what the Prime Minister is trying to do with the Murray-Darling. One of those letters is from the state minister, writing to the Treasurer. I seek leave to table the letters so I do not have to read them out. Leave granted.",53
25,Mr WINDSOR,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I thank the minister in the chair. The first letter is from Ian Macdonald, the state minister, written on 20 March 2006, nearly a year ago. I will quote it a little bit: The purpose of this letter is to seek your urgent reconsideration of the proposed taxation of the payments to be made under the programthat is the Achieving Sustainable Groundwater Entitlements ProgramTo eligible licence holders for a reduction in irrigation water assets. … … … I believe that it would be against the spirit original agreementthat was the agreement between Knowles and Andersonfor the Australian Government to retain up to $47 million, or almost 85% of its total support as a result of income tax, when the clear intention was for the program to be equally funded by both the NSW and Australian Governments. There is also a letter from the Hon. Peter Dutton MP written on 14 June. I will table this as well, if I can. Leave granted.",56
26,Mr WINDSOR,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The Hon. Peter Dutton responded on behalf of the Treasurer to this particular issue, where he raises the issue of a grant. There was no mention of it before. The letter reads: Under the income tax law, a grant received in relation to carrying on a business is assessable income. It goes on to say that these people are carrying on a business, and even though it was never mentioned on prior occasions that it would be taxed up to the rate of 47 per cent, the government, in his view-representing the Treasurer-believed that they should be taxed. A number of issues have been raised since then, and the parliamentary secretary Malcolm Turnbull, now Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, has been playing a role and there have been a number of people at a state level. I will be waiting with interest, because I think I will receive the documents within the next few days, to see how that intergovernmental agreement was actually put together and why these water entitlement holders have been subjected to this massacre of their capital asset and then a massacre of their income base or their their income-earning capacity. If the government is serious about the Murray-Darling, and really serious about putting in place policy of our rather than politics on coming to grips with this issue of over-allocation, it has the ideal way to display that here and now: recognise those who are going to give up their entitlement and bear in mind the property rights arrangements in the original COAG agreement back in 1995. Those who are going to give up these entitlements for the greater good of the nation should be encouraged, and not penalised in the way in which the current government is perpetrating this act of bastardry upon them.",57
27,Mr DUTTON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (11.54 am)-in reply-Can I start by thanking those members who have taken part in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006. In particular, can I thank those who have provided some comment or input on the measures that are actually contained within the bill. I am happy to address some of those concerns now. Firstly, I wanted to address some of the concerns raised by the member for Prospect. The member for Prospect commented that the ALP may seek to refer this bill to a Senate committee for consideration. I want to make the point very clearly to him and to the House that the government actually offered to refer the bill to such a committee. I am not sure how the handover went when he took up his current position; I am not sure if he is in the same faction as Joel Fitzgibbon or not. I do not know what happened, but the decision from the ALP at the time, along with the other minor parties, was that this bill did not need to be referred to a Senate committee. He has put himself forward as the bright star of the ALP and come up with this wonderful revelation that it should be sent to a Senate committee; well, the government has offered it. The ALP rejected it, so if they are now reproposing that then that is for the ALP. But one has to wonder: is it merely a political stunt, or is the real reason that the ALP are still at a complete loss on these matters of taxation and generally running the economy, as they were in the late eighties and early nineties? The government cannot now agree to the referral of this bill at such a late stage. The government does not want to delay businesses from accessing the benefits, and if the ALP are serious about their support of business, as they are currently saying they are, then I would have thought it would be in their best interests not to pursue this political agenda to the cost of business. The member for Prospect has raised concerns that the government announced an increase of the net asset value threshold from $5 million to $6 million. That has not been included in the bill and does not apply from 1 July 2006, similar to the amendments in schedule 1. To that, I say these amendments are in response to the Board of Taxation's recommendations coming out of the review of the small business CGT concessions, and these amendments apply from 1 July 2006. The government is separately introducing a new small business framework. The framework will align the small business thresholds throughout the income tax law. Due to the significance of this reform, the relevant changes will commence as announced on 1 July 2007 to allow sufficient time for the new framework to undergo appropriate consideration and consultation. The member for Prospect was also concerned that the government did not consult on the amendments to interest withholding tax contained in schedule 2. Of course, again, that is not true. The government in fact consulted widely with a number of industry parties and stakeholders before the measure was introduced. The government also appointed an independent consultant. I note for the benefit of members that the government is not reversing its reforms to this area of law but is simply ensuring that the law reflects the parliament's intent. These amendments correct an inadvertent error of short duration and would not be expected to cause any detriment to Australian companies who access offshore capital. What should be noted as part of this debate is that this government cannot be accused of not consulting with business, engaging with business or engaging with the stakeholders on these policies that we propose. In fact, the feedback that I get as I move around the country talking to businesses both big and small-and I am sure the same message is being conveyed to my shadow minister opposite-is that this government is operating its consultative process as well as we ever have. If there are issues that arise in relation to bills, we will continue to consult and make appropriate amendments where we need to. But the government is serious about consulting, and we will continue to embark on that path. We are not going to be pushed to one side by a political agenda run by a Labor Party desperate to make itself relevant to the business community. While supporting these amendments, the member for Prospect noted in relation to the statutory cap on the effective life of tractors and harvesters that these amendments are inconsistent with agreed Ralph recommendations. The government continues to support the Ralph recommendations on effective life, but as noted by the member this is an exceptional circumstance which required acknowledgement of the dire circumstances faced by our farmers, who around the country are encountering the worse drought in our country's history. This government is committed to continuing its assistance to people in the bush, and the member for New England, who is here to contribute to this debate, would be the first to acknowledge, surely, that this government has provided exceptional circumstance assistance to farmers in a time of exceptional need. When you compare it to the states, you see it is an appalling situation that the states have put themselves in. They have deserted farmers in their hour of need at a time when the Australian federal government is providing phenomenal support to people who are very worthy of it. The measure in relation to capital protected borrowings drew more whingeing from the member for Prospect about how long it has taken to implement an announced measure. But this is at the same time that he says that we should be consulting more. The opposition cannot have both short consultation times and long consultation times. They cannot have measures introduced tomorrow that require lengthy consultations. That needs to be a message that is sent to Labor and to the business community, when we have Labor running around saying that they will consult but saying at the same time that they will introduce legislation the next day. Both cannot happen. One has to give way. Although we are committed to introducing legislation in a timely fashion, we are committed to consulting with business to make sure that we provide the best outcomes not just to business but to consumers and to stakeholders in this portfolio and to make sure that we as a government continue to manage the Australian economy well so that the prosperous times in this country continue to roll. This bill makes a number of important changes that will assist small business. The changes will support primary producers and will improve certainty for taxpayers. Firstly, the bill amends the capital gains tax concessions for small businesses to increase the availability of these concessions and reduce the compliance costs of small business. The amendments are in response to the recommendations of the Board of Taxation and will improve the operation of the small business CGT concessions by making changes to the maximum net asset value test, the active asset test, the 15-year exemption, the retirement exemption, the small business rollover and how the concessions apply to partnerships. The bill also clarifies the interest withholding tax exemptions by more closely specifying the types of financial instruments the parliament intended to be eligible for the exemption. These amendments will reduce uncertainty for taxpayers and the tax office by confirming the policy intent in relation to dead interest. The intent, though, is broadly that Australian business should not face a greater cost of capital due to interest withholding tax. I repeat my statement that the government is committed to continuing our process of consultation on this aspect of the bill and other aspects, both those that are before the House at the moment and those that are under consideration by government. We will continue to make amendments where we need to. We will continue to listen to business. We will continue to act in the best interest of the nation and of our economy. Today, we recommit ourselves to doing that. The bill also gives effect to the government's 2006-07 budget announcement that it will enhance philanthropy by streamlining the integrity arrangements and reducing the compliance burdens that apply to deductible gift recipients or DGRs. The gift fund requirement for certain DGRs will be removed and the consolidation of multiple gift funds will be allowed for others. However, all DGRs will be required to maintain adequate records to show that the deductible public donations they receive are used appropriately and indeed how they are used. The amendments also align the integrity arrangements across all DGRs by allowing the Commissioner of Taxation to review whether an entity listed in the law continues to be eligible to receive deductible gifts, in the same way that the commissioner can review the eligibility of those entities that require the commissioner's endorsement. Additionally, the bill amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 by extending the time period for which four particular entities can receive tax deductible donations. Extending the deductible gift recipient status will assist those organisations to continue to attract public support for their activities. The Howard government is committed to helping Australian farmers struggling under this drought. This bill makes two important changes to the tax law to help farmers. The bill preserves the depreciation rate that applies to tractors and harvesters used in the primary production sector. With the drought affecting farmers and their families across Australia, the last thing that they need is a change in the tax treatment of their valuable farm equipment. That is why the government has implemented a statutory cap which will mean no change to the income tax treatment on harvesters and tractors. The government is also amending the Farm Management Deposits scheme to increase the non-primary production income threshold from $50,000 to $65,000 and the total deposit limit from $300,000 to $400,000. Increasing these thresholds will assist primary producers to cope in this time of hardship. This bill will provide certainty as to the tax treatment of capital protected borrowings. Under a typical capital protected product the investor is protected from a fall in the price of the shares, as the loan facility includes a capital protection feature that gives the investor the right to transfer the shares back to the lender for the amount outstanding on the loan. The full Federal Court of Australia ruled that the component of interest applicable to the cost of the capital protection feature is deductible when paid. The amendments will ensure that part of the expense on a capital protected product attributed to the cost of the capital protection feature is not interest and is not deductible where this cost is capital in nature. The measure restores the general principle underpinning the current law: that any revenue loss or outgoing in producing assessable income is deductible, while a capital loss or outgoing is not deductible. The measure also ensures that all borrowers who utilise a capital protection feature are treated in the same way for taxation purposes, whether or not the capital protection feature is purchased separately or included within so-called interest on the loan. I recommend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",57
28,Mr DUTTON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (12.06 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA'S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 December 2006, on motion by Mr Hardgrave: That this bill be now read a second time.",60
29,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 appropriates funds on behalf of the Commonwealth parliament to vocational and educational training, to the government's so-called Australian technical colleges. As a matter of principle, any expenditure by the Commonwealth to enhance vocational education and training and skills, whether that is in ior secondary school level or in the tertiary level, is to be welcomed. However, we have such grave reservations about the effectiveness of this allocation of Commonwealth revenues that, whilst we will support the legislation and not oppose it, our reservations will be detailed in a second reading amendment which I will formally move at the conclusion of my remarks. This is not the first occasion that the House has been seized with legislation in respect of the government's Australian technical colleges; indeed, it is the third occasion. The position which Labor adopts on this occasion is the same as it did on the vious two occasions, which is to not oppose implementation by the government of its 2004 election commitment but to express, both by way of debate and by second reading amendment, its very grave reservations about the effectiveness of the government's election commitment and the government's measure. The government announced the creation of its Australian technical colleges during the 2004 federal election campaign. That announcement was a political response during a political campaign to a political problem that the government had, and therein lies the basis for our very grave reservations about the effectiveness of this program and the effectiveness and value of the approach that the government has taken and the money that it is expending. Because it was a political response to a political problem, it is not necessarily the best public policy solution. We know, because it has been detailed regularly in this place-most importantly, detailed by the Reserve Bank of Australiaas one of the reasons why there was and is upward pressure on interest rates, that there is in the Australian community a serious skills crisis. A serious skills crisis does not come along just because we might have a the senboom in the minerals and petroleum resources industry which people were not necessarily expecting to be of that magnitude or extent; it comes along because of neglect and complacency over the long term. Unquestionably, this government has been both neglectful and complacent when it has come to the skills, education and training of our workforce. It is acknowledged, belatedly, by the government that there is a skills problem in the Australian community. As is so often the case with this government, the only time that it chose to act was when it was under political pressure. This is another illustration of pre- the government seeking short-term political cover for a long-term economic or social problem, an issue which goes to the long term international competitiveness of the Australian economy, an issue which goes to our long-term future prosperity as an economy and as a nation. It was a short-term political fix, and therein lies the reservation about the effectiveness of that fix. I think it is important to make some general remarks about the nature and the framework of vocational education and training in Australia. In my view, the only effective approach to take to enhancing vocational education and training is by the Commonwealth taking a leadership role and acting in cooperation with the states and territories and with industry. That is the most effective way of ensuring that we cater for our long-term skills needs and requirements. The essential starting point for the deficiency in the government's program is that, having neglected and been complacent and having, over its 10 long years in office, not funded skills training and vocational education and training enough-on the contrary, having removed funding from that area-when it came to effect a political fix, it did so by riding roughshod over the states and not playing a partnership or cooperative role with the states. Therein lies one of the economic, financial and administrative inefficiencies of the government's approach. The Australian technical colleges are stand-alone facilities. are not integrated with nor do they bear any relationship to what the states are doing through the traditional TAFE sector or indeed through TAFE colleges now, working in partnership with industry either at a state or at a local level. So an essential deficiency and criticism that Labor has of the government's approach in this area is its ignoring the states and ignoring of the TAFE sector. I do not think even the states or the TAFE sector argue that the states themselves or TAFE have been perfect in this area, but that is to say that you ignore the instruments which remain effectively responsible for about 70 per cent of the delivery of skills training vocational education and training in this country. So one fundamental deficiency of the government's approach is that it is not working in cooperation with the states. The best way of ensuring that we meet our skills and training needs into the future the Commonwealth working cooperatively, through the government of the day, with the states and territories and working cooperatively with industry. This is the best way of ensuring that the Commonwealth's priorities, the Commonwealth's needs-those areas which the Commonwealth regards as priorities-are the focus of our vocational and educational skills and training. The approach that the government has taken of a short-term political fix, ignoring and riding roughshod over the states, is a political solution that it fell upon in the course of the 2004 election campaign. What preceded that was a long period of time where it had failed or refused to cooperate with the states and failed or refused to invest in technical and further education. Let me now move to some of the detail of the legislation. The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 is the second such amendment to the AustraThey lian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Act 2005 in as many years. The first amendment bill brought forward the funding of the proposed 24 Australian technical colleges from 200809 to 2006-07. The bill before us today seeks to increase the total funding appropriated under the act by $112.6 million from the of $343.6 million to $456.2 million over the period 2005 to 2009. It does this by amending column 2 of the financial assistance table under subsection 18(4) of the act. The govnot ernment says it needs this extra money because of cost increases associated with the start-up of the colleges. As I have indicated, and the $112 million is on top of the $340-odd million already allocated to the start-up and running of the colleges. The fact is that this money represents a significant cost blow-out of the government's program. This should not be surprising beis by cause, by the government's own admission, it has embarked on a costly project to essentially duplicate vocational education and training infrastructure that exists elsewhere across our vocational education and training system. Instead of looking at joining with vocational education providers already established, in particular the state TAFE systems, and tapping into the existing expertise there to maximise training outcomes, the government has embarked upon a course of setting up its own stand-alone system. That is where the inherent inefficiency comes from and that is where the additional costs are found. The government's rationale behind the creation of the ATCs program has been twofold: firstly, to isolate and attack the states and territories in an area that has traditionally been one of the responsibilities of the states and, secondly, to try to find a political fix to a policy problem that the government has complacently neglected over a long period of time. Since the government came to office, over 325,000 people have been turned away from TAFE as a result of a lack of investment by the Howard government. The Australian Industry Group recently estimated that we would require 270,000 more trained people to fill the current skills shortage. A snapshot of the state of our skills shortage is found in the January skilled vacancies index, which shows that it is clear that our current skills crisis is not abating. Skilled vacancies in January rose by 1.4 per cent over the already high December reading. Compared with January 2006, vacancies in the automotive industry in January 2007 rose by 12.5 per cent; for cooks, by 5.3 per cent; for the food industry, by 10.5 per cent; for the printing industry, by nearly 60 per cent; and, for hairdressing, by over 10 per cent. We have a shortage of skilled and trained workers for two reasons: firstly, the government has actually cut public investment in vocational education and training and, secondly, it has complacently neglected the crisis coming down the track. You only have to look at the OECD figures and analysis to find that public investment in tertiary education, in both universities and technical and vocational training, has declined by seven per cent over the period that the government has been in office compared with competitor OECD members, whose public investment has increased by nearly 50 per cent. In 1997 the government cut funding to Australia's principal vocational education system, TAFE, with Commonwealth revenues in vocational education decreasing by 13 per cent from 1997 to 2000 and only increasing by one per cent from 2000 to 2004. Vocational education and training funding has also fallen relative to other areas of the education sector. In effect the amount of vocational education and training funding per student has decreased, with the result of adversely impacting on the quality of vocational education those students receive. The AiG identified in its Manufacturing futures report released in the second half of 2006 that real expenditure per hour for vocational education and training has declined in recent years. Today funding is lower in real terms than it was in Labor's last year in office. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research shows that real expenditure per hour declined by 16 per cent between 1997 and 2001 and increased only fractionally between 2001 and 2003, leaving a net real expenditure decline. The latest financial data released just last week by the NCVER shows that the Commonwealth's contribution to overall vocational education and training revenue has declined as a proportion of total revenue down from 22.4 per cent to 22 per cent. TAFE Directors Australia have also identified the fact that, in terms of revenue expenditure, vocational education has fallen behind other education sectors in both aggregate terms and on a per student basis, despite it being the area that will bear the greatest responsibility for the skills, vocational education and training development of our workforce. I have outlined some of the important reasons why Labor has very grave reservations about the application of these funds. Let me now read to the House my second reading amendment to reflect some of the detail of those reservations. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House recognises that the present Government has been complacent and neglectful about the Australian economy by: (1) presiding over a skills crisis through its continued failure over more than 10 long years in office to ensure Australians get the ing they need to get a skilled job and meet the skills needs of the economy; (2) failing to make the necessary investments in our schools and TAFE systems to create opportunities for young Australians to access high quality vocational education and training, including at schools; (3) failing to increase the number of schoolbased traditional apprentices and provide funding support for schools in taking up the places; (4) creating expensive, inefficient, stand alone colleges, without cooperation with the States within the existing Vocational Education and Training framework; (5) riding roughshod over the States and Territories in establishing these Colleges, despite the role the States and Territories play cational education and training; (6) making Australian industry wait until 2010 for the Australian Technical Colleges to produce their first qualified tradesperson; (7) failing to provide support to other regions that have skill shortages, but are not listed for a Technical College”. I dealt with some of those issues in the course of some of my earlier remarks, so I will now move to some of the areas that I have not covered. The creation of expensive stand-alone colleges without seeking to cooperate with the states and without seeking to contemplate the use of the existing vocational education and training framework has led to a cost blowout in the program. On any measure, the creation of a stand-alone facility is expensive. Instead of cooperating with the states and instead of seeing whether existing facilities could be enhanced or refurbished, the Commonwealth has decided to go it alone. That is at the heart of the cost blow-out and the expenditure here. I note remarks from the new Minister for Vocational and Further Education yesterday train- indicating some optimism about an acceleration of enrolments, the number of colleges up and running and outcomes. Even on a good day, it will not be until 2010 that the first qualified skilled workers will emerge from the ATCs, in the face of a skills crisis and the demands-some of which I have detailed from the Australian Industry Group. There are 24 to 25 colleges throughout the Commonwealth, which does not go anywhere near meeting the needs in all of the states, regions and local areas so far as vocational education and training is concerned. Anecdotal feedback on and experience with these expensive stand-alone colleges indicate a vast spend on physical infrastructure, and that their creation has been costly and has not been done in a way which is either coorin vodinated with or integrated with the state system. There is also anecdotal evidence and reports that enrolments in many of these facilities are quite low. As late as yesterday, I noticed in the Illawarra Mercury a short article under the heading ‘College fails to fill classes' which read: The Illawarra's newest technical college is still looking for students one week after classes started. So far, 38 students have enrolled in the region's Australian Technical College, which officially opened last Monday. And that is just one illustration that I have had drawn to my attention. So we have low enrolments, no graduation of skills until 2010 and waste and expense by riding roughshod over the states and going it alone. It may well be that some of the individual colleges are actually successful. Frankly, would be more by accident than design and because the moons happen to be in alignment rather than through good public policy, good public administration or good planning. One of those colleges may well be the ATC in the Pilbara, which is aimed at the minerals and petroleum resources industries of Western Australia. That one may work because the moons happen to be in alignment. A minerals and petroleum resources boom in exports to China has seen Western Australia-on the last set of state final demand figures I sawwith economic growth of 14 per cent. The relevant industry chambers in Western Australia-the Chamber of Minerals and Energy and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry-have put their very strong support behind the need to expand the capacity of Western Australia in skills in the minerals and petroleum resources area generally. And, despite reservations at the state government level that the cost of the project was massive when compared with how it could be done more efficiently, very grave reservations, the state government has got behind that project. That college may be a success, but largely because the moons are in alignment, not because of good thought, good public policy or good planning. I have made the point recently that, since became shadow minister for education and the Labor Party's spokesperson on education, my analysis of the ATCs and my starting point so far as the future of the ATCs goes was to sit down with my state colleagues and have a conversation about whether a better approach might be to fold the ATCs into the state system so that we would at least have some coordination, some integration and some cooperation with the states. That is certainly something that I am having a conversation with my state ministerial colleagues about. I do not believe there is a sencation sible public policy rationale for the Comthat monwealth to be starting off its own system without having a conversation with the states. That is precisely what the government did on this occasion-in the heat of an election campaign where it had been exposed politically, as a result of complacency and neglect, as the cause of a skills crisis. The states have had long standing responsibility in this area. In my view, the sensible way of moving forward is to do this in cooperation and in conjunction with the states, so that the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the states, can apply its own priorities through an integrated system. So my starting point of conversation with the states and my state colleagues is to see what the reaction of the states might be to folding the collegesthose that are up and running after the election-into the state system as a measure of cooperative partnership in the areas of skills and training, not the Commonwealth riding roughshod over the states and waving a big stick. I was in the House yesterday at question time when the new Minister for Vocational and Further Education, Mr Robb-the member for Goldstein, who recently replaced the former Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, the member for Moreton-argued and asserted that, if the colleges were to be I folded back into the states, employers involved would be shown the door. He went on to say: As a consequence, the unique and innovative role of training students with skills that are highly tailored to the needs of local employers will collapse. The colleges will disappear if they are handed back to the states. If Labor were to hand back these colleges to the states, history would repeat itself and the status of technical training would be reduced once again to that of a secondclass career. Firstly, I do not believe that vocational eduand training or a technical career is a second-class career. Just look at any technically qualified person who is currently working in Western Australia. They are handsomely remunerated and they have very fine careers. Secondly, that analysis by the minister fies the existence of very strong partnerships with local TAFE colleges, in harness and in conjunction with industry. In my own state of Western Australia, the Challenger TAFE, in Fremantle, south of Perth, is a very good example. It is a strong TAFE college, very conscious of the needs of local industry and working hand in glove with local industry. So to take the view that it is not within the capacity of the Commonwealth, working with the states and through the current TAFE system, to have vocational education and training requirements-whether that applies to secondary school students or to those at the tertiary level who have completed secondary school-working hand in glove with industry is, frankly, a nonsense. The government has been exposed here. The government, in the 2004 election campaign, tried to effect a political fix. It may well have had some short-term political benefit, but we have been left with a long term public policy problem that will only be resolved by a much greater investment in education generally; it will only be resolved by a much greater investment in further technical and vocational education and training, but making that investment on behalf of the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the states, using facilities that are currently available-refurbishing and enhancing them. We need agreement between the states and the Commonwealth about priorities and agreement with industry about what the skills needs will be down the track. That is the only sensible way forward in this area, and that will be the approach that Labor adopts in opposition and, subsequently, in government. I formally move the second reading amendment that I have detailed to the House and which has been circulated: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second dereading, the House recognises that the present Government has been complacent and neglectful about the Australian economy by: (1) presiding over a skills crisis through its continued failure over more than 10 long years in office to ensure Australians get the training they need to get a skilled job and meet the skills needs of the economy; (2) failing to make the necessary investments in our schools and TAFE systems to create opportunities for young Australians to access high quality vocational education and training, including at schools; (3) failing to increase the number of schoolbased traditional apprentices and provide funding support for schools in taking up the places; (4) creating expensive, inefficient, stand alone colleges, without cooperation with the States within the existing Vocational Education and Training framework; (5) riding roughshod over the States and Territories in establishing these Colleges, despite the role the States and Territories play in vocational education and training; (6) making Australian industry wait until 2010 for the Australian Technical Colleges to produce their first qualified tradesperson; (7) failing to provide support to other regions that have skill shortages, but are not listed for a Technical College”.",60

32,Mr CADMAN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Mitchell) (12.32 pm)From the day that the concept of a new approach to trade training and trade education was discussed by the governmentbeginning with Brendan Nelson, who at that stage was the Minister for Education, Science and Training and raised the significance of technical education-those thoughts have been rejected by the ALP. They have consistently knocked the concept of any change. They have said that the states know how to provide technical and further education. The fact is that they have all been failing to do that. There are a reduced number of apprentices and trainees, with skills that are sorely needed by Australia. They have failed to recognise this. There has been consistent denigration by the ALP of any proposal for change. There is no doubt that that rejection of any change in or improvement to technical and further education has been shown today, here in the House, by the opposition spokesman. As I understood it from his speech, here is what the Australian Labor Party intend to do. In government they consistently failed to support technical and further education. So will they do the same thing again if they ever have the chance to govern? Of course they will. The opposition spokesman said today that they would close down the Australian technical colleges and that he is negotiating the process by which that would be done. So a whole band of new and alternative education, a challenge to the status quo, a challenge to the way in which things are done-a combination of industry and education working together, possibly for the first time, in effective, cooperative arrangement with the flexibility of delivering education programs that are attractive to young people and that provide an opportunity to move quickly into trades when they leave school-will be rejected by the ALP. A rejection of that will, I believe, bring on a conflict that will mirror the current conflict between government and non-government schools. It will also highlight the continual backing of the teachers unions by the Australian Labor Party. Instead of working out what is best for our students, for our families and for Australia's needs, and having participants cooperate to get a result, it seems that the Australian Labor Party, by these pronouncements today, have stuck with the old framework. Their attitude is: ‘The states will deliver it, and whatever they want to do will be okay with us because we have no real priorities.' From the policies repeated today, the intention of the Australian Labor Party seems to be that the states will deal with technical and further education and that we will give them more money to do the same thing over and over again. I think that is a crazy and wrong approach. One only has to read about the priorities in my own state to see what should be happening there. One only has to look at the way in which New South Wales residents have been let down by their government on these issues. There are 47,000 job vacancies in New South Wales. The demographic changes will cut the size of the workforce in the coming years. There are significant skills shortages in the public sector and in regional New South Wales, despite its poor economic performance. There is an apprenticeship completion rate of 45 per cent in New South Wales. Victoria and New South Wales have a heap to answer for for the failure rate of their TAFE students. It is about the way in which an they present their courses. It is about the way in which they charge. It is all about cost recovery. The system is rigid and incapable of change. Unfortunately, in both of those states, the completion rate is low compared with other states. I think that is a let-down not by the federal government but by state governments incapable of delivering programs in trades and further technical skills that are attractive to young people, who are sorely needed in those areas. Australia has a proud, world-class training system. When our students go to compete at the trades ‘Olympics' they score extremely well. They beat many other countries time and again. Students from my own electorate have topped their trades in the world. The Australian government, since about the year 2000, have been trying to discuss with the states how we can do things better. The frustration of Brendan Nelson, the current Minister for Defence, day after day at the dispatch box trying to persuade, cajole, argue with and threaten the states into doing more was just not bearing fruit; in fact, the number of apprenticeships that this government was able to produce by 2004 had grown to approximately 400,000, nearly three times the number of apprentices who were in training in 1995 under the Australian Labor Party. The number then, in 1995, was only 140,000. By the year 2000 this government had successfully raised the numbers but realised we needed to go further. What were the results of those discussions? They were a flop. The states would not shift. They were too locked in. They were too rigid and too controlled by the trade unions and by the teacher's federation, in my view. The rigidity was there. A new approach was needed, and the Australian technical colleges are a new approach. able. Will it be the ideal pattern for the future? Maybe it will; maybe it will not. But it is a brilliant start, because both the young people whom I have spoken to and the tradesmen who will be employing them when they finish are excited by the changes. Let me give an example of what is occurring in Western Sydney. It was difficult to start something in Western Sydney. There are a number of reasons for that, but it is up and running. It was only in January this year that the New South Wales government agreed on what the courses should be. For goodness sake, if anybody is dragging the chain and trying to prevent young people from entering trades, it is the government of New South Wales. I think that its approach has been deplorable. There has been no interest in trying to meet some of the challenges of the future. If the New South Wales government were to look at what needs to be done, they would continue to support the COAG national reform agenda. They would want to be in there, having a say, instead of being dog in the manger with the future of young people and the needs of New South Wales. They need to work with the Commonwealth and the other states, and they need to have nationally recognised qualifications. But, no, New South Wales wants to have its own way of doing things and its own courses, structured in a certain way. So, when the federal ministers, both Dr Nelson and Mr Hardgrave, spoke to New South Wales people, a blank wall went up. There are destructive disincentives for Australian apprenticeships being practised by the government of New South Wales. Long hours of traininglong years of training, in many instancesrelatively low wages and the attractiveness of learning while you earn is being offset by hesitancy in making a rigid four-year commitment. Greater flexibility, which the Australian technical colleges offer, is not availSo there is a need for states to change. They have not changed, and so the Australian technical colleges are working like this: between year 11 and year 12 students work a full day. They start study at eight o'clock in the morning and finish at five o'clock. They have roughly seven months of school. They have a couple of months on the job and they spend the remainder of the year learning skills in their technical trade. What is this producing? At the end of two years, in the time a student achieves their higher school certificate, they have the first year of their apprenticeship completed. They have trade skills, they know about the workplace and they are a very desirable employee. And the changes that have been brought about by the introduction of the Australian technical colleges are going to produce massive effects in the workforce right across Australia-one only has to look at the take-up rate. The reason for this amendment, this appropriation of additional funds being required, is that the take-up rate during 2006 has been greater. Five colleges commenced in 2006: East Melbourne, Gladstone, Gold Coast, Northern Tasmania and Port Macquarie. A further 16 are to commence this year. North Queensland, North Brisbane, Adelaide South, Gippsland, Bendigo, Perth South, Hunter, Geelong, Northern Adelaide, Sunshine, Illawarra, Spencer Warrnambool, Darwin and Western Sydney have all commenced, and Pilbara will open in mid-2007. There will be a further three opening during 2008. They will be Central Coast, Dubbo and Queanbeyan. Two thousand students across Australia will attend Australian technical colleges this year. The Australian Labor Party has knocked this program as having a slow start. It has not been slow start. From a rapid introduction, there are 2,000 students in colleges this year and the expectation is that around 7,500 will be attending colleges each year once they are fully operational in 2009. It is an extraordinary achievement, and one that challenges the states, in my view, to needs. do more. I think that the states, particularly New South Wales, need to be providing support for school based career advisers to encourage students to consider professional advice about their careers and about education, training and opportunities for their future. And the trades must be part of that process. There needs to be a ministerial council in New South Wales to work out what needs to be done in vocational education in schools. There needs to be recognition of prior learning. But all that seems to be happening in New South Wales is that they are jacking up fees and saying that they need more migrant tradesmen. They do not appear to be capable of approaching the job and doing something worthwhile themselves. So I really feel that there needs to be a change in outlook. Let me give the House a couple of examples. Recently I had a discussion with a young man, a mature student, who wants to take up plumbing. He has done his first four years, which I understand qualifies him for certificate III, and he needs to do certificate IV, which is all theory. He is going to do two subjects a year and will attend college one night a week. During this time he will study Gulf, advanced plumbing to equip him to become a master tradesman who is able to do anything. After four years he is licensed but he needs these additional qualifications, so he needs another two years of study. The cost of study for one night a week for six months is $1,150. I am told that, only two years ago, this course was a fraction of that price. Some centres are even charging up to $2,200 per a segment for these last two years of a plumbing course. If one looks at some of the further subjects, which are not compulsory but which need to be added to these single subjects, one is looking at a possible total cost of about $6,000 for the additional two years to get the final trade licensing that a plumber I think this is so wrong. What they are doing is milking people in need. This young bloke has two kids. He is changing careers. He has a proven career of the past, and he is a mature student. He said, ‘I'm going to battle and find that money because I need to change my career. But I don't know about the young blokes who are in their twenties with a couple of kids and in the final years of their course. They're out on the job and need to get that final licence to establish themselves one day as a licensed plumber operating on their own, as a contractor or a subcontractor, but they're never going to do it.' any wonder we have such a failure in completion rates? Not only that; what is even more ridiculous is that, of the four subjects that are supposed to be completed in those years, only three are compulsory and they need not complete the fourth. Let me give you an idea of what they are. There are four components, including advanced gas, water and sanitary drainage. The one that is optional-which is probably the most important of the lot-is plumbing contracting principles. That is the thing that equips a bloke to go out and do the job in a responsible manner. That is optional in New South Wales. You do not have to do it; you can just do the three. You pay for the four and you can do the three, but you do not have to complete the most significant one; it is not mandatory. It is no wonder that we have a dropout rate of such significance in New South Wales. The Financial Review of 9 June said that in Victoria the completion rate for 1998-2002 was 64 per cent, falling to 57 per cent for 2002-05. The figures provided in the recent publication of the New South Wales business chamber indicate that it is down to a 45 per cent completion rate. This is the way it has changed in the two states. The flexibility offered by the Australian technical colleges is terrific. A lot of students want to go into the trades, but they have not had decent maths or decent English early in their education. However, they can get remediation. A technical college has to take everybody and enrol them and then apply the remediation. The Australian technical colleges can assess students on the way in, design personalised courses for them and give them additional hours. They have the flexibility of employers being involved in the design of courses and they have tradesmen on the boards of the Australian technical colleges, as well as educators. The Australian Is it government has produced a magnificent result, an amazing success that will contribute mightily to Australia's needs in technical and further education. It is an attractive opening in which students and employers can become involved in a high-calibre career-they can all participate-and the Australian government is spearheading change in this area. Under the current state arrangements operating in New South Wales and Victoria in particular, it is too closed, too inflexible and too difficult. Other states may be more flexible. I believe that the TAFE teachers are trying hard and the institutes are trying hard, but the policies overriding those make it almost impossible to meet the goals of Australia. We need a unified approach to trades. We need to have objectives which are flexible and which allow people to take up trades-objectives which are encouraging and offer people a wonderful opportunity. My electorate is full of young families, and the heads of those families are selfemployed tradesmen. They are in building trades of all sorts, and there are mechanics and people in a whole range of other trades such as pneumatics, hydraulics and all the rest of it. They are very successful people. They work extremely hard, start early in the morning and work long hours. They may be running only small businesses-one or two people or just a single tradesman and his missus running the books-but they are some of the best people in Australia, and they are really committed to Australia's future. They want to see Australia succeed, and they are committed to their homes and their families. They want to produce the best results for them as well. I believe that any ernment that restricts, limits or hobbles that process is not worth keeping and not worth feeding. Unfortunately, it appears that only too often Victoria and New South Wales are obstructive rather than supportive of our liant, young, new tradesmen.",67
33,Mr MCMULLAN,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I rise to support the amendment to the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 moved by my colleague the member for Perth. When the Leader of the Opposition took that job, he gave high priority to the task of ending the blame game and getting rid of the attempts by one level of government to explain away their failure by blaming the activity on the other. Australians are sick and tired of the blame game-and if the speech by the member for Mitchell had been broadcast, they would understand why. I have never heard a more old-fashioned, tired exposition of the blame game than that which we just heard. There was not one step forward in what he had to say. It was a straight 1990s exposition of the modern Liberal Party. In the 1970s, he would have been kicked out of the Liberal Party for saying all that, but these days it the modern Liberal Party version and it is sad. The question of our skills crisis is a very serious one, but the most remarkable thing about the skills crisis is that everybody knew it was coming. Nobody has been taken by surprise, but nobody thought that the federal government setting up a parallel system of vocational education and training colleges was a sensible solution-not even the Howard government in 2003. They did not think about it in 1997, 1998 or 1999. Everybody who has ever been engaged in the political process knows what happened. In the run-up to the 2004 election, the people in the policy think tank said, ‘The research says we have a govproblem with skills. The public has perceived we are not doing enough, so we have to dream up a policy for the election.' Because a proper solution would have required lengthy discussion with the states and an brilagreed program of reform, it was incapable of being done in the time available. In the eight previous years, no effort had been made to do that. That option was not open, so they dreamt up this nightmare of a parallel Needs) system of Australian technical colleges. Think about this analogy: what would people say if the federal government said, ‘We have a clever idea. We are going to set up federal government hospitals in Bundaberg because of the problem the Queensland government has with health'? No sane person would have thought that was a good solution. Everybody knew there was a problem at Bundaberg hospital, but nobody thought that the Commonwealth should set up some hospitals and then it would all be solved. We could have it run on AWAs-that will solve the problem! That is just a very sad example of what is worse about the management of federal-state relations. The Business Council of Australia articulated their concern about the profound crisis in our federal system and is released a report that said the shortcomings in our federal system-the waste and the duplication-are costing Australians $9 billion a year. What was the example they used to highlight the worse of it? It was the Commonwealth's attitude on vocational education and training-and that is before we had this mad system! The report stated: The Commonwealth/State agreement on Skilling Australia's Workforce provides a good example of where funding ... in fact provides perverse incentives and opens the way for the imposition of overly prescriptive requirements on the States ... The agreement: - does not provide incentives or rewards for improving quality of training, - imposes maintenance of effort requirements in both activity and spending which are incentives to efficiency (so it rewards the more inefficient States), and, - imposes highly prescriptive requirements at provider level which have nothing to do with training outcomes. That is dead right. So what is it that we are trying to achieve? Any sensible person who sought a reform of vocational education and training would talk to the states. It would not be easy, but the previous government did come to an agreement, which this government abolished. I am not advocating that we go back to that model. We need to go forward, but we need to go forward to a new sort of agreement that is about outcomes and not about inputs. This government is about regulating the inputs in schools and not worrying about the outcomes. All the contemporary literature and the good analysis, both Australian and international, about the efficient operation of federations say that the central agency-in Australia it is the Commonwealth governmentshould primarily be about funding in the areas that are best done locally. That is not everything; it is not defence or economic management, which should be done centrally. The advantage that federalism brings in vast countries like Australia, the United States and Canada is that it allows the delivery to respond to local variation. But if you have that in an unfettered way, what you get is widening differentiation between the states and regions in the country because the strongest have the capacity to do the most. The federal body can have an equalising function and a standard setting function to say, ‘We have a national interest in what is going to happen with regard to skills.' Ten years of neglect have created a profound national crisis in schools. We need to address it by setting outcomes that we require the states to achieve and providing an incentive system so that those who achieve it get rewarded, disand those who do not achieve it do not get rewarded. That is the way we go about getting reform. If you tried to imagine the worse possible mechanism for getting a broadly based enhancement of Australia's skills training regime, you would invent a parallel scheme. We have three out there: there is private vocational education and training, there is the TAFE system and now there is the Commonwealth system. Even if the Commonwealth system were magnificent, its scale is totally trivial compared to the scale of the problem we face. The minister, in his first answer in question time yesterday, made it clear that the system is not going to achieve the specified outcomes. If his ambitious outline of what is going to happen this year were to come true, we will still only be getting to 2,000 students by the end of this year-far fewer than the Prime Minister promised at the last election. But that is very convenient, because it means that he can promise it again at the next election-and he will. It is typical. This problem arises on a triennial basis, just before every election, but in between nothing happens. This system is entirely trivial compared to the scale of the national skills problem. Its dollars would be much better spent on incentives for the improvement and reform of the state system, where most of the training is going to take place, even if this scheme comes to its full and comprehensive fruition as promised-and I do not believe it will. As the title of this bill says, we need to ‘achieve Australia's skills needs'. As Dr Peter Kell from Wollongong University said: A skills shortage is no accident when you under invest for 10 years. That is absolutely right. All the international data says that Australia has been falling behind the pack in investing in post-secondary education. The government cannot say that it did not know this was coming. It was advised on a number of occasions by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank warned that declining skills in the workforce was a looming problem: Localised prejudices are certainly evident official wage measures as well as through business liaison which points to substantial increases in wages for skilled employees. The Productivity Commission was also warning the government as follows: The challenge for Australia is to further strengthen and improve the national training tem so it delivers what Australian business communities and individuals need to build their own personal, and our collective, economic and social prosperity. All the proposals for reform in our federation look across a range of issues, and high up on the agenda is doing something better about our federal-state relationships as they relate to skills. There is more to do about preschool-a very big issue. It is a question of long-term investment in enhancing the economic performance and social equity of this country. The neglect of preschool education has been a scandal. Investment in preschool education is not going to do much to address our current skills crisis, but it is an investment that needs to be made. More needs to be done in schools, particularly in the area of maths and science, which has been highlighted by the conference being held here in Canberra today. More needs to be done about university, where the international data is humiliating for Australia. Our performance is so bad compared to all those with whom we hope to compete. It is flying in the face of the data that says that investment in that area of education is critical to modern successful economic performance. Central within those three areas where our performance is lagging and where reform is needed is the need to do something about skills. We all welcome the fact that under this bill there will be an increase in spending on the training of Australians, but the way that it is being done is a scandal-a waste, a duplication and a scandal. Everybody knows this policy has not been a success. The poor prein some vious minister carried the can and got dumped. I am sure a lot of people blame the department, but neither the minister nor the department are responsible. I did not think the previous minister was one of the stars of the government in any of his previous positions, but it is not his fault. This policy is a sys- dog. It could not work. The best will in the world could not make it work. And, if it succeeds, it makes no significant contribution to solving the problem. Everybody knows that. They knew it on the day it was announced. The Prime Minister knew it on the day he decided to announce it. Everybody knows the policy has not been a success. It could not have been a success. By the end of last year only five of the promised colleges were functioning. The new minister said yesterday in question time that, while more colleges would be coming online this year, the total number of students will still only be 2,000-absolutely irrelevant to the broad sweep of the challenge facing Australia. We have been experiencing strong economic growth. The world has been driving demand for what we want to produce, and we have been riding on the back of that boom. There are now all sorts of long term issues about the sustainability of that boom and the lack of investment in other areas of the proceeds of the boom to guarantee our future prosperity. Nowhere is it more stark than in this area. The very failure to invest some of the proceeds of that boom in skills is putting the boom itself at risk because the skill shortages are contributing to pressures on the labour supply in particular industries and regions, particularly those booming the most. The Prime Minister, as we all know, is a very clever politician. He saw in the lead-up to the last election that he had a political problem. One wishes he had seen that the nation had a social and economic problem. But we all know he is very clever with these political quick fixes. He saw a political lem and he came up with a political solution. He announced on the day, to the incredulity of everybody who knows anything about the area, that the Commonwealth would set up its own system of technical colleges. It would have been funny if it were not sad. I empathise with the challenge faced by the department in implementing this extraordinary policy. It is an example of the worse sort of federal-state relations-a knee-jerk reaction to solve a political problem for the Commonwealth-which involves duplication and inefficiency. What did the BCA say when, with the very comprehensive economic analysis that they commissioned, they assessed the $9 billion cost to the Australian economy of the waste, inefficiency and duplication? They said that the lines of responsibility are not clearly defined. How could that be more clearly illustrated than here, where we have a conscious decision to duplicate a federal system? It is not a takeover-I do not think I would have agreed with that, but at least it would have clarified the line of responsibility-but it is a duplication. It is a classic ample of waste and inefficiency. The establishment of Australian technical colleges in parallel with the TAFE system cuts across all good principles of how a federation should work. We need a new round of economic reforms. All the analysts-driven by the Business Council of Australia but including independent advisors such as Professor Garnaut-say that the next big wave of micro-economic reform is going to have to come from, or include within it, reform of federal-state relations. And there has been no more adverse step in the reform of federalstate relations than the decision to establish a needless duplication in the training system to meet our national skills crisis. I am a great believer in the benefits of prob- competition, and I think that opening the forces of competition in our training system is worthwhile, but I am not a fan of different levels of government duplicating the same area of activity. The system loses cohesiveness and the duplication outweighs any potential advantages. You get a misalignment of priorities. At its best, federalism suggests that needs will be better met at a local, regional or state level, through the principle of subsidiarity: carrying out the function at the lowest level at which it can be most effectively delivered. That is certainly not exemplified by the Commonwealth's setting up of a parallel system of technical colleges. The Commonwealth should be focusing on training outcomes and on incentives to the states and the other suppliers to meet those outcomes. They should have an incentive based model-as in all the best federal-state relations reform models-that will encourage participants to meet that requirement, be an incentive for innovation and get the best benefit out of competitive federalism. The Commonwealth should focus on setexting priorities that ensure Australians have access to more training, better training and more appropriate training. Money currently being wasted on the pointless duplication of the TAFE system by the Australian technical colleges should be invested in our skills sector by providing incentives for innovation, reform and better outcomes. I repeat what I said in opening: I welcome the increase in funding for skills education but I call on the Howard government to stop playing politics with this issue that is so vital for Australia's future. We need to be smart in how we spend our money. We need to develop our human capital and, through this, maintain the momentum that will eventually build a better future for all Australians by finding ways for all to participate and achieve in our economy. And we need to focus on reform of our federal-state relations. There is no worse example of bad practice in this area than the duplication inherent in the system of Australian technical colleges.",71
34,Mr RANDALL,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I am pleased today to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. It gives me the opportunity to say a number of things about the technical college system, and particularly about the technical college that is going to be in the region of my electorate of Canning in Western Australia. Before I speak about that I am almost obliged to respond to some of the things said by the member for Fraser. He is obviously out there trying to brush up his credentials on federal-state relations and to demonstrate that he needs a guernsey on it. This is the person who said, in his speech, ‘Let's stop the blame game and let's stop playing politics.' But what did he do throughout the whole damn speech that he just gave? He spent the whole time pouring scorn, in a snide and cynical way, over this whole process. That was his contribution: firstly, to try and showcase his federal-state relations credentials; and, secondly, to try and rubbish the whole system. He knows that this system was in need of greater funding and in need of an alternative system, because the state TAFE training system is broken-and I will later give you some evidence about why the state TAFE system is in such bad shape. The member for Fraser is not somebody I take a lot of notice of because he is the man who misled this parliament on the ethanol issue. As a result of that we do not take what he says for granted; it needs to be examined very carefully. Mark Latham was right about him when he sacked him. Amazingly, the Labor Party wanted to go ahead with new blood but they went back and got a timeserver and put the member for Fraser in place. Putting a timeserver back on the front bench is a strange way of taking the party forward. The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill, which is before us today, is very important because it is aimed at providing additional funding of $112.6 million over the years 2005 to 2009 for the establishment and operation of Australian technical colleges. We know that the original initiative was funded at $343.6 million for 24 colleges. That was increased to 25 colleges, and, when you add $112.6 million, we now have $456.2 million, almost half a billion dollars, that the federal government is committing to further training, particularly for our young people in upskilling them for jobs. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot have the member for Fraser and those on the other side saying this is-what were his words?-‘needless duplication', a funding mechanism which is a waste and a scandal, when the federal government is putting in place a world-class training regime for young people to upskill our workforce. We know that Australia at the moment is going through one of the biggest booms it has ever had, and it is going to keep running for some time. To all the naysayers over there that say, ‘You should have seen this coming years ago,' and all that sort of stuff, I say that we have seen it coming and that is why we have put in place a mechanism to try and upskill our young people. But in the meantime we have to import skilled labour through the 457 visa program and other regional and state government sponsorships to fill the void of this hugely growing economy. In this hugely growing economy we need skilled workers, and you do not just invent them overnight. The TAFE system has been a dismal failure in providing this. To give an example, one of the TAFE teachers in my area came to me and said: ‘ Mr Randall, I can't believe what goes on at this TAFE that I teach at. There are more administrators and teachers than there are students.' The administrators all have a car and a fuel card and spend most of their time being bureaucrats, and the teachers are underemployed because there are not enough students there. In Western Australia, as Mr Deputy Speaker Haase would know, in the north-west, for example, it is very difficult tract students into training when they can go out and earn the sort of money that they are earning as trades assistants, for example, without any skills. My nephew, over Christmas lunch, happened to tell me that he earns $1,200 a week as a trades assistant in Karratha. Why would he now take up an apprenticeship or a skill training regime when he can leave school early and go and get that sort of money? That is the challenge-to try and get enough people into this system. The proof of the pudding is in what is happening today, and that is that these Australian technical colleges are receiving very good enrolments. It is patchy in some areas. In my state, at the Perth South Australian Technical College, there are enrolments before they have even opened their doors-that demonstrates how popular it is. The young people are voting with their feet. They want to join Australian technical colleges that actually teach skills. The Prime Minister put in place the mechanism of Australian technical colleges because TAFEs were not teaching skills. They were teaching everything but skills. You could go and do courses in aromatherapy, flower arranging or transcendental meditation, but could you get a real course in upskilling automotive electricians? It was very difficult. Because the state governments absolutely slugged through fees and charges students going into these courses, they were not interested. They were not interested because, firstly, it did not provide them with the course that they wanted and, secondly, they were getting slugged in the neck. The state governments cannot have it both ways, and neither can the opposition by saying, ‘At the end of the day we have a very good system in place.' The TAFE system is largely broke all around Australia. Then we to atget the member for Perth-the opposition spokesman who has been dumped as industrial relations spokesman because he could not sell it; now he is going to try and sell this-saying that if Labor were to come to power they would dump the college plan. An article in the Financial Review on Monday the 5th by Sophie Morris said: The federal government's new trade high schools are likely to be handed over to the states if a Labor government is elected. He is their spokesman, so obviously it is Labor Party policy. Once these technical colleges are established, he would take them and hand them over to the broken and dismantled system of TAFEs in the states. We are going to fund them properly. With half a billion dollars in the initial set-up plus the ongoing recurrent funding, we will see that this is done properly-properly staffed and properly resourced in terms of educational facilities and tools. But you cannot say that about the TAFEs. In fact, the TAFE system in my state in particular is almost laughable because people who try and get into it, as I said, do not get the meaningful courses that they want and the charges are exorbitant. The article goes on to say: As Labor tries to make education an election issue, education and training spokesman Stephen Smith said that a Labor government would probably dump the policy, which was the coalition's skills centrepiece ... Mr Smith told The Australian Financial Review that he saw no good reason for the government's Australian Technical Colleges for senior high school students. “I don't see a sensible public policy rationale for the commonwealth trying to start up its own technical system when you've got the states having primary responsibility for secondary schools and for the TAFE system for many years ... “My starting point would be: is it possible to fold these ones which are already up and running, is it possible to fold them sensibly into what the states are doing, and in the course of that reflect our own priorities?” That is the danger. I say to the parents of all the students out there in Australia who want to get into this system: the Labor Party, should you put your student into one of these colleges, will shove them back into the state TAFE system, with all its ramifications. It is scary to think what a Labor government in the future would do with training. What is their history on training? What did the previous Keating-Hawke Labor government do in terms of training? The member for Hotham was their minister charged with the responsibility for training and employment. They started these beautiful things called Working Nation training centres, where you could do a brickies course in three weeks. I went out to some of these when I was the member for Swan. I have to tell you: I would not want them building my house. They were not put up by a plumbline, I can assure you. They were probably put up by somebody who was not too good at putting an eye down a bead. I would not want these people doing these quick fix, mickey mouse courses putting up my brick house, thank you very much, because it would not stay up for long. But there they were. They had Bill Hunter-remember him?-standing there in those expensive as saying, ‘We've got these people job-ready to go into the workforce.' The only one who made any money out of it was Bill Hunter. He got an enormous amount of money for running the as. He was probably the only one who got well remunerated. It was in effect a way of taking all these unemployed young people off the unemployment list and putting them in a short-term fix to alter the stats so they did not look too bad. It did not last long, because in reality with some of these jobs it was costing something like $60,000 per person to train them on these short, mickey mouse courses and to put them into some sort of training regime which did not last long. At the end of the day it was an absolute failure. So that is Labor's past. That is what they have done in the past, and in the future their only alternative is, rather than try and put into place a decent skills training regime, that they are going to fold these colleges back into TAFEs, in the broken state that they are in. I can point out quite clearly that the Perth South Technical College-which the member for Hasluck, Stuart Henry, and I have fought hard for-is going to be a success. One of the reasons I am very proud to be associated with working hard and making a strong argument to have it located in Perth South is that the eastern corridor of Perth in particular has been bereft of skills training and tertiary training. When the previous education minister, Brendan Nelson, was in place I was able to get him to agree to provide 20 university funded places for the Armadale region. That was most welcomed by the city of Armadale and the whole community of Armadale, and the Curtin university provided the facilities and the linkage to the local schools. In fact, they got more than 20 places, because they were able to maximise their funding to fund more than 20 students. This was a first step. We had the former member for Hasluck, Sharon Jackson, out there saying, ‘Ah, there's nothing in the eastern suburbs,' and all she was doing was criticising. Well, she is trying to come back again, but I think she will have a bit of trouble against the current member for Hasluck, Stuart Henry, because he is actually out there working and he knows a lot about skills training. He used to run this sector in Perth himself. I do not know if he is down to speak on this bill, but if he is then it will be an quent speech because he knows the subject like the back of his hand. Anyway, Sharon is going to have a job ahead of her trying to do this, because at the end of the day there she was, bemoaning the facts. It is a typical Labor thing: yelling and screaming and saying, ‘Shock, horror,' but not providing any alternative. We are providing the alternative. As soon as we provide the job training places out there, what do the Labor Party do? What did the member for Fraser say? He said they are ‘a waste, duplication and scandalous.' This was a man who said, ‘Let's not get involved in the politics of it.' The Australian Technical College, Perth South is going to be located on two sites, one at Maddington and one in Armadale. Maddington is in the electorate of the member for Hasluck, just up the road from me. It is probably only about three to five kilometres from my electorate office, and the Armadale campus is just a couple of kilometres up the road. So the two campuses are very close. They are actually going to be involved in real, meaningful skills training. The Armadale campus will concentrate on the construction industry-that is brickies, plumbers et cetera-which is going to be fantastic, and the Maddington campus is going to be providing automotive training: for car electricians, upholsterers, panel beaters et cetera. That is going to be fantastic, and the young people in that region are taking hold of this straight away, as I will indicate in a moment in terms of enrolments. In fact, I will indicate it now. Let me point out that the first-year intake for both campuses has been targeted for 90 people, and you will ask in a moment, ‘Why is it so low?' Well, you will see in a moment that, as a lead-into the construction and facilities available, 90 is quite appropriate. Currently, even before they open, the enrolment is 61. eloEnrolments are expected to jump once classrooms are finished, and there will be over 300 by the third year. At the moment the temporary classrooms for the students in Armadale are almost ready, and until then the students will be housed at Maddington. Industry is now enthusiastically joining the party, and enrolments for this year will be 90 within the next few weeks. One of the keys to the Perth South college is flexibility. For example they are outlining the curriculum and the courses available, but it came to pass that steel fixing was an area that they need further support with. Steel fixing was not planned, but since the industry became interested there have been 14 enrolments for the steel fixing course. Given the fact that you can earn about a thousand bucks a week as a steel fixer no matter what age you are, is it any wonder that young kids want to get involved in the steel fixing side of the construction industry? Interestingly, the Armadale campus will cost $4.75 million plus $1.5 million for the land-not inexpensive-and the Gosnells campus is going to cost $5.5 million. Can I say at this point-and I digress-that I am really aggrieved about the process, in that it missed out on an opportunity. The RAC had a magnificent site on the highway in Maddington which could have been had for something like $2.3 million. The previous minister was aware of this and wrote to the state department and to the Australian Stirling Skills Training group, who are running this institution, and said, ‘Look, even though you haven't received all the paperwork yet, I'm telling you that you will be awarded this and you should go and get that centre.' But they did not, and there was not enough courage from the board at that stage. A whole range of incidents came together so that they did not go and buy it, and they got beaten by Silver Chain. I do not know why Silver Chain would want a facility like that, but at any rate it is a magnificent facility. They could have got it for something like $2.2 million or $2.3 million, and now building a purpose-built one is going to cost $5.5 million. So I am pretty annoyed that they did not show enough initiative to go and do that. One of the reasons this process has been slow is that they have had a lot of difficulty getting approvals from the state department of DEST. Thank goodness the new minister has intervened over the last few days and has made sure that DEST got on and signed their approval to lease, because what they wanted was the leasing arrangement for this rather than the purchase. As a result, this is going happen now. The builder was waiting to build-the footings were poured and everything was ready to go-but DEST wanted so much compliance and further information, and there was duplication and a wrong form. But when Trevor Williams, from Stirling Skills Training, wrote to Margaret Cameron and said, ‘If you don't hurry up, we are going to lose our builder,' that was a cause of concern to me. So I got straight onto the new minister and made sure that we saw this happen. That is one of the reasons why there has been some lag time. In fact, there has been a deliberate intervention by certain people to try to slow this process. A school principal, when we actually turned the first sod there, said to me, ‘Look, the Perth South district education has made it clear to me as a school principal that they want to see this process go slow.' That is the state government again trying to put a bit of heat on with nefarious behaviour and trying to cause grief to a federal government initiative. He said: ‘I will not have a bar of it. I am just letting you know that that is the direction I have seen from the Perth South district office on this.' In finishing, I would say that this is a great outcome. There have been frustrations and delays. DEST requires information about a three-year lease, which is not very attractive to someone who wants to involve themselves in a lease. It should be for a longer period than that. But the whole community is grateful for this federal government initiative. The young people are grateful for this initiative on training and educational opportunities, particularly out in the eastern corridor of the Perth area. I know that it will be welcomed in the Pilbara in the north. We are actually fixing something that the states dropped the ball on. We are going to make sure that young people get opportunities, which they have been deprived of, to be upskilled in the to future workforce of Australia. (Time expired)",75
35,Ms GEORGE,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I have made several contributions in the House on the government's Australian technical colleges program. I have consistently questioned whether the expenditure on these 25 colleges is in fact good public policy and to what extent the program would play any meaningful role in addressing the skills crisis which is now facing our nation. As we know, it is a skills crisis that is a severe obstacle Australia's economic fortunes. It is very easy for the member for Canning to again play the blame game and try to transfer the responsibility to state governments. But, under the watch of the Howard government, for years a range of credible organisations, including their friends in the business community, have been alerting the government to our growing skills crisis. Rather belatedly, the government had to confront this reality and admit that such a shortage actually existed. However, rather than accepting their failure to deal with the crisis after 10 long years in government, they came up with the rather spurious rationalisation that Australia's skill shortages were a manifestation of a buoyant economy. I have to challenge that assertion and I do so on the basis of the region that I represent. One would have to ask how it is that, in a region like the Illawarra-where we have unemployment rates at around 10 per cent, together with record levels of unemployment among teenagers looking for full-time work, at around 40 per cent-side by side with these horrendous indicators of unemployment we have skills shortages. So this rationalisation that somehow you have to expect skills shortages because we are travelling so well economically certainly does not hold up in the area that I represent. In fact, it is a very potent mix to have high unemployment rates, especially among young people desperately wanting to get into an apprenticeship, coupled with business crying out for labour to fill their shortages now, not in 2010 to 2012 when we would expect the first graduates to be emerging from these colleges. The government has only itself to blame for allowing the skills crisis to develop on its watch. It has been asleep at the wheel while this crisis grew around it. A small indication to that it has been asleep on its watch is the response to some questions on notice to the former minister about what was happening to apprenticeship training in the Illawarra from 1996 onwards. By the government's own admission, the number of apprentices in training in the traditional trades in fact fell from 880 young people in training in 1996, which was the first year of this government, to 870 in 2004. So the number of young people in training for an apprenticeship was in fact declining at a time when the alarm bells should have been ringing for this government. Despite all of the knowledge and warnings about the skills crisis, fewer people in my region were training in the traditional trades in 2004 than in the first year of this government. When you look at the early 2000s, you see that the number of apprentices in training in the Illawarra had fallen to 630. So you cannot say that this is a problem that developed overnight. The warning bells were ringing loudly for a considerable period of time. As we know from all of the reports that we had from the TAFE directors, this was at a time when cuts were being made, there was a lack of investment in vocational education and there was huge unmet demand in the system. Young people who would have made excellent apprentices and trainees were in fact being turned away from the gates of our local TAFE colleges. When we first heard the proposal about these Australian technical colleges as an election promise, the Prime Minister said at the time, ‘The technical colleges are the centrepiece of our drive to tackle skills shortages and to revolutionise vocational education and training throughout Australia.' In my view, it was the case then as it is today that that statement was one of extreme hyperbole. The 25 colleges, as we know, will at best train a maximum of 7½ thousand tradespeople who will graduate between the years 2010-12. How on earth is that a solution to tackling the skills crisis that is here with us today and that is growing every day? I cannot say to the businesses in the Illawarra, ‘Wait for the 315 young people who will graduate between 2010-12 to fill the skills shortages that we know exist today.' So the solution was a mere drop in the ocean when the estimated skilled labour shortage today is in the order of 100,000 people. The government's announcement was, in my view, a political fix to the policy problem of Australia's crisis in skilled labour-a problem that continues to grow and that still needs to be urgently addressed by the new minister. On behalf of the people I represent, I think it is quite reasonable to query whether the expenditure on these colleges is good public policy and to ask the question: would not the same outcomes be achieved without duplicating the existing provisions for school based apprenticeships, the provisions that are available for apprenticeship training in the TAFE sector and, indeed, the increasing interface between the VET stream in schools and local TAFE institutes? We are asked in the bill before us today to increase the funding allocation for these 25 colleges by another $112.6 million. The total allocation would grow from $343.6 million to $456.2 million over the period 2005-09. You have to ask: why is this increase in funding needed? We were told by the minister-who obviously did not satisfy the Prime Minister about his capacity to implement an urgent response to Australia's skills crisis and who now finds himself on the back bench-in his second reading speech that the additional funds are needed because: ... the continued success of the Australian techniFriday cal colleges ... program reflects the better than expected progress that has been achieved to date in implementing this Howard government initiative. Nothing could be further from the truth. By the end of last year, just five of these colleges had commenced operation. Some two years after the grand announcement was made, the minister at the time was claiming satisfaction with the hundreds of enrolments. There were five colleges up and running last year-on the Gold Coast and at Gladstone, Port Macquarie, Eastern Melbourne and Northern Tasmania. Between these five colleges, there were 340 enrolments. Even that minimal figure was skewed by the fact that, at Port Macquarie, the newly labelled Australian technical college with 205 enrolments previously operated as the long-established St Joseph's vocational college. So there were 205 students at a college that already existed. It was relabelled and rebadged as Port Macquarie Australian Technical College. If you subtract the 205 enrolments from the 340 total enrolments, it is a pretty pathetic performance. I recall at one stage that the Australian Technical College Gladstone had only one student enrolled. So some two years after the announcement, after we spent about $50 million of taxpayer funds, we had 350 students, minus the enrolments that were already there in Port Macquarie, in only five colleges. You have to ask: is this what the minister claimed to be a great success? I do not think so. Now we are being asked to approve an additional $112.6 million. We were told-and I quote again from the former minister, the no longer minister for vocational education and training-that ‘the operational cost necessary to get each college up and running is far higher than originally expected'. Let us look at the situation in the Illawarra where we do have one of these colleges. Last night, I attended a very pleasant function in Wollongong to meet the parents of students enrolled at our college. The comments I make in my contribution about the government's program do not reflect at all on the parents, the students, the staff or the board members who have all worked enthusiastically and tirelessly to get the Illawarra college operational. My comments are directed at the failure of government policy and the continued tardy implementation of real programs to address real problems insofar as our skills crisis is concerned. I talked to a number of parents at the function and they were, naturally enough, excited at the prospect of their child's enrolment. Nearly all I spoke to referred to the load and the pressure for these students because, as we know, they are supposed to be studying for their HSC, undertaking apprenticeship training and working two days a week. For a 16or 17-year-old, I think that is a sizeable load. I do not think any of the projections on the part of the government for the maximum output of the 7,500 students ever factored in the possibility of drop-out and attrition rates because of that quite sizeable burden on 16and 17-year-olds. In fact, the TAFE directors of Australia also pointed to this problem. Their executive officer, Mr Riordan, said ‘The Australian technical college model asks a great deal of 16and 17-year-olds' and that ‘the prospect of drop-out rates is high'. When I raised the specifics of the Illawarra college with the minister, I was told that enrolments at our local college were to be 50 students at the start of this year. This some two years after the announcement. Our students are currently in leased facilities and, not surprisingly, are going to undertake their training at the local TAFE college just down the road. But instead of using the facilities that TAFE can provide, the government proposes to build a brand new building, which will be constructed and operational from 2008. I think it is reasonable for me to ask the government: do these students really need a brand new building when the majority of their week will be spent in employment with their employer? When they are not with their employer, they will be at the local TAFE college doing their apprenticeship training. By 2009, it is anticipated that enrolments will reach 315 students, and that will be the maximum. During that period we will have spent $19.6 million of taxpayer funds. If you work that out on a per capita basis-divide $19.6 million by 315 students-you have got to ask whether that investment is really justified. That raises the question that numerous people have referred to: why have we gone to the extent of duplicating the existing TAFE system which has for decades provided outstanding vocational training, particularly for young apprentices? I also ask: could the skills crisis in the Illawarra have been addressed in a more costeffective manner? I believe it could have been. I chair a committee called the Illawarra and Shoalhaven Apprenticeship Program. Over the past several years we have managed to place 250 unemployed kids into apprenticeships. All we have ever asked of this government is an ongoing commitment of about $100,000 a year to make that project ongoing and viable. Just think about it. Over the last couple of years, at a cost of something less than a quarter of a million dollars from the federal government, 250 young unis employed people in the Illawarra have been placed in apprenticeships and yet, at best, we are going to have 315 students coming out of our local Australian technical college-with a brand new building-and we are going to spend $19.6 million on that program. Not one question has been asked about whether that is a wise investment of taxpayer funds. But every time we go to the government to get an ongoing commitment of $100,000 a year to employ a project coordinator to continue to place young people into apprenticeships, we cannot get any firm commitments from this government. I think that is unjust and inequitable. I ask again: is this expenditure a wise investment of the funds bequeathed from the taxpayers to government and is it good public policy? There is no doubt in my mind-and it was pretty obvious when the former minister who had responsibility for this program ended up losing his portfolio in the last reshuffle-that the Prime Minister also came to the same judgement that many people in the community have, and that is that the program has been bungled. We are told now, according to a recent headline in one of the national newspapers, ‘ Mr Fix-it has the tools to restore colleges.' We now have a new minister, and he points out in this article that one of his first tasks will be ‘getting the technical colleges program back on track'. I wish him all the best, because the government has raised expectations and it is failing to deliver. My views about this issue are confirmed by people who know even better than I do what happens in TAFE and the vocational system. Martin Riordan, the Executive Director of TAFE Directors Australia, said recently, ‘We think it's important to reassess the Australian technical colleges because, despite the best intentions in the world, they are a failed model.' Mr Riordan wants the Commonwealth to review the progress of the technical colleges program at the COAG meeting in April. I want to put a number of questions to the minister, and I do so in all sincerity, because I think the time has come for a serious reexamination of this program. I ask: is the expenditure of $456.2 million on 25 colleges that will train a maximum of 7,500 students, who will not graduate until at least 2010, good public policy and a sound investment? Could this investment have produced better outcomes in dealing with skills shortages, and in a shorter time frame, through the existing school and TAFE programs and interface? What programs does the government have in place to deal with the shortages that exist right now-estimated at around 100,000 in terms of the needs of skilled labour? Of course, I want to know when I am going to get an answer to a very modest request for an ongoing commitment of $100,000 a year to ensure that young unemployed people in the Illawarra region continue to have access to apprenticeships. I do not think that is too much to ask when we have in our region a youth unemployment rate of 40 per cent-among the highest in the nation. We have had a successful program working on the ground. We are not asking for $19.6 million, much of which is going to creating a brand new building that is not really required; but we are asking for some contribution to an innovative local program. Investment in vocational education and apprenticeship training is an issue of serious national importance, as is the crisis in the availability of skilled labour. The electorate is tired of quick political fixes which are based on spin rather than on substance. I think there are serious deficiencies in the Australian technical college model. My views are confirmed by the directors of the TAFE institutes throughout Australia, and I think that the matters that I have raised today warrant serious consideration at the highest levels of government.",79
36,Mr SLIPPER,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I will only be addressing the House for a very short amount of time with respect to the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. I was somewhat disappointed by the honourable member for Throsby in the way she condemned the Illawarra Australian Technical College. If she does not want this facility in her electorate then I would be happy to have it transferred to the Sunshine Coast, which was a serious omission from the first 25 technical colleges announced around Australia. If Labor members do not want the technical colleges which have been allocated to them then I am quite sure that coalition members will be very keen to have young people in their electorates given the additional opportunities which will obviously flow from the establishment of these colleges. This, of course, was an initiative announced by the Prime Minister in his policy speech prior to the 2004 federal election. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the infrastructure required to help develop a future workforce with the necessary skills required by Australian industry is available. All of us receive many complaints from employers who spend an inordinate amount of money advertising with a view to obtaining people who are able to be worthwhile employees and earn an income for their families but, in doing so, make a contribution towards the growth and success of a certain industry. There is no doubt that in Australia one of the major problems we have in 2007 is the skills shortage. This was the reason that the Austramore, lian technical colleges were announced by the Prime Minister prior to the last election. The Australian government is well underway with the development of 25 technical colleges around Australia. The majority of these already have finalised funding agreements right through until 2009 with the Australian government. This will ensure that their operations can continue at least until that period. It is expected that some 21 colleges will be operating by the end of this year. A college is to be established at North Brisbane, and it is anticipated that it will open in 2007. While it was the intention that the North Brisbane college would service the Sunshine Coast-and no doubt it will to a certain extent-given that the road system between the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane is not quite what should be, it becomes in my view a matter of pressing urgency that the Australian government should look at an Australian technical college for the region. If the government is looking at expanding the number of Australian technical colleges, it should consider that the Sunshine Coast is the 12th largest urban conurbation in Australia and perhaps the fastest growing area in the country. These colleges, despite criticism in the contribution made by the member for Throsby, are wonderful institutions that will make a big difference for young people who are looking to secure trade qualifications. These institutions will also make a substantial contribution to the success of Australian industry and to the growth of our economy because they will be able to turn out qualified people who will be able to help businesses grow and boost their local economies. Despite the criticism directed towards the Australian technical colleges, I think they are a wonderful thing for Australia and we need not fewer, of them. It is quite wrong to criticise the former minister, as the member for Throsby did when she spoke a little while ago. The bill currently being debated amends the funding amounts available to these colleges between the years 2006 and 2009 from the $343.6 million allocated to $456.2 million. This necessary increase in the amount of funding available will help these colleges achieve their goals. The Australian technical colleges are successful and popular, and this funding increase reflects this success. In fact, the support for the colleges has been so strong that a number are now opening earlier than initially envisaged. These colleges are unique and sensible in that they allow students to begin their studies towards gaining a trade qualification while they are still at school. This means that they are on the road to getting real qualifications earlier than would have been the case in the past, which in turn means that they will complete their training earlier. that meets both the needs of students and the requirements of the country. Over time the presence of these ATCs will mean businesses that require electricians, plumbers, carpenters and workers with other related skills will have a greater supply of such workers, and eventually some 7,500 work-ready young people annually will emerge from the colleges. Some 2,000 young people will already be enrolled in the colleges by later These institutions will make certain that students are taught the latest methods using the latest equipment. These young men and women will emerge as well-trained individuals with the types of skills required by contemporary business owners. In what is a sensible facet of the colleges, they are tied closely to the local communities in which they are located. Instead of having operational decisions made from a remote head office, the local boards that manage each of the colleges are able to make managerial decisions that ensure that the institution meets the specific needs of that region. This is a sensible move because the skills needs of one region will be quite different from the skills needs of other regions. By addressing the specific needs of each area, the network of colleges will address the overall skills needs of the nation. This bill will make sure that these colleges have the necessary financial backing from the government to enable these goals to be met. This bill outlines the additional funds that will be disbursed in the following amounts over the following years: 2006-07, $27.848 million; 2007-08, $42.628 million; 2008-09, $32.647 million; and 2009-10, $9.509 million. These ATCs will provide students with viable career paths into worthwhile employment. Trade qualifications are rewarding, worthwhile having and provide a potentially lucrative alternative to a univerIt is a system sity degree. The only plea I make to the government is that an Australian technical college be established on the Sunshine Coast. If Labor members who are quick to stand in the chamber and criticise their local Australian technical college are prepared to pass that college onto other regions, I am sure those regions would welcome the establishment of a college. The former minister said he would like one, and I this year. hope he gets one as well.",83
37,Mr SNOWDON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,I am pleased to be able to speak to the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 and will elaborate on the points I would like to make after question time.,85
38,The SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I thank the member for Lingiari. Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Climate Change",85
39,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall his Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources saying just six months ago, ‘I am a sceptic of the connection between emissions and climate change?' Does the Prime Minister support this statement?",85
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I do recall that, and I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the correction I made to the answer I gave yesterday. I acknowledge again to this House that I mistook the question asked yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. I wrongly thought-and I do not mind saying I am wrong when I am wrong, and I have no grounds for complaining about him-he was asking me about the connection between drought and climate change, where I do believe the jury is out. I have to say that I think the evidence of the connection to which he referred is very strong. That is my view, that is what I said yesterday and I repeat it today. Climate Change",85
41,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What is the purpose of the issues paper on emissions trading released earlier today?,86
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. Can I say very directly that the purpose of this paper is to promote an intelligent debate on the issues of what form an international emissions trading system might take, how that would impact on Australia, what form a national emissions trading system in this country might take and the circumstances in which it might be introduced. I want to make it clear that the formation of this group, which brings together senior members of the federal bureaucracy as well as senior business figures, is a very intelligent and sensible way of trying to get the right outcome in relation to the environment. In joining the business community and the government, I have very much had in mind the dictum of the member for Batman, whom I find a ceaseless source of encouragement and inspiration on this subject, when he said: It's time to abandon the political correctness poused by the green movement. Let's be real: without getting business on board we cannot achieve anything. I happen to agree with that. I think the most intelligent way of looking at an emissions trading system either here or internationally is in fact to join the business community to the process, and that is exactly what we have done. I do make it clear again that we have no intention of introducing an emissions trading scheme which damages Australia's international competitiveness. We are not going to sacrifice the jobs of coalminers in pursuit of some kind of knee-jerk reaction. We need a measured, sensible, consistent and intelligent reaction to the problem of climate change. Of course, in determining whether a national system might cause damage to our international competitiveness, we must necessarily pay regard to the responses of other nations to the issue of emissions trading. I think all members of the House would recognise that the people on this group do represent those business interests that would be very directly affected by the introduction of an emissions trading system. I am very grateful to those people for joining it, and I commend the issues paper to all members who are interested in a measured response that protects the jobs of Australians and looks after the interests of the Australian economy. Climate Change",86
43,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister and refers to his answer to the previous question. Did the Prime Minister receive government reports on emissions trading in March 1999, June 1999, October 1999 and December 1999? Did the government say no to each of these reports and then disband the emissions trading team in the Australian Greenhouse Ofesfice? Given that the Prime Minister has ignored all the climate change warning bells in the past, why should Australians believe him on climate change for the future?",86
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reason why I believe the Australian people will believe me is that I have a track record of putting the jobs of Australians ahead of anything else, and that is what I will continue to do. Quite frankly, I wonder at the view taken by many on the other side-not all; not the member for Batman or the member for Hunter, who also has a very distinguished record in relation to these matters. The member for Hunter has been astute enough to point out that if you introduce a national emissions trading system, you have to abandon the MRETs. I wonder if that is a view shared by the member for Kingsford Smith. I wonder if it is a view shared by the Leader of the Opposition. Back when the energy white paper was introduced, we looked at whether we would increase the MRETs. We decided against that because we thought it was better to invest in low emission technology. The investment in that low emission technology has led not only to an investment in clean coal technology but also to an investment near Mildura, Victoria, which represents the largest investment in solar energy anywhere in the world, and that is a product of the policies this government. I can say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will put the jobs of Australians ahead of ideology in responding to this issue. NA",86
45,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Honourable Ahmad Shabery bin Cheek, the Malaysian Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Housing Market",87
46,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer update the House on developments in the housing credit markets? What are the implications for economic policy?,87
47,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. The Australian property market, which showed substantial growth in the early part of this decade, has shown considerable moderation in recent years, with the exception of Perth and, to some degree, Darwin. The 12month change in the Sydney property market, according to Australian Property Monitors, was a 0.5 per cent increase, in Melbourne a 3.1 per cent increase, in Hobartwhich I know the member for Braddon would be interested in: southern Tasmania, not northern Tasmania-a 6.6 per cent increase, and overall in Australia quite a considerable slowdown in the growth we saw in the early part of the decade. The exception to that is Perth, which showed a 31 per cent increase in average prices over the 12 months, making Perth the second most expensive city in Australia. In addition to the moderation in the propof erty market we have also seen a moderation in credit markets, with housing credit increasing one per cent in December to be 14½ per cent over the year. Taken together with the adjustments as a result of fruit and petrol prices, we saw a lowering of the consumer price index in the December quarter, with the underlying measures around about 0.5 per cent for the quarter or two per cent for the year. The good news is that the consumer price index seems to have ticked down a bit, and that is good news for stability in interest rates. Interest rates were left unchanged at yesterday's Reserve Bank board meeting in recognition that moderation in the property market, in the credit market and in the consumer price index seems to have moderated to some degree the inflationary build-up that we saw in the latter part of last year. If the Australian economy can continue to grow, with unemployment at a 30-year low of 4.6 per cent and inflation moderate, that will be a very good interest rate outlook for homebuyers and for business. To have a two to three per cent inflation rate in an economy where we have nearly full employment, at 4.6 per cent, is something that we probably would not have dreamed of 10, 20 or 25 years ago. Still, the task is to ensure that economic management is consistent with growing the economy, finding job opportunities for young Australians and keeping inflation low in a stable interest rate climate. is what this government is committed to doing. Climate Change",87
48,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again to the Prime Minister is on climate change. Did the Prime Minister actually is say on Lateline two days ago that a four to six degree temperature rise would ‘be less comfortable for some than it is now'? Given that CSIRO states that a three degree rise will result in the decimation of the Great Barrier Reef and the dengue fever transmission zone reaching Brisbane and possibly Sydney, what exactly did you mean when you said that Australians would be less comfortable?",88
49,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! In calling the Prime Minister, I would ask the Leader of the Opposition not to use the word ‘you'.",88
50,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps when addressing the Leader of the Opposition I should use different language. Let me simply say again what was the substance of my comments on the Lateline program the other night-that is, this government did recognise that climate change represented a challenge, but I also made it clear that, in responding to it, we did not intend to embrace knee-jerk reactions that are going to damage the Australian economy. At the end of the day, the first responsibility of this government is to secure the welfare of the Australian people in all their various dimensions. One of those dimensions is to make sure that our public policy responses on all sorts of issues do not damage the job security of Australians and do not damage the international competitiveness of this country. In our responses to the challenge of climate change we do not intend to embrace every gloomy prediction about the future of the planet. We intend to respond in a measured way, but we intend to respond in a way that does not damage the Australian economy or destroy the jobs of hard working That people such as Australian coalminers. Water",88
51,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House the importance of infrastructure investment in my Riverina electorate and to regional economies across Australia? What measures is the government planning to increase jobs and prosperity by securing our water supplies?,88
52,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I recognise her very keen interest in infrastructure investment across regional Australia and particularly in her electorate in the Riverina. I might add that she has been a great supporter of more action in terms of securing Australia's water supplies, particularly for industry and the irrigators in the Riverina. The recently announced government package to deal with the challenges of managing our water better in Australia is due in no small part to a lot of the work that has been done by the member for Riverina. I certainly acknowledge her for that. It goes without saying that water is the lifeblood of regional Australia. Irrigated agricultural production in Australia is a very significant contributor to regional economies and our exports, with $9 billion worth of agricultural produce produced in irrigation areas. That is 25 per cent of agricultural production produced in irrigation areas on one per cent of the agricultural land in Australia. It is very important that we recognise the significance of irrigated agriculture in the overall Australian economy. Most importantly, we need to recognise the critical role it plays in those regional communities in which it exists. For too long we have tended to take too much for granted the management of the water systems and what that delivers in terms of wealth to our regional communities. I know that the member for Riverina recognises the significant nature of the announcement that the government has madea $10 billion announcement-to invest in the water systems of Australia to secure that sustainability for those communities, some of which the member for Riverina represents. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in securing those water supplies for those areas. It is not just about the industry in those areas; it is about the communities that survive in those local economies. It is terribly important that we recognise the significance of this. We have seen the debate that has taken place in and the commentary coming back from some of the states-some of it positive; some of it not so positive. But this is an issue that we must look at in the interests of the nation. This proposal-a $10 billion proposal-can save 3,600 gigalitres of water. That is almost six times the volume of Sydney Harbour. That can be saved without one more drop of rain falling. That is the smart aspect of this package that we have put forward. We ask all the stakeholders involved to work with the government to achieve those savings. We have said that 50 per cent of those savings will go back to industry-go back to those regional economies. That is a significant gesture of our faith in the economic worth of those economies to the national economy and to their local communities. It is also important to note that what we are proposing is going to build on a lot of the hard work that has already been done. We recognise the efficiency gains that have already been achieved in our irrigation systems and our irrigation areas across Australia, both on-farm and within the systems. We want to build on those savings. We want to add to them and aggregate greater savings in that area. We are smart enough to fix our river systems. We are smart enough to manage and balance the competing interests of industry and the environment and maintain the sustainability of industry in our regional economies. It is incredibly important. The majority of the feedback that we have received since the Prime Minister announced this policy a couple of weeks ago has generally been, ‘Thank goodness someone at last is prepared to do something of a practical nature to address this problem.' We certainly intend to go on and do that. The last point I want to make on this is that this is a $10 billion package and the only way that we can afford to do this is because of the good economic management that has been deployed in Australia over the last 10 years. We do not have any debt. We are running the economy much more efficiently and much more competitively and the nation can afford to do this. If we had had to borrow this money, as previous Labor governments would have had to do, it would have been a much more difficult decision. We should never forget that we can do these things in Australia today because of how well the economy is run and how well the economy is doing. Climate Change",88
53,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister now formally repudiate the industry minister's statement in which he said, ‘I am a sceptic of the connection between emissions and climate change'?",89
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I will not formally repudiate it. People make different statements about different things over a period of time. I seem to remember the Leader of the Opposition a little under two years ago saying that he was not experienced enough to be the leader of the Labor Party. He now thinks that he is experienced enough to be Prime Minister. Economy",89
55,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Given the strength of the Australian economy, would the Treasurer update the House on Australia's private sector wealth and the level of growth in the last year?",90
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. On Friday of last week, the Treasury released their annual estimates of net private sector wealth for the year up until 30 June 2006. It showed that the market value of Australia's net private sector wealth grew by 19 per cent over the course of that last full financial year. Although a main influence on wealth is family dwellings, they were not the largest contributor to this rise because of the moderation I talked of earlier to the House. The main influence was the increase in business assets, which has coincided with the Australian Stock Exchange moving to the highest levels ever recorded in its history. Millions of Australians are sharing in that wealth, either directly or through their superannuation funds. Australia's net private sector wealth in nominal terms now stands at around $7.4 trillion dollars, or more than seven times our annual GDP. This is a consequence of the fact that more Australians are in work than ever before, their wages are higher than ever before, their investments in savingsparticularly through superannuation-are higher than ever before and Australian business is more profitable than it has ever been. The Leader of the Opposition, who has no experience of economic policy other than as a staffer in a state government, which is his main claim to economic experience, has gone so far as to try and describe the Australian economy as a-and this is a word that I am not familiar with; it sounds like a pharmaceutical of some kind or another‘brutopia', something that the minister for health could put on the PBS list, I think, and subsidise. He says that brutopia is ‘economic neo-liberalism' with ‘unrestrained market capitalism' sweeping all before it. Brutopia-also available at health shops near you as an alternative or complementary medicine! Mr Tanner-Otherwise known as Work Choices.",90

We are now funding unfunded superannuation liabilities, which were never touched by any other government in Australian history. There have been two million jobs created since this government came to power. There is $7.4 trillion of private sector wealth. And the Leader of the Opposition calls that ‘brutopia'.

I refer to the minister's comments on 3 February: There's a lot of very exaggerated claims ... and because of the geology or the [topography] of the east coast ... much of that is adequately elevated to deal with a one-metre sea rise.

72,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I went on to say that the response to rising sea levels will require both planning measures and engineering measures. It can be adapted to in some cases. There are a range of measures that will be used to deal with rising sea levels-and, of course, as I mentioned in the AM interview, the consequent storm surges, because it is not simply a question of the sea level rising but of the consequent storm surges. This is the strategy of the opposition: they are seeking to create a massive scare campaign. We are talking about, at the higher limit, a sea-level rise of 58 centimetres over 100 years; at the lower level, 18 centimetres. In the course of the last century, we have had a rise in sea level in Australia of 20 centimetres already, so rising sea levels are not new. We have dealt with them. We have adapted to them. We are working closely with state and local government. Indeed, the National Resource Management Ministerial Council in November 2006 agreed to fund a first-pass national coast vulnerability assessment to be coordinated by the Australian Greenhouse Office. The Australian Greenhouse Office, the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO have published extensively on rising sea level issues. There is an immense amount of literature out there on it. The techniques for dealing with it are very well known. Local councils up and down the coast-on the east coast, the west coast, in South Australia and all around Australia-are aware of this issue and adopting planning measures to handle it. Those measures will no doubt be recalibrated and adjusted as better science becomes available. But it is no answer to the challenge of climate change to be frightening the Australian people-to be out trying to panic the Australian people-with threats of a massive Al Gore style, The Day after Tomorrow style inundation. That is a scare campaign. It is calculated to do enormous damage to public confidence. I would say this to the member for Kingsford Smith: I do not believe that the constituents of the electorate of Griffith, or the constituents of any other electorate on Australia's coast, will thank him for this sort of panicked scare campaign. What the member for Kingsford Smith has left out of his question is: what do you do about it? We are aware of it. We are dealing with it. Labor is full of scare",91

75,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on developments regarding the military coup in Fiji?,92
76,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bowman for his question and for his interest in this issue. I think the House is well aware that the Australian government has been amongst those which have strongly condemned the Fijian military's unconstitutional coup d'etat. As time has gone on since the coup, we have become increasingly concerned about the way the Fijian military force is exercising power without any real restraint and without accountability. Honourable members will be aware that there have been reports in recent times of a number of human rights abuses in Fiji by members of the Fijian military force. In the government's view, there have been endeavours by the Fijian military to suppress any form of dissent from or disagreement with the actions that the military have taken. They have done that through extreme intimidation of critics. There have been reports that, in some cases, critics and opponents of what has happened have been taken down to the Queen Elizabeth barracks in Suva and beaten and assaulted. Not surprisingly, many ordinary Fijians are dismayed that the military has not honoured a pledge that it originally made to uphold human rights, the rule of law and, for that matter, freedom of the press. That simply has not happened. The Australian government are disturbed by reports we have heard that the Fijian military is continuing to try to divide the community by encouraging Fijians to spy on each other and report any private criticisms-which must, presumably, be manifold-of the military administration. Furthermore, we are very concerned that the rule of law is being undermined through compromising the independence both of the judiciary and of the police force. On 1 February the Fijian military disbanded the tactical response division of the Fijian police. In December the Chief Justice of Fiji was summarily dismissed by the military. There is no doubt that there is a great deal of opposition in Fiji to what the military have done and to their heavy-handed tactics since the takeover. There is also no doubt that the military commander, Commodore Bainimarama, underestimated the degree of public opposition to his actions and underestimated in particular the degree of opposition that there would be amongst non-government organisations. In conclusion, an eminent persons group-which was established at a Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers meeting which I attended in Sydney during December-has now visited Fiji. It did so last week. The group contains Peter Cosgrove, a former Chief of the Defence Force in Australia, and a number of other eminent figures from the Pacific region. Its report is in the process being concluded, and we look forward to seeing that report. I hope that, before too long, a meeting of Pacific Islands Forum foreign ministers will be able to consider that report and hear from the eminent persons group. That will help the region, not just Australia and New Zealand but the region as a whole, chart a way forward in terms of dealing with what has happened in Fiji. I make no apology for raising today the question of human rights abuses in Fiji. It is a serious problem and a serious matter. When the military take over control of a country in this way, which was completely illegal-and of course we in Australia and those in New Zealand, around the Pacific and elsewhere regard it as an unacceptable way to behavethe problem is seriously compounded by the human rights abuses that ensue. Climate Change",92
77,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and follows on from his answer to a previous question. I refer to a recent speech by the British Foreign Secretary on climate change where she said: One study suggests that a sea-level rise of just 50 centimetres ... will displace two million people from the Nile Delta. A one metre rise will displace 25 million in Bangladesh. Minister, what implications will a one-metre sea level rise have for Australia and for our neighbours in the South Pacific?",93
78,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The rule of thumb with sea level rises, and this is very much a general rule of thumb-it is based on Dutch work; they know quite a bit about sea level rises, as you can imagine, Mr SPEAKER - is that sandy beaches can retreat 50 or even 100 times as much as the sea level rise due to erosion. So if the sea level rises as estimated in the fourth assessment report, the degree of erosion on sandy beaches in Australiaof absent any other engineering action: groynes, artificial reefs or anything like that-could be somewhere between nine and 50 metres. That plainly has consequences for communities that are built on low-lying sandy soil. Obviously, portions of south-east Queensland and Cairns have been identified as being at risk. The measures that will be deployed if or when those sea rises become apparent vary enormously from place to place. As the Leader of the Opposition would know from his very careful study of the fourth assessment report, the sea level rise is not even forecast in the fourth assessment report to be uniform around the world. In fact, there are some parts of the world where the sea level may actually fall. So it is a very variable proposition. And, of course, the land can change too. If you get more precipitation, you get more sediments being washed down, and that can offset or even exceed the rise in sea level. That is the context in terms of Australia. Globally, of course, it is an enormous problem. It is particularly problematic in places like China, Egypt and Bangladesh, where there are large cities and populations that built in river deltas on sediments which have a tendency to sink anyway. They will be particularly prejudiced, and the dangers are enormous. We are all familiar with New Orleans, which is a city that is largely below sea level. Jakarta, which has recently been flooded, is 40 per cent below sea level. It is plainly a big issue globally but, in Australia, it is something that everybody, every level of government, is well aware of. The Australian government is well aware of this issue. We are working closely with the states and local government through our scientific agencies to make sure that we have the science and that we take the practical measures-not the panic, scare slogans-to deal with the consequences of a further rise in sea level. I repeat: in the last century, experienced a 20 centimetre rise in sea level. Rises in sea level are not new. We have adapted to them in the past and we will adapt to them in the future. Climate Change",93
79,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. Would the minister advise the House of the global importance of clean coal technology in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially in rapidly developing economies such as China?",94
80,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question. China is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Only a few years ago it was forecast to overtake the United States by 2020. China's growth has been so rapid that it is expected to overtake the United States by 2010 or even 2009. So it is growing extraordinarily quickly in terms of its greenhouse gas emissions. That is because China is heavily dependent on coal. It consumes more coal than Australia does. In 2005 we consumed are about 124 million tonnes of coal; the Chinese consumed over 2,200 million tonnes of coal. So our coal consumption represents a little over five per cent of China's consumption. China is commissioning the equivalent of a 1,000 megawatt coal-fired power station every five days. Its additional growth in emissions equals Australia's annual total every eight months. That gives an idea of the scale of the problem. Only this morning, both in the press and on the radio, Mr Qin Dahe, the Chinese scientist who was co-chair of the United Nations scientific panel that produced the fourth assessment report, stressed China's dependence on coal. He said that it was 69 per cent dependent on coal for its energy needs and that that would continue. He also stressed the we need for technology solutions to clean up its coal. Australia is leading the world in clean coal technology-be it through the Low Emissions Technology Development Fund, where over $200 million of projects that are relevant to clean coal technology have been announced; through the AP6; or through the Australia-China Joint Coordination Group on Clean Coal Technology, which the Prime Minister announced in January. Across a wide range of programs, Australia is, and has been for many years, working actively to develop clean coal technology-practical measures, demonstration projects, scientific research. This is often correctly presented as being in our national interest as a great coalexporting nation-it is a vital part of protectwas informed? ing our coal industry, as the head of the CFMEU said only this morning-but it is also in the world's interest. We recognise that, no matter how much we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, the critical reductions have to take place in the countries that are the largest emitters. China is saying today-as it has said again and again-that, in order to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, it needs affordable technologies that enable to clean up its coal. Australia is working to provide that technology. It may be that, in the years ahead, the greatest contribution we will make to the reduction of greenhouse gases is giving the Chinese, the Indians and the other coal dependent countries of the world the means to clean up their coal-fired power stations and deliver their people the energy they need, but in a manner which does not exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.

82,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer confirm that the Department of the Environment and Water Resources and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry were advised of the intention to spend $10 billion on the National Water Plan on 8 January-10 days before the Treasury was advised of the proposal and 12 days before the Department of Finance and Administration",95

84,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House of recent additions to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that will improve the it health of older Australians, in particular those with osteoporosis?",95
85,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Canning for his question. I know that he takes a very personal interest in this. It is very important for thousands of people in his electorate, as it is for millions of peoplesome two million people-around Australia who suffer from osteoporosis. The PBS is one of the three pillars of Medicare. Thanks to the PBS, Australians gain affordable access to life-saving and life-enhancing drugs. Thanks to the Howard government, more Australians have more access to more medicines than ever before. Since August there have been new and expanded PBS listings. Herceptin, for early stage breast cancer; Lantus, for insulindependent diabetics; and statins, for people with cardiac risk factors, have added some $1 billion to our PBS investment over the forward estimates period. As well, there is now good news for people over 70 with osteoporosis. From April, up to 73,000 new patients each year will gain access to osteoporosis drugs such as Fosamax under the PBS, before they have fractures-because prevention is better than cure. Along with the associated bone mineral density testing, this latest measure will add some $225 million to our health investment over the forward estimates period. While this government gets on with the job of making a good system even better, members opposite just cannot let go of something called Medicare Gold. The new shadow minister was asked on 3AW, just before Christmas: But Medicare Gold has gone, hasn't it? It's dead, buried, never to be resurrected. Listen to what she said on the record, on 3AW. The member for Gellibrand said: Well, I think that there are some components of itthat is, of Medicare Goldthat are really important for us to consider in any rethink about the health system. We know that Barry Jones called Medicare Gold a turkey. I ask the member for Gellibrand: which bits of that old stuffed bird does she want to serve now? I say to the Leader of the Opposition: inexperience is no excuse. If you do not have a health policy, you have no credibility as a candidate to lead this country. NA",95
86,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon a group of young people who are winners of the Heywire competition, an ABC Radio award scheme for regional and rural youth. On behalf of the House, I extend to them a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Renewable Energy",96
87,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of a confidential cooperative research centre report by five CSIRO scientists which reportedly states that solar thermal technology has the capacity to produce Australia's entire current electricity demand and could be cost competitive with coal within seven years? Given that the Newcastle company Solar Heat and Power has been forced to move to the US to obtain development support for this technology, can the PM explain whether this report will be placed on the energy options table? Don't its findings that solar thermal is poised to play a significant role in baseload generation in Australia contradict your assertions that clean coal and nuclear are our only feasible baseload energy options?",96
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know the detail of that particular study, off the top of my head, but I am perfectly happy to have it examined and put into the mix. I have to say to the honourable member that the view that solar can produce baseload power would be at odds with the overwhelming bulk of scientific opinion. Workplace Relations",96
89,Dr WASHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister advise the House what impact the removal of unfair dismissal laws has had on small business? Are there any alternative policies?,96
90,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moore for his question and note that unemployment in his electorate is now 2.2 per cent. I say that not just because it is a good figure; I say it because it is great that people have jobs. The coalition believe that the best welfare that you can provide to the nation is the opportunity for members of the family to have a job. We believe that is vitally important. When Mr Keating, as Labor Prime Minister, and the then head of the ACTU did a deal in 1993 to introduce the unfair dismissal laws, they had no regard at allMr Martin Ferguson interjecting",96
91,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Were you involved? He was!,96
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The sheepish Martin!,96
93,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He is going red. I think he was involved. They had no regard at all for the impact on jobs. The coalition warned of the impact that it would have on small business and the creation of jobs-and it was not just the coalition. A 1996 Morgan & Banks survey showed that one-quarter of all small businesses were affected by Labor's laws and 14 per cent of small businesses had hired fewer staff as a result of the unfair dismissal laws. In 1998 the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA, estimated that 50,000 jobs would be created in Australia if we could abolish the unfair dismissal laws as they applied to small business. In 2002 a Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research study estimated that the laws introduced by the Labor Party and the ACTU cost a staggering $1.3 billion. It predicted that if we removed the laws it would create 77,000 jobs. There was an ACCI survey in 2003, and so on. Mr Speaker, you might ask: since we introduced the Work Choices laws in March last year, what has been the impact? In the March to December period of 2005, 90,000 jobs were created. In the same period in 2006, after we removed the unfair dismissal laws in their application to small business, 245,000 jobs were created. So, from having 90,000 jobs before then, when the Labor Party and ACTU unfair dismissal laws were in place, in the same period in 2006 it went up to 245,000 jobs. Certainly, not every one of those jobs can be credited to the abolition of unfair dismissal laws. But, fundamentally, we are about putting in place the infrastructure, putting in place the laws, that create well-paid jobs that give people careers in the modern Australian workplace. Not only do the Labor Party and the ACTU have an agenda to rip up those laws, but current ACTU policy says that the new laws that the Labor Party will have in a Rudd Labor government will go further, to cover casuals at all levels and a whole range of other workers who previously did not have the unfair dismissal laws. We are about job creation. We are about well-paid jobs. The Labor Party, in partnership with the ACTU, is about destroying jobs, particularly in small business. Interest Rates",97
94,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of new mortgage repossession figures from the Supreme Court of New South Wales for 2006 which show mortgage repossession actions have increased by 75 per cent since 2004? Does the Prime Minister accept that the four back-to-back interest rate rises since 2004 have contributed to this massive 75 per cent increase?,97
95,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Facts are facts. If there has been an increase in the repossession rate then it has occurred. But the Reserve Bank's September 2006 financial stability review noted that the housing loan arrears rate has increased from a low of 0.17 per cent of loans outstanding in June 2004 to 0.3 per cent now. It stands to reason that, if at a time of very low interest rates people borrow a great deal more than they did during high interest rates, some people will borrow more than they can afford. It also stands to reason that if you have a state government that imposes penal rates of exit tax",97

Education",97
99,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister outline measures to improve school governance and teacher quality? How might this improve academic standards, including for schools in Cook?",98
100,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cook for his question and I particularly thank him for organising a meeting with school principals from schools in his electorate last year so that we could talk about sues of concern to them. Teachers are a precious national resource. After parents, teachers are the single most important determinants in a child's educational outcomes. That is why we must focus on quality teaching. For schools to be able to provide quality education, principals must have greater autonomy. Principals must have greater management control over staffing and over budgets. Principals in our schools must have the power to hire and fire staff according to performance, like any other head of an organisation or enterprise has. How else can a school principal guarantee a quality education, if they have no control over the quality of the staff? What we must do in order to attract and retain the very best, high-quality teachers to provide more flexible and more attractive workplace conditions, and that includes offering rewards and incentives based on performance. Today I announced that I will be taking to the next state education ministers' meeting a number of proposals relating to greater principal autonomy and ensuring that we have an element of performance based pay for teachers. We must attract, retain and reward the very best teachers. They are professionals. Let us treat them as professionals. I note that the new Labor education spokesman, early on, ventured into this issue of teacher performance. He made a few noises about teacher performance. But, immediately, he was hauled back into line by the Australian Education Union, who even threatened to withhold campaign funding from the Labor Party unless they toed the line. Federally, Labor will never be able to deliver on education reforms because they are captives of the all-powerful teachers' unions.",98

119,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for his question and acknowledge the wonderful work he has done to help get the Australian Technical College, Northern Tasmania off the ground. This government has been working to a multibillion dollar plan to tackle labour and skills shortages. It is a plan that has already made a major contribution. It is an important part of the continuing success of our economy, and it is a success already. I will give you some examples. In 2006, four times as many young people started a bricklayers apprenticeship than in 1996. In 2006, nearly four times as many young people started a plasterer's apprenticeship than in 1996. The list goes on and on through dozens of trades. In fact, last year, in 2006, 142,000 people completed apprenticeships compared with a paltry 32,000 in 1996. Importantly, the government's plan, which has delivered so much already, is also a plan for the future because demand for skills will continue. It will continue because of the strength of the economy, amongst other issues-the year-on-year uninterrupted growth that we have had. The 30-year low in unemployment will continue to put significant demands on skills. So this plan for the future not only includes a raft of initiatives to give us the capacity to train more people but also, very importantly, is about elevating the status of technical training so that people can be justly proud to pursue a career in a trade. Elevating the status of technical training is necessary because Labor-those oppositehave spent more than 20 years telling parents that unless their children go onto a university education they have failed them.

The 25 technical colleges are an important initiative in, among other things, restoring the status technical training in Australia. Not only will 2,000 young people this year directly benefit, and 7,500 by 2009, but these Australian technical colleges will stand as a wonderful symbol in local communities of the importance of a technical career. The government has a plan to address skills shortages and keep the economy strong. Labor's plan is to hand the technical colleges back to the unions.",100

125,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"I was asked a question by the member for Calare about base power load generation and I expressed the view that I thought the bulk of scientific opinion was against the proposition he was putting. I would like to quote from a letter-and I am quite happy to table the letter; I think it has been made public already-that was written to me on 21 December 2006 by the Chief Scientist, Dr Jim Peacock. He says, amongst other things, in the letter: At present there are only two modes of power generation capable of base-load power production which can be operated without serious consequences for climate change emission. Fossil fuels will be used in Australia now and in the next several decades in power plants. These of power plants should be operated with minimum emissions and we have technologies to retrofit most existing power stations so that emissions are reduced. New power stations can be designed to operate with low emissions. He then goes on to say: Nuclear power stations are the other clean and mature mode of electricity generation. In the interests of balance in this debate, they are the words of Dr Jim Peacock, the Chief Scientist. Can I also point out to the House that the company referred to by the member for Calare in his question, Solar Heat and Power Pty Ltd, was successful in gaining a Renewable Energy Development Initiative grant of $3,254,000 in December of 2005. To date-and that was a few weeks ago-the government has paid $2.1 million, or 64 per cent, of the grant and the company has stated that it will retain the intellectual property developed so far and continue with Australian management.

Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992Report under section 34A for 2006. Debate (on motion by Mr Albanese) adjourned. NA Climate Change,101
137,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Kingsford Smith proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's decade long scepticism and inaction on climate change, placing at risk tralia's economic and environmental future. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",102
138,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Yesterday and today at question time the government was finally in the situation of being able to clarify to the Australian people whether or not it understood the implications of climate change. Today the government released an emissions trading scheme discussion paper of some nine pages. Opposition members-Nine pages!,102
139,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Leader of the Opposition is showing it to us now.,102
140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am sure the member for Kingsford Smith does not need any help.,102
141,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for the Environment and Heritage explained to us what China was doing to deal with its greenhouse gas emissions and made the argument, if I understand him correctly, that Australia's robust addressing of reducing greenhouse gas emissions needs to be seen in the light of the fact that China-a country much bigger than ours-actually produces more. I notice that the minister for the environment did not mention that China has a very significant mandatory renewable energy target, and it is true, as he said, that they are investing significantly in clean coal. But the final point that the minister for the environment did not make is that China is doing more than Australia. Interestingly, the electorate of Kingsford Smith, which I represent, includes the University of New South Wales, and that is where Dr Zhengrong Shi completed his PhD Ausin solar energy. His technology was clever and the future looked bright. After all, he was living in a country which receives more radiated solar energy than most other countries. But Dr Shi, unable to get support for his company in Australia, ended up taking his business to China. He is now China's thirdor fourth-richest man. He is not a climate change sceptic; nor is Dr David Mills, as the member for Calare identified in his question. Dr Mills is a world leader in solar research who, after 30 years of research and development in Australia, has to take parts of his company offshore to California because Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger‘Arnie'-has vowed to cut greenhouse emissions by a massive 80 per cent over the next 45 years. Arnie Schwarzenegger is not a climate change sceptic. As Dr Mills saidMr Turnbull-Did he speak to you?",102
142,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is the quote. He said: The Australian Federal Government refuses to put in place strict emissions targets, strict legislation to enforce those targets, and reliable long-term market valuations for carbon emissions avoided. We can find all of those things overseas That is the direct quote from Dr Mills. Mr Turnbull interjecting",102
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister is warned!,103
144,Mr GARRETT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is inaction, as identified in the subject of this MPI, by the Howard government. Australian business is being forced to go overseas to continue to produce greenhouse-good technologies. The mums and dads of Australia are realists. They know about climate change. They are educating themselves about its implications and they are feeling concerned and anxious about the future for their kids. And why wouldn't they, given the time lines and the scale of this issue? But they are not climate change sceptics. The Prime Minister and his government have had an uneasy and confused period in dealing with climate change. Their position has shifted significantly, but for the last 11 years one consistent theme has emerged from the Howard government: that is, climate change is not a real, present and future danger to the Australian way of life, to our economy, to our ecology and to our society. In the last week, with climate change awareness at an all-time high, we again heard some extraordinary assertions by the Prime Minister and his environment minister on this issue. Last Monday night, four days after the release of the fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the Prime Minister was asked, on ABC TV's Lateline program: What do you think living in Australia would be like by the end of this century for your own grandchildren if the average mean temperatures around the world do rise by somewhere between four and possibly more than six degrees Celsius? As we know, the Prime Minister answered by saying, ‘It would be less comfortable than it is now.' That is something of an understatement. A four to six degree increase in temperature is dismissed by the Prime Minister as potentially uncomfortable. That potential increase carries a burden on future generations to try to manage highly stressed ecosystems, with our natural icons under siege and with health, security and social implications of an order hitherto unseen. The Prime Minister went on to challenge the accuracy of the IPCC report by saying: I think it is very, very hard for us in 2007 to try, with that kind of mathematical accuracy-with great respect to the scientists-to sort of extrapolate what things might be like. The nub of the problem lies in the Prime Minister's own misconceptions about climate change and in his refusal to take responsibility for a decade of inaction by his government. This IPCC report was produced by 600 authors from 40 countries, including 42 scientists from Australia. There were 620 expert reviewers and 113 governments involved. The Prime Minister says that it is very hard for them to try to work out with some kind of mathematical accuracy to ‘sort of extrapolate what things might be like'? They have done exactly that-perhaps not with mathematical accuracy, but with enough accuracy to give prudent governments a clear identification of the nature of risk that lies at the heart of this climate change issue. This is an issue about managing risks, and this is where the policy approach of the Howard government is deficient. Let us quickly revisit what the report tells us. It tells us that, if there is business as usual, temperature increases are likely to be in the range of two to 4.5 degrees Celsius. It is very unlikely to be less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. We have already had an increase of 0.76 degrees up to now. It tells us that snow cover is projected to contract and that the thawing of the permafrost is expected to deepen. It tells us that it is very likely that hot extremes, heat waves and heavy rain events will continue to become more frequent. And it tells us that the number of tropical cyclones may decrease but, at the same time, their intensity will increase. It predicts more rainfall in high latitudes, with decreases in rainfall across subtropical regions by as much as 20 per cent. Importantly, the report also tells us that how we respond, and how quickly we respond, will determine how hot the planet gets. This report makes clear that ‘business as usual' will see climate change and global warming continue to build over time until the task of managing and mitigating against the impacts will be greater than anyone in this chamber can imagine. In the House yesterday, the Prime Minister again sought to dismiss the global threat posed by climate change by referring to the opposition as climate change purists and climate change fanatics. What an extraordinary assertion. When it comes to naming climate change purists, perhaps the Prime Minister should also include the Australian Medical Association, who have very great concerns about the impact climate change will have on the nation's health. He should include companies like Visy, Origin Energy, Westpac, BP and the Australian Insurance Group, who have been demanding that the Prime Minister address this issue with the seriousness it deserves in order to give them some security in their business arrangements as they go forward. The Prime Minister could also include the National Farmers Federation, who argue that climate change is a very real issue for their members. More worryingly, he should also consider including some of Australia's most eminent security analysts, like Dr Alan Dupont, who suggested that climate change is fast emerging as the security issue of the 21st century. But what is the government's response to their concerns and the concerns raised in numerous reports over the last 11 years? It is a discussion paper of nine pages on emissions trading. That is the substance of the response. The 2001 IPCC climate change report warned of temperature rises without precedent over the last 10,000 years. In 2003, the Australian government report Climate Change: An Australian guide to the science and potential impacts warned that temperatures could rise by two degrees and that rainfall in southern Australia could fall by 20 per cent by 2030. In 2005, the Australian government report Climate Change: Risk and vulnerability warned of direct threats to Australia from climate chance, including prolonged drought, a 20 per cent reduction in rainfall in southern Australia, increased high bushfire danger days and more extreme cyclones. Why did the government ignore all these reports? Why did the government ignore all these warnings? Those are the questions that the Australian people want answered, and those are the questions that the Prime Minister has to address. Finally, while the Prime Minister sneeringly dismisses the Kyoto protocol as totally ten minutes ago-as last year's fashionAustralian business continues to be locked out of $30 billion in carbon trading, and Australia is, once again, asked to leave the room when the real climate change negotiations start. Some of us in this chamber have spent a long time campaigning on issues like climate change, and we have watched and witnessed the scientific evidence accumulate which tells us that if we continue to increase the production of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, the likelihood of an ever increasingly-warm world will jeopardise our way of life and will certainly create an additional range of problems, obstacles, hurdles and challenges for our kids to deal with. I think it is really a question about duty care, because we owe a duty of care to the people who we serve in this place. The lawyers in the House, including members opposite, will recognise that the definition of of care and an understanding of duty of care involves consequences that can be foreseen. We now have the best scientific brains in the world telling us that we can foresee with some degree of certainty-in some instances with a 90 per cent degree of certainty-what the consequences will be. We need to exact a duty of care now, instantly, to recognise the scale of the threat that we face. No amount of dissembling, spinning or debating and no number of reports, recommendations and the usual business that goes on when we watch the Howard government in action will satisfy the Australian people that they are responding in a fair dinkum way to climate change. I have absolutely no doubt that this issue will preoccupy every member sitting in this House. I have absolutely no doubt that, unless you have a policy suite which recognises the need to urgently and immediately reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions now, the task will get harder and harder as we go forward. Labor are not climate change sceptics. We are not sceptical about climate change. We have looked at the science, we have taken note of the reports and we recognise the need to act. Labor will take action to protect Australian communities from the ravages of climate change and enable Australian businesses to maintain their competitive edge in the international arena. We will ratify the Kyoto protocol to give Australian businesses access to the world's carbon trading markets and allow them to compete on a level playing field. We will aim to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas pollution by 60 per cent by 2050 because the best minds in the world tell us of that that is what is needed to avert the worse excesses of climate change. We will build a robust renewable energy sector because that is what is needed to draw on our great natuduty ral inheritance of sunlight-and with a technology that is not 20 years away, expensive and with a raft of unsolved problems of radioactive waste, exposure to terrorism and management of nuclear proliferation. That is what a Rudd Labor government would do about climate change. It is about having the solutions and being willing to put them into place. The jury is in and the science is clear: the planet is heating. The time for action is now, and our children and our grandchildren deserve nothing less. The challenge for the Prime Minister and the challenge for the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources is to recognise that the policy suite that we have identified here has virtue and merit. Why debate the business of cuts? Every single person who looks at this issue with any degree of seriousness recognises that you have to cut greenhouse gas emissions. What better way to do it than to say you will and to establish a target and a time line in order to do that? Why have a paltry two per cent mandatory renewable energy target when renewables are one of the fastest-growing businesses in this world and we can build Australian businesses that produce and provide energy? Why not, as a matter of course, stand up and say, ‘Now that the Australian public is speaking to us about climate change in a way that says they understand the enormity of that issue it is time that the government listened'?",103
145,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Wentworth-Minister for the Environment and Water Resources) (3.28 pm)-This morning the member for Kingsford Smith was interviewed on the Today show. Karl Stefanovic said to him, ‘If we do everything that Labor is suggesting with regard to the environment and climate change, will that definitively stop global warming?' The member for Kingsford Smith replied, ‘Karl, it won't.' It will not! The Labor Party's policy on climate change is to impose a 60 per cent cut in emissions by 2050. That is the core part of their policy, other than ratifying the Kyoto protocol, which we all understand will not reduce Australian emissions to any extent because we are committed to and will meet our Kyoto target. The substance of their climate change policy is a 60 per cent cut in emissions by 2050. Three times yesterday the member for Kingsford Smith was asked what it would cost. Three times he could not say. At one point he said he did not know what ‘pay more' meant. The consumers of Australia, the industries of Australia-look at my friend the member for Throsby-and the workers of Australia know what ‘pay more' means: it means making industries uncompetitive and it means losing jobs. If Labor want to impose a 60 per cent cut in emissions by 2050 then they should at least do the Australian people the courtesy of telling them what it will cost. How can you responsibly embark on any measure of this scale without knowing what the cost is? You cannot. This demonstrates once again how unfit the Labor Party is for government, how reckless it is; how ideologically driven it is; how obsessed it is with symbols, slogans and saying things. It is as easy to proclaim your commitment to the environment as it is to proclaim your piety. We judge people's actions and their beliefs not by what they claim to say or what they plead but by what they do. How can we judge what they will do if they will not tell us what the consequences are? The Howard government has recognised for more than a decade the consequences of climate change and the risk it poses to Australia. I believe every single one of the reports-with the exception of the fourth assessment report, which, as the member for Kingsford Smith said, was contributed to by Australians-was actually published by the Australian government. They were published because of initiatives by the Australian government to create greater awareness and to engage the community, business and citizens in dealing with climate change. If they think that is not an important agenda, I would refer the honourable member for Kingsford Smith and those interested in these issues to the Stern report, which recommends as one of the key objectives the removal of barriers to behavioural change, stressing that it is important to foster a shared understanding of the nature of climate change. What has the Greenhouse Office done but that? What has all the work of the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology done but that? Again and again the facts have been put on the table, and they have been matched with action. Over $2 billion has been invested to tackle climate change, and that is just to tackle mitigation-not adaptation; I will come to that-and to ensure that we are on track to meet our 108 per cent emissions target under the Kyoto protocol. Five projects have been approved under the $500 and million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, including a large solar concentrator in regional Victoria, a $420 million project to which the fund is providing $75 million. There is a whole series of projects which, as I said in question time, are designed to promote and advance clean coal technology-technology without which the world will never be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The member for Kingsford Smith reminds me of a person who thinks that they do their bit for the environment by putting a bumper sticker on their car or exercising some personal saving or recycling activity in their own home: ‘Don't worry; I've done my bit for the water challenge. I've got a water tank.' Many of us have water tanks. It is all very commendable, and I commend everyone who has a water tank, but it is not going to fix the problem by itself. The member for Kingsford Smith's solution is to say Australia should impose on itself a massive reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which will have an enormous effect on the Australian economy, the extent of which he either does not know or will not tell. He knows, as we all do, that that self-inflicted restraint will have no effect at all on global warming unless it is matched by a similar reduction around the world. What will the member for Kingsford Smith do if massive reductions in emissions are imposed on Australia way beyond those of our competitors? What will he do when there are thousands of Australians out of work, when instead of adding two million jobs-as the Howard government has done-two million jobs are swept away and when the cost of energy intensive industries goes through the roof? What will he say when nothing changes, when nothing happens to climate, when it is still getting warmer and still getting drier? Will he say: console you, you poor, unemployed people. I console you from my pillar of virtue. I console you because you have done the right thing. We have sacrificed you in the interests of our ideology. You, your jobs and your livelihoods have been sacrificed, and, by the way, nothing has been achieved.' That is the Labor Party philosophy. Our approach is to mitigate greenhouse gases, to meet our international commitments and to work constructively internationally to ensure that we can achieve what we all know is the only answer to an effective reduction in greenhouse gases: a global agreement. That is the reality. It has to involve China, India and the United States. If we go it alone and clean up our own backyard, as I think the member for Kingsford Smith said the other day, that may be commendable and admirable, but it will have no impact unless it is matched by global action. We could pay a very heavy price and make a very heavy sacrifice indeed-a sacrifice on the altar of an ideology that has no interest in the livelihoods of Australian workers or in the Australian economy and is prepared to sacrifice the interests of Australia, the competitiveness of Australia and the jobs of Australians for nothing more than an ideological slogan. So intensely do the Labor Party hold this slogan dear that they are not prepared to accept any questions, any doubt; hence we have, as I said yesterday, the new heresy of scepticism. You cannot have a doubt; you cannot question anything; you cannot doubt anything; you have to be a total believer. It is as though we are returning to the Spanish Inquisition. I read that at one point the member for Kingsford Smith said the Prime Minister ‘had been' a sceptic for many years. Apparently, even if you change your mind that is not good enough; you will still be punished. Let us consider what some other leaders ‘I around the world are saying. I am not just quoting the Prime Minister here. Mr Tony Blair has said that it is: a completely unrealistic debate to say that you could have a climate change agreement that doesn't involve China and then America obviously, and of course India which is also a country of over a billion people ... He pointed to the limitations of the Kyoto protocol and said we have to build towards ‘a more realistic frameworkMr Garrett interjecting",105
146,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Kingsford Smith.,108
147,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"that gives us a real chance of being able to reduce emissions'. We need to look to the future now. He said: There will be no resolution without a clear, disciplined framework for action, with measurable outcomes. Mr Garrett interjecting",108
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Kingsford Smith is warned!,108
149,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And if it is doubted that Mr Stern is under any delusions of the kind that afflict the opposition, what did he say? ‘Every country in the world has to get involved,' he said on ABC radio on 3 November: ‘I don't think we have to insist on everything being done the same way all around the world. Even if we wanted to we could not do that successfully. Australia is good at technology. They've got wind, they've got coal and they've got uranium. There are so many ways in which Australia could bring so much to the table, we've got to get all countries involved.' That was the message: it is global engagement that will provide the reduction in emissions that we need. But the interesting part about the opposition is that they go on and on about climate change as though we are debating a theological issue: ‘Does he believe in climate change? Does he believe enough? Is he a purist? Is he a sceptic? Is a believer of whatever gradation?' And no doubt different punishments will be awarded by the inquisition run by the members for Griffith and Kingsford Smith, depending on the degree of doubts. No credit, apparently, will be given for conversions. But no mention is made of the key consequence of climate change to Australia, and that is water scarcity. And that, as I said yesterday, is a matter where John Howard has been prescient those are not my words; those are Paul Kelly's words. The Prime Minister has been prescient on the issue of water. He has provided $2 billion over five years to establish the Australian government water fund, which is promoting research, innovation, recycling projects and sustainable water management. In the Wimmera Mallee, 16,000 kilometres of leaky, open drains are being replaced by 8,000 kilometres of pipes. Over 100 gigalitres of water will be saved, a great benefit for the environment and a great improvement in water security for the people of that region. That is the type of practical measure that we are undertaking all over Australia. And then, only two weeks ago, the Prime Minister announced his $10 billion 10-point plan to take charge of the Murray-Darling Basin for the first time, to do what everybody has said should be done but was impossible: give the federal government responsibility over the interstate rivers-which, we all know, cannot be managed other than by the national government because the four states involved, whether they have the best will in the world or not, are essentially in competition with each other. This planned proposal, which appears to be receiving a high degree of support from the premiers, to take over the interstate rivers-the Murray-Darling Basin-is revolutionary. It is historic, and it has had the support of the member for Kingsford Smith. As he said only this he morning: ‘We have always said we support a national water plan. That is something that was part of Labor policy.' Well, I would ask the member for Kingsford Smith where in the Labor Party's policy it says that the Commonwealth government should take control of the Murray-Darling Basin. You know it does not. Mr Garrett-You know we have always supported it.",108
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will not use the word ‘you'.,109
151,Mr TURNBULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I call on the member for Kingsford Smith to produce the Labor Party policy document which says the Commonwealth government should take charge of the Murray-Darling Basin. It will be interesting to see whether that is produced. That plan will revolutionise the management of water in a region which uses most of our water. Most of the water that is consumed in Australia is used in the Murray-Darling Basin. Why? Because that is where 80 per cent of our irrigated agriculture can be found, and irrigated agriculture uses about 70 per cent of all the water that is consumed. That plan will transform the security of irrigators and the security of communities, and it will restore the sustainable balance and sustainable allocations between agriculture on the one hand and the environment on the other. Things that people have been saying must be done but which were frustrated by an antiquated and inappropriate governance structure can now be resolved, and they will be resolved in this climate because of the leadership that the Prime Minister has shown. This is leadership from the coalition. The Labor Party never proposed this. They never canvassed this, and indeed we do not know whether all the Labor Party premiers will yet support it. But it is the answer to the biggest environmental challenge in Australia: the management of water. It is the one that affects most people and most communities. It is the answer to that challenge in our largest area of rivers and groundwater systems, where over three million people depend on the water from that system and about 40 per cent of our agricultural produce is delivered. (Time expired)",109
152,Ms GEORGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will return to some of the comments made by the newly appointed minister, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, but in speaking on this matter of public importance let me just say that denial, scepticism, delay and inaction are the words that best describe the Howard government's response to the most serious issue confronting humanity-that of climate change and global warming. For the minister's benefit, I think it is worth reminding him of the level of scepticism that was allowed free rein. I will refer to a couple of quotes from a very senior minister on your benches, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. He had this to say not so long ago: ... carbon dioxide levels go up and down, and global warming comes and goes. When interviewed by Laurie Oakes, he confessed: ... I am a sceptic of the connection between emissions and climate change. All this was being said, Minister, at a time when our own scientific reports and global reports were telling us of the enormous consequences of inaction on this most serious issue. This is the same minister who arrogantly dismissed Al Gore's movie An Inconvenient Truth as ‘just entertainment'. This government cannot keep on dismissing the growing concern of our communities about the impact of global warming. They see it and live with it every day. I picked up our local paper this morning and the editorial screamed ‘PM sniffs the wind'-and doesn't that say it all? There is an increasing cynicism out there in the electorate about the quick political fixes when this government is under political pressure. To understand that, you only had to talk to the people who saw the graphic description of the impact of global warming in that most memorable movie, An Inconvenient Truth. The release of the most recent UN climate change report tells us all about the grave and serious consequences of increasing temperatures that could rise in the vicinity of three to four degrees Celsius. The days of denial, Minister, must surely be over. With the PM sniffing the political wind, I was looking forward to a more enlightened approach with your appointment. I have known you for a considerable period of time, and thought that you would bring a more reasoned and rational approach to this very serious issue. I was profoundly disappointed yesterday, because I think that you have a real identity crisis. On the one hand, you are openly supporting a redefinition of the word ‘scepticism' by implying that scepticism really means just being open-minded. It was not clear whether you were now on the Prime Minister's track of being a realist on the issue of climate change. So what are you? Are you a sceptic? Are you a realist? Are you open-minded? Are you an environmental purist? Might I suggest, Ministerwith due respect-that you sound just like Malcolm in the middle: not sure of where to turn on this very important national and global issue. Your Prime Minister now describes himself as a climate change realist. There is one simple reality he needs to comprehend, and that is that right now-this very day-the Australian people are feeling the impact of a 0.8 degree temperature rise. We see that with our horrific drought, with water shortages and water rationing, with mega bushfires and with storms of increasing intensity. This has happened on your watch. You and your government are culpable. The seriousness of the situation becomes even more urgent with the latest scientific report from the United Nations, which points to temperatures rising in the order of three to four times more than they have to date. This would be a catastrophe for our economy, our agricultural sector, our environment and our children's future. There is no justification for inaction. If, Minister, you wanted to portray this debate as one being led by just environmental purists-people who are only concerned about the environmental impacts and who do not understand anything about the economics or the impact on working people-let me draw your attention to the Stern report, the most compelling analysis of the economic costs of not acting on this issue. The report concluded: ... it is already very clear that the economic risks of inaction are very severeand that failure to act would cost between five per cent and 20 per cent of annual global GDP. For someone who professes to understand the workings of the market, Minister, let me say that the Stern report said that climate change was: ...the greatest market failure the world has ever seen ... The report's response was not just to argue the importance of technological development-no-one dismisses that; it is critical for the future-but a lot more than that is needed. What is needed is an effective global response on the pricing of carbon, not just the deployment of low-carbon technologies and energy efficiencies. The central issue was the pricing of carbon. The responses recommended in the Stern report are all actions that the Labor Party has long advocated. I am pleased to see that, even if your identity might be somewhat confused and you are adopting a ‘Malcolm-in-the-middle' approach, at least your Prime Minister is now saying that he is a realist on this issue. Let me quote from Tony Jones on Lateline. I nearly fell off my chair with what I heard. Tony Jones asked this: Prime Minister, what do you think living in Australia would be like by the end of this century for your own grandchildren and for the grandchildren of and great grandchildren of others, if the temperatures, the average mean temperatures, around the world do rise by somewhere between four and possibly even more than six degrees celsius? These are the actual words of John Howard, the Prime Minister of our nation: Well, it would be less comfortable for some than it is now ... Prime Minister, it is certainly not a question of some people being less comfortable; it would be an absolute disaster for our communities. Let me refer the Prime Minster and the minister to our own reports undertaken by the CSIRO. A three degree rise in temperature would have grave consequences. Eighty-six per cent of Kakadu wetlands would be lost to sea level rises, our iconic Barrier Reef would be destroyed through coral bleaching and with it its associated tourism industry and jobs, there would be up to a 70 per cent increase in the number of very high fire danger days in the south east, there would be a southward spread of malaria receptive zones, there would be up to 5,000 heatwave deaths a year, there would be more severe cyclones and higher incidence of flooding from king tides and storm surges, and developed coastal areas would be at risk of inundation. And the Prime Minister tells us that some people would be less comfortable. We expected a far more judicious response from the leader of this nation to the most serious and critical issue facing the planet. In sorting out the position of the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources on these very important issues, let me just say that his own words reveal him to be a sceptic, absolutely, about the issue of rising sea levels. Let me quote again from his comments on the AM program-and I quote in context. He said: There's a lot of very exaggerated claims, and you have to bear in mind that most of our coastal population lives on the east coast of Australia, and because of the geology or the topography of the east coast, that isn't ... you know, much of that is adequately elevated to deal with a 1 metre sea rise. With due respect, Minister, it seems that you have completely missed the point. Using a range of projected sea-level rises of between nine and 88 centimetres-let alone a metrescientific modelling at the University of Sydney, not far from your electorate, already shows that, by 2050, the beach at Narrabeen could disappear; within 100 years, the harbour could advance by as much as 43 metres from the eastern side of the Spit, covering the southern approach to the bridge; there is a 50 per cent chance of the beach at Manly Wharf eroding 11 metres, cutting off access to the ferry terminal; and erosion at Nielson Park-very close to home-would threaten the foundations of the pavilion there, a heritage listed building. And the minister at least confessed today that, for every onecentimetre rise in sea level, you get one metre of coastal erosion. Just go and visit Belongil Beach. Have a look at Clifton Beach in North Queensland. That will show you graphically the impact of coastal erosion and the totally inadequate response by all levels of government to these very serious issues. (Time expired)",109
153,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (3.53 pm)-This debate is not, as it has been presented by the opposition, a debate about a choice between action and inaction; it is about a choice between policies, and it is a choice between the right way to deal with this, the right way to deal with a real and genuine issue, and the wrong way. The wrong way encompasses saying no to any serious attempts to clean up power stations, because of a theological opposition to coal and gas; no to dealing with 16 per cent of the world's energy through nuclear energy, because of a theological opposition within the party that would aspire to governance; and no to further renewable power through hydro energy-or do you suddenly support new dams? In reality, they say, ‘We want decreased emissions'-that is what they want-but the practice is to say no to the three things which, globally, will make the greatest difference: no to the big renewables, in terms of hydro; no to nuclear, even though that would be saving 16 per cent of the world's emissions through providing that amount of energy; and no to seriously cleaning up coal and looking at that as we go around the world. What are they saying yes to? They are saying yes to a petrol tax for families and low-income earners. They are saying yes to a heating tax on pensioners and low-income families. Here is the chance the member for Kingsford Smith has to turn around and say: ‘We are going to rule out a petrol tax. We are going to rule out a pensioners' heating tax.' If you want to say that you have policies here, you had better stand up and define what they are. Do you rule out a petrol tax? Do you rule out a pensioners' heating tax? Do you rule out a heating tax which is going to strike at low-income families, which is going to strike at farmers, which is at those who are least able to deal with it? You talked about intergenerational equity, and this debate, in real terms of intergenerational equity, is about making sure that we do not sell out the present as well as making sure that we do not sell out the future. That means that you have to be able to look motorists, pensioners and farmers in the eye and say to them, ‘Yes, I am going to slug you with a petrol tax; yes, I am going to slug you with a pensioners' heating tax,' or rule those out. You are right here on the floor of the House. You can pretend you do not hear, but you know the challenge is before you right now. That is the question.",111
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Flinders will refrain from using the words ‘you' and ‘your'.,112
155,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On the alternative side, we say that there is a right way to deal with this, and that is from the people who brought the world the first greenhouse office and who brought the world $2 billion worth of real and practical technological initiatives, not just in clean coal, not just in clean gas, but also in renewables-the world's biggest solar power plant, potentially, that we are investing in. We are not afraid to look at all of the different forms. All of these things are needed. You say the solution is so important, but you rule out some of the key elements. If you are serious, and I think that there is a seriousness on one level, then drop the theology and deal with all of the elements. That is the challenge. Also, make a pledge to the pensioners and the motorists that you are not going to sell out the current generation for some utopian impact on future generations. That is the real stuff of policy. This challenge is with you right now. You can talk about it",112
156,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Flinders will refrain from using the words going to strike ‘you' and ‘your'.,112
157,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"but my challenge to the member for Kingsford Smith is to spell out the real impact on pensioners, motorists, farmers and low-income families. If the opposition are willing to do that then I respect it, but there has been a curious silence on real impacts on real people today. We make no apologies for caring about and fighting for battlers, for workers, for people with jobs and, at the same time, trying to invest in the long term. Mr Snowdon interjecting",112
158,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the member for Lingiari is asleep, he can leave the chamber.",112
159,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me deal now with this debate on three levels: firstly, the reality here, to deal with this notion of denial and scepticism; secondly, to deal with the international situation; and, thirdly, couple of the points that my learned leader has asked me to make in relation to the domestic situation. In relation to the reality, I have a very simple proposition, which is to find what we have done as a government. Climate change is real. It is important. It is significant. That is the position. That is why we have invested $2 billion. That is why we have taken concrete, practical steps. What does that mean, though? Where does Australia fit? We represent 1.4 per cent of global emissions. We represent about 560 million tonnes of 40 billion tonnes of global emissions. Where were we in 1990? We were at 550 million tonnes. So we have seen an increase of about two per cent over the last 16 years. We have seen an increase in our energy efficiency intensity of about 45 per cent. There are a series of causes for that I do not deny it. I am pleased that the changes in practice in land clearing have been an important part of that. I would also note that specific policies that this government has put in place have, on the estimates of the Australian Greenhouse Office, saved about 87 million tonnes per annum of abatement than would otherwise have been the case. So, by comparison with the rest of the world, what does that mean? We are one of the only four developed world countries that happen to be on track to meeting our targets. There are a lot of countries which made the promise, but there are very few that have delivered. So here is the question about morality: do you give the moral tick to the person who makes the promise but never delivers or to the person who never makes a false promise but does deliver? We have a real and powerful story to tell that Australia, almost alone amongst the countries of the developed world, is on track to meet its targets. We will get there because there is more action that we are going to take-there is more action that the minister himself has already emto deal with a barked upon. Where does this 40 billion tonnes sit in terms of the international situation? What does that mean? Internationally we have four planks to what we are doing, and we take this very seriously. The first is the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. This has been derided by the opposition. Yet we see from the work of ABARE that we are likely to save the world about 90 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions, over and above what would already have been the case, through the Asia-Pacific partnership process between now and 2050. That is about two years of global emissions. That is because we have brought in China, India and the United States-none of which have committed to targets under the Kyoto process. So they are willing to take real action under something that the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the Australian environment department and its successive ministers the have brought together. This is something that is real, tangible and cogent. But we have moved beyond the Asia Pacific partnership in the help we are giving in the form of clean coal technologies, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency technologies to China and India. That is probably the single most important thing we can do globally. Why? Because China's coal emissions alone account for 10 times Australia's total emissions. That is real. If you want to find out where global emissions are coming from, you should look to the increase in China's coal emissions. If we can have a 10 per cent decrease in China's emissions in any one year, it is the equivalent of Australia saving every single kilogram of our own emissions. The second thing that we are doing is that the Prime Minister has set out personally to pursue a new model for Kyoto, a new international agreement which is comprehensive and real. We make no apologies for that. What is wrong with the old system? The old system has three flaws. Firstly, it is inadequate. For all of the talk, it has had a one cent impact over the last 16 years on our emissions. We would have had 141 per cent of a 1990 emissions by 2012-now we are going to have 140 per cent. Secondly, it has perverse outcomes. This is what I call the ‘Bhopal effect'. Essentially it is driving emissions offshore from developed world countries to developing world countries. It is not doing what it should do. Thirdly, there are numerous countries that have failed to meet their targets. We are not only unashamedly driving up the take-up of clean energy through clean coal but also through the sale of uraniumwhich the Leader of the Opposition supports but the member for Kingsford Smith opposes. Why do we do that? Because it is real and it is tangible. I think I have covered the domestic points, but the last thing I want to say about the international front is that we also support reforestation. Even today I had discussions with a leading scientist about the role of reforestation in the developing world and the things that we can do there to act as global carbon sinks. We are talking about real savings of carbon having a real impact on natural systems. At the end of the day, this is not a debate about action versus inactionno country has taken more action than Australia-it is a debate about the right way versus the wrong way. (Time expired)",113
160,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I listened with interest to the member for Flinders. I thought he finished up on quite an odd note actually. He was talking about reforestation as a way of having an actual carbon sink.,114
161,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It's true.,114
162,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, it is true. But there are a couple of points to make here. The Commonwealth government has recently put in place a carbon trading task force to look at emissions trading et cetera. Agriculture was not included. Another natuper ral carbon sink is organic matter and humus in our soils, some of which trees grow on. In terms of the short to medium term, the potential for carbon to be sequestered in soils in organic matter and humus is enormous-that is not to suggest that it does not get released at another time further down the track. In fact in parts of the United States carbon trades are actually taking place. I am sure the deputy speaker would be aware of the practice of no-till agriculture where the plant residues are left on the surface of the soil. That not only reduces erosion and run-off but also increases infiltration of moisture. Under the Howard 10-point plan that might even be considered a diversion of water if we are talking about trees. The Howard 10-point plan actually says that they are going to have to review the Murray-Darling catchment cap based on how many trees are there because that could be having an impact on the amount of water that can enter the system. That is slightly different to what was being said six years ago. The new minister makes great play of his statement that they have been progressing this agenda for quite some time. Six or seven years ago the issue was salinity and we were being encouraged to plant trees so that we actually took water up and the watertable would go down so the salt would not come to the surface. Now in some of the fine print of the new plan we are actually going to revisit the impact that trees have on run-off. I think there are a number of mixed messages here, and I compliment the member for Flinders for talking about trees, because they do have a positive effect in terms of carbon absorption. But under the Prime Minister's plan they may well have a negative impact in terms of water being allowed to enter our river systems. I would hate to see a circumstance where that other natural sink, soil mus and organic matter, and progressive farming practice is scorned upon because it actually takes more water. It allows less ter to run off than traditional farming techniques. In fact, on the black soil plains, which the member for Flinders would not be aware of, I am told that that could have an impact of up to six to eight inches of additional moisture. We heard in question time today that China is building one coal-fired power plant every five days. I will tell you what America-that country that we follow in almost everything-is doing. It is building an ethanol plant every 11 days. One country, fossil fuel fired, carbon dangerous; and another country-America, one of the worse in the world in terms of consumption et cetera-is actually starting to address the problems with transport fuel with a renewable energy source for transport fuel. They are moving at an enormous rate-one plant is being opened every 11 days. I know the member for Kennedy was recently in the United States looking at those plantsMr Snowdon-They let him in?",114
163,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, they apparently let him in. He must have got in through Mexico! Mr Katter-They tried to not let me out.",115
164,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And I had paid money to have him kept there. But, anyway, the Brazilians tried and they failed! All this highlights the inactivity that been going on in our nation. I do not think the Labor Party are completely scot-free on this either. Because of the Dick Honan and Prime Minister golf game and teapot, they have been very slack on progressing the renewable energy debate. They will talk solar and they will talk wind, but they do not talk very much on ethanol, biodiesel or biofuels-renewable energy sources that not only could have an enormous impact in terms of huthe health repercussions in our major cities but also could have an enormous impact on our regional economies. You can see what is wa- happening with the corn price in the United States now-purely driven by biofuels. You can see what is happening in Europe with the canola and vegetable oil price-purely driven by biofuels. You can see what is happening in Brazil-and we are getting a bit of a spin-off from that with the sugar industry, mainly driven from Brazil. It is increasing its ethanol production at the rate of one Australian sugar industry a year. And we are doing nothing. We are standing here letting the market take its course. There is all this talk about what we are going to be doing about climate change-because it has suddenly become an issue since October-but there is nothing really happening in terms of real policy to drive some of these energy targets and to look at a mandate on the usage of fuel. Another issue is water. I will not go back to the issue I raised yesterday and this morning but, to have any credibility with respect to the future of the Murray-Darling system and the overallocation problems, the government really has to address the issue of tax on the compensation paid for the loss of water entitlement that groundwater users in New South Wales, in particular, have faced. They entered into the arrangement voluntarily and the state and the Commonwealth came together. It is jointly funded. The money is on the table, as the Prime Minister has was talking about in his plan. They worked with the irrigators and they reached a sustainable target. Compensation was arranged and, all of a sudden, after the deal was done, someone said, ‘By the way, we're going to tax you on that.' So 47 per cent of it could be taken by the Treasurer. Another issue that I will raise while the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and the member for Flinders are here is the issue of Lake Alexandrina-right at the end of the Murray. I believe the Prime Minister was there last week. Lake Alexandrina is an absolute disgrace. It is 20 times the size the electorate of Wentworth. It is artificial. Through the rising water level, it has destroyed vast areas around it. It has banked water up the Murray about 100 kilometres and it has had an enormous impact on the ecosystems-and Adelaide are saying that they do not have any water. The evaporation alone that takes place on Lake Alexandrina is half what the New South Wales cotton industry uses in a year-and the cotton industry has been demonised by all and sundry as the enormous slurper of water in the Murray-Darling system. And what are we doing about the Menindee Lakes? There is mention of it in the Prime Minister's plan. Where is that water going to be allocated? I congratulate those members of the government who have actually started to look at Lake Alexandrina, because it is a tragedy. For people in Australia to believe that the Murray-Darling system is not allowing any water into the Murray mouth is just a deception. Lake Alexandrina, this lake at the end of the Murray, is 20 times the size of the electorate of Wentworth, the minister's seat. You could throw a rock into the ocean from Lake Alexandrina across the Murray mouth. They have built what they call artificial barrages-an artificial structure-at the end to dam it up. As I said, for hundreds of kilometres around it, the salt levels have risen through man's intervention. So, if we are serious about the Murray-Darling, rather than everybody saying, ‘Let's start at the top and work down,' I think there are some things that should be done at the bottom as well. As I said, half the water that the cotton industry in New South Wales uses is actually evaporated away on this vast lake at the end of the Murray-Darling system.",115
165,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I commend the minister at the table, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you of would be well aware that one of the great failings of this parliament, when compared with the state houses-and why the state houses are much closer to the people-is that ministers do not sit in this House and listen to the speeches. This is one of the first times that I have seen a minister come into the House and listen to the opposition's arguments and his own party's arguments-and listen seriously. Mr Hockey-There are two ministers here.",116
166,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You are a primary producer, so you have a vested interest. But the honourable minister does have some interest in my electorate. When these people come in here and talk about climate change and people down here being without water, he would realise that we are inundated at the present moment. I am ringing up almost half-hourly not only Tully and Innisfail but also Burketown, Mornington Island, Normanton and the like about flooding. We, in fact, have enjoyed good seasons over the last 10 yearsand, unfortunately, in the super wet belt, we have had an excess of water. I do not know whether people in this place have read Al Gore's book, but if you look at the increase and decrease in rainfall shown there you will see that there is no pattern. One offsets the other, which is the experience in Australia. Quite frankly, the wet areas are getting a bit wetter and the drier areas might be getting a bit drier, if you go on the figures from the last 10 years. But we people who are close to the land know that it is absolutely ridiculous to look at a 10-year cycle. If you look at the rainfall pattern for Australia-a magnificent map done by the DPI in Queensland-you will realise that these years are not too bad as far as seasons go in the overall picture of Australia. I want to commend the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources for being here. I think this place would be a much more effective reflection of the Australian people if ministers did what he has done and came into this place. I also commend the other minister at the table, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and my colleague here, the member for New England, a very wise investor in the electorates of North Queensland. I want to give the ALP a little bit of gratuitous political advice: if you want to win the next election, you have to win the seats of Flynn, Bundaberg and Herbert. They are marginal seats. You have to win those seats. Those seats are coal mining seats. Don't you realise what you are kissing goodbye? This nation has one single source of income now, and that is coal. It is 20 per cent of the nation's entire export earnings. And guess what the No. 2 earner is? Aluminium. Guess what aluminium needs? Cheap power! No cheap power, no aluminium industry. You can only get cheap power with coal. Let me be very specific. The ALP has come in with some vague, airy-fairy notions. For heaven's sake! Put up solutions. Do your research. But, for the sake of the ALP, I will help them out. If you want to have wind generation or hydro generation, let me give you the figures. It is $35 a megawatt for coalfired power. Gas is $60 a megawatt. I know because I was the minister; I am intimately familiar with these figures. It is $60 to $80 a megawatt for nuclear. So forget about nuclear. No-one is going to pay $60 a megawatt for nuclear. But hydro is $140 a megawatt. Are you going to pay $140 a megawatt for electricity? For heaven's sake! Think of the poor people who are struggling to make ends meet out there, paying the huge debt on their houses because of the way we have run things in Australia. How the hell are they going to pay a 300 per cent increase in their electricity charges? But that is hydro. I have not got to wind yet. Wind is about $135 a megawatt. Solar is higher than that-maybe $240 a megawatt. Are you seriously saying that we are going to close down the Australian aluminium industry and the Australian coal industrywhich are bringing in about 20 to 30 per cent of the nation's entire export earnings? Is that seriously what you are proposing here? What about your own unions, the people who pay the money to fight your campaigns for you? Who are they? They are the miners of Australia. Look at the mining seats in Queensland. You people got absolutely annihilated in the mining towns. These people are not stupid. The miners of Australia are not fools. Let me just zero in. I do not think anyone here, on either side of the House, is questioning the increase in CO2-at least, I hope not. There has been a huge increase and that increase has been man-made. I do not question that. If you jump to stage 2 and say that therefore that increase is causing climate change, I think you are on very shaky ground. If you look at the evidence that is coming forward, you will see that it is very equivocal. I do not hesitate for a moment to say that we should be doing something about it, but you cannot possibly be seriously proposing that we close down the coal mining industry. The world will laugh at you but the people of Australia will crucify you-and justifiably so. I will do my part to ensure that they do, I can assure you. But what have we got? Look at the world authorities. Speaker after speaker for the opposition has got up and quoted Al Gore. Look at his solutions. What is his first solution? His first solution, as I said yesterday, ethanol. Look at Newsweek magazine, a most intellectually accredited magazine. It is Time and Newsweek but Newsweek is the more intellectual one. The first solution it puts forward is ethanol. In his state of the union speech last year and again this year, President Bush, who you would expect to be on the other side of the argument, said ethanol is the answer. Are all the people who live in the Americas idiots? Are the people of Canada, the United States and Brazil fools? The US and Brazil have mandated ethanol and it is in the process of being passed in Canada. As my worthy colleague from New England has said, there is an ethanol plant being built every 11 days in the US. We build one every 3,600 days in Australia. We have only built one in the last 3,600 days. One plant was built during the Second World War, at Sarina. The other plant, Honan's plant, is the only plant that has been built since 1945. One plant! Another one is being built, and let me state to the House that the people at Macquarie Bank are not fools. It was a little bank that opened up with $300 million. It is now one of the major banks in the world. Macquarie Bank is an equity investor in the new plant going ahead at Dalby. So the smart money is going on ethanol. The dumb governments are not doing that. So I ask the minister to reflect upon the fact that the United States, the greatest economy on earth, is building a plant every 11 days. Brazil, the 12th biggest economy on earth and the fourth biggest country in population, is building a plant every 14 days. Australia has built one plant in nearly 60 years. Please! We have the water and we have the land in Northern Australia. The minister, who is in the House, has raised great hopes throughout this nation. This is a nation that reveres the building of our own motorcars. This is a nation that reis veres the building of the Snowy Mountains scheme. We have done great things in this country. The minister and the Prime Minister have raised very great hopes. And, quite frankly, I praise the Leader of the Opposition as well on this insofar as he has restrained himself from attacking it. With the Snowy Mountains scheme, to his detriment, Mr Menzies attacked the idea. But, of course, when he became Prime Minister he embraced it as his own creation-and God bless him for doing that. He was very proud as an Australian of what his country had achieved in the Snowy. I say that the answers are there. In the case of ethanol, every hectare that you put under sugar cane takes 72 tonnes of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year. It produces 8,000 litres of ethanol, which puts back into the atmosphere-I cannot give an exact figure but I will track one down over the next couple of days-about 21 tonnes. So it takes 72 tonnes out and puts 10 tonnes back. There is the answer. That is why Mr Bush, Mr Al Gore and Brazil, Canada and every nation on earth are going down this pathwayMr Windsor-The Japanese and the Chinese.",116
167,Mr KATTER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Japanese, the Chinese and the Indians are building plants. Everyone is doing it. So there is the answer. I am in the unique position to also say that 40 per cent of domestic water usage is in heating water. If you solar heated Australia, one country, that will be CO2 neutral-(Time expired) NA",118

Question agreed to. NA COLLEGES (FLEXIBILITY IN ACHIEVING AUSTRALIA'S SKILLS NEEDS) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed.",122
180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Perth has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,123
181,Mr SNOWDON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I am pleased to be able to be back on my scrapers to continue my remarks, which were so rudely interrupted by question time! As we know, the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 proposes to bring forward funding for the 25 Australian technical colleges that the Commonwealth has committed itself to building. We understand through the bill that the total level of funding for the ATCs remains the same. I am pleased to be able to support these minor changes. However, I cannot say that I am happy with the way the government has handled such a crucial area as education, and I am not impressed by the way it has failed to address the skills shortage by investing in Australia's future. I do not believe that this legislation will deliver the goods; it certainly will not deliver the goods for people in my electorate. What these amendments do is to highlight the inability of the government and its complete lack of commitment to educaMs tion within this country. This ineptitude is being felt most particularly in regional and remote Australia and in my electorate of Lingiari, which has large numbers of isolated Aboriginal communities, pastoral properties and mining towns. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation and emphasise the particular areas of concern faced within my own electorate. We are told by the government that the proposed technical colleges-only five of which have been opened-would be located in areas with a high youth population, skills needs and in regions supported by a significant industry base. Whilst my electorate certainly fits these criteria, there is no commitment to a technical college being developed in this area. In fact, there has been very little investment at all in the sorts of services and infrastructure needed to provide vocational education and training and to address the skills shortages and education needs in my own electorate. What we instead see, sadly, is the historical neglect of the education needs of the many people who make up my electorate, particularly where they live in remote parts of it. I know this to be true of other parts of Australia, particularly in the north. In 2005, the Northern Territory government, with industry, held a conference entitled ‘2015: Moving the Territory Ahead'. It was told that the regional economies were suffering as the Darwin economy boomed. In December 2006, the Northern Territory Construction Association stated that these skills shortages were leading to business closures, despite a booming economy. In addressing this critical concern the conference delegates stated that there was a crucial need to involve Indigenous Australians in the answer. The Workforce NT report for 2005 notes: The NT economy is predicted to continue to strengthen over the next few years with increasing exploration resource development, continuation of major project construction activities strengthening tourism market. In the current climate where skills shortages exist across a wide range of occupations, it is reasonable to assume that demand for skilled workers and the demand for labour will continue at both the local and national level. We know from the most recent Northern Territory occupation shortage list that there are shortages in around 80 occupations. A significant proportion of these are in the trades. The Workforce NT document reports on the results of an NT wide survey of industry and business conducted by six training advisory committees. Across the Territory 53 per cent of businesses reported difficulty in recruiting staff. The most difficulty was experienced in the central region, where 65 per cent of businesses reported difficulty, followed by the Barkly region, with 59 per cent. Tradespersons and related workers were the most difficult group of workers to recruit, reflected by 34 per cent of responses. Labourers and related workers follow, with 13 per cent of responses; clerical and service workers, with 12 per cent; and professionals, with 12 per cent. The report profiles the specific skills shortages suffered in each of the Territory's regions. The report found that, in the East Arnhem region, the most common occupation with a shortage was tradespeople, with 35 per cent of responses, and the common reason given for this was ‘a general skills shortage', with 39 per cent of responses. The most common occupations experiencing shortages were motor mechanics, cleaners, electricians, seafarers, fishing hands and sales assistants. In the Katherine region, the figures were very similar, with 30 per cent of responses saying that there was a shortage of tradespersons. The most common reason given, again, was ‘a general skills shortage', with 55 per cent of responses. Again, in similar fashion, the most common workers idenand a tified as being in short supply were farm hands, nursery and garden labourers, motor mechanics and sales assistants. In the Barkly region, again, 50 per cent of responses said there was a shortage of tradespersons and 63 per cent of responses said the reason for this was ‘a general skills shortage'. The most common occupations identified were that of motor mechanics, other tradespeople and registered nurses. In the central region, the most common occupations in shortage were tradespeople, with 40 per cent of responses, and the most common reason give, again, was ‘a general skills shortage', with 51 per cent of responses. The most common occupations identified as having a shortage of labour were those of electricians, motor mechanics, sales assistants, carpentry and joinery tradespersons and cleaners. The shortage of skills in the Territory is, of course, exacerbated by the growth in economic activity that the Territory economy is experiencing. The Access Economics five year outlook released last month predicts strong growth in the Territory economy of between five per cent and 6.5 per cent over the next three years, no doubt strongly driven by the commodity boom across northern and Western Australia. Indeed, much of the economic activity that is a result of the commodity boom is based in regional parts of the Territory, in my own electorate. What is unfortunate is that the impressive rates of growth and low levels of unemployment predicted in the Access Economics outlook are not being fully enjoyed in the communities that exist within this area of such vibrant economic activity. In the regions I earlier identified in my own electorate, there is a significant Indigenous population, with 38 per cent of the population of Lingiari being Aboriginal people. One of the defining characteristics of this population is that they are disproportionately youthful when compared with the rest of the population, and they have very high fertility rates. Forty per cent of Australia's Indigenous population is aged 14 years or younger, compared with only 20 per cent of the non-Indigenous population. I have said in this chamber a number of times that the most crucial factor bearing upon the ability of these people to participate in the labour market is a lack of education opportunities. I have pointed out many times in this place that there are literally thousands of young Territorians who live in my electorate who have no access at all to any high school education opportunities or vocational education opportunities. It is within that text that I note the remarks made by various ministers during the course of question time today. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations made the following comments. Firstly, he said that ‘the best welfare that we can provide to Australians is a job'. He later said that giving Australians a career in an Australian workplace is what they are about. Then, of course, we had the Minister for Vocational and Further Education talking about skill shortages. He was saying something which we all know: the demand for skills will continue. He said that the government has a plan to address skill shortagesreferring to these technical colleges-and keep the economy strong. Then we had the Minister for Education, Science and Training talking about the need for quality education. I wonder if they actually sat down and had a conversation together whether they could work out a solution to the problems in my electorate. Clearly there is a disjointed approach to how to address the skill shortages in this country. Clearly there is a disjointed approach about how to address the needs of people who live in regional and remote Australia and who are not afforded the opportunity to go to technical colleges because they do not exist there. Nothing in this legislation will assist a single person in my electorate to attend a technical college, because there is not one there. In any event, even if there were, a substantial proportion of the population would not be able to get access to it because they would not have the fundamental skills to get entry. Why do they not have the fundamental skills to get entry? Because they do not have access to a quality education. Why do they not have access to a quality education? Because, sadly, since at least 1978 until 2001, con- successive conservative governments in the Northern Territory took conscious decisions not to invest in educational infrastructure in the bush. As a result, we now have at least three generations of Territorians-some of them are clearly not young any more-who have been denied access to proper education opportunities. It is all very well for this government to come in here and parade what it sees as its values about the importance of quality education and the importance of providing people with career opportunities and jobs, but they fail the test because none of the decisions that they have taken in this legislation will provide opportunities for these Australians who live in remote parts of the Northern Territory. Of course, the three ministers who I referred to earlier all make bland statements about what this country is on about and about what they are trying to do in terms of real welfare. It could well be true that providing people with real jobs is the best welfare, but I wonder if the minister responsible would talk to the minister for education and say, ‘Listen, if I am going to give these young Aboriginal kids in the Northern Territory access to jobs in the broader labour market, they need an education.' Then, when he has done that, he might well go over to the other minister who got up at the table here and paraded his virtue and say to him: ‘Mate, if we want to give these young kids apprenticeships, you have to provide them with those vocational education opportunities in the bush. It is not much good to them if it is in Darwin.' My electorate is 1.34 million square kilo- metres in area. The city of Darwin and Palmerston form the electorate of Solomon, which is 334 square kilometres. You do not have to be Einstein to work it out. The town of Alice Springs is the major service centre for a very large region-about one-third of the Northern Territory. Do you think they have any technical and further education opportunities provided through this legislation? They have zero. What opportunities do all those young kids who live in the northern part of South Australia, the eastern part of Western Australia or the southern part of the Northern Territhese tory and who see Alice Springs as their major service centre get out of this legislation? Not a jot-not one single opportunity. Let us not have ministers come into this place belting their chests, parading their virties tue and saying how well they are doing when, in fact, they are doing abysmally. And whilst I am happy to support the meagre impact this legislation will make in assisting with Australia's skill shortage by providing some opportunities for some people in some parts of Australia, I say to the government: you have failed the test and you continue to fail the test. You do not understand, nor do you care, about providing those Australians who are most disadvantaged and most need an opportunity in life with that opportunity. You have taken conscious decisions not to do it. We know that if we are actually going to do something about this that we have to do something reasonable. I talked about the Indigenous community in the Northern Territory. Over 83 per cent of the Indigenous population aged 15 or over live in remote parts of the Territory-that is, in my electorate. According to the Workforce NT Report, they typically have: - high rates of disengagement from the labour market high rates of employment through Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) - declining mainstream employment ... If you profile this population, and if you understand this population, you do not have to be too smart to work out why they cannot get a job. Not only is the labour market an issue, and not only do this government not understand the small-area labour markets that exist across the Northern Territory; they also do not understand their obligation-nor do they acknowledge their obligation-to provide Australians with a similar opportunity to that which they want to provide to other Australians in other areas, such as Western Sydney or even Darwin. The people in my electorate have the right to these opportunijust like other Australian citizens have. This legislation will not provide them with that opportunity. This legislation does not go nearly far enough. I say to members opposite: we have to do a damn sight more if we are going to fill the gap which now prevails in the bush and give these young Australians a real opportunity. In 1996, when I was parliamentary secretary for employment, I was responsible for promoting and funding a skills analysis to look at skills shortages in the Northern Territory and across the north of Australia. What did that analysis tell us? It told us that skills were short. We know that, but it exemplified the huge potential pool of labour in the north of Australia which is not being accessed because they are being ignored. Now, report after report has exemplified exactly what I have been saying. Industry knows that there are skills shortages. They need their carpenters, they need their electricians, they need their fitters in the mining industry. They not get them. What we have seen, despite the lack of effort by government, is industry taking up the cudgel. The mining industry, particularly in the case of Argyle, has taken a deliberate approach to make sure that the labour which they employ in that community is largely from the local population. They have changed the way they operate. They have gone out to the community and said: ‘We will help you to get training. We understand the need for this educational opportunity. We will give you the opportunity, we will train you for a job and we will give you a job.' That is what this government needs to understand. It needs to see that it has an obligation to work with communities and provide the people with real opportunities. This legislation does not do nearly enough in terms of providing technical and further education opportunities for people who live in remote parts of Australia, particularly in my electorate. It is a shame. The government needs to do a damn sight better. (Time expired)",123
182,Mr TICEHURST,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Dobell) (4.47 pm)As a result of strong industry and community support, 21 of the 25 Australian technical colleges are expected to be in operation in 2007, which is well ahead of the schedule announced at the 2004 election. This has resulted in additional costs over a five-year period, which this bill seeks to address. The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 will increase the total funding for the ATC initiative from $343.6 million to $456.2 million-an increase of $112.6 million over the period from 2006 to 2009. While it is fantastic that youth in many parts of the country will have the option of this flexible approach to education and traincan- ing sooner than anticipated, I must express my disappointment and frustration that the technical college in my electorate of Dobell has been held up because of the New South Wales Labor government's continual political games. The Central Coast ATC would have been up and running in 2007 had it not been for the New South Wales Labor government delaying the granting of a licence. I understand this has also occurred in other electorates in New South Wales and in Western Australia. But we all know what Labor does when it is threatened by good policy: it stands in the way and denies communities of important projects. The Australian government and Central Coast industries are working together to provide and promote technical training for youth across the whole region, while the New South Wales government tries to stifle these moves-purely for political gain. The local New South Wales Department of Education and Training have been very cooperative and they understand the need to work together to avoid an unnecessary duplication of facilities. However, I understand that the New South Wales Labor government is now refusing to sign a memorandum of understanding to provide the education component for the project, adding further delays to the project. We all know that Labor has a limited grasp of the technical college concept and how valuable it will be for areas with a high youth population and a rapidly growing employNeeds) ment base. It cannot seem to grasp that the technical college initiative will serve to complement TAFE, rather than duplicate it, by providing young Australians with the opportunity to commence their training in a traditional trade through a school based apprenticeship at certificate III level while at the same time completing academic subjects leading to their year 12 certificate. The additional funding in the bill will provide a capacity for ATCs to provide high levels of support to both students and the employers who engage students as Australian school based apprentices. This is another initiative that the New South Wales Labor government has held up for so long, denying thousands of young people in New South Wales opportunities, options and a say in their future. Instead, state Labor attempted fool Australians with hollow promises and trade schools, which are nothing like the Australian Government's ATCs, as they do not offer trade training to certificate III certificate IV level. One of the best things about these technical colleges, and something that really sets them apart from other VET initiatives, is their flexibility. Each college has been encouraged to pursue a model that best meets the needs of the region in which it is established. Students and employers are attracted by this flexibility. Employers are able to fluence the curriculum to ensure their apprentices are work-ready, and students are able to undertake on-the-job training at times that suit their employer. Students can also work towards two qualifications at once. One student commented that he had been trying to decide whether to stay at school and complete his senior certificate or to start an apstudy trades. prenticeship. He was over the moon when he heard that he could combine the two. This flexibility has resulted in the operational costs necessary to get each college up and running being higher than expected. These costs vary from college to college because every operational model is different. In my electorate of Dobell, on the Central Coast, trade qualifications are vital. In fact, I recently been involved in a Central Coast apprentice drive with a local organisation called Central Coast Group Training, and we have been working to encourage businesses to take on apprentices, with great results. The plan was to employ one apprentice or trainee per day for 30 days. This program has been running for two weeks, and so far 15 new trainees have been signed on. They are handling about 150 apprentices and trainees currently and they are tied into make that 200 during this year. The abolition of technical schools by the states many years ago has meant that over to the past few decades our young people have lacked training and skills pathways. The price we have paid is the severe trade skill shortages we are currently experiencing in and many of our key industries. Indeed, when I went to school at Granville we had a technical high school there. Technical high schools existed in many other suburbs around Sydney. Many kids learned a lot of their handson trades at school. Those schools no longer exist; they were abandoned by Labor. Labor pursued higher education and just forgot the skills that were in- really needed to keep this country going. This is why the establishment of technical colleges is vital for the Central Coast. While take-up of places at the University of Newcastle's Central Coast campus is higher than ever, there are an exceeding number of students in years 11 and 12 on the coast who do not want to go on to university but want to Residents and businesses on the Central Coast are grateful that our local area has been chosen to house one of the 25 technical colleges. The good thing about this technical college and why it is a revolution for our young people is the way they are getting trade training. The college is industry-led, which means local employers in the region have are working with education providers to establish a college that responds directly to the needs of local industry, resulting in students making a smooth transition into the workplace and local areas having access to a supply of highly qualified workers who will be trained according to local industry requirements. The Central Coast Manufacturers Association is doing a fantastic job to get the ATC under way and has been fully supported locally by association members including Albany International, Sara Lee, ADC Krone, Gibbens Industries, Masterfoods, Adhesives Research, Gosfern, Thermit Australia and Pacific Labels. These industries are further supported by the involvement of Australian Business Ltd, the Master Builders Association, the NRMA and the Gosford District Chamber of Commerce and Industry, just to name a few. On the Central Coast, trade training will be offered in the engineering trades, construction, electro-technology, automotive trades and commercial cookery. The bill takes into account that in some cases a newly established school will be the most effective delivery model to meet their regional needs. The ATCs also need to ensure students are trained using the latest tools and equipment. While all ATCs have been encouraged to work closely with existing training providers, including TAFE, to utilise existing infrastructure in their region, the ATCs have in some cases been required to contribute funding for this infrastructure to be refurbished or upgraded. Recently Mr Lester Searle, who was the campus director for the Wyong and Gosford TAFE, gave me an extensive tour of the facilities at Wyong. It was encouraging to see that facilities for commercial cookery and plumbing were really superior, and very few institutions in the area had anything like fact, the plumbing school is probably one of two or three in the state. We really need to make sure that these facilities are not duplicated. Indeed, the ATCs can provide a training ground and provide a student feed into these TAFEs. The Australian government is committed to building a nation in which high-quality technical education is as valued as a university qualification. Some 70 per cent of young people do not go directly from school to university and many choose to undertake vocational and technical education and apprenticeships. The Australian government values and respects these choices. The Australian technical colleges initiative is just one of a range of vocational and technical education initiatives that the Australian government is delivering during 2006 to 2009. In fact, this government's investment over that period will total more than $11.3 billion, the biggest commitment to vocational and technical education by any government in Australia's history. The investment includes $781 million over five years from the Skills for the Future package, which is 93 per cent of the total funding; helping to ease the early financial burden on apprentices by providing apprentices starting an eligible apprenticeship with: a tool kit worth up to $800; a $1,000 Commonwealth trade learning scholarship, with $500 paid at the successful completion of each of the first and second years of an apprenticeship in an eligible trade with a small or medium size business; an extension of the living away from home allowance to third-year apprentices who have moved away from home to take up or remain in an apprenticeship; and $10.6 million over four years to extend incentives for employers of higher level apprentices in key growth areas. Australia is proud to have a world-class it. In training system which many countries around the world try to emulate. The Australian government is committed to maintaining our high-quality training system by focusing on flexibility and being responsive to industry needs. I urge the New South Wales government to forget 24 March and sign the MOU so that duplication on the Central Coast will not be needed. The Australian technical colleges initiative is part of a term plan by the Australian government to build the status and prestige of the trades, to address the barriers to trade training in the school system and to ensure that the nation can better plan and meet the needs of trade industries in the future. At this point I would like to congratulate Gary Hardgrave, the previous minister, whom I worked very closely with over the years to establish this Central Coast ATC in conjunction with other training for apprentices. I commend this bill, which will give young people in my electorate the chance to study at an Australian technical college and get a head start in their working lives.",127
183,Ms KING,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I too rise to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. The purpose of this bill is to provide additional funding of $112.6 million over the years 2005 to 2009 for the establishment and operation of the Australian technical colleges, as costs for the colleges have blown out beyond expectation. The Australian technical colleges provided the Howard government with the political cover it needed to create the perception that it is addressing the skills crisis in Australia. Fixing the skills crisis is essential if the tralian economy is to continue to prosper and grow; however, the reality is that the Australian technical colleges are yet to train one young Australian in a traditional trade. Coming from an electorate that has a teenage unemployment rate of over 20 per cent, I see first hand the very human costs as well as economic costs of the Howard government's failure to address Australia's skills crisis and to train young Australians in traditional trades. The failure of the government to come up with an effective policy response to Australia's skills crisis is increasingly imlong- pacting on skills training, innovation and industry, particularly manufacturing, in my electorate. We cannot rely on the resources boom indefinitely. To compete globally, Australia must become a skilled and highly trained economy. While the government is more than happy to take the credit for the economic good times, it is doing nothing to assure Australia's economic strength will continue into the future. The government has been in office for 10 years, but what has it been doing to address these issues? It has failed to provide the required opportunities for Australians to access training that will ensure their future employment and ensure that the future skills needs of this country are met. Nothing better highlights the Howard government's ineptitude than its management of the Australian technical colleges. As a policy, the Australian technical colleges are much more about providing political cover than about providing a practical policy solution to the skills crisis. The ATCs were announced in the context of the 2004 election campaign and they were pretty much a political quick fix rather than an actual policy solution. The reality is that the Howard government announced a policy that sounded good in the context of an election campaign, Auslargely in response to Labor's criticism over its lack of action on skills, but for which there was no policy work done and little idea as to how to implement it. The policy has limped along ever since. The demise of the former minister responsible for this area largely reflects his failure to implement the Australian technical colleges-a failure that is to some extent not really his fault. It is a policy that has been destined to fail from the start because, instead of working cooperatively with the states on the existing long standing system of trade training provided via TAFE, the Howard government has set up an alternative system-talk about creating duplication, wasting scarce resources, failing to use federal funding to build and leverage additional funding from states and other registered ing organisations, introducing inefficiency and failing to maximise opportunities for trade training for young people! Australian technical colleges were billed as a solution to the projected shortfall of 100,000 skilled workers by 2010. Of the proposed 25 Australian technical colleges, how many are actually open and operating today? There are five of them. Of the promised 7½ thousand students to be enrolled and working towards their trade in a school based apprenticeship, how many are actually enrolled today? It has been more than two years since the ATC policy was first announced but, as at December last year, there were only five colleges up and running. That is the advice from the government's own website advertising the college system. Those five ATCs, the Gold Coast, Gladstone, Port Macquarie, Eastern Melbourne and Northern Tasmania, account for fewer than 350 enrolments. This figure looks even more pitiful when the Port Macquarie ATCwhich is really a rebadged vocational college that had existing enrolments-with 205 enrolments is taken into account. Even if the implementation of the Australian technical colleges had not been bungled and could meet its target of 7,500 students by 2010, it would be too little and far too late to address Australia's skills crisis. I supported the original bill in this place which introduced the colleges because investing in trades and technical education is of critical importance both to the individuals involved and to the Australian economy. I supported the original bill to establish the colleges despite the lack of detail available and despite the flaws in the government's proposal because, frankly, on this side of the House we were relieved that the government was at least trying to do something about the skills crisis. We will support this bill because getting trad- more money into the system of technical education is critical to addressing our skills crisis, but the government has taken entirely the wrong approach. I believe this money could be spent to far greater effect if it was channelled into existing state structures and registered training organisations. There has been continued criticism from the sector about the Howard government's decision to not use the TAFE network or even other existing registered trading organisations as the basis of the Australian technical colleges system. The state governments and TAFE have tried and tested structures already established with the experience to make use of any additional funding immediately. Instead of establishing an opposing structure, it would have been more practical and effective to work within existing and more established structures. If the government has criticism of TAFE then why doesn't it work to improve it instead of bypassing it by creating an opposing system? In Ballarat we were pretty disappointed to see that we were not considered for one of the Australian technical colleges in the original allocation-not because we desperately wanted one of the government's ATCs but because we would have been grateful and grabbed with both hands the opportunity to access federal funding to address our skills crisis and our high teenage unemployment rate. We have been screaming for assistance on this issue in Ballarat for some time. The skills crisis is a particular concern to the Committee for Ballarat, the Central Highlands Area Consultative Committee and the City of Ballarat, who have been working on this issue for some time. There are simply not enough individuals in traditional trades and there is a high youth unemployment rate, which is running at around 20 per cent in my electorate, particularly for those young people aged 15 to 19. In our region we would welcome federal funding to assist us with trade training, but the government needs to take into account that the Bracks Labor government has already stepped up to the plate in the federal government's absence in this respect. Working within established and existing structures, a new Ballarat Technical Education Centre, funded by the state government, will commence operating from the University of Ballarat's SMB TAFE Division midyear. Implementation is already well under way and a structure, curriculum and enrolment system has already been developed with local schools and businesses. There will be an initial intake of 75 students, who will use the SMB campus's existing facilities at Lydiard Street South. I also note the $12 million commitment to the new building and construction facility at that campus, which is about completed and due to be opened, and was again funded by the state Labor government. The Ballarat TEC will initially offer courses in building and construction and automotive and engineering before moving into a new purpose-built facility on the campus in 2008, and work is already underway on building that campus. The intake is expected to rise to 300 students when the new facility opens. In Ballarat we already have a strong VET and VCAL in-schools program. Our schools have been working closely with TAFE on the implementation of the technical education centres. We have terrific secondary colleges. Sebastopol College, which used to be Sebastopol Technical School, after years of declining enrolment now provides a huge range of options for the young people who go there. Whether the kids from there go into university, stream into TAFE, go into arts or go into their own businesses, there is room for everyone at Sebastopol College. It is seen as one of the most desirable schools in my electorate. Sebastopol College, Mount Clear College, Ballarat Secondary College and Ballarat High School have for some time been offering pathways into trade and vocational education and training. These colleges are working closely with the TAFE on the technical education centre. They have specialised in areas where they know that they have strengths. There is transportability of kids between the four secondary colleges if they do not have the equipment or the training for a particular trade, and our non-government schools are also taking advantage of the vocational education experiences offered by our government schools. Our schools, TAFE, registered training organisations and the state government have just invested in upgrading equipment for vocational training, and they provide that training to many private schools in my electorate. We of course could always do with more, and again it would be a more appropriate use of ATC funding in our district if it were directed toward the upgrading of technical facilities within our existing secondary system rather than establishing a duplicate system. One of the other criticisms that many of the people who have been involved in technical education for a long time is that the Australian technical colleges take young people way too late. They really need to start capturing young people at a much earlier age, and all of the evidence suggests that that is what they should be doing. Certainly, one of the issues that the technical education centre is addressing with schools is how it can work within the VCAL and VET systems. It is also looking at how we can actually stream people at a younger age than that offered by the Australian technical colleges. Our schools have been working very closely with the department of education, the local TAFE, other training providers, local industry and the local learning exchangeanother fantastic facility that we have larat that is used by both government and non-government school students. It allows people to train in areas such as film, sound and lighting, and office management. If anyone gets the opportunity to come to Ballarat they will see it really is a shining example of a learning centre that provides technical education to government and non-government schools. All of these schools have been working very hard. In the announcement I understand that the government will make on Monday about 15 new technical education centres, I hope that Ballarat is considered by the government for ATC funding. However, the government would be entirely wasteful and inefficient if it did not put that money into existin ing structures such as the technical education centre and our vocational education system. If on Monday the government decides to put the money there rather than attempting to introduce a complicated new system of technical education to Ballarat, we will certainly welcome that and I will be one of the first people out there welcoming the funding into Ballarat. But if there is to be a completely new, duplicate structure within Ballarat, I can tell the government now that it will fail. It will not actually improve training and technical education in my community if it is not able to work cooperatively with the existing system and complement the large amount of funding that has been allocated to our technical education centre from the state government. I also want to mention two other training initiatives operating in my electorate. In my own electorate-and, I know, in many other electorates-we have been running the Mindshop Excellence program for some time. It is in essence a trade taster program, but it is quite unique. It has actually been running as part of the Australian Industry Group's ‘Manufacturing 31 Days'. It used to in Bal- be ‘Manufacturing Week'. The Mindshop Excellence program is a great example of what you can do. It takes young people into the manufacturing sector, and they get to experience not just trades across the manufacturing sector but also the real-life problems that are faced by the manufacturing sector. They are asked to workshop and come up with innovative solutions for those problems. These young people are integrated absolutely into the businesses and learn what manufacturing can offer them. They get to come away, provide a presentation to leaders in the local community and present the solutions to companies such as FMP, MCCain and MasterFoods. It provides people with a real taste of what it is like to be a trade but, more specifically, in a trade in manufacturing. I certainly think the program is worth looking at as a trade taster program. It provides an excellent base for young people, particularly in terms of manufacturing, and it is certainly something that Labor will look at very seriously. I think this, alongside our TAFE's active participation in the World Skills program, puts Ballarat at the forefront of technical education across Victoria. We are very proud that many of our young people have gone on to represent our area in state, national and international finals and also that they are fantastic tradespeople in our local community. While I support the additional funds going into technical education that are represented in this bill, all this bill really does is draw attention to the spectacular policy failure of Australian technical colleges and the woeful response to our skills crisis that has characterised the 10 long years of the Howard government. The policy was totally bereft of substance in the first place. It failed to address important issues relating to incentives for students to complete training or to gain meaningful employment following training. We are now seeing the results of that. Where was the foresight to ensure that enough young people were supported to fulfil their training requirements in the first place and to graduate as skilled workers? Where was the government's policy on enhancing relationships between employer groups and trade training colleges to ensure appropriate employment at the end of training? Where was the commitment to work with states and territories to achieve the skilled worker goals that this nation must have to compete with the rest of the world? Where was the commitment to work with the states and territories and to build upon the funding that was available from the states and territories for technical trade colleges the VCAL and the VET programs that are being implemented? Where was the idea to use federal funding as a bit of leverage to increase state funding and the availability of what is on the ground in local areas? Where was the acknowledgement that our young people need and deserve better choices, and that our current education system needs and deserves better facilities and better structures for vocational and educational training? We will not find any of these things in the Howard government's Australian technical colleges policy and, because of that, we now see only five of the colleges up and running. Policies like the Australian technical colleges and the amalgamation of traineeships into the New Apprenticeships scheme have provided a political smokescreen for the government's complacency and neglect when it comes to skills. We can do much better in this country in relation to improving trade skills but the government is unfortunately only capable of finding political solutions to what it sees as political problems. It is incapable of providing real solutions to long term problems, whether they be the skills crisis, climate change or even water policy. The Australian technical colleges are unfortunately yet another classic example of the Howard government pursuing a political solution to what they see as a political problem and failing to address the real issue behind the skills crisis.",130
184,Mr HAASE,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I rise today to speak in support of the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. This bill will provide for increased funding for the ATC program, which is of particular interest to us in the Kalgoorlie electorate, as one of the colleges will open in the Pilbara region in July this year. It is no secret that there are skills shortages in this country and there is for nowhere that these shortages are felt more than in my electorate. The resources boom in Western Australia, particularly in the north-west, has created great prosperity but has also created a desperate shortage of workers. Workers are needed in the Pilbara region on every level across all industries, but particularly in the trades. In recent decades there has been a focus on tertiary education, with vocational courses falling behind in popularity and status. This has led to a large number-some say a glut-of university graduates. But the Australian community needs tradespeople as well. There are shortages of plumbers, electricians and builders across the country, jeopardising projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars. State laws and regulations have stifled change and progress and kept the training of trade skills locked in the dark ages. Too many cases of trade jealousies and union dominance have aided and abetted state Labor governments in maintaining an environment that discourages young Australians from taking up apprenticeships and making a real contribution to the Australian economy while securing a future for themselves-and a sound financial future at that. The states failed to address the looming problem of the skills shortages, which frustrated the federal government into action in 2004 and into doing something positive and meaningful. We could only be patient for so long waiting for the states to attend to their responsibilities, because everyone is affected by these shortages, and there are dire consequences when communities do not have these services. For example, in Western Australia there are approximately 4,200 plumbers and related workers according to the state government career information website. The majority of them work in the Perth metropolitan area, where the population is 1.5 million, equating to one plumber for every 357 people. Cities are affected by trade shortages, but the towns across my electorate feel it even more. For example, the online Yellow Pages listing for plumbing businesses reveals seven in Karratha, with a population of 10,000, and just one in the town of Port Hedland, with a population of 15,000. Granted, it is not necessarily accurately representing those trades in the towns, but it gives you a sense of the situation. While the ALP has an ongoing fascination with streaming all young Australians through a tertiary course, the Howard government has recognised this considerable problem and is committed to raising the profile of vocational and technical education. For the time being we have been forced into adopting the only immediate workable solution, which is skills migration via the 457 visa, but we also have a long-term strategy that will turn this situation around. In fact, this government's investment over the period 2005 to 2009 will total more than $11.3 billion, the biggest commitment to vocational and technical education by any government in Australia's history. The Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Act 2005 was enacted on 19 October 2005, providing the legislative framework to establish and operate the ATC program and providing funding of $343.6 million for the initiative. Attracting people to the trades is vital for Australia's future. The ATC initiative offers a new approach to achieving this and forms an important part of this government's strategy for tackling skill shortages. These colleges will promote trade qualifications as a highly valued alternative to a university degree and will provide up to 7,500 young Australians with the opportunity to combine an Australian school based apprenticeship, leading to a national training package qualification, and their Year 12 certificate. This amendment bill provides additional funding of $112.6 million for the ATC program, bringing the total for the 2005 to 2009 period to $456.2 million. The additional funding is broken down into $27.8 million for 2006-07, $42.6 million in 2007-08, $32.6 million in 2008-09 and $9.5 million in 2009-10. This measure is necessary for a number of reasons. The demand for these colleges has been significant, as has the support from communities and industry. To date, 24 ATCs have been announced and 20 funding agreements have been signed ensuring funding for their establishment and operations until the end of 2009. Five of the colleges are already operational and a further 16 are expected to commence during 2007. Additional funding is also needed to provide for the flexibility of this program. Each college has been encouraged to pursue a model that best meets the needs of the region in which it is established. This flexibility has resulted in the operational costs necessary to get each college up and running being higher than expected. They vary from college to college-that is what flexibility is all about. However, in general, the costs relate to the need to attract the best teachers and support staff, extensive industry engagement, marketing and promotion, curriculum development incorporating industry requirements and the necessity for some colleges to operate on interim models in the early years. There has been an increase in operational costs due to the fact that, of the 24 announced colleges, only four are based on existing schools, compared with the original estimate of 12. The colleges have not been able to leverage existing services and infrastructure for the new ATCs, which means that new facilities must be built in many cases. It has also emerged that several colleges need multiple campuses to ensure appropriate coverage of the region, which has led to increased operational costs. In fact, Pilbara ATC is a fine example of this, being decentralised over five separate locations. Additional funding is needed to ensure that students are trained using the latest tools and equipment, with a focus on enterprise, employability, business and information technology skills to ensure that they are as job ready as possible. This final element is of importance to me, as ensuring that our young people are job ready is vital for not only the Pilbara area of my electorate but this nation as a whole. It was very gratifying for me when I was told at the end of May last year that I had secured an ATC for the Pilbara, and even more so when I joined the former Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, at the signing of the funding agreement-finally-on 18 January this year at Karratha. It was satisfying, as state government had held up the project. At one stage I was almost convinced that it would not happen. The state opposed the college, resisting the obligation to provide staff on flexible wage structures, but the agreement was finally signed and provided $23.5 million for the college in capital and operational grants. It was signed, due in the main to the perseverance of those who knew that this progress was vital. The ATC Pilbara, as it is known, will now offer the opportunity for young people to learn a trade without having to leave home and for employers to be involved in the curriculum and, at the same time, provide support for local industries and businesses. The college will be based in Port Hedland, with sites opening at Port Hedland and Karratha in time for semester 2 this year. In 2007, the proposed student enrolments are 50 year 11 students. In 2008, the figure remains the same for year 11 students, but 35 year 12 students are added. In 2009, an estimated 65 year 11 and 40 year 12 students will be enthe rolled. Student numbers will increase following the opening of the Roebourne and Onslow sites next year and the expansion to Tom Price and Newman in 2009. The ATCP will be registered as an independent school under the School Education Act 1999, offering courses in engineering, construction, electrotechnology, automotive trades and commercial cookery. The academic learning program will be developed and reviewed annually, and the trade training will be delivered by the Pilbara TAFE. Flexible and practical learning is a key element of academic programs to be offered, and it is anticipated that students will be able to study academic programs outside school time. The ATC program will produce highquality, work ready apprentices. This project is a very significant one for the Pilbara, and the employers across the board support this project because the need for a local, appropriately trained workforce has never been stronger. Businesses from cafes to major companies are all suffering the same problems in attracting and retaining employees. A search yesterday on just one employment website found 166 vacancies in the Pilbara, from engineer to truck driver to bar manager. The industry consortium for the ATCP is led by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia and comprises BHP Billiton Iron Ore; Pilbara Iron, part of the Rio Tinto Group; Woodside Energy; Chevron Australia; the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association; and the Western Australian Department of Education and Training. There is additional support by local industry groups such as Newcrest Australia, Fortescue Metals Group, WorleyParsons, SKM, and Ngarda Civil and Mining. Their involvement will ensure that the skills taught to students will be directly relevant the trade they have chosen and will assist in encouraging local employers to provide school based apprenticeship opportunities for students. I must speak about an element of this program which has the potential for an outcome that is arguably more important than the training of our Pilbara young people generally, and that is the training of our Indigenous young people. Everyone involved with the ATCP will be working to address the issue of Indigenous education. The chair of the ATCP is Mr Meath Hammond, General Manager of Indigenous Affairs at Woodside. Mr Hammond has more than 10 years experience in the community and Indigenous affairs across academia, government and industry. All the parties working on this ject recognise the importance of engaging with the local Indigenous community for a mutually beneficial outcome and are committed to increasing Indigenous employment opportunities. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association has worked with its member companiesincluding Chevron, which is about to begin developing the $11 billion Gorgon gas project-on the issue of Indigenous employment. Through the Indigenous Affairs portfolio, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of WA influences legislation and policies on Indigenous issues and provides a forum for addressing the need to build sustainable relationships between industry and Indigenous people. Training and employment in particular have been a key focus for developing economic and social outcomes, which has been embraced by many Chamber of Minerals and Energy member companies. BHP Billiton's Pilbara iron ore operation has made a commitment to increase Indigenous employment in its operations and the wider community to 12 per cent by 2010. With the current levels to of Indigenous employment at the site at three per cent, this is a very significant undertaking. The program, titled Investment in Aboriginal Relationships, is a long-term initiative that recognises Aboriginal communities as key stakeholders. The program focuses on education, training and employment, including an Indigenous trainee scheme and the development and support of educational, vocational and life skills programs, in conjunction with the education department and the expansion of the BHP Billiton crosscultural training program. Rio Tinto's Pilbara Iron established an Aboriginal training and liaison unit in 1992. Known as ATAL, the unit manages training, employment and community relations programs designed to support self-determination pro- and community capacity building within Aboriginal communities in the Pilbara. ATAL runs education programs, preemployment training programs and scholarship and cadetship programs in Karratha, Roebourne, Tom Price and Paraburdoo. ATAL's programs focus on job skills training, small business development, education, cross-cultural development and the preservation of Aboriginal culture and heritage. The cultural heritage unit of ATAL works in consultation with Aboriginal communities and elders to record, map and protect significant Aboriginal sites in proximity to its operations. In 2002 Woodside became a participant in the Corporate Leaders for Indigenous Employment initiative sponsored by the Australian government. Woodside has instigated an Indigenous employee retention strategy and cultural awareness training for its employees aimed at maintaining long-term employment for its Indigenous employees. There are several employment vehicles through which the company hopes to create employment opportunities for Indigenous people: the National Indigenous Cadetship Project, an Indigenous commercial traineeship program, the Woodside graduate program and direct recruitment. If you will permit me, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I will provide the House with a brief outline of life in the Pilbara, to insight as to the importance of this project to the people in that area. Economic success from mining is certain, but the future of the region is not. Regional Australia, particularly the towns in my electorate, faces an uncertain future due to the lack of regional development. There is no long-term growth, populations are shrinking, towns lack infrastructure and services, and incentives for professionals to relocate to these areas are few and far between. The resources industry makes the most significant contribution to the Pilbara's economy-albeit primarily with a fly-in flyout workforce. It is the biggest employer. It is expected to be prosperous for the foreseeable future. The Indigenous population in the Pilbara, which is marginalised, is rising, but there has not been a correlation to the numbers employed. This is due to welfare dependence, a lack of education and training and a culture which places insufficient importance on self-reliance. Indigenous children are not encouraged to go to school by their parents, and those who do attend are not made to stay there. The statistics vary, but, in general, I believe 80 per cent of Indigenous children who are enrolled in primary school-which is by no means every child-do not attend on a regular basis. Without at least a primary school education these children have no chance of moving into secondary or further education, let alone of getting a job. The sad reality is that an Aboriginal child is more likely to complete a term of incarceration than year 12. This situation must change. The resources companies in the Pilbara, as elsewhere, are eager to employ and train Indigenous workers, but the workers are not available. In 2001, according to ABS census data, 50 per cent of working age Indigenous people in the give an Pilbara were not in the workforce. The ATCP-that is the Australian Technical College, Pilbara-will go a long way to improve standards of education, local employment, local training and business engagement. The most important role I believe it will play is to increase the participation of Indigenous youth in education and training and help them create a future for themselves. The additional funding provided by this amendment bill will allow the ATCs to be properly funded and taken seriously. The role they will play in the future of our young people is vital, and they must have support from all of us to succeed. I take this opportunity to recognise the hard work done by the former minister, the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, in the area of vocational and technical education. I know that achieving the Pilbara ATC was hard work, requiring great leadership and persuasion skills. However, required above all was tenacity and the ability to never countenance failure. I thank him for his interest in the Pilbara and the training of our young people there. He saw that Pilbara first hand on a number of occasions. Thanks and recognition must also go to the ATCP board and the Pilbara business community for its support and encouragement of this project. I commend this bill to the House.",134
185,Ms HALL,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I rise to support the position adopted by the opposition in relation to the establishment of tralian technical colleges in the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. This is the third time. I have stood in this House and spoken about Australian technical colleges. On the last occasion I spoke to legislation dealing with the Australian technical colleges-or ATCs as I will call them from now on-I made the point that this government introduces legislation into this parliament regularly, and we, as members of this House, find ourselves returning to the House time and time and time again to deal with that legislation simply because it does not get it right the first time. This is a pretty good example of a government failing to get it right the first time, as the legislation amends column 2 of the financial assistance table under subsection 18(4) of the act. In effect, it increases the total funding appropriated under the act-in other words, it costs more than they said it would. They did not do their costing properly; they did not do their homework. They made an announcement on the run during the election, and I will deal with that a bit more further into my contribution to this debate. As any sensible member of this parliament would, I support any initiative that will provide vocational training to young Australians and also address the chronic skills shortage we have in this country-a shortage that has developed because the Howard government have been asleep at the wheel. They have not paid attention to the climate and the needs of our nation. Unfortunately for the people of Australia, the government decided that they would introduce Australian technical colleges. This was not the most effective approach to solving the problem and not the most effective approach to ensuring that young people who wanted to undertake training in trades could actually do so. It was not Aus- the most effective way to address skills shortages, particularly when you consider that the first person to complete their training at an Australian technical college will not hit the ground until 2010. This was an idea that was floated in the 2004 election-six years from the date that the government came up with an idea to establish ATCs. I think that this idea of the ATCs was driven by two things: the 2004 election and the government being bereft of ideas and policies that they could announce during the election campaign. They thought that an Australian technical college was a good idea. This is the same government that has absolutely ripped dollar after dollar out of the TAFE system in the states. One of the first acts of this government was to cut funding to TAFE colleges. On the one hand they take away and now they have decided that they will establish an Australian technical college system that will go over the top of the TAFE system. I think it is also important to note at this point that the other aspect of it is the government's ideological hatred of the states. They look at any way that they can usurp power from or establish themselves over the top of the states. Rather than looking at what is best for the community, and for those young people who are attending school and wanting to train, they decide that they will take power from the states, put it into their own hands and not look at what the real picture is. What it is all about is training young Australians. What it is all about is addressing the skills shortage. I am afraid the government are awarded an F for their efforts in that area-an F for addressing the skills shortage and an F for truly providing young Australians with the opportunity to undertake traditional apprenticeships. As I have already mentioned, it was ill conceived and poorly planned. Because of the poor planning, we still have a situation where some technical colleges have not even been awarded. I would like to address some very serious issues previously raised by the member for Dobell. I was so concerned when I heard what he had to say that I thought I should check the facts. The member for Dobell attacked the New South Wales government. There is no surprise about that. I actually think that the only contribution that the member for Dobell makes in this House is to attack the New South Wales government or somebody who is not a member of this parliament. He said that the New South Wales government was refusing to sign the memorandum of understanding that would see the ATC on the Central Coast established. That is quite a serious thing to say, so I have checked the facts. I have been advised that the Department of Education and Trainingthat is, the New South Wales DET officersare in cooperative discussions with the Australian technical college proponents, they are working together and the process is moving along very nicely. There is total cooperation between all parties. There is no conflict at all. No-one is putting any delay into the process. It is all about working together and providing maximum opportunities for local students. That is what is happening. The member for Dobell really portrayed a picture that is not true. He said that the New South Wales government is refusing to sign the memorandum of understanding whilst all parties involved are working towards signing it. He also put a date for it to be signed. That date is 24 March. Members of this House may wonder why he chose 24 March. I am certain it was not because my daughter is getting married on 24 March. Rather, I think it is because it is the state election. I might say to the members of this House that the member for Dobell was obviously just playing blatant politics. I think it is an absolute disgrace that he could politicise a process that has taken so long to get to this point and that he could come down here and say that the state government is not cooperating and working to see that that ATC on the Central Coast is up and running. I think the member for Dobell should actually hang his head in shame. It is little wonder, I might say, that he is known on the coast as the Ghost of the Coast. Why? Because he has hidden his electorate office away where no-one can find him. I receive numerous phone calls from constituents asking where he is. I am even more concerned because, after the redistribution that has recently taken place in New South Wales, part of the electorate of Shortland that I previously represented has now moved into the Dobell electorate. Already I have been contacted by irate voters saying that they feel that it is very unfair that they are going to have to travel to the Tuggerah Business Park, I think it is, on the second floor. These are elderly people living on the Central Coast. I say to the Ghost of the Coast: how about taking politics out of this issue of getting the Central Coast ATC up and running and really showing that you are interested in the people of the Central Coast. I will go back to the more important aspect of this debate-the Australian technical colleges. I have previously stated that the announcement on ATCs by the government during the 2004 election smelt very much of a political fix. It looked to solve a policy problem rather than address the chronic skills shortages which existed then and which still exist in Australia today. The tralian Industry Group, which is very supportive of the government, has estimated that there is a skills shortage of around 100,000 people in Australia, and a large number of them are needed in the area of the traditional trades. I am very concerned about the government's response, which has been the establishment of ATCs rather than putting more money in the TAFE system. I am also very concerned about the other approach to dealing with the skills shortage-that is, apprentices being brought in from overseas. Neither of these approaches has been particularly popular in my area. The Shortland electorate straddles both the Central Coast and the Hunter. It is importhink tant to look at where these ATCs will be established and at whether or not they will assist students who live in the Shortland electorate. The Hunter ATC is going to be a joint venture between the Diocese of MaitlandNewcastle and the Hunter Valley Training Company. They are both outstanding organisations and have my 100 per cent support because they have done some wonderful work in the region. The ATC is set to commence this month, which is great news. It will have a multicampus, non-government school for years 11 and 12. Campuses will be in Maitland, Singleton and Newcastle. But that is the problem. How will a young person who lives in the Shortland electorate be able to access those ATCs? The people whom I represent in this House would benefit much more from the government putting money into TAFE colleges. As recently as last week, I was contacted by constituents in my electorate whose young sons wished to attend Belmont TAFE to do pre-apprenticeship courses-courses that have been run for a number of years and have been very successful. Unfortunately, because of the lack of funding going to TAFEs, the college was no longer able to run Austhese courses. So, instead of these young people doing a metal fabrication preapprenticeship course or an engineering preapprenticeship at Belmont TAFE, they now have to look at doing something else. It is very unfortunate that the government is pouring money into something that students living in the electorate that I represent will not be able to access. These students come from a background where they aspire to undertake apprenticeships. Their goal in life is to work in one of the traditional trades. But here you have a situation where people who would make outstanding tradespeople are being denied that opportunity. I will now turn to the Central Coast ATC. I the memorandum of understanding for that ATC will be signed very shortly. This college will enable students of years 11 and 12 to undertake trade training in engineering, construction, electrotechnology, automotives and commercial cookery. As the member for Dobell noted, it is being established by a local industry association, the Central Coast Manufacturers Association. Albany International, Kitchens of Sara Lee, ADC Krone, Gibbens Industries, Masterfoods, Adhesive Research, Gosfern, Thermit and Pacific Labels will all be involved in it. Delta Electricity, another partner in the Central Coast ATC, have been very proactive. In my last contribution to the debate on ATCs, I mentioned their involvement in the group training scheme. They have trained apprentices over a number of years. My community newsletter also had a story promoting the work of Delta Electricity and that of the group training scheme on the Central Coast in helping young people to undertake apprenticeships and qualify as tradespeople. Once again, I acknowledge the fine work achieved through the group training scheme and Delta Electricity. My real concern about the Central Coast ATC is that it will be located at Gosford. I forgive members of this House for being unaware of the distance between Gosford and, say, Gwandalan in the Shortland electorate. It would be extremely difficult for a young person in years 11 and 12 to travel from Gwandalan to Gosford to undertake training at the ATC. It would involve a lengthy bus trip, a train trip and then probably another bus trip at the other end. I would argue very strongly the case that young people will have limited access to these technical colleges. I want to return to the issue of skills shortages to paint a little picture of what they are like within my local area. On 5 September last year a release from DEWR said: The skills shortage in the Hunter's coal industry appears to be worsening. Mine contracting firm Allied Coal Services has spent the past 60 years placing workers in jobs in the state's mining sector. Managing director David Briggs says a recent nationwide recruitment drive only found 80 mine workers with experience, and only 25 per cent of those had the specialist skills needed for a job. He says the outlook is bleak, with the Hunter's mining work force getting older and few skilled younger workers entering the industry. I say that these ATCs are not going to do anything to help the mining industry that so desperately needs skilled workers in the Hunter. I would argue very strongly that the government needs to be much more proactive. They need to put aside their feelings of hatred for the states, forget the fact that there are Labor governments in power in the states and embrace and work with the states to try and solve the problem. In the remaining time, I will quickly touch again on a DEWR survey. Sixty-nine per cent of employers surveyed expect to recruit staff-this is in the Hunter in the next 12 months-and 59 per cent of those said that they do not expect to be able to fill those jobs. The survey covered all major industries and occupations and only 70 per cent of those vacancies were filled and the number of applicants for those jobs was very limited in the areas of skill. It is time for action. It is time for more than the ATCs to address this issue. It is time for the government to get real about skills shortages. It is time for the government to do something to address the issue. It is time for the government to make a real commitment to young Australians to ensure that they get the training they need. It is time for people like the member for Dobell to stop disgraceful political grandstanding, stop creating problems and acknowledge the fact that the state government is working with the federal government on the Central Coast.

186,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I rise to support the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 and strongly encourage all members to express their support for it. The Australian government's commitment to addressing areas of skills needs as a prerequisite to developing a skilled Australian workforce and keeping Australia's economic growth strong is well known. There are great skills needs throughout a number of traditional trades in Australia and, contrary to what the member for Shortland has just been espousing, it actually occurs when you have a strong economy and a 4.6 per cent unemployment ratesomething that the Labor Party can only dream of. We all know about and experienced through the 1990s Labor's destruction of the Australian economy, the destruction of businesses through record interest rates and over a million people unemployed. The member for Shortland needs to sit back and appreciate and remember those disastrous times. So as great a skills shortage as there in this county, it has actually occurred through a thriving economy. The Australian government is strongly committed to encouraging and supporting young Australians into trades and onto trade based self-employment or opening their own small businesses-another thing that the Labor Party has no comprehension of, no experience in and no understanding of what is required. The establishment of 25 Australian technical colleges in regions experiencing skills needs and higher than average rates of unemployment has demonstrated the Howard government's leadership in providing this type of future. A key concern for all businesses today is the need for a high level of quality productivity in the workplace. According to workplace studies conducted universally-in 2003 by the University of New South Wales, in 2004 by Monash University, in 2005 by Harvard University-one of the key factors that enhances productivity is the skill of the workforce to produce goods and services at a globally competitive performance level. We live in a world of globalisation. We live in a competitive world-something that we need to continually understand and appreciate as we move to a higher level of skills needs in this country. Studies undertaken by the Great Lakes Council in Pennsylvania, the Singapore government on behalf of the ITC system and Harvard University verify that trade based training led by industry, supported by education-and that is one concept that the Labor Party cannot seem to understand or grab hold of; this is a new concept of industry to education, not education to industry-provides a significant contributor to higher productivity outcomes in the workplace. The decision by the Australian federal Liberal government to introduce the industry led training initiative, is the ATCs, was one based upon the need for a skilled workforce that will be driving productivity and world's best practice processes into the future. Each of the 25 regions is different in aspirations, style and substance. By offering training in a specialised trade that is of particular relevance to the local region, and is in one of the industry groups which have been identified as a priority, the government has set the overall direction and strategies necessary to respond to the most significant challenge faced by Australian business in ensuring ongoing economic growth and development-that is, the training of more skilled workers to meet a growing demand by Australian businesses in order to remain competitive in the global economy. The establishment of the Australian technical colleges has provided a new approach to achieving this objective and forms an important part of the Australian government's overall strategy for tackling our skills needs. In promoting trade qualifications as a highly valued alternative to a university degree, and demonstrating that vocational education and training provides access to careers that are secure, lucrative and rewarding, the Australian government is actively raising the profile of vocational and technical education. The ATCs serve to address the skills needs of the Australian economy through the pursuit of a number of key goals. These include: the promotion of pride and excellence in trade skills training for young people; the provision of skills and education in a flexible learning environment in order to build a solid basis for secure and rewarding careers; the adoption of a new industry-led approach to providing education and training in partnership with local communities to meet regional labour market needs; the provision of trade training that is relevant to industry and that leads to nationally recognised qualifications through school based new apprenticeships; the provision of academic and vocational education which is relevant to trade careers and leads to a year 12 certificate; the provision of employability and business skills to young people, recognising that many successful apprentices will operate their own businesses; and the development of expertise in a range of industries in a region, with the flexibility to meet changing workforce and local industry needs. Students studying at the colleges will be provided with tuition in trade related vocational training, leading to a national training package qualification, and academic studies which allow them to complete their senior secondary education. This is a new way of developing and training for the future skills needs of our country where we are providing an apprenticeship, skills training and also pre-tertiary education. Students will commence a school based new apprenticeship in a trade in an industry where there is a need. They will have a strong foundation to continue with the preferred trade after they plete year 12 but will also keep open the option of going on to further academic study if they so choose. By promoting a strong career path in trade and occupations in key industries as a helpful and satisfying opportunity for young people, the Australian technical colleges play a pivotal role in raising the profile and status of vocational pathways. They offer high-quality training and facilities where capable and committed students who are interested in pursuing a rewarding career can start their vocational training. The colleges provide training which is relevant to industry and which leads to nationally recognised qualifications relevant to trade careers and further academic study if students so choose. The colleges provide employability and business skills to young people and develops expertise in a range of industries in a region with the flexibility to meet changing workforce and local industry needs tailored to the needs and challenges of each individual region. The flexibility offered by the Australian technical colleges to tailor arrangements to local needs is especially valuable. It is what makes this new form of education so valuable to the regions that they will be located in. As noted earlier, the Australian technical colleges are able to offer training in specialised trades of particular relevance to a local region or to one of the industry groups which have been identified by the Australian government as a priority. Each Australian technical college provides both academic and vocational technical education as well as the opportunity for each student to commence a school based apprenticeship in a trade. Australian technical colleges are for students in years 11 and 12. Students enter into school based apprenticeships in the trades at the certificate III level. This leads to a nationally recognised qualification. Students study academic subjects leading to a year 12 certificom- cate and also gain IT, employability and business skills, enabling them to run their own businesses if they desire. Thus students learn a trade whilst studying towards their year 12 certificate; and, if they choose to, study subjects which would give them the option to go onto university. After listening to the member for Shortland, I suggest that she sits down to read about and understand what these new Australian technical colleges will provide. I should probably say that not only to the member for Shortland but the majority of the Labor opposition. These new colleges will provide an incentive for more students to stay on at school and will encourage more students to pursue a trade qualification. They expand student choice by providing another pathway to a career involving trades. Facilities and educational services offered by the colleges are high quality, establishing them as centres of excellence in trade training, thereby raising the profile of vocational and technical education in schools and strengthening the training system as a whole. The colleges play an important role in expanding school based apprenticeships, particularly in the traditional trades area. The unique and sustainable quality of the Australian government models insists that local industry and community representatives have a leadership role in the governance of each of the colleges. The direct involvement of industry and community leaders ensures that the skills taught to students match those skills required by local businesses. Students will be trained in these skills through an Australian school-based apprenticeship which will lead to a nationally recognised qualification. At the same time, students will also complete the academic subjects required for their year 12 certification. These bills do not support an untried method or model. The ATC model, which seems to be misunderstood by those on the other side in this House, considers successes that have already been recorded globally. For example, similar education facilities exist in Pennsylvania, USA; the Institute of Technical Education, Singapore; Malaysia; Holland; and the UK. They have verified and quantified results validating the important contribution an industry-led training model makes towards business's long term economic sustainability. I would like to quote one of the key findings from the Singapore government's review of the ITE college, an industry-led trade training school. It said: ‘The quality of the workforce is an essential prerequisite for an organisation's sustainable growth. Business competitiveness is possible only if the workforce can produce products and services at a highly productive level.' Industry-led training brings industry skills into education, providing a high level of knowledge transfer between both disciplines. Such an approach has a strong following as the most effective method of training for the trades being targeted by the Australian technical colleges model. The training model ensures our young people have the best prospects for employment due to the high level of relevancy their training has to the industries which will employ them. This training model ensures that our businesses have the best skilled workers, which are the core of a high level of industry productivity and a sustainable economy. This is a model that is flexible, evolving and relevant to local regional skill needs. It is a model that is transforming training and education in this country today. The Australian technical colleges differ from current schools and TAFE in that they provide students with the opportunity to pursue trades training, leading to a nationally accredited qualification, as well as complete their senior secondary education. Students at colleges will have the opportunity to commence an Australian school based apprenticeship. Such a model in turn supports the long-term prosperity of each of the regions in which the colleges are located and, of course, assists Australian businesses to remain competitive in a global economy such that exists today. The Australian technical colleges offer an alternative model of training, through the provision of high-quality training and facilities, thus further increasing Australia's vocational and technical education system and, at the same time, providing more choices and more opportunities for our young people. The bill also requires states to take action to maximise choice for employers and new apprentices so that they can choose the most relevant, flexible and convenient training for their particular needs. Maximising Australia's skills base is a high priority for industry, particularly in the traditional trades like gineering, electro-technology, building and construction, as well as in new and emerging technologies such as photonics and nanotechnology. Through this bill, the Australian government is demonstrating its commitment to high-quality, nationally consistent education and training and to working closely with industry to find solutions. Something that the Labor Party has great difficulty in coming to terms with is actually working with industry to find solutions. The Australian government is committed to highquality, nationally consistent education and training. By working closely with business and industry at all levels, the ernment has fostered a national collaboration and engagement which will undoubtedly lead to improved success within Australia's training system. The bill will make available some $343.6 million over the period to 2009 to support the establishment and operation of the 25 colleges. This supplementary funding will support infrastructure development as well as the additional costs associated with the delivery of the specialised services which the colleges will provide. This funding is over and above other general recurrent funding which colleges will be eligible to receive from the Australian government under the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 and recurrent funding provided by state and territory governments. The Howard government's commitment to vocational and technical education is illustrated by the significant funding provided through this bill, which will further increase Australia's vocational and technical education system and deliver improved vocational training to young people throughout this nation, which will create a future for them to enjoy. It will allow them to grow and take enthis country forward in the years to come. I commend this bill to the House.",142
187,Mr HATTON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Blaxland) (6.10 pm)Here is a quick quiz. When do you know that someone on the government side who has read the entire speech does not know what they are talking about? You know when they talk about ‘photo-onics' instead of photonics. What is brought to this debate by people on the government side is a lack of knowledge, a lack of understanding and a lack of experience in the education sector. Maybe we should ask them at question time to stick their hands up if they actually have experience as a teacher. There are more on this side Australian govthan on that side. Mr Baker-I have.",146
188,Mr HATTON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"Certainly not in photonics. I could guess that-otherwise you might know what the discipline is. I had 10 years as an English history teacher-and in fact have a master in both of those subjects-at the De La Salle College in Bankstown. I also taught diploma entrance I and diploma entrance II at Bankstown Technical College. So I not only have some idea of how the education system works at the secondary level, in years 7 to 10, but also a pretty good knowledge, gained from the five or so years that I taught at Bankstown TAFE, about the difficulties faced by those people who did not complete their secondary education when they first had the chance-those students who come in as mature age students who realise that they missed an opportunity while they were doing their secondary education. They come in after work and commit themselves to try to increase their level of capacity by getting further qualifications-whether that is certificate entrance I or II or diploma entrance I or II-with a view to getting equivalent qualifications to either the school certificate or the HSC, at that point in time. There were also the students who realised that they did not have available to them an appropriate education in the trades area in the schools that they went to. Over a long period of time now, we have seen a fundamental transition in terms of what is provided at the school level and at the TAFE level and what is no longer provided on a vast scale by the major trainers of young employees, our major apprenticeship sources, such as Telstra-the old Telecom, which was the Postmaster-General's Department when my brother Kerry went there. At the end of fourth year at school in the old system in New South Wales, he did four and a half or five years full training at the Redfern Institute of the Postmaster-General's Department and came out as a fully qualified PNG technician and spent his entire working life in that area. He retired a while ago and now he is doing a series of other things. His experience was the experience of many people of his generation-the preWyndham generation-where going into the trades was virtually the only option for most people, particularly those coming from an Irish Catholic background in Bankstown. You could not front up and expect to gain entry into most of the professions, because you could not get into the universities in the first place. So forget about being a doctor, lawyer, dentist and all the rest of it; for of the people who came from Bankstown in my era it just was not on. That is why the former member for Blaxland, Paul Keating, left school at the age of 15 and pursued electrical engineering. Where at? Bellmore tech, because that was available to him to do his training. That is where he connected with the Electrical Trades Union. That is where he got his fundamental understanding of and interest in engineering. That is why when you heard him speak as Treasurer and as Prime Minister, when he talked about the levers of power et cetera, you may have noticed that he used a series of motifs which were engineering based. That is how he understood the world. That is also part of the reason why, apart from being influenced by the local nature of Bankstown-speak and the people he ran around with, not only with the ETU but also in the other places that he worked-which were pretty rough and ready, very much working-class and running back to Cockney and so on-the vibrancy of what he had to say rested on saying it from a different point of view, as well as coming from a different milieu. But for Paul, and for virtually everybody he went to school with, there were not the options in higher education. There were no options, either, in terms of where you would go. Almost the only other place to go was a safe place in the Public Service. You could become a copper and work in certain parts of the police force-the ones that were not run by the Masons; the ones that were run by the Catholics-or you could go into particular government departments and become a clerk. You would sign up to the Federated Clerks Union, which was a Catholic union in a Catholic stratum of the Public Service. What was available to people otherwise? The option was to work as a labourer in the local factories or to work as a tradesperson, if they got the chance, if they most picked up an opportunity to become an electrician, as did the former member for Kingsford Smith, Laurie Brereton. He became a fully qualified electrician. Leo MCLeay, the former member for Watson did. Leo worked with the PMG, as my brother Kerry did. They got their training on the job and at TAFE. What they understood intimately was how important it was for people to get a really good education in the trades, because that built their chance for the future. In the fifties and sixties in Western Sydney there was no way up and no way to improve the lifestyle of your family unless two fundamental things happened. You had to break the back of the discrimination against Irish Catholics in Australia and break the back of employment discrimination. You could only apply to work in certain jobs; there were only certain parts that you were allowed into. You were not allowed into the upper echelons. There was a glass ceiling, not just for females but for just about everybody. It worked on the basis of capacity to pay. It worked on the basis that you could get your entry point if you could pay. If you came from a wealthy background then you might be able to break through. To his eternal credit, Gough Whitlam broke the back of that disadvantage by allowing people from poor backgrounds into the system. Australia is immensely wealthier as a country and richer in all senses because he did that. How dare the government attempt to reinstitute Dickensian, 19th-century notions, not only through their industrial relations reforms, which are all about the Master and Servant Act, but in the education area as well. Look at the changes they have made to the HECS program, particularly in maths and science. We have said we will address that directly and forcefully to deal with the dramatic decline in Australia in statisticians, in mathematically trained people and in science trained people, not only as teachers but across all areas of industry and all areas of the Public Service. There is a dramatic shortfall. This mob has tried to make education a privilege again, and a privilege for those people who can buy their way into the future. I have had to sit here and listen, time time, when this bill has come before us, to speeches about their 24 technical colleges. At one stage they made it 25 but I think we are back to about 24. We are told that three of them are open. Whoop-whoop! Isn't that great? Here is a quick quiz: when will the first fully qualified person emerge from one of those technical colleges? 2010. Where are we now? My guess is that we are at the start of 2007. It will be another three years before we see the emergence of anyone from those colleges. I will claim to be guilty on a number of counts on a range of things but I cannot claim to be guilty of agreeing with John Howard in relation to much-the member for Bennelong, a former Treasurer and the current Prime Minister. But I have to claim guilt in terms of one thing: I cannot condemn the idea of these technical colleges. They are a 1950s approach to education. This I will fully confess: I think it is right to concentrate on technical and further education. I was the first person in my family to go to university. To get there I had to win scholarships to go to fifth and sixth form and I had to win a Commonwealth scholarship to go to university. We could not afford it otherwise. I still worked my way through. I was privileged to do it and privileged to have the opportunity to work at it and to break through. In the first part of the Wyndham program, pre Whitlam, there was an avenue-but a very small one-for those people who could either get a Commonwealth teaching scholarship or gain sponsorship from companies. Hardly anyone in my family understood why I wanted to spend my life learning out of books, given that we were a small business family. We were a working-class family, where people either worked for others or ran their own businesses. Historically, on both sides, that is exactly what we have done. People understood that you laboured and after worked as hard as you could for your daily bread. They could not understand another world that they had not had entry to, where you could do things using what a university gave you access to-not just teaching but the rest of it. It was a foreign world. For a lot of people, it meant that they needed to learn about that. In the seven years between Paul Keating and me and the three and a half years between me and my older brother, Kerry, the world opened up for others. But it opened up for those people who had a chance to get trade training-for example, with the State Rail Authority. In Chullora, at the great rail yards there, they taught people boilermaking, metalwork and sheet work. Now they are teaching people again. In carpentry, for example, they have two tremendous facilities. One deals with domestic carpentry and the other is the only place in Sydney where people are taught to work on building manystoreyed buildings. That facility has just opened, and it is the centrepiece for the whole of Sydney. Some features of the work that went on in the past can be seen there now, and they are related in particular to gathering up people who cannot find a place elsewhere. But this is within the context of the most massive skills crisis we have seen. This is a result of a decade's worth of the most significant employers of apprenticesTelstra, the SRA and every major employer-having got right out of that game. The end, in the last 10 years, for those kids who wanted to get trade training was to get into a situation under the Liberals in which they got a cut-down version of the whole show: Dr Kemp's traineeships-the poor man's version of a full apprenticeship. The skills crisis that we have is very directly related to that. The federal government blame it all on the states, but it is the federal government who have to bear the responsibility. What have they left out of the equation, which is so fundamental to this? It is the fact that without a full-blooded apprenticeship system operating, one that is as deep and strong as that we used to have in the past, you will not get fully qualified, knowledgeable people coming out and we will have a dramatic dearth of tradies. I am 55 years of age. Guess what the average age of tradespeople is in Australia? It is 55. I bet their ages will just keep going up with mine. But we are reaching a critical crisis point. As those people retire, unless they are kept in chains forever-and they cannot be kept in there at the wheel for forever and a day-with our ageing population, we will not have those people in the workforce. They will not be there as skilled tradespeople, and they will not be there as trade teachers either. We face a massive crisis in that area, which will continue the skills crisis. What is the government's remedy for this? I think it is entirely farcical. The government has argued its remedy over 10 years. It started with the good Dr Kemp and has been continued by a series of government spokesmen, including the recently demoted minister, who spoke on this bill in December and who got the flick. He is now a parliamentary secretary, but he has been given the title of assistant minister for a bit of face saving. Why did he get the flick? Why was he demoted? Was it the fact that this whole scheme, this travesty of 24 places Australia wide, has been so poorly run and so poorly put together to provide a token technical college system for Australia? This is the government of tokenism. It is a government putting up a facade. It is like the Soviet Union in the 1950s when, in Joe Stalin's era, they used to run people down the major thoroughfares in Moscow and it was a cardboard city. They had whole avenues full of cardboard cut-outs to make it look like they were a prosperous country, that there was a great deal of activity, that there had been fresh building and so on. Behind the facade, you found that there was virtually nothing. The Communists in Russia at that time had the temerity to argue that they were the great new society and were well in front of the West not only in terms of dealing with their people but also in the way in which they trained people and in the whole gamut of things that you could compare East and West on during the Cold War. But the reality was that they were as hollow at the core as this coalition government is. At this time, all you get out of the mouths of those in the government are claims that Labor does not speak for tradespeople, Labor does not care about technical colleges, Labor only cares about university education and that is all it ever cared about. That is so verse to Labor's entire history, which is based upon building everything we do on the basis of attempting to improve the lives of working people in Australia. What we did in the period of our last government was to attempt to reshape technical and further education in Australia and to reshape the whole way in which the states went about getting together and cooperating with each other so that kids could go from one end of the country to the other and have their qualifications. So glacial is the approach to this problem that, more than 10 years later, this government still have not fixed it. It is almost tickcountant ing over to 11 years that they have been in the joint. They have not fixed the problem of kids in Western Australia not being able to take their qualifications from one state to the other. They have not fixed it in relation to teachers either. The state bureaucracies are simply Antarctic in this regard. Melting them down takes a great deal of time. I know; I was part of trying to do it. But this mob have not put the heat on them in order to get those kinds of results. But to campaign, as they have time after time in this House, on the basis that Labor does not care about trade training is purely and simply crazy. It is ridiculous. We understand that it is a betrayal of the Australian people and of the 300,000 young kids who should have had access to full trade training, apprenticeships and even the modified traineeships over the past 10 years but who have not had that because the funding to the states has been cut back. It has been cut back in the health and education areas. Those people have been absolutely betrayed and this government has sought stopgap measures to deal with the skills crisis by bringing in plasterers en bloc from China. I know that because in this very area, in the block of flats I am living in now, I saw ad- some of these guys. It was in the middle of the afternoon and I thought: ‘Who are these guys? Do they have a ticket? No. Do they have vests on? No. Do they have work boots on? No. Do they have hardhats? No.' They were covered in plaster. It was about an hour and half after everyone else was out of the joint. They were aged between about 22 and 50. And I really understood for the very first time what the government's program was with their 457 visas. There are over a quarter of a million people on those visas, which used to be exclusive to major international companies who needed a specialised acto come here for four years, for example. This is a farcical, hollow government that has utterly betrayed the Australian people and all the young people who should have been allowed the opportunity to have trade training for the future. I have to confess to actually agreeing with the 1950s approach to technical colleges. It is the one good thing to come out of this. Our education system Australia wide has not properly adjusted to the realities of the 21st century. There are not the proper opportunities, except in certain places, for kids to do full trade training while they are going to school. I actually think the old model of technical high school, where you get a comprehensive education and full trade training is the proper thing to do. That is how I would change the system if I had the capacity to do so. That is what I will continue to argue for. I saw that in operation in Holland in 1975-32 years ago-and it worked magnificently. The Dutch, after a bit of experimentation over the last few years, have come back fully to what works extraordinarily well. We know, from the late 1980s, the Carmichael report and the work that was done based on that, that the work done in Europe had been taken note of by the Hawke and Keating governments, and they were putting into place a restoration of technical education in Australia because of its primary importance. What have also been lost over the last 10 years are the opportunities to have Australians trained in Australia by other Australians while the skills could still be communicated, to build jobs and industries that are Australian and to export those skills to the region. Instead of doing that, we have imported all of those skills into our region. Our country has been impoverished because of a lazy ideological and hollow government that does not have any fundamental concern for the Australian people. It should be booted out at the first opportunity. (Time expired)",146
189,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I welcome the opportunity to speak this afternoon on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. This bill will increase the amount of total funding appropriated under the act from $343.6 million to $456.2 million over the period 2005-09. While we on this side of the House generally support the bill, I, along with my colleagues, have some strong reservations about the government's approach to enhancing vocational training and education. We will not oppose this bill, because we do not want to play a political game and deter any steps which may improve the skills base-steps that are desperately needed to be taken in this country. In my opinion, responsibility for the current skills crisis lies fairly and squarely at the feet of the Howard government. The government has had its head in the sand for 10 long years as our skills crisis has continued to grow. It has been warned time and time again. As our competitor economies invest heavily in their education systems, our government has been pulling funding out. Instead of funding our nation's excellent TAFE colleges, this government has gone about setting up a whole new level of bureaucracy to duplicate vocational training services already offered through the TAFEs in the states. In fact, we raised this issue when the bill was first debated in this place some time ago now. If only this government had invested this money into the state TAFE systems we could have had graduates a lot sooner. As it stands, under the technical colleges program, we will not see our first tradesperson graduate until 2010 at the earliest, even later here in my local region. The Australian technical colleges represent a bandaid solution to Australia's skill crisis. It is just too little and too late, with a very, very long lead time. As I move around my electorate and the region, skills shortages and their impacts on the local economy are brought to my attention. The skills crisis is an inevitable part of any discussion about the long-term economic prosperity of the region and of our nation. I know that if I go to the hairdresser or if I talk to people from the local chamber of commerce-all sorts of people in my community and in this region-they always bring up at some point the question of skills shortage and the desperate need to be doing something about it. I am greatly concerned that this government has allowed its ideology on industrial relations to delay the establishment of some of these technical colleges. In particular, I am concerned about the delays in the opening of the Queanbeyan college, which was announced in September 2004, to service the Southern Highlands region, the ACT and the region around the ACT. Despite being announced almost 2½ years ago, we do not have one student enrolled in the Queanbeyan Technical College. There is not one student studying to be a plumber, a carpenter, a mechanic, a hairdresser, a bricklayer or anything else, for that matter, and there is not one student on their way to realising their dream of attaining a trade. You must say, after 2½ years, that it is a fairly slow way of doing something about the skills shortage in this region. In fact, the recently replaced minister, the member for Moreton, announced the successful tenderer only in November last year. No wonder the Prime Minister moved him on. It took him over two years to find an operator for the Queanbeyan college, and we still do not have one student enrolled. I understand that the Queanbeyan college is due to open some time in 2008, so we will be waiting until at least 2012 before we see our first graduate. There is only one reason for the delay in addressing the skills crisis that is impacting on our region, and that reason is the government's ideological obsession with its extreme industrial relations laws. Back in April of last year, then Minister Hardgrave's office was quoted in the Canberra Times as saying: …the Queanbeyan region would have to wait for its college because the Government did not want the NSW Government's involvement in the leading bid. He went on to say: …the strong bid would have to be restructured but was still preferred over the second bid lacked strength. That was in April 2006. The only reason this government rejected a bid by a local Queanbeyan consortium-the Capital Region Business Enterprise Centre, which included the NSW Department of Education-was that that consortium refused to put their staff onto AWAs, the same AWAs that are stripping workers of their penalty rates, overtime rates and other essential conditions all over the country, and the same AWAs that we believe are of some concern to a great number of Australian workers. This is further proof that there are no choices under Work Choices. The government, I believe, put its obsession with these IR laws before the needs of local businesses and students and the long-term prosperity of the ACT and the Southern Highlands and delayed the project. It was not until 1 November 2006 that Minister Hardgrave announced the successful tenderer for the operation of the Queanbeyan college. It is not at all surprising that the successful tenderer is not the local consortium which had refused to take part in that IR agenda. I do not know what process was used by the minister to choose another tenderer; no-one seems to know. Is it the second bid which the minister said ‘lacked strength'? Did this government choose the successful tenderer based on their compliance with the IR agenda over the quality educational outcomes for local students and businesses? I do not know, and I cannot seem to find any other possible answer. We have lost another almost two years on this project because of the obsession by this government in relation to the AWA question. I know that many people in the region's business community are not impressed with this government's what I would call ‘petty politicking' over the Queanbeyan college. Local students are not impressed either, nor are the local governments in the region or the which chambers of commerce-at least, not the ones I speak to. We have all been let down badly by this government's mishandling of the project. As I said earlier, it is a pity that some of this money had not been put into the TAFE system, the system that is already up and running. In Canberra, our TAFE is called CIT, the Canberra Institute of Technology. I want to refer in passing to three programs that that particular institution is running because of the skill shortage. They have attempted to make up and bring on stream faster than usual some outcomes for students, and all of these programs relate to areas of dramatic skills shortage. The first program I want to talk about is their chefs program. It is an tensive training program and includes a workplace training component. The four-year training program has been reduced to two years, and it is extremely successfull. Its comes are very highly regarded, and it is producing very productive, well-qualified people in an accelerated time purely because it can see the need and they want to do it. I also want to talk about enrolled nurses. At CIT, if students have a Certificate IV in Health (Nursing), they can access an intensive bridging program of 150 hours in a block over two weeks. Credits are then given to move to the second year of the three-year degree in collaboration with the Catholic University here in the ACT. This is another area of desperate skill shortage and an example of something positive that is being done. The third area I want to talk about is also of extreme importance, and that is allied health. We in this place hear everywhere we go about the shortage of qualified people in the area of allied health. The ACT department of health and the Department of Disability, Housing and Community Services have developed a Certificate IV in Allied Health Assistance. The people involved might already be in the workforce, but they need their skills increased to carry out further advanced work. We are talking about allied health areas such as speech pathology, occupational therapy and other similar areas that are desperately in need. This training can be done while these people are still in the workforce. They may be participating in the workforce at that lower level and want to increase their competency; we desperately need them to do so. Because they can undertake further study while they are working, they are actually freeing up university places. It is a very progressive program for an area of desperate need in the country due to the skills shortage. When we are talking about the skills shortage, certainly we are talking about in- plumbers, motor mechanics and a range of other people, but also we are talking about nurses and allied health workers, all of whom are desperately needed to deliver seroutvices to our communities. I commend CIT for their progressive way of looking at how to improve the training programs they offer. Would it not have been a better idea to see the money that is supposedly going into these colleges given to a process like that? How much more inventive could they be if they had those resources? Rather, in the local case, I understand that the resources are sitting around doing nothing while we wait for the development of this college. Like the rest of Australia, the Canberra region is in the grip of a major skills crisis. We need urgent investment in our skills base and not some bizarre obsession by this government with their industrial relations agenda, which is ruling how these colleges may or may not come on stream. Unlike the Howard government, we would work with the states and territories to implement the necessary advances in technical training, particularly through our secondary school and TAFE systems around the nation. Australia absolutely needs a more systematic approach to addressing our skills needs than what is being offered by the technical colleges program. It is a very important issue and one that we should be able to deal with in a competent, honest and progressive way. I talk to people from around the country, and business owners, students and the local Canberra Chamber of Commerce alike speak about the need for training opportunities to address the skills crisis and to improve employment opportunities for Australian workers. As the examples I have given show, it is no different in my own region. We need skills training and we need it now. We do not need a government that will only come up with a solution if it fits a box of a particular shape and size. If it does not fit, then it fails to get legs; it does not get an opportunity. I really hope that the government can see its way to liberating itself and allowing these colleges to come on stream quickly if that is what they want to do and to not criticising this side of the parliament when we come up with ideas and views about how we might implement programs in this country to improve the skills shortage. I thank CIT for the examples they have given. I hope that we see honest investment in the tertiary level of education so that vocational training can actually improve and that we see absolute determination to attack the skills crisis in this country in a bipartisan and honest fashion.",151
190,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I rise to support the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006 and the amendment moved by the shadow minister for education and training. I concur with the member for Canberra that much of the motivation of the government in relation to this matter has been driven by an ideological blindness-its hatred of collective agreements and unions. That was clear from day 1, when it was a condition of the establishment of colleges that they offer Australian workplace agreements. Never mind the title of the Work Choices legislation introduced by the government. In relation to this matter, in an area of the education and training portfolio, the government is using taxpayers' money to force people onto particular industrial instruments whether they want to be part of that or not. There is no choice at all. I have said that time and time again. This is, of course, the third opportunity I have had to speak about the Australian technical colleges proposition. It is the second amendment to the original bill that was moved in this place in 2005. It arose from policy on the run by the Prime Minister during the 2004 election when, out of the blue, and probably written on the back of a beer coaster, the Prime Minister put a proposition together which had no comprehensive detail whatsoever. It was just a suggestion so that there could be a slogan or a media release for the election that was held in late 2004. Notwithstanding the way in which the government has chosen to go about introducing Australian technical colleges, I can assure the government and every member here that I will do everything I can to ensure that the Sunshine Australian Technical College will be a success. Whilst I do not accept the premise upon which it has been established, and I do not accept the way in which the government has decided to introduce pernicious provisions that force employeesteachers and other ancillary staff-to be on individual contracts, I want to see more young people in western Melbourne given the opportunity to acquire the skills they need to maintain employment for their working lives. So I will do everything I can to ensure that does occur. As I indicated yesterday to Andrew Wilkinson, the appointed chief executive officer and principal of the Sunshine college-a fledgling college but one that has at least commenced-I want to visit him and speak with him about what we can do to increase the number of students who are there. At the moment, there is a very small cohort of students; it is nowhere near the target of 300 that the Prime Minister and the former Minister for Vocational and Technical Education indicated in their speeches. But if any young person in western Melbourne can successfully finish an accredited course and improve their opportunities for work, I will certainly support that. It is not surprising to me that the government has paid lip-service to this area. As I said earlier, it started with a media release during an election campaign. From that point on, there was an effort by the government to backfill and to develop some plan around that media release. It was left to the former Minister for Vocational and Technical Education to explain why the government had not properly considered the way in which this should be done. Indeed, the last opportunity the former minister had to speak as a minister in this place was when he introduced this bill, which will amend the substantive legislation that was introduced and passed in 2005. One would have to ask: if this policy is as successful as government members claim, why is it that the Prime Minister chose to sack that minister? Why is it that the member for Moreton now finds himself on the back bench after overseeing this area of policy? Why was he not even afforded the opportunity to be a quasi-minister-one of those assistant minister positions that have been given to the members for Parkes and Sturt? The member for Moreton has been sacked from the front bench halfway through the process of developing the Australian technical colleges. We have to conclude either that the Prime Minister and the government consider this area of policy an abject failure and they are embarrassed about failing to properly construct these colleges or that the former minister was asked to resign for other reasons-perhaps so that we would be able to see the theatrical genius of the member for Wentworth. The point is this: the former minister was to oversee the 24 colleges announced by the Prime Minister during the election in 2004, he introduced the bill in 2005, he introduced an amendment in 2006, and he introduced this amendment to the substantive legislation on 7 December last year-the last day of sitting last year. Between his introducing this bill into this place and our debating it today, the former minister has been dismissed by the Prime Minister of this country. We have to wonder why that occurred. I have to say: I do not know what is in the head of the Prime Minister with respect to why he dismissed the former minister, but I can understand some disquiet amongst government members about the failure of the Australian technical colleges insofar as their being developed and being on-stream for young people across this nation. We heard last year that there was a so called ATC established in Gladstone which had one student being trained-and the government had the cheek to call that a college. I would not call that a college. I would say good luck to the one student who was being taught and trained, if that were the case, but clearly this is an example of failure by this government to fulfil the commitments that were uttered by the Prime Minister during the 2004 election. The government has failed to fulfil those. Whilst there might well be 16 of the 24 Australian technical colleges commencing in some way, shape or form by the end of this year, that is hardly sufficient for those areas that are crying out for these types of resources. There are young people across the nation in regional and rural Australia, and in the area that I represent in western Melbourne, who need to acquire skills. We know the government concede there is a skills shortage. They choose not to blame themselves; it is always somebody else's fault. But there seems to be a consensus that this country has a skills shortage and the government seek to boast that they might at some point, by the end of this year, have 16 of 24 colleges commencing. I do not think that is good enough. If we do have a crisis, and I think it is fair to say that we do have crisis in the area of skills shortages in workno places across this country, then the government must attend to that crisis in a much more expeditious manner than the way in which they have treated this area. That is one of the problems Labor has with this. Clearly, there has been an attempt to entwine the need to spend money in this area-technical learning and the technical skills that are required-with the government's pursuit of individual contracts. As the member for Canberra indicated, that has probably caused some delay because there would be some people who would not join a consortia that would force employees to sign individual contracts. That might be one of the reasons. The other main reason for the failure by the government to get these 24 colleges up quickly enough is that it has not sincerely concerned itself with the plight of young Australians and their needs in the area of skills. The government has sacked the minister who was responsible for this area and replaced him with a new minister. Whilst I feel for the member for Morton-because I cannot see, on the face of it, why he was worse than many others in discharging his duties-I hope the new minister listens to the concerns that we have in this place and acts to respond to the problems that we have highlighted-in particular, in the case of Sunshine Australian Technical College, providing every resource to that college and to the partners that are involved in that project to accelerate the number of places that are available for young people in western Melbourne as quickly as possible. No doubt members that represent constituents wherever these colleges are located would feel the same as I do, because it is not good enough for the government to talk about a target of 300 young people to be trained in a college and then for the member of the particular area to find that the target a seems to be a long way off and that there is guarantee that the target will be fulfilled. So there needs to be more assistance provided to the people in these colleges. I am not in any way pointing the finger at the people who are attempting to establish this at the college level. I am sure many of them are very good education providers, with a history of teaching. I wish them well but I think the government has to now match its rhetoric about attending to the skills crisis in this country and to match its rhetoric about its concerns for the young people and their needs to be properly skilled so that they can be gainfully employed through their entire working lives. These are the things that the government needs to do, and they have not satisfied me or the other members on this side. The purpose of this bill is to provide for an additional $112 million, between the years of 2005 and 2009, for the establishment and operation of the ATCs-in other words, to add an extra $112 million to the original budget. Agreements have been signed, as I understand it, for establishing 21 of the 24 colleges that were proposed. I understand that five commenced last year and 16 will be in operation by the end of 2007. What I need to know and what I am sure other members would like to know is what ‘in operation' means. Is it like the case of Gladstone, where we are talking about one student in a college, or is it about more than one? I think it is probably fair for the government to start giving us the numbers of students that are being placed into these colleges. The questions that I have for the new Minister for Vocational and Further Education are: what is the target enrolment for the Sunshine Australian Technical College; how was this target determined; how many students have actually enrolled this year; how many teachers have been employed at the Sunshine Australian Technical College; how many of those teachers have been employed using Australian workplace agreements; what is the total cost of running the Sunshine Australian Technical College; what, if any, new facilities have been constructed or are planned to be reconstructed on the Sunshine ATC site; and, what is the cost and/or projected cost of these facilities? Those are some of the questions that I will be placing on the Notice Paper and directing to the minister. I would be much happier if he were able to respond to me in summing up the legislation. I do not hold out much hope of that happening but I will certainly formally direct those questions about my concerns about the Sunshine Australian Technical College to the minister. This has been a disaster from the beginning. I think the intent in terms of getting young people into the colleges is good; however, it was conceived in a very rash manner. It was conceived in order to provide for an election campaign media release that would create a spin to show the Howard government concerning itself with people needing technical skills. Then it had a little bit of a twist to it because it also coercively required employees to be forced onto Australian workplace agreements. Those things have led to a failure to fulfil the demands that are out there. As I said, if taxpayers' dollars are going be spent looking after young people in my electorate, I will do everything I can to assist. I was there on 1 March 2005 when the then minister came to my electorate to announce the college. I was not notified-I have to make that clear-but I did find out that the minister was coming to the electorate of Gorton, I was in attendance, I spoke to the minister at that time and I said I would assist and I would be constructive. I will continue to be so on the ground, but I will need to see that the government is fair dinkum about these colleges and that it really will be looking to increase the amount of students that will be trained at the Sunshine Technical College before I can start to convince others that this government has a great concern about our young people and their needs.",154
191,Ms GRIERSON,AUSTRALIAN TECHNICAL,"I also rise to speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006, which seeks to appropriate another $112.6 million for the establishment and operation of the Howard government's Australian technical colleges network. The total funding under the act for the period 2005-09 will come to a grand sum of $456.2 million once this legislation is passed-half a billion dollars of investment, and of course too little to show for it. I have to say, having worked a lifetime in education, that half a billion dollars well directed into the good things that are happening in schools, TAFEs, industry, partnerships and cluster networks would have been exceptionally well spent; but with this, unfortunately, we look at that half a billion dollars and say, ‘Where has it gone?' We are not opposing this bill. I will be supporting the amendment moved by the member for Perth because we do need to make a close examination of the govern to ment's failures in skills and vocational education and training, and its neglect of the TAFE sector. We need to examine the failure of this government to deliver outcomes in skills and the wasted opportunities that have been associated with the ATC program. These technical colleges were announced at the 2004 election. The public get cynical about election cycles these days. They do not perhaps believe that what is offered will always deliver the best outcomes or even be delivered, and this one is pretty typical. In the 2004 election framework the Howard government finally woke up to the skills crisis, which has been costing our economy millions for some time. The announcement was typically just a political fix. It has now taken three years to get that political solution, that political fix, off the ground, and still will not produce a graduate until 2010. The world moves on and unfortunately the government does not seem to reflect reality and the real world very often. Seven months ago I spoke on a similar bill. It also appropriated more money for the ATC scheme and was another indication of how the implementation of this scheme has been mishandled. It is looking very dangerously like the Job Network roll-out, with continual bailouts of money, money, money with very little change, and that is regrettable. The scheme is, unfortunately, a duplication of resources which could be better used in existing structures like TAFEs and traditional apprenticeships. That is the approach Labor will take in government. The Howard government is on an absolute mission. It is entering into a kind of federalism that I think the public of Australia will not welcome. You cannot just use the big stick. You cannot just decide you will have a federal tier of operation when state operations are already out there. The public are sick of duplication, and schemes like the Australian technical colleges just create a duplicate layer of administration. They do not exist in cooperation with any of the existing state structures like TAFEs, which do such a wonderful job, and they do not at this stage tap in well to those wonderful industry links that exist in hard working regionsregions that have always had investment in skills as their priority. They were set up with a great emphasis on exclusion, not inclusion. For example, when it was announced in my electorate that ATCs were going to be become a possible solution, the whole field in Newcastle looked at it in the cooperative way they always do. There were thoughts that our TAFE; our manufacturing industry cluster group, HunterNet; and the group training companies that run off that industry cluster group would look at that and it say, ‘How can we take this and make it really work for the Hunter?' But they found that there is an ideological barrier linked into this legislation. They found that the government has written into this legislation some restrictions. You cannot put in for this if you are going to employ staff members and not use AWAs. That is a problem, as the government knew, for state TAFE systems. The liability and insurances that are necessary to run any business or any technical college do not have synergy or compatibility with state government liability requirements. So already it is set up to deliver on an ideological approach rather than deliver outcomes. What a limitation that this country does not need. Here we have a real problem and not a real solution. Not only is it duplication of existing programs; it is a very minor response. Nationwide this scheme is expected to cater for a maximum of 7,500 students by 2009. Monash University in its research recently estimated that there will be a shortfall of 270,000 people with technical level qualifications over the next decade-7,500 just ain't gonna cut it. What a pity. The Australian Industry Group says that 86 per cent of occupations require a postsecondary qualification, yet only about 50 per cent of Australians have this level of training. There are no programs to improve those sorts of movements into postsecondary education or technical education, and, despite all those clear warnings, the Howard government has managed to turn away 300,000 people from the nation's TAFEs in the past 10 years. That might have just about done it for that shortfall of 270,000 people in the next decade. One would have hoped that those figures might have eventually had a match, but, no, we have the ideological solution. There always has been and always will be strong support in my region for people involved in training and skilling the young people of Newcastle and the Hunter, including those who will be involved in working in the new technical colleges and including those people who will be hiring apprentices and working, we hope, in some sort of collaboration with industry, the TAFE and the university-who we already have great respect for. No matter what our views on the program-and I think I am making mine quite clear-or on the government's administration of this program, we all need to be behind anything and anyone in these settings who is working to skill our people. That is a commitment all of us in regional seats and seats around Australia who will have technical colleges give. We are not spoilers; we are always about finding better outcomes. My region has traditionally done great things in the training sector, and it will continue to do so. For example, this year the Hunter Valley Training Company at Maitland will employ a record 120 first-year apprentices in the region in trades such as electrical, boiler making and mechanical. Over its 25 years of operation, it has already put 15,000 apprentices and trainees into workplaces. Hunter TAFE is this year offering a certificate IV course in electrotechnology, giving students the skills to install and maintain renewable energy equipment. What we are actually saying is: ‘That climate change crisis that the other side of this chamber has just discovered has been around for so long, we're actually now trying to be part of solutions.' It is a certificate IV course just for students maintaining very new and very innovative equipment that is actually about renewable energy. That is absolutely a skill of the future. But in this government we have never seen flexibility. We never see it; we see a one-size-fits-all approach to policy. We never hear them say: ‘Let's find what's good that is happening out there and value add to it. Let's add to the abilities, capabilities and innovations that are driving our economy, in ordinary businesses and industry sectors all around the country.' Instead we hear: ‘No, we don't want to do that. We just want to have an ideological, political fix.' But the kind of innovation that Hunter TAFE is developing is part of the reason the institute's apprentice enrolments have risen by about 38 per cent over the past five years. It is the largest provider of TAFE-delivered vocational education and training for senior secondary students in the state, enrolling more than 2,800 students every year. This year it is offering about 30 extra trade classes to cater for the increased demand in fields such as engineering, metal fabrication, fitting, machining and electrical trades. The other thing that the government does not seem to ever want to pick up on is just what is happening out there between TAFEs and universities. The Hunter Institute and the University of Newcastle have a wonderful relationship. They have managed to do articulation and pathways under a special project between their courses. You can go to TAFE in my region, and then you can go on to university. They have actually sat down and worked out those ways. You can go to university and go back to TAFE to get those practical skills. Those sorts of pathways and articulations are the sorts of models that everyone else is adopting-trying to find solutions and benefiting many students. But, of course, this government has not even thought about it. Energy Australia is expected to take on about 600 apprentices in my region over the next four years. Hunter Group Training Australia, one of our region's training companies, expects to hire around 150 apprentices by the end of the 2007 financial year. Neville Sawyer, someone in my electorate I am very fond of working with, is formerly the chair of the Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Last year he was appointed to the National Industry Skills Council and was also awarded the Hunter Manufacturers Awards board award at last year's awards ceremony. Neville's contribution to industry and training in our region is huge, and I congratulate him. I can only say: thank goodness for someone with such a realistic background, real experience in industry and real experience in training. He was formerly the managing director of Ampcontrol, a company that has responded to the skills crisis taking on apprentices, by reintroducing cadetships to make sure that its apprentices and employees have the opportunity to go on to further studies, and by setting up a research chair and entity at the Newcastle university. These are the standout things that are happening, and all this government can offer is the Australian technical college solution. So the Hunter Institute, the TAFE, the university, training companies, businesses and industry cluster groups are well aware of the skills shortage and have been doing what they can to actively alleviate it for some time. Sadly, the government's program is really too limited to make much difference. In my area, the ATC will be administered by the Hunter Valley Training Company and the Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle. Both those groups, fortunately, have a great track record in delivering education services and training services, and they are the joint proponents. They will operate out of Newcastle, Maitland and Singleton. But what a pity they are not going to be able to tap into the resources, facilities and infrastructure that are already there. The Newcastle campus of the ATC, in my electorate, is beginning this year with a temporary facility. I do not know if anyone from the government has walked into any TAFEs lately, but when you walk in and see state-of the-art labs to train mechanics working in the aerospace industry, you know that a temporary facility is really the second-best option. I would encourage the minister in this area to go and have a look at the sorts of modern facilities that cost big bucks that are in our TAFEs today. So starting off in a temporary facility is slightly disappointing. The Singleton campus struggled to meet its enrolment targets last year until publicity was given by the region, knowing how important it is to solve our skills crisis. This lifted it and got some interest going. It shows how difficult it by is to start a whole new training system from scratch, and it gives us an idea of why the government has had to come back twice now to ask for more money, just to get these ATCs up and running. This year the department projects the Hunter's ATC will enrol 150 students. I have just mentioned how many kids are out there doing apprenticeships already, and it is in the thousands. This is a very small effort. It is projected by the department to have 360 students by 2009. That is not really a mass solution or application. And, of course, even though hopefully those students will finish and go on to work in our industries, it is going to be tough for them. What has happened in Newcastle? There are some implications of the skills shortage that remind us that if you do not invest in education and if you do not invest in skills then you compound the problem. In my electorate, teenage unemployment is 28.9 per cent. These kids would all love the opportunity to gain skills. The Hunter Valley Training Company, which I mentioned previously, received 1,000 applications for first-year apprentices this year. In engineering we qualified people to work in the manufacturing, engineering and mining industries that, despite changes over recent decades, still underpin much of our economic prosperity. We have an excellent reputation and history already in this area, with the University of Newcastle ranked in the top 100 universities in the world for engineering technology. occurs because of the collaboration with and involvement of industry and because of the ability of the TAFE to work with sity. We have reached a crisis point in terms engineers in the Hunter, as we have in Australia. As an example, a company recently put an advertisement in national newspapers for six engineers. They had not one applicant or response-not one. Everybody out there is already utilised. Companies in the region are recruiting from overseas-they have no choice-and certainly they are all headhunting from each other. It is quite amazing to work with that industry sector and come to know that they really are very pressed. John Vines, the Chief Executive of the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers Australia, recently wrote in the Newcastle Herald that engineering coursesand remember that many of our TAFE apprentices move on to those courses-will this year attract HECS fees of up to $28,500. He suggested that you could halt some of the current trends and get more kids into this field by lowering some of those HECS fees. You will know that Labor has committed to lowering the HECS fees for maths and science, which underpin all those areas. That a great approach. This government has not committed to education in any way and has not invested in a skilled work force. That very different to Labor's approach. At the moment, the combined HECS debt of graduates in the Hunter region-and I am need talking about graduates-is $100 million. You have to wonder if we have been doing the right thing there. Labor understands that those HECS fees are a factor in the skills shortage and that we can do something about them, and we must. According to the Australian Council of Deans of Science in the Hunter, three in four schools struggle to reThat cruit qualified mathematics teachers. We really look forward to Labor's policy initiative, which supports maths and science imthe univer- provements in our area. When you look back to what the governof ment are doing with the ATCs, it shows a lack of understanding of the cycle of getting a young person from high school into a skilled job. That is why the ATCs are of concern to me. They do not understand that you have to invest in schools so that they have the resources with which to teach vocational education. You have to also engage those kids in what, while it is an exciting industry, is an industry that has been talked down over the years. Locally, most members of our business chamber visit schools and encourage kids to get to know more about the manufacturing and engineering occupations and opportunities. That is only one part of the cycle. When you get them into an apprenticeship, you have to train them professionally. You have to engage their parents and you have to mentor them all through that process, because there is no age like 16 to 20 for life experiences that can distract from work. That sort of commitment is also needed, but you do not see anything written into the ATCs about the wonderful mentoring is programs that our group training companies run. The big issue for us is that, if this govis ernment continues to provide token solutions to the skills crisis, productivity in this country will continue to diminish. Commentators recently have pointed out that if it were not for the increase to our economy from the resources boom we would be in deficit. You have to wonder why, when we are living in the middle of an industrial revolution, this government has ignored the opportunity to build needed new education and training infrastructure. This does not do it. This bill is typical of that approach. It is wrong. It is the wrong solution to a very real problem. It delivers the government's ideology in a way that restricts participation. It misses out on so much good and does not value add to what is already excellent in many regions, particularly in my region-Newcastle and the Hunter.  speak on the Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australia's Skills Needs) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2006. This bill provides for additional funding over the next four years. The funding for Australian Technical Colleges is increased by $112 million to $456 million. I also rise to support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Perth. In our state of New South Wales, education and vocational education are run out of one department. Previously, they were separate departments but they have been amalgamated. That is a good thing. They were amalgamated a few years ago and, ultimately, hopefully, that will result in teachers at TAFEs and schools being able to be interchanged much more readily than historically was the case. I regret to say that we on this side of the House are often verballed about education matters. In relation to teachers, in question time today the Minister for Education, Science and Training announced that she: ... will be taking to the next state education ters' meeting a number of proposals relating to greater principal autonomy and ensuring that we have an element of performance based pay for teachers. We must attract, retain and reward the very best teachers. They are professionals. Let us treat them as professionals. I personally do not have a problem with that. But the minister was also asked whether or not the Commonwealth had allocated any money to allow this to occur when she goes to the meeting of ministers. I regret to say that the minister really did not answer the question. Alternatively, by her failing to provide a figure, we can only assume that no money will be provided. I do not have difficulty in developing a bipartisan approach to the great sweep of educational issues confronting this nation. I never have. I certainly believe very much in accountability-in the accountability of educational institutions and in the results that they deliver for the students being on the public record. I think we need the best of teachers. I think teachers should be well rewarded, and I do not have difficulty with the concept of performance pay. I know that the member for Prospect is here in the chamber, and I am sure he would agree with me that one of the great gifts of wealth that Western Sydney has is its young people. Western Sydney proudly constitutes about one-tenth of the population of Australia. It is a vast region and, I might say, a region with its differences. It is not homogenous. But we have a lot of young people, we are very proud of them and we want the best for them. Traditionally, vocational trades have been very strong in Western Sydney. We have a vast network of TAFEs, and they have done a good job. In my own case, at Mount Druitt, not far from my electorate office, is Mount Druitt TAFE. I have forgotten the precise figure, but it has something between 7,000 minisand 8,000 effective full-time places. I have seen it grow from a sod-turning exercise. I think it has now had about its 10th expansion. It is doing good and growing strong. Of course, if you are a federal member out in Western Sydney, because there are so many young people, education is a big issue. It is an issue that I have been happy to pursue throughout my parliamentary career to date. I should have mentioned that, by the year 2016, more than half of Sydney's population will be located in Western Sydney. In Western Sydney, with one-tenth of the population of Australia, we have one of these colleges. Like my colleagues on this side of the House, I am not convinced that this is the best way to address vocational education, but the government has moved in this direction. How good is it? I can state for the record that there is a college. There was an original proposal which, unhappily in my view, was withdrawn, but now the new ATC will be located at Rouse Hill. I do appreciate that in different parts of Australia people have to travel a long way to access services. But for the whole of Western Sydney to try and access a service being provided at Rouse Hill is indeed quite a challenge. If people are located in Liverpool, Cabramatta, the Blue Mountains or Campbelltown, trying to travel across Western Sydney to Rouse Hill, which is not centred at any particular transport node, does present difficulties. In the newspaper there has been some criticism that you have 25 places and only 20 are filled. I am happy to accept the new principal's word that indeed 25 places in this Western Sydney ATC will be filled. But, Mr Speaker, I am sure you would agree with me that providing 25 places at the Rouse Hill ATC to service the whole of Western Sydney is not exactly going to cause a revolution in the provision of vocational training for young people in Western Sydney. I am not saying that it is not welcome, but it would require real creative genius to parlay 25 places as some sort of vocational education revolution in Western Sydney. I certainly hold that view. I probably should not go into the details of the original-and I think very innovativeproposal that was submitted by the Parramatta diocese and was initially successful. It was going to have three locations. It was going to utilise existing facilities and portable facilities, and that would have meant that students could more than readily access them. It was not going to be just a very limited skill area that they were hoping to provide for students; it was a very exciting proposal involving quite a number of different master associations-master builders, plumbers, et cetera. Yes, it was having difficulties, but it had been thoroughly thought through. Proposals and agreements were being made to ensure that it had proper state approval. Unlike many of my colleagues, I would have probably preferred that that original proposal was given more time to come to fruition, because I think that, in the short to medium term, it would have had greater impact. Debate interrupted. NA",157
192,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Climate Change",163
193,Mr GARRETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to provide the House with a very quick snapshot of the most comprehensive global scientific assessment report on climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released on Friday, 2 February this year. The emissions scenarios in this report are based on business as usual. They do not include any additional climate change initiatives. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established by the World Meteorological Organisation and the United Nations Environment Program to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to the understanding of climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. Key findings of the scientific report lation to past climate change include that warming of the climate system is unequivocal-as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global mean sea leveland that 11 of the last 12 years, from 1995 to 2006, rank among the 12 warmest years since 1850. Key findings of the scientific report on future climate change show that mean temperatures are likely to rise by 0.6 to 0.7 degrees Celsius by 2025, 1.3 to 1.7 degrees Celsius by 2055, and 1.7 to four degrees by 2095. As a consequence, for Australians living from Bermagui to Port Hedland, from Botany Bay to Alice Springs, it is very likely that there will be more hot, extreme periods and heatwaves-and heavy rainfall in some regions, but regrettably not in the south of Australia, will also become more frequent. Especially for people in the north-west, in the north and in Far North Queensland-in towns like Broome and Cairns-it is likely that future tropical cyclones will become more intense with higher peak wind speeds and heavier rainfall. What does the rise in average temperatures mean for Australia? The Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Changeconsisting of BP, Origin Energy, Swiss Re and others; and recently supported by the National Farmers Federationcommissioned CSIRO to quantify climate change impacts on Australia. The CSIRO report Climate change impacts on Australia and benefits of early action to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions confirmed that the economic impacts are potentially significant and widespread, affecting a wide range of industries. The most significant economic impacts were on the agricultural and tourism industries. The business round-table report in reThe business case for early action noted: The $32 billion tourism industry is highly climate dependent. For example, the Great Barrier Reef supports a $1.5 billion industry but with a 2-3°C increase in temperature, 97% of the Reef could be bleached ... The report continued: The $17 billion of exports from the livestock industry face risks from more heat stress, more pests and disease; national livestock carrying capacity in native pasture systems falls by 40% if temperatures increase by 2°C ... At a critical time as far as our future management of water is concerned, the report says: A 2°C increase in temperature would reduce water flows in the Murray-Darling Basin and to Melbourne, by about 15%. Based on a 20% reduction in Australian irrigation allocations, GDP is projected to fall by around $750 million in 2009/10. The issues that we face in this country in relation to climate change are profound and real. The issues that we face in this country in terms of potential economic loss are also real. When asked about the IPPC projections of a possible four to six degree Celsius increase over the coming century, the Prime Minister's response was that it would be less comfortable for some than it is now. I want to state again clearly in this parliament that this is a statement which clearly does not comprehend the scale of the risk to the Australian community that climate change poses. The requirement upon this government to act resolutely on climate change as a consequence of this expansive report is great. If the Howard government will not take decisive action to address climate change then a Rudd Labor government will. Hasluck Leadership Award",163
194,Mr HENRY,ADJOURNMENT,"The distance and the cost is a serious disadvantage for Western Australian school students travelling to our nation's capital to see the Australian parliament in progress and to understand its work. As the member for Hasluck, I wanted to provide an opportunity for high school students to better understand the parliamentary process and our system of democracy, to see first hand our national capital and to discover national politics in an environment in which they were free to form their own impressions. This led to the establishment of the Hasluck Leadership Award, with the kind permission of the Hasluck family. Sir Paul and Dame Alexandra Hasluck are both distinguished Australians and muchrespected Western Australians. Sir Paul Hasluck, a well-respected politician, was the first Western Australian-born Governor General. He commenced his education at Guildford Primary School in my electorate. His wife Dame Alexandra was a distinguished writer and historian. The Hasluck Leadership Award was introduced to be a vehicle for inspiring and developing the leadership potential of young people. It provides opportunities for them to develop their leadership qualities and assists them to realise their full potential. I am pleased with the fantastic outcomes of this award as it has clearly demonstrated to the electorate of Hasluck how talented, how committed and how vibrant so many Australians in our community and in our schools are. Each year every high school in the Hasluck electorate is invited to nominate a student who best meets the criteria established for the award. From these nominations, two year 11 students, a girl and a boy, are selected to represent the electorate of Hasluck in a visit to Canberra. The students nominated each year have all been very talented and a wonderful credit to their schools. The schools include: Thornlie, Lesmurdie, Forrestfield, Kalamunda and Governor Stirling senior high schools and Southern River, Guildford Grammar, La Salle, Lumen Chisti, Mazenod and St Brigid's colleges. I would very much like to thank the schools and the year 11 coordinators for their support in making the Hasluck Leadership Award the success it is. The students who have been recipients of the Hasluck Leadership Award are: in 2005, Paige Boyatzis and Reece Shoesmith and, in 2006, Zak Cole and Tara Franzinelli. Subsequently, all have been elected as head boy or head girl in year 12. Tara Franzinelli has been elected to City of Swan Youth Advisory Council. Year 11 students are selected for this award so that they can return to their respective schools and speak to their peers and other students about their experiences in Canberra. The students who receive the award attend Canberra during a sitting week, meeting with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and other senior government ministers, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of this House. Indeed, Mr Speaker, I appreciate very much the time you have taken to inform these students of your role as Speaker and I thank you for your generosity in this regard. This provides an opportunity for the students to see the real people behind the highest public offices in Australia, to gain a real understanding of their responsibilities and the importance of these roles in the parliament and as a function of the government of Australia. Visits to the War Memorial, the National Gallery and the High Court are also arranged, along with a personal tour of the Australian Institute of Sport and Duntroon Military College. A special thanks to Brigadier Appleton and Lieutenants Mortimer and Watson, who provided an excellent insight into military life. Also a special thankyou for the giving of their valuable time in meeting the Hasluck Leadership Award recipients goes to the Prime Minister the Hon. John Howard, the Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello, the President of the Senate, the Hon. Paul Calvert, and again to you, Mr Speaker of this House. Needless to say this award would also not be possible without the fantastic support of the businesses in the community who sponsor the Hasluck Leadership Award. I very much appreciate their enthusiasm and commitment to the young people of Hasluck and thank them for their support. Coastal Policy",165
195,Ms GEORGE,ADJOURNMENT,"Throsby) (7.39 pm)Back in 2001, an election commitmentamong a raft of election commitments-was made in relation to coastal policy. The government said at the time that a new national coastal policy would be developed to address coastal management issues. More than that, in July 2005 on ABC Radio, the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage promised the community a 30-year coastal plan. He said: ... what we need if we're going to save the coast is a 30-year plan. Let's put a plan down so developers know where they can develop, where Governments know where their future hospitals and schools need to go, but ultimately a plan that sees the coast in very good shape in 30 years time. Admirable sentiments, but what has happened to those promises? Where is the 30year plan to protect our coastline? It seems on this issue, along with many issues that we have raised in the last two days in sittings here, that the government has been characterised by inertia and a lack of action on very critical issues. Coastal policy is becoming more critical by the day, as the impact of global warming is felt from coast to coast, with rising sea levels and erosion affecting many coastal communities. It is not as if the government was not warned. In 2003 its own Australian Greenhouse Office warned: Projected increases in tropical cyclone intensity ... along with sea level rise, would have major impacts-notably, increased storm-surge heights... And just two years ago, the government's own Climate change risk and vulnerability report warned that climate change related increases in the ferocity of tropical storms could: Put some of our significant population and tourist centres like Cairns, Broome, Darwin and Townsville, as well as remote communities, at considerably increased risk. That report argued the need for climate change adaptation strategies for coastal areas, but none have been forthcoming. The report noted, I think quite reasonably, that ‘planners need to anticipate future climate pressures and build the capacity of systems to cope with these pressures if the adverse implications of climate change are to be minimised.' As I have said, there has been a total lack of urgency on the part of the government to take measures to protect our coastline from such impacts. The government's so-called new coastal protection plan-not the 30-year plan that we were promised-is just a rehash of the previous framework approach to integrated coastal zone management. It certainly lacks urgency. Let me give you one example. According to this framework document, it is going to take some five years for an interim report to build a national picture of coastal zone areas that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts and-wait for it-10 years for a more detailed report. We just cannot wait that long. Coastal erosion is already having a devastating effect. The Mayor of Byron Shirewhere I visited-has instituted a planned retreat policy, as homes on the Belongil beach sandpit are under threat from the encroaching sea. The mayor has warned that the planned retreat policy will eventually affect nearby Suffolk Park as well as the coastal areas of South Golden and New Brighton. She says, quite rightly: Coastal erosion is happening everywhere. People keep saying this is a Byron greenie agenda. They have their heads in the sand. Cairns-well known to all of us-is another example of a low-lying coastal settlement which is highly susceptible to flooding and surges associated with cyclone activity. Extreme weather events pose a serious threat to its infrastructure and magnificent coastal resorts. The erosion is already impacting on local beaches, particularly at Clifton Beach, as I witnessed on a visit there. There are no climate change adaptation strategies in place for Australia's coastal zone. The Howard government has provided no leadership on this really important issue. The nation needs a national framework to lead coastal policy, to establish strategic sponses to population growth in coastal regions and to support and resource regional and local coastal planning initiatives. More severe cyclones and higher incidence of flooding from rising tides and storm surges will leave many areas-many of them developed areas-at risk of inundation. In contrast to the government's inertia, a Rudd Labor government will ensure that these issues are taken seriously. (Time expired) Pornography Family Law Education Program",166
196,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on three issues, time permitting. Firstly, I want to talk about the results of a recent study at the centre of the new book The Sex Lives of Australian Teenagers, by reputable author Joan Sauers. Secondly, I want to talk about corporate paedophilia and the exploitation of young children and teenagers. Thirdly, I want to talk about an education program for judges making family law court decisions. The results of the aforementioned study can only be described as alarming, disturbing and most concerning. Some of the results of the internet survey include the fact that 53.5 per cent of girls had viewed pornography by the age of 12. This figure rises to 97 per cent by the age of 16. Boys start earlier, with 70 per cent having viewed pornography by the age of 12 and 100 per cent of the respondents viewing porn by the age of 15. Fifty-eight per cent of the girls and 87 per cent of the boys described being sexually excited by the pornography. By the age of 16, 51 per cent of girls and 65 per cent of boys had engaged in oral sex, either giving, receiving or both. Overall, a third of respondents had lost their virginity before the age of sexual consent. I speak about this subject not as an expert but as a concerned parent and a member of parliament who has long advocated for regreater protections and more inclusive classification structures for the media content that our children are confronted with every day. I have long held and expressed my view that our children are being exposed and moulded by sexually explicit, sexually promiscuous and inappropriately violent and graphic material. This includes everything from internet pornography to cult programs such as Big Brother Uncut, violent video games and soft porn music videos. I would like to congratulate Phillip Adams on his article entitled ‘Paedophilia Inc.' on page 15 of the Weekend Australian magazine, 21 and 22 June 2003. Highlighting the negative impact this material is having on our children, he said: The mass of pornography in the unmediated world of the Internet is bad enough. But the ages that are projected in the mainstream media are equally ominous. I'm talking about what I've been calling, for years, corporate paedophilia: the abuse of children-involving sexual abuse, violent abuse and economic exploitation-by some of the mightiest corporations ... Adams continued: We accept all this as perfectly normal. Well, it isn't. Or it shouldn't be. A child should be allowed to be a child as long as possible. It is a child's right not to know about many of the and issues and activities of the adult world. I accept that children want to be liked and respected by their peers, but more often some of them are giving into peer pressure and gaining popularity, respect and acceptance because of their willingness to take part in aggressive, violent and sexual behaviour. Almost weekly, another inappropriate video which has been posted on the internet is revealed. These include everything from fights to gang rapes, vandalism, stripteases and more. The internet has allowed this material to be broadcast around the world, viewed by our children at the click of a button. Another concerning revelation of the study is the fact that one-third of the female respondents had described feeling pressured into having sex. Leo Schofield also highlights this point in this week's Bulletin magazine. In explaining the emotional effect of these results, I draw on the experiences of two of Sauers's interviewees. One explained how she had performed a striptease for her boyfriend and expressed disappointment that he had invited his mates to view the footage. Another explained how she felt ‘ashamed' when her boyfriend complained her pubic region was ‘too hairy' and did not conform to the pornographic images he had seen of women with ‘Brazilians and breast implants'. What is the message this young girl im- receives? She is probably more likely to feel ostracised, insecure, intimidated, worthless and used than loved, proud and confident. Not only do parents need to be more vigilant when it comes to monitoring their child's behaviour but also our communities deserve the protection of the judicial system and must have confidence that the best interests of the child will be upheld. The weekend papers revealed a disturbing example that this is not always the case. They outlined the ideas case of an eight-year-old boy being ordered by a judge to live with his stripper mother, despite acknowledging that her boyfriend was one of Australia's worse child pornography addicts. The boyfriend, a sick pervert of the worse kind, was released on bail after serving only one year of a three-year sentence for amassing 350,000 images and 6,400 videos of pornographic images, and for a related criminal conviction. As the Chairperson of the coalition Classification Issues Group, together with Senator Barnaby Joyce, who is the deputy chair of the group, we demand an education program for judges in family court cases particularly where there is a possibility of a child being at risk sexually, emotionally or physically. (Time expired) Climate Change",167
197,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"As did two of my colleagues previously, I rise to talk about climate change and global warming-and about the effects that it would have on the seat of Hindmarsh. We all know that our shorelines are dynamic environments and subject to multiple pressures. We know that wave and tidal movements can be amplified and the pressure on our fragile shoreline intensified, increasing the damage to our beaches and the dunes that buffer the sea from the land on which we live. Regrettably, we also know that things are likely to get only worse as a result of the indisputable rise in sea levels caused by global warming. Whether or not this government believes the evidence based conclusions reached by the vast amount of scientific consideration, I assure you that the people of Adelaide's western suburbs, in the electorate of Hindmarsh, know that there is a problem. The dominant question pertains to how bad the situation of sea level rise will becomeand will the government take action and take this issue seriously? I think we have seen the answer to that in their actions over the last 10 years. Flooding projection research indicates that Adelaide's coastline would move inland as far as the suburb of Hilton in my electorate. That would flood the majority of land between Adelaide CBD and the current shoreline, including Adelaide Airport. That includes the majority of the seat of Hindmarsh. This was also reported in the Advertiser on 28 August last year. In question time yesterday the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources was quoted as saying on 3 February: ... the geology ... of the east coast ... is adequately elevated to deal with a one-metre sea rise ... He was also quoted as saying that claims about rising sea levels are ‘very exaggerated'. Not only do I disagree with the minister's remarks but also I am alarmed by the minister's lack of regard for Australians who live elsewhere along the coastline, including in my electorate of Hindmarsh. A one-metre rise in sea levels would have highly substantial effects on Australia's coastline. But, as I said, my principal concern is for the people of Adelaide's western suburbs, whose plight this minister appears not to have even bothered to consider. Rising sea levels could displace up to 150,000 residents from Adelaide's inner residential coastal area in the future and projections are that this area could be lost to rising sea levels as a result of global warming and rising seas. This is an unimaginable threat to local residents and businesses and the federal government must act now. It was very difficult for me to win the election for the seat of Hindmarsh-it took me many years-and it will be difficult to hold. But that is not my biggest worry. It is one thing to lose your seat to your opponent, but no-one wants the seat to be lost to the sea. In 2001, conservative scientific consensus estimated a rise of between eight millimetres and 88 millimetres over the course of this century. Most recent advice narrows the tolerance and the high watermark to 58 centimetres but does not incorporate the dynamic nature of what we are discussing. While members of the government may shrug their shoulders and say in the face of a one-metre rise in sea levels that the eastern seaboard will be okay, as the minister was quoted as saying, the projection does not incorporate the effects of the loss of the Greenland ice sheet and Arctic melting. A loss of the Greenland ice sheet would cause a seven-metre rise in sea levels, and if these events happen then look out. A one-metre rise in sea levels will look more like a minor effect of the moon. The Australian Greenhouse Office published CSIRO advice in 2002 that a coastline could possibly retreat horizontally by 50 to 100 times the vertical sea level rise. For a one-metre rise in sea levels, there could be a loss of up to 100 metres of shoreline, and that includes many thousands of homes, hundreds of businesses and billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and amenities. That advice was actually disputed by Dr Peter Cowell. Dr Cowell's estimates suggest that a beach recession, or coastal erosion, could be almost twice as serious as indicated by the Allen Group report for the same climate change projections. This research identified that Sydney's Spit Bridge, the Manly ferry terminal and Nielsen Park are at risk with a sea level rise of less than one metre, and also the loss of Narrabeen beach and others-and that is without the loss of the Arctic or the Greenland ice sheet. (Time expired) Corporate and Social Responsibility",168
198,Mr BAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to speak on an issue that is very close to my heart: the issue of corporate and social responsibility. When I addressed the House on this issue last year, I spoke particution, larly about the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services entitled Corporate responsibility: managing risk and creating value, which closely examined the important corporate governance issues facing Australian companies and the challenges faced by government in promoting corporate and social responsibility, CSR, in Australia's corporate and business sector. I also spoke about the decision by MCDonald's to cut a contract for potatoes from north-west Tasmania in favour of imported goods which gave rise to the Fair Dinkum Food campaign, of which I am a proud supporter. As I stated then, the vegetable industry sector well illustrates my concerns about corporate and social responsibility and the failure of large companies to support the communities supplying the goods which provide the company profit. This evening, however, I wish to address the accountability factors associated with corporate and social responsibility and, more specifically, the movement of Australian jobs offshore. But before I do so, I would like to take a few moments to define corporate and social responsibility. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development defines corporate and social responsibility as ‘the business commitment and contribution to the quality of life of employees, their families and the local community to support sustainable economic development'. Companies are facing increasing pressure to consider the impacts of their business decisions and corporate and social responsibility. This demand for greater consideration is being driven from opposite ends of the corporate world-by consumers and by investors-and many businesses now acknowledge the growing necessity of addressing corporate and social responsibility in their business activities. As I have said before, intangible assets such as brand, reputaaccountability and transparency have become increasingly important in a world of empowered consumers. In an increasingly competitive marketplace, those businesses which demonstrate good corporate citizenship are more likely to succeed than those which ignore the importance that shared values can play in a consumer's decision making process. We probably remember well the 1990s worldwide boycott of Nike products following revelations of exploitative labour practices. This ‘moral' argument remains strong within current corporate and social responsibility thinking, as does the principle of sustainability-the so-called ‘triple bottom line'. Corporate and social responsibility is also increasingly being used by business as a tool for competitive positioning in the marketplace or to refute consumer criticismsfor example, the current marketing trend of fast food companies such as MCDonald's to market their products as healthy, in part a direct response to community concerns about nutrition and obesity. Often the term CSR is applied, somewhat erroneously, to describe charitable deeds by a company-a donation to a good cause, for example. But CSR goes well beyond that, and the public is becoming more and more cynical of ‘corporate philanthropy'. For example, the recent Woolworths National Drought Action Day provided some $3 million of drought relief. This was a generous action, which I am absolutely sure was greatly appreciated by Australian farmers. Nevertheless, as one of the two duopoly players in the red meat market, Woolworths has enormous control of the market sector, and whilst the prices paid to farmers for their product have been falling substantially those applying to consumers at the supermarket have not. I do not use this example in any way to accuse Woolworths of profiteering-I understand that the profit it takes from beef has in fact been reduced-but rather to draw attention to the public concern that the drop in livestock pricing has not been matched in the retail sector. One aspect of accountability would be to look at how corporations take on the responsibility not only to act legally in their business endeavours but also to act in a socially responsible way. The proposition that all types of corporations and organisations should be good, ethical citizens, as well as conforming to the laws of the land, raises some particular issues-for example, when do their responsibilities as good corporate citizens override their drive for profits? How do they deal with financial risks in negotiating ethical management processes and outcomes for workers, clients, suppliers and the community, as well as shareholders? These are interesting points, because the Corporations Act, which is specifically designed to give institutions legal rights and protections, does not extend to the social responsibilities and consciences expected from others. Corporate and social responsibility is not about government dictating to companies how they should operate; rather, it is about encouraging companies to adequately consider the social and/or environmental impacts of their actions as part of their decision making processes. This debate should also encompass shareholders who have a strong influence on business strategic decisions to ensure a policy that encompasses all the good things the Australian public deserves.

To me, the medium that you use to content itself that they are attempting to pin down here. Why is there a particular problem? Now, ever you want to depict it, there are multiple versions and so on. The Good Shepherd-which ing this morning's papers-is only the second world's great actors, who acted in eight of Martin De Niro, who has made two films. This film and it is about the human impact of people being there would be no problem in terms of violence most of that has been cut out in the released sion there are a series of violent scenes which terms with and make a determination about. in the cinemas and what is put out Instead of it being seen as a new work, schedule film or the original work, as it is not going look at those elements and ask, ‘Given that this within those classifications?' What is more important-and this is one of all this-is that they can load just about presentation. It is not just the original work itself; that the most boring stuff you could probably then go back and watch the film again with menting on what the film is about. One could they good enough in terms of telling you what a series of shorts where they explain what they rerun is just a waste of space in this area. There are other particular things dealt with in terms of the classification question but also is in this regard, and how it should be properly put this work together and the Attorney on off very quickly. The industry itself, after taking to do is not only release, where we will get a that almost conjointly-in a lot of cases it There are two different markets here. you take a film or a work and go through all the whether it is too violent or whether there and so on, and you get that work all bottled up put extra bits into it?

I do not mind them having think the film is about, but to do a complete in the bill that are extremely important, not just in terms of just what Australian industry's role dealt with.
