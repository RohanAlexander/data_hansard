10,Mr LAMB,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, we on this side of the House believe that our candidate, the honourable member for Scullin (Dr of Jenkins), is a most admirable and honourable and, in doing so, I desire to exto member to fill the office of the Chairman of Committees. Unlike the previous Chairman of Yours faithfully, Committees, he is not a lawyer, although he does J. M. BERINSON come to the Parliament with a duo of academic successes, in the fields of medicine and science. I this because while it is not important to hold legal qualifications to be a Chairman of Comthe qualifications of the honourable member for Scullin do indicate the self-discipline and objectivity possessed by him, characteristics be displayed so well by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson) during his tenure of office as Chairman of Committees. Primarily it is parliamentary experience rather than legal experience or academic qualifications that is the prerequisite the holder of the office of Chairman of Committees or of Speaker-and one of the tasks of the Chairman of Committees is to deputise for you, Mr Speaker. I believe that the honourable member for Scullin possesses the necessary requirements-a n intimate understanding of parliamentary life, of the problems of members individually and collectively, and of the atmosphere of this House. The honourable member for Scullin has had a long and distinguished apprenticeship inside and outside Parliament in the way of preparation for holding this position. He has served 14 years in Australian parliaments, 8 years as the member for Reservoir in the lower House of the Victorian Parliament, and the last 6 years, since 1969, as the honourable member for Scullin in this House, having been re-elected in 1972 and 1974. I believe that in all that time he has served his electorate with dedication, sincerity and distinction. Moreover, he is a person well versed in the committee system of Parliament. He was a member of the Printing Committee of the Victorian Parliament and was Deputy Chairman of the Statute Law Revision Committee in that State. He was appointed Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation on his election to this Parliament. I have served on the House ofRepresentatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, under his chairmanship, for more than 2 years, as have members on the other side of the House. He has been Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System since that Committee was established 11 months ago. He is also a member for the Privileges Committee of this House. I have mentioned all of those matters because it is in that extraordithat nary record of Committee service and as one of our former Deputy Chairmen of Committees that we have observed the qualities that make him an ideal candidate-integrity , judgment, a sense of humour, common sense and firmness tempered with understanding. The honourable member for Scullin is of integrity, a virtue he demonstrated when stood down as a Deputy Chairman of Comvice mittees this year over a matter that has forced all honourable members on both sides of this House to re-examine their conceptions and understandapproximately ing of the chairmanship of this House. The perassociated sons who preside over the proceedings of House are the protectors of the rights of Parliament-no t of the Executive or a political party-whil e acknowledging that the Governthis ment must control the business of the House. In my maiden speech in this House a few years ago I said that this Parliament was in danger of being seen by the public as an anachronistic chamber where politicians make wordy speeches, throw around inane interjections and manipulate parish pumps. That is a constant danger. Its avoidance depends upon the members themselves and the chairmanship of this House. Honourable members on this side of the House believe that their candidate-the honourable member for Scullin-possesse s the qualities required to complement your own contribution, Mr Speaker, towards constantly raising the standards of this place in the eyes of the public, particularly at a time when the number of supporters of the Government and the Opposition is fairly close and the potential atmosphere is highly charged. We commend his candidature to the House.",21
11,Mr ENGLAND,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, I regard it as being an honour to commend to you and to the House the appointment of Mr Philip Ernest Lucock, Commander of the Order of the British Empire and the honourable member for Lyne, as the Chairman of Committees of this House. For the smooth and emcient running of the House I think we should be looking at the aspect of service. In this respect I do not intend to go into such detail as did the honourable member for La Trobe. Service falls into 2 parts. Over a period of 23 years, Mr Lucock has provided a fully effective service to those whom he represents in his electorate of Lyne. It is not given to many to have the opportunity of serving the people for such a length of time. As we all know, periodically we have to face the public. The people of Lyne have continued to send Mr Lucock back to this place to serve them. Over period he has demonstrated without doubt a knowledge of and an ability in relation to matters of Federal import over a very wide field. Further, and more importantly, I refer to the qualifications he has for the specific task for which I have had the honour to nominate him. He served for a record term in the history of this a man Parliament- I emphasise that-as Deputy he Speaker and Chairman of Committees. That sercommenced from 8 March 1961 and, without going into further detail as to the exact date, I emphasise that it continued for a period of 12 years. In addition he was with the work of the Chair in this Parthis liament before he was appointed Deputy the Speaker and Chairman of Committees and he has been associated with it since that time, and has given him an association either as a Deputy Chairman, of Committees or, as the position used to be called, a Temporary Chairman, and then Chairman of 17 or 18 years in all. There gas are many members of this Parliament who have witnessed the efficient and impartial manner in which Mr Lucock has conducted his work from the Chair. I would like to go to the words not of somebody from his own political party but of somebody from outside it. I refer to the last election of a Chairman of Committees when the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) said: . . . having seen both contenders for the position in operation in the chair both as the Chairman of Committees, I would find it very difncult, suppose, to choose between them in respect of their competency. The honourable member for Lyne during the period ofhis occupancy of the chair, in my view, performed very fairly and within the Standing Orders. The person with whom he was comparing him, Sir, was you. I feel that that speaks for itself. honourable member's record is a magnificent one; it would be very hard to beat. I firmly lieve that that record will be added to on further occasion. I commend to the House the appointment of Mr Lucock to the position of Chairman of Committees.",22
12,Dr CASS,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," I rise to endorse the nomination of the honourable member for Scullin for the position of Chairman of Committees. I will not traverse the historical facts that have been given by the honourable member for La Trobe. However, if you will forgive me, Mr Speaker, I would like make one or two personal reminiscences. I have known Dr Jenkins for many years in the Austhe position. tralian Labor Party and my comments relate to my personal experience with him in that period and particularly to his capacity as a chairman. Many of us aspire to be chairmen. We all like think that we know how to control things and people, and I can be accused of that; but, sadly, very few people are competent in this field. I am reminded that the very first occasion which I got to know Harry Jenkins was when he was chairman of a Labor Party committee that election. was dealing with a very controversial topic, a topic which was known to be of an explosive nature. The people appointed to the committee were all at sixes and sevens. It was a measure Harry's skill as a chairman that the committee brought in a unanimous report. He has shown that same skill in his time in this Parliament chairman of committees which have dealt quite controversial topics relating to the environcumstances ment. He has managed so to encourage-no t Prime suppress-the full expression of points of view, and yet at the same time to maintain relevance House. on the part of the contributors, that he has succeeded in getting a large measure of unanimity or consensus of opinion on most of the committees with which he has been concerned. In shon, no doubt I will suffer like the rest of the members of this place if Dr Jenkins is appointed to this posiuon because he will force me, I hope like the rest of the members of this place, to be relevant. For these reasons I endorse his nomination.",23
13,Mr BOURCHIER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"In rising to second the nomination of the honourable memthe deputy of the Speaker and as I ber for Lyne for the position of Chairman of Committees I can only endorse the remarks that have been made by the honourable member for Calare (Mr England). I and other members of  eration during the last 2A years and we know l The how very effective he has been both as a Deputy Speaker and as a Deputy Chairman. When he behas been in charge of proceedings the House has a always run very smoothly. He has a very sound knowledge of the operations that are required of the House and he carries them out to the very best of his ability. I feel somewhat like the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnfelt when he was in a similar position last year, because I reaUse that the honourable member fbr Lyne and Dr Jenkins are people who are both very capable and very able to carry out the duties of the position. If Phil Lucock is unfortunate enough not be be elected, then I am sure to that Dr Jenkins will be a good second string. I heartily endorse and recommend Phil Lucock for",23
14,Mr WENTWORTH,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, I think that nothing could be said which to would detract in any way from the personal merits of either candidate for this position. I am sure that personally both honourable members are qualified to occupy the position. I think that perhaps the Labor Party has been wise in on nominating one of the few of its members who is likely to retain his seat after the next general On a more serious note, may I say this: There is generally a tradition in this House that the of Chairman of Committees should come from the Government side. On the whole, I think that that is a good tradition. I am wondering whether in as these particular circumstances, that tradition with should be observed. The particular cirarise because of the habit of the Minister of hectoring and intimidating the occupants of the chair or the Chairmen in this",23
15,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,Order! I suggest that the honourable gentleman debate the question which is now before the Chair and that is the nomination of the 2 honourable members concerned. The subject matter upon which the honourable gentleman is now embarking is one which he can take up in other circumstances.,23
16,Mr WENTWORTH,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Indeed , Sir. While I concede that both honourable members have personal merits, I am now debating the question as to whether we should follow the tradition of the House in electing somebody from the Government side as Chairman. I am saying, Mr Speaker, that this is generally a good tradition but in these particular circumstances I doubt that it is because I looked at the way in which the Prime Minister assassinated your predecessor in the chair.",24
17,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Order! If the honourable gentleman continues on that line, I will ask him to resume his seat.",24
18,Mr WENTWORTH,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Sir , I am trying to make my point as relevant as I can.",24
19,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,I realise the honourable gentleman is having great difficulty with relevance and I will help him with it if he continues on that Une.,24
20,Mr WENTWORTH,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"My point has a very great relevance to whether or not we should vote for the nominee from the Government side. That is the question before the House. What I am saying is entirely relevant to that question. I ing that in these circumstances, Mr SPEAKER - and your predecessor in the chair would know the circumstances very well-ther e is something to be said for having in the chair as Chairman of Committees, somebody who does not come from the Government side. Sir, what I am saying, with all respect, is entirely relevant to that question. I remind the House and you, Mr Speaker, of the way in which the present Prime Minister, who continues as Prime Minister, assassinated your predecessor, and that is relevant.",24
21,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. In accordance with the Standing Orders, the bells will be rung for 2 minutes. (The bells having been rung)",24
22,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,The ballot papers will now be distributed. Will honourable members please write on the ballot papers the name of the candidate for whom they wish to vote. The candidates are Dr Jenkins and Mr Lucock. (A ballot having been taken),24
23,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"The result of the ballot is: Dr Jenkins 62 votes, Mr Lucock 58 votes. I therefore declare Dr Jenkins elected as Chairman of Committees and offer him my congratulations.",24
24,Mr WHITLAM,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Government, and I have no doubt on behalf of all honourable members, I should like to congratulate the honourable member for SculUn on being elected as Deputy Speaker. It was a difficult choice for honourable members to make because we had to choose between 2 experienced parliamentarians and 2 gentlemen who are respected by every member of the House. It was a secret ballot. I suspect that the result would have been the same if there had been a division. The honourable member for Lyne has held the office of Deputy Speaker for, 1 believe, a record term. The honourable member for Scullin has not been a member of this House nearly so long-barel y a quarter of the time-bu the had been for 8 years earlier a member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. He has already been a Deputy Chairman of Committees for 2 years in this House. He had been a member of parliamentary committees in the Victorian Parliament and, as we all know, he has been a member of many committees-standin g committees, select committees and joint committees-as a member of this Parliament. He has been a member of the House Committee, he was the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation, he is the Chairam sayman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation and he is the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System. He has, moreover, been a member of the Australian delegation to the annual conference of the InterParliamentary Union at Paris in September 1971 and a member of the Third International Parliamentary Conference on the Environment in Nairobi in April last year. It will be seen that he is an experienced and diligent parliamentarian. I congratulate him, as will all honourable members. There is only one other comment I must make: He is one of those doctors who are frank in acknowledging their poUtics and rational in advocating them. Mr MALCOL M FRASER (WannonLeader of the Opposition) (2.50)-For the Opposition I congratulate the honourable member for Scullin who has had a wide experience and who, I believe, will serve the Parliament well. The Prime Minister pointed to the fact that it was a difficult decision for honourable members of this House and that the honourable member for Lyne also is exceedingly well qualified to fill this position. So he is. I say to the Prime Minister that the House will be given an opportunity at some stage for the decision to be reversed. I have no doubt that it will be. That in no way indicates ill will to the honourable member who has won the vote on this occasion. It is not indicating any ill will to him to say that I believe that his holding of the position will not be all that long lived. Nothing should be read into that remark. The honourable member for Scullin, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System, has a real concern for the arrangements of this House; he has a real concern to see that there is reform, to bring the procedures and practices of the House of Representatives into the 20th century and to equip it to go into the 2 lst century. I hope that his new responsibilities will in no way delay the report which I know he has been pursuing, with his Committee members, with diligence. There is a real need for reform in many areas and avenues of the work of this House. This is not the time to canvass the sorts of things which should be done, but the need for reform is very clear. It cannot come about unless there is a government which has a will to make the Parliament work. If there is a government or a Prime Minister who seeks to by-pass the Parliament, then presumably the report of the Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System will be left aside and not acted upon. I say again that there will be a government which will be concerned for the procedures and practices of this House. I hope that the report which Dr Jenkins will be tabling at the appropriate time will lay the ground work for reform which will complement his chairmanship of the committees of this House. The Opposition will co-operate with the Chairman. We will support his decisions always when we believe them to be right. We will uphold the dignity of the chairmanship, as we do in relation to yourself, Mr Speaker, because propriety of performance in this House is something about which I believe every honourable member is concerned. I am glad that the Government has put forward a candidate of whom I hope all members of this House can be proud in his performance in the position.",24
25,Mr ANTHONY,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Mr Speaker, I add my congratulations to the honourable member for Scullin on being elected Chairman of Committees and your Deputy. He has had a good deal of parliamentary experience, although we have not seen a great deal of his experience in this position in the House. However, we wish him well in the new position. I know that he hopes he will be in the position for some time. I have to warn him that there is nothing very permanent about positions in this Government, where ministerial changes are a regular pattern of government and where the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees seem to hold their positions for only a very short time. However, we hope that he displays a good deal of capacity either as the Deputy Speaker or Chairman of Committees in seeing that the procedures of the House are carried out quickly and succinctly and that Ministers do not use this chamber as a forum for parry political purposes or forfihbustering.There would be one or two exceptions. I would not mind if Ministers were to spell out the Government's policies in a few areas. I am thinking particularly of minerals and energy, an area in which we have been waiting for Vh years to hear a policy. It would be a pity, after such a distinguished record of national development, for us not even to know the policies and why we have no national development. I should like to say again that we are pleased with the election of the honourable member although we are disappointed that our own nominee was not elected. He is by far the most distinguished and the most experienced person in the House for this office. We know that in the fullness of time he will be back in that position.",25
26,Mr LUCOCK,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, I take the opportunity of joining with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia in offering the warmest congratulations to the honourable member for Scullin on his appointment. I must confess that when one of the Government supporters walked across the aisle just a few moments after the vote had been taken my heart rose and I thought: 'Ah, it has happened at last'. But it was not to be. I do congratulate Dr Jenkins. I can assure him of my support. It is not an easy task to hold this office. I think sometimes that the Deputy Speaker has a harder task even than the Speaker himself. Dr Jenkins can be assured of my fullest support and assistance on any occasion on which he feels it may be an advantage to have advice.",25
27,Dr JENKINS,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," Mr Speaker, it is with some humility that I thank the House for the honour that it has paid me in electing me to this position. I thank the honourable member for La Trobe and the Minister for the Media who put forward my name to the House. I am grateful for the words they had to say. I am even more grateful, after having chaired committees of which the Minister for the Media was a member over the years, tofindhe admits that there may have been occasions when I had to place a rein on his exuberance. I thank you, Sir, for your congratulations. I thank the Prime Minister for the words he had to say. Of course I must also thank the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia for their remarks. As was indicated, I have been a member of parliament for a good many years. I have seen fortunes wax and wane. I am under no illusions about what happens in parliaments. I am grateful, however, that the Leader of the Opposition made some remarks with regard to the question of parliamentary procedures. I believe that we are facing an era in which changes have to be made. I trust that the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System, which he mentioned, will very soon be able to make worthwhile, sensible and dignified suggestions. To the Leader of the National Country Party of Australia. I say that term of office does not worry me. The thing is that the task is ahead and that the task should be properly carried out. I trust that, the House having given me its confidence, I will be able to carry out my duties, to maintain the dignity of the parliamentary institution and to allow the proper conduct of its business, the business for which we are all here. I thank the House.",25

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the progressive taxation scale is seriously reducing the ability of wage earners to keep up with ever increasing costs, and by forcing them to apply for large gross salary increases in order that their nett take home pay will meet these costs, is a major cause of inflation.

30,Mr RUDDOCK,RED SCHEME,I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration. Is it the case that the Regional Employment Development scheme is being wound down because unemployment has reached such levels that the scheme can no longer be funded at an acceptable cost?,31
31,Mr RIORDAN,RED SCHEME,"The question is not one which I can answer at this stage because the matter of the funding of the RED scheme is a matter contained in the Budget, as I would expect the honourable member to know. However, I do want to say that the unemployment ngures were certainly disappointing but I do not believe that it is appropriate to look at them in their totality and to say there is doom, gloom and nothing more. For example, there has been a signincant increase in employment in the clothing and textile industries. I think that should be emphasised. I also think it should be emphasised that, whereas the ngures are quite high and unaccepUranium tably high at the present time for unemployed persons, those ngures should nonetheless be considered in conjunction with the ngures that have applied previously. For example, as at July 1972, let the record be clear, under the Liberal Country Party Government there were 95 732 of environunemployed persons, excluding school leavers and we are, therefore, looking at something less than 150 000 extra.",31
32,Mr ANTHONY,RED SCHEME,That means nothing! What is another 150 000! Goodness me.,31
33,Mr RIORDAN,RED SCHEME,"I take the point of the Leader of the National Country Party: What is an extra 150 000? It is a very great number indeed. It is a matter of very great concern to this Government that such a situation should have developed. I want to say this: The right honourable gentleman has little to crow about. If he looks back through the history of his Government when in office he will see a generation of neglect in terms of employment planning and labor planning and a complete lack of any manpower policy. The point I am wanting to raise at this time is that whereas the ngures are extraordinarily high-m y own view is that they have reached about the height and will go little if any further, and will start to improve significantly-the fact of the matter is that under the full employment program of the Liberal-Country Party Government almost 100 000 people were out of work. That is what those opposite call 'full employment'. I would say this: After this Government's policies are implemented and inflation is stabilised, there will be a signincant improvement in the employment position. NA NA",31
34,Mr CROSS,QUEENSLAND,"I ask the Minister for Minerals and Energy: Is there any justification for the claim recently and frequently made by Sir Gordon Chalk, the Treasurer of Queensland, replacement that the Minister is favouring coal producers New South Wales at the expense of coal producers in Queensland?",32

In particular, in the period which this Government has held office, there been a distinct forging ahead of coal exports from Queensland. It is a very distinct one. In current year, of a total of 30 million tons to exported, no less than 17.5 million tons will come from Queensland. As for the innuendo-and repeated innuendo-that somehow I am favourcent ing the South Coast district, in point of fact in year there will be a reduction in its exports coal from 4.5 million tons to 4 million tons. see the future, Queensland will forge ahead. has huge resources easily won and, by the very nature of orthodox technology, it will continue progress.

36,Mr NEWMAN,TASMANIAN SHIPPING FREIGHTS,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is it a fact that Minister is refusing the Holyman pany consent to charter the roll-on roll-off vessel Wanaka and that this refusal could lead to further increased freight rates to Tasmama? a fact that Tasmanian primary industry and ondary industry are being crippled by the freight rate increases approved by the Minister in recent months? Will the Minister tell the House what steps the Government proposes to take to relieve the crippling freight rate burden on Tasmania?,32
37,Mr CHARLES JONES,TASMANIAN SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"It is perfectly true the that the William Holyman company has made several approaches to me concerning bringing new ships, or imported ships, on to the Ausa tralian coast. I have given the company a number of extensions of time with respect to a ship already has on the coast- a ship that was overseas and imported into Australia. I have operated with the company. The former honourable member for Bass, the Honourable Lance Barnard, spoke to me about this matter on a number of occasions and I co-operated with him and gave the company every assistance possible. It is true to say that at this stage I have not approved the importation of the ship from New Zealand that the company is desirous of bringing to Australia. The matter is still under consideration. It will be interesting to hear what the Opposition has to say on whether it believes in the importation of second hand ships to the disadvantage of the Australian shipbuilding industry. If the Holyman company is prepared to build a ship in Australia, we will be able to in give the matter more favourable consideration. I will deal now with the other part of the honourable member's question, which was I about the freight rates that apply to Tasmania being cripphng. Let me say to the honourable in member that when the Party of which he is now has a member was in government it did nothing whatsoever to assist Tasmania as far as freight the rates are concerned. It continually increased be freight rates and gave no assistance whatsoever in this place. As far as the actions of the present the Government are concerned, the recent 40 per increase in freight rates was applicable this throughout Australia. It was applicable not only of to Tasmania but also to other people using the As I Australian National Line for the carriage of It general cargo. That increase was necessary because of the increases that had occurred in port to charges, the cost of fuel and the cost of labour and as a result of industrial disputes. Those matters placed an additional burden on the ANL and on other shipping companies. The real position, as the Prime Minister has said, is that the the present Government will endeavour to assist the shipping compeople of Tasmania. Let us look at the real facts. This year we will be subsidising northbound freight to the extent Is it of $4m to $5m. That is $4m to $5m more than secthe Party of which the honourable member for Bass is now a member was ever prepared to pay. We are paying a subsidy of $ 1 m a year in respect of the Empress of Australia. That is $lm more than the honourable member's Party was ever prepared to spend. The carriage of wheat from the mainland to Tasmania will be subsidised to extent of about $1.8m. Let us boil down the matter in facts and figures. Every Tasmanian famUy is receiving from the present Government subsidy of about $80 a year. On a per capita basis that represents about $22 for every man, it woman and child in Tasmania. As a result of built action taken by the Whitlam Labor Governcoment, freight rates are being subsidised. Representatives of the paper manufacturers saw me and said that they were being disadvantaged by the increase in freight rates. I asked them with whom they were in competition. They certainly are not in competition with any other Australian paper manufacturer, because there is none. I explained to them that if they were experiencing problems with respect to paper imports the way to go about overcoming them was to approach either the Temporary Assistance Authority or the Industries Assistance Commission and to seek an increase in tariff protection. That is up to them. It is not up to the Department of Transport to determine the extent and the degree of disability that they might incur. As far as the other bulk commodities that are being exported from Tasmama are concerned, the Tasmanian exporters are not in competition with anyone else. Other Australian bulk commodity handlers have to pay the increase. There is no reason why the Tasmanian bulk section should not likewise be required to carry it. As far as southbound traffic is concerned, it was clearly established in a Bureau of Transport Economics study that was carried out late in 1972 and presented to the Parliament in 1973 that a considerable amount of the southbound freight comes under price equalisation and therefore Tasmania is not disadvantaged. All the bunkum that has been printed about the effect the increase will have on prices in reality cannot be borne out by the facts. So that the people would get a fair go the Government appointed Mr Nimmo to carry out a study of the requirements of the situation and what should be done about it. But the real answer to the problem is the establishment of an Inter-State Commission so that the facts and ngures can be established and so that all the details can be brought out. It is the Opposition which is frustrating the establishment of an Inter-State Commission. In fact if the Opposition had allowed the legislation to go through the Senate, the Inter-State Commission at this stage would have been operational and would have been in the position to carry out a detailed invesoccasions, tigation into any disability from which Tasmanians suffer and which the Liberal and Country Party governments in 23 years of office were not prepared to tackle. TELEVISION: STATION TVT6",32
38,Mr SHERRY,TASMANIAN SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for the Media. The Minister will recall the 2-hour suspension imposed by him on TVT6 of Hobart last Saturday night. I ask: Under what section of the Broadcasting and Television Act was this penalty imposed? Who introduced the provisions of that Act? Had the station transgressed before and has the Government in fact attempted to amend some of the more anachronistic sections of the Broadcasting and Television Act? Finally, were any alternatives offered to the station management for this breach of the law on 3 occasions?",33
39,Dr CASS,TASMANIAN SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I had a sneaking suspicion that such a question might arise in view of the fact that I am depicted as a goateed Goebbels, or words to that effect, in seeking to control what the Press says and does and so on. Mr Keith Johnson-That is incredible.",33
40,Dr CASS,TASMANIAN SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I thought it was incredible too. However, it was offered in a humourous fashion so I did not take offence. In November last year the station broke the rules as laid down by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The breach was of the rules laid down in regard to the time for which advertisements can appear on television stations. I might point out that those rules were laid down by the Control Board long before we came into power. They are the sorts of rules that the Opposition when it was in government lived with and we are still living with them. That is not to say that the Opposition when in government necessarily liked them any more than we necessarily like them, but that is the situation. As a result of the breaking of the agreement which every other commercial television station seeks to observe-and I want to point that out-the Minister at the time wrote to this station in the following terms: In view of the fact that TVT has had a very satisfactory record of compliance with the Board's standards you will understand it is not my desire to exercise my power under Section 86 of the Broadcasting and Television ActThis is the answer to the question raised by the honourable member about which part of the Act we are operating underto take action to suspend the licence for the operation of the station. However, as I have stated publicly on several the Australian Government is not prepared to countenance breaches of the standards. In the present case, therefore, I have decided to take no action pending an assurance from you that steps have been taken to bring the seriousness of the matter to the attention of the management and that adequate procedures have been established to ensure that there will be no further cause for complaint in this area. That was written in November 1974. Sure enough, a letter was received from Mr MCRae pointing out that the letter was acknowledged, stating what had happened and assuring the Minister at the time that this would not happen again. Mr MCRae wrote: We have critically reviewed our procedures in order to ensure that breaches do not occur. That is not very long ago. However, it was drawn to my attention that on 3 and 4 May this yearless than 6 months later-the same sort of thing had happened. So I wrote another letter pointing out the situation and suggesting that something had to be done because, after all, the station has been warned and it had undertaken not to let it happen again. I personally do not care much about this particular regulation. I think that people who look at commercial television have to expect to view advertising. I take it that the rule was brought in because people, while they want to look at commercial advertising and are prepared to accept the screening of advertisements as a penalty for doing so, still want limitations placed upon the amount of time during which advertising can be shown. Limitations were placed by the previous Government and we are still abiding by the same rule and regulation. The station concerned gave an explanation as to why the breach had occurred and I accepted its explanation. But it does not alter the fact that the station had broken the rules. So we are faced with the question as to whether we should ignore the law. If we should, I will stop the Control Board bothering trying to implement that particular law. Why waste money having people sitting in front of television sets timing the length of advertisements if when one discovers that someone has broadcast an advertisement for longer than he should have, one does nothing about it? Let us stop pretending. However, that is a different question. The fact is that the law is as it is. So I chose to suggest to the station that I would require it to go off the air unless it could make some alternative suggestion. I will not bother reading the letter. Needless to say, I gave warning that I intended to suspend the station. I again want to point out that there is no alternative for me. I either ignore the station's transgression or I suspend the station. As one critical letter to me pointed out, any school child could have suggested an alternative penalty. I quite agree. But the law does not allow me to impose an alternative penalty. That is the fact. Needless to say, the gentlemen from the station came over to talk to me. I made it quite clear, after they had agreed that they had broken the regulations-the y did not deny it-that something had to be done. I gave a very broad hint that as far as I was concerned, I had no desire to impose a penalty. If, in recognition of their transgression, they were prepared to  sorry to interrupt the Minister for the Media, but 1 wonder whether he would table the documents which he is consulting in this connection.",33

However, as I have stated publicly on several occasions, the Australian Government is not prepared to countenance breaches of the Standards. In the present case, therefore, I have decided to take no action pending an assurance from you that steps have been taken to bring the seriousness of the matter to the attention of the management and that adequate procedures have been established to ensure that there will be no funher cause for complaint in this area. Extract from a letter from E. G. MCRae, now Chairman of Directors of Tasmanian Television Limited, to Senator Douglas MCClelland sent on 20 December 1974. Your acknowledgement of our stauon having a satisfactory record of compliance with the Australian Broadcasting Control Board's Standards and the statement that you do not desire to suspend our licence is very much appreciated. However, the threat and the danger is clear in what you have We have critically reviewed our procedures in order to ensure that breaches do not occur. Dear Mr MCRae, I have received a report Control Board, advising me that stauon TVT has again been found to be in breach of the Board's Advertising Time Standards. You will recall that, in replying on 20 December 1974, to a letter from my predecessor, Senator Douglas MCClelland, regarding breaches which occurred on 10 November 1974, you stated that you had critically reviewed station procedures in order to ensure that further breaches would not occur. The latest excesses which occurred on Saturday and Sunday, 3 and 4 May, have been taken up by the Board with the station management, and in the opinion of the Board the explanations received from the station did not satisfactorily account for the breaches. Details of the breaches are set down below: Date Time Saturday, 7.00 p.m - 8.00 p.m. 3 May 8.00 p.m - 9.00 p.m. 9.00 p.m -10.00 p.m. Sunday, 4 May 6.00 p.m - 7.00 p.m. I am told that your General Manager, Mr D. Carter, has informed the Board that, as a result of these breaches, he has established a continuity department under the direct supervision of the stauon program manager, whose responsibility it will be to ensure that the Board's standards will be observed at all times. Notwithstanding this action by Mr Carter I am satisfied that in all the circumstances the appropriate course open to me is to consider suspending the licence granted to Tasmanian Television Ltd, in respect of the operation of the station. Accordingly I am enclosing a formal notice of my intention to take such action pursuant to the provisions of Section 86 of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1975. As required by sub-section 2(b) of Section 86, before reaching a final decision in the matter, I will take into consideration any action by Tasmanian Television Ltd, to prevent the recurrence of similar breaches.

Dear Mr MCRae, Thank you for your letter of 1 August, inresponseto my letter and notice of 29 July. I have noted your comments on the factors surrounding your station's breaches of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board's Advertising Standards. It is clear from your letter that you are in no way challenging the fact that the Advertising breaches, as outlined in my earlier letter to you, did in fact Content Excess occur. I note that you have not been able to supply any inforU'10"" O'lO"" mation in explanation of these breaches additional to that I3'05"") 1'20"" already provided to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and to me in our meeting on 31 July. 10'15"") I reiterate my conviction, which I expressed to you at our meeting, that a licensee must assume full responsibility for 10*56' 1'56"" the conduct of its television station. This responsibility extends to ensuring that staff, at all levels, comply with applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. The application of these provisions must be uniform and universal. It was my impression that, at our meeting, you accepted this proposition. I did, however, indicate to you that I was prepared to differentiate between an inadvertent and a deliberate infringement of a regulation in terms of the penalty applicable. On the advice tendered to me by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, I am prepared to accept that your station's breaches of the regulations were inadvertent rather than deliberate. However, I am also convinced there is an element of negligence involved. In view of this I believe I have no course other than to apply some form of penalty. The Broadcasting and Television Act provides only one penalty; suspension of a licence for a period not exceeding 7 days. I would rather avoid .applying such a penalty in this situation. However, I am convinced that some action must be Yours sincerely, taken. (Moss Cass) Minister for the Media Unless I receive from you by 5.00 p.m. Thursday 7 August, an acceptable alternative suggestion as to some action you will undertake which will demonstrate public acknowledgement of the breaches and will penalise the station in some way, I am obliged to suspend your licence for an appropriate period. Yours sincerely, NA MrE. G. MCRae, Chairman of Directors, Tasmanian Television Ltd, Box I209M.G.P.O., Hobart, Tas. 7001",34
46,Dr CASS,MOSS CASS,"Havin g had this informal disthe said company has failed to cussion with representatives from the station, I made it clear that if they were prepared to make a gesture it would resolve the difficulty. For example, they could refrain from having advertisements on for the period for which they had transgressed. As I got a bit of feedback that might put them in a difficult position with their advertisers, I would have let them put their advertisements on and donate the proceedings to a charity. I was perfectly happy to accept that proposal. Mr Donald Cameron-To the Labor Party?",35
47,Dr CASS,MOSS CASS,"No, not to the Labor Party-to an acceptable charity which they could nominate themselves. I ask the honourable member not to get scungy about it. I was perfectly happy with either of those possibilities, in which case I would not have imposed a penalty. That would have signified that the station had recognised that a mistake had been made. That was all that I thought ought to be done. However, I subsequently learned- I cannot vouch for this, but I have been told-that the station representatives were leant on by somebody and told not to do this sort of thing. They had to stand up and resist the monster from Canberra, I take it. So, in my view, I had no alternative but to flick them with a feather duster. That is all it was really; let us it. I could have taken the station off the air for a whole week. The suspension was for only 2 hours to make the point. If all the commercial networks are in an uproar about it, I am perfectly happy to meet them and discuss alternative proposals so that we can introduce a Bill into this House to change the Act. Hopefully honourable members opposite will endorse the proposal, as we will. We will then get more adult, sensible and intelligent means of control-if control is needed - for commercial stations.",36
48,Mr SPEAKER,MOSS CASS,Order! I ask honourable can members to make their questions somewhat by shorter. I ask Ministers to make their answers considerably shorter. The answers so far this afternoon have been exceedingly long. The quesdecisions tions have provoked long answers. I think Ministhe ters should refrain from going into a complete historical analysis and should seek to answer questions in a shorter form. NON-OFFICIAL POST OFFICES,36
49,Mr HEWSON,MOSS CASS,"I ask the Minister representCourt ing the Postmaster-General: Has the Governin ment given consideration to the proposals in conto nection with the new Postal Commission to alter the title of non-official post offices to postal agents? If the changes are made, will the present rights and privileges be retained to protect the non-official postmaster, and will his duties remain the same?",36
50,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MOSS CASS,"As I understand the position, there will not be any real change. I have not had the benefit of discussing the matter with the Postmaster-General but I am assured that the Australian Postal Commission itself has discussed the matter. There have been a lot of groundless fears and a lot of suggestions that changes are going to be made, but I understand there is no truth in them. If there is anything I have to add which I can acertain by further inquiry, I will let the honourable member know. NA",36
51,Mr MCKENZIE,FAMILY LAW ACT,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Following the passing of the Fanuly Law Bill by the Parliament, I and many other honourable members have received numerous inquiries regarding the future operation of the Family Law Act. Can the Attorney General inform the House of the progress to date in introducing the Family Court of Australia and the likely date of commencement of the Family Law Act?",36
52,Mr ENDERBY,FAMILY LAW ACT,"I thank the honourable face gentleman for the question because I too have had a number of inquiries about the matter and it has been the subject of speculation in the Press. Honourable members will recall the passing of the Family Law Bill through this House. It received the royal assent on 12 June 1975. There is a section in it, section 41, that requires me to confer with the various State Attorneys on the subject to give them the option of setting up family courts within the various States of the Federation. That consultation has been going on. I have attended personally on each of the State Attorneys, which has taken time in itself. The matter has been the subject of correspondence, and I tell the House now that I have been informed the Attorneys in each of the States, other than Western Australia, that they do not wish to set up a family court in their States. I imagine that the in the States had to be considered by respective Cabinets. New South Wales and Victoria were fairly early off the mark, but I was the informed by the Minister for Justice in Queensland only a week or 10 days ago that Queensland does not wish to set up a family court in Queensland but would prefer the Family of Australia to operate there. Mr MCNeill Western Australia has told me that he prefers set up a family court of Western Australia, and no doubt that will be done in due course there. There are other aspects that have to be considered. For example, the Act in its present form puts a limitation on the number of judges that may be appointed. It restricts the number to seven. In view of the developments I have outlined to the House, the number will now have to be increased. That will be the subject of regulations that I will be introducing into the Parliament in the not too distant future. are the problems of acquiring premises, recruitsuggested ing staff, having interviews, placing advertisethe ments and providing for appeals within the Pubsuggestion? lic Service for people who might want to claim that they should have a position. However, I am happy to tell the House now that the date when we hope to have, or will have, the Family Law Act operating is 5 January 1976. NA NA",36
53,Mr STREET,DEVELOPMENT SCHEME,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor. I refer to his refusal to answer the question whether there will be an allocation of funds to the Regional Employment Development scheme in the Budget. Is the RED scheme funded by Supply until 30 November? Has the RED scheme in fact already run out of money voted for it, which was to last until 30 November, because of the huge increase in demand for RED funds resulting from the Government's causing over 250 000 people to be unemployed?",37
54,Mr RIORDAN,DEVELOPMENT SCHEME,"I repeat what I said earlier. The RED scheme and its future activities and $ funding are contained in the Budget. I want to take up again the point that the honourable gentleman raised about unemployment created by the Government. I categorically deny his sertion. Horse laughs from the Opposition do add any more credit to that assertion. The fact the matter is that the economy has been through a period of downturn in the same way as similar pins? economies in western Europe, North America and Japan have gone through a downturn. The Government has illustrated over recent monthsand I believe it will illustrate it even more clearly in the immediate future-it s very great concern bring inflation under control. There is simply doubt that the level of inflation has been responLiberal-Country sible for a signincant increase in the rate of employment. I believe that this is now being cepted by large sections of the community. would simply say this to the honourable gentlenight, man who asked the question: If he believes that unemployment in Australia can be rectified simply by having bigger and better RED months. schemes, I have less respect for him than 1 previously. AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY: JULY NA",37
55,Mr DAWKINS,DEFICIT,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Did he see an article in the West There Australian newspaper this morning which that the Government was rocked by July deficit? Is there any substance in the If not, in the interests of raising the standard ofeconomic debate in Australia will the Treasurer arrange for some special instruction to be made available for the journalist on the subject of the interpretation of national accounts?",37
56,Mr HAYDEN,DEFICIT,"I noted the comment in the West Australian this morning. The Government was not rocked. We were well aware of the dimensions of the deficit for the month of July. It is usual for the July monthly deficit to be bulging in comparison with other months. On this occasion there was an added reason. I ought to point out that it is also usual for the development of the deficit to be more significant in the first half of thefinancialyear than in the second half. However, there were special circumstances that affected this July. Unusually in the second half of last financial year there was a substantial increase in Government outlays consciously injected into the economy for the purpose of supporting the private sector. In fact, over the 12monthly period the additional outlays over those proposed in the Budget were of the order of 1,600m. It is possible to identify about $ 1,300m of that amount as having a fairly direct stimulatory effect for the private sector. I wonder whether anyone on the opposite side of the asHouse would argue that stimulation should not not have been provided. If honourable members opof posite do argue that way I would ask them: From under what sectors do they propose to pull the The facts are that the level of the deficit in July was anticipated. The people who advise us, the to technical people who assist this Government, are no the same technical people who assisted previous Party governments. They were uncompetent in these things then; they are comacpetent now. We were well informed. As honour I able members will discover from the Budget toan appropriate calculation has been made for this and for all other factors in the economic management of the country over the next 12 The last proposition put forward by the had honourable member is an interesting one and I will consider it. NA",37
57,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,RANGER PROJECT,My question to the Prime Minister comprises 5 sentences. What arrangements for profit sharing have been made between the participants in the Ranger project? How will supervision of the accounts and the revenue from the project be exercised? What part will the Auditor-General and/or the Government play in that supervision? What are the proposed sources of public money for the project? Have any efforts been made to obtain loans overseas or is it intended to obtain loans overseas for the Ranger project?,38
58,Mr WHITLAM,RANGER PROJECT,The arrangements for Ranger are the same as announced to the House last October. I expect that within the next few weeks there will be further discussions between the Australian Government and the Ranger interests. NA,38
59,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I ask a question of the Prime Minister. Have the pleas of the Leader of the Opposition for 'minimum controls over the pursuit of alternative life styles compatible with human dignity' had any impact upon the Government's priorities or will the Government regard this advice, as the Melbourne Age does, as imprecise, disturbing waffle?",38
60,Mr WHITLAM,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"If the Melbourne Age can bring itself to making that comment about the Leader of the Opposition I should of course hasten to endorse it. I must say that I have not followed all the vagaries of the honourable gentleman's philosophy. The one that particularly remains in my mind, of course, is this idea of imposed equality-that is, the idea that people should attain those positions to which they were born and the devil take the hindmost. It is quite clear that in the interstices of his philosophy there is an itch to dismantle those things which the Labor Government has introduced to bring equality of opportunity to all people in Australia, whether they were born here or migrated here, wherever they live in Australia and whatever their parents' means were. The creation of equal opportunities should be the first task of any government, and it will continue to be the first preoccupation of the present Government. NA",38
61,Mr OKEEFE,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS,"I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Is it a fact that many thousands of young Australians are drawing full unemployment benefits and living in our coastal areas? Has the number of young people living in the areas mentioned and seeking social security benefits doubled in the past 7 months? What action does the Government intend to take to make sure that these people can be gainfully employed or work for the social security assistance being given to them, thus making a contribution for the benefit of the nation?",38
62,Mr STEWART,UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS,It is not true that many thousands of young people living on the coast of Australia are drawing unemployment benefits. It is the intention of the Government to make absolutely certain that anyone who is in receipt of social security benefits receives them because they are due to him and not because he is infringing the regulations in any way. The Department of Social Security carries out work tests and makes checks on the people who are receiving unemployment benefits. In the last few months in particular many young people and others have had their unemployment and sickness benefits discontinued because they have been detected infringing the regulations. It is the Government's intention to review continuously the payment of social security benefits to make certain that they are paid only to people who are entitled to receive them. NA,38
63,Mr DUTHIE,SUPERPHOSPHATE SUBSIDY,"I ask the Prime Minister: Did the Cabinet have before it last week the Industries Assistance Commission interim report recommending r e s to r at i o n of the superphosphate subsidy? Was a decision made by Cabinet for or against that recommendation, or did Cabinet refer the question to the Government Resources Committee? If the latter is so, were not Press reports that Cabinet had rejected the recommendation wholly, utterly and mischievously false?",38
64,Mr WHITLAM,SUPERPHOSPHATE SUBSIDY,"I do not remember seeing many reports on the subject; so I will not venture to categorise any reports as mischievous. The Government did not consider the Industries Assistance Commission interim report on superphosphate. I expect that it will be doing so at the next Cabinet meeting or the one after. The honourable gentleman mentions one of the Government committees. I have no doubt that that committee would bring down an overwhelming endorsement of the majority opinion of the IAC. I am equally certain that the Government Economic Committee would bring down an overwhelming endorsement of the minority IAC opinion. So, if the honourable gentleman is seeking to give the Cabinet the benefit of committee advice on this, perhaps he could get the 2 committees together. I would imagine that then we would be dealing with a majority report and a minority report. As the honourable gentleman knows, in all these matters the Government publishes the report as early as possible. It also seeks the advice of all the relevant departments. PRE-BUDGET DISCUSSIONS",38
65,Mr HYDE,SUPERPHOSPHATE SUBSIDY,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it true that only 4 members of the 27-man Ministry met representatives of primary industry for pre-Budget discussions and that one of those members could not or would not spare the time to sit through those discussions? Is it true that the 3 Ministers who sat through the discussions were the Minister for Environment, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs?",39
66,Mr WHITLAM,SUPERPHOSPHATE SUBSIDY,"I do not know, Sir. NA",39
67,Mr MORRIS,MEDIBANK,"I ask the Minister Assisting Minister for Social Security: What action can the Australian Government take to prevent the Party. heartless, callous and iniquitous practice being followed by some general practitioners in preferential demanding payment in advance, at rates oftengiving times in excess of the scheduled fee, from invalid and age pensioners before they will provide medical attention?",39
68,Mr STEWART,MEDIBANK,"I do not know what one can do with people who deliberately set about to infringe an Act of Parliament and who refuse abide by the regulations which are laid down. That is not the only thing which is happening with doctors under the Medibank system. Some doctors are refusing to refer patients to a specialSturt. ist because that specialist is bulk billing. tirely unjust for people to suggest that we are wrong in introducing Medibank.

We will continureal ally review the activities of the medical proas fession and of chemists who act as agents Medibank to see that the people of Australia ceive the benefits of a health system to which they are entitled.

If so, what steps are being taken to make that appointment?",39
70,Mr UREN,HOUSING CORPORATION,The Government has no commitment in this respect. The nomination of the Returned Services League of Australia was considered by Cabinet. It made its decision. At no time was there any commitment by the Government to the RSL. That is a falsity. NA,39
71,Mr YOUNG,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN ELECTIONS,"Has the Minister for Services and Property studied the recent South Australian election for the Legislative Council which, for the first time, was elected on a system of optional preferential voting? Has there been any complaint about the system used or any suggestion by any political party that the system should be altered for future elections?",39
72,Mr DALY,SOUTH AUSTRALIAN ELECTIONS,"I have studied the results of the South Australian elections. They were very satisthe factory from every point of view. They even resulted in a change of leadership in the Liberal The results of the elections, particularly for the Upper House, indicated that optional voting is a very effective method of democracy in a real way to all people in the country. I noticed that in South Australia 6 Australian Labor Party members were elected to the Upper House, with 3 Liberal Party members and 2 Liberal Movement members. Under the optional preferential system one had only to vote to on a group basis for one candidate. As a matter of fact, on one occasion in this Parliament that method was suggested to this House by that outstanding radical, the honourable member for It is a method which commends itself to a It is enlot of people throughout the country. Until 1973 in South Australia the Liberal Party had 16 members in the Upper House and the Australia Labor Party 4 members. In other to words, voting for the Legislative Council was under restrictive franchise and most undemocratic. Thanks to the optional preferential system democracy prevails in South Australia as far the election of members to the Upper House is under concerned. It has now 10 members of the re Australia Labor Party, 9 members of the Liberal Party and 2 members of the Liberal Movement. I believe the optional preferential system of voting is one of the most democratic advances which this country can endorse. It was opposed by the Opposition in another place, and here also, when sought to introduce it for Senate elections, but South Australia there has been no complaint by any section of the community or any political party about the result or the methods employed. Might I just give a bit of advice, which I rarely give to those opposite? They should follow the example of South Australians, introduce an optional preferential system in accordance with what has been presented to the Australian Parliament by the present Government, and in that way we would get the democratic results that have come on this occasion to the South Australian Upper House.",39

These proposals formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes introduced by gazette notices during the last recess. The changes arise from the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the Textiles Authority in its report on certain yarns and textile products and of the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on nitrogenous fertilizers. Also included in the proposals are the addition of further commodities to Schedule A of the New Zealand-Australi a Free Trade Agreement and a modification of the developing countries' preference in respect of toy balloons. Changes of an administrative nature in the footwear area of the tariff have also been made to remove certain redundant provisions.

On 5 June 1975, the House disagreed to the amendments that the Senate had made that day to the Superannuation Bill 1975. The reasons adopted by the House for disagreeing to the amendments were: Because the superannuation arrangements for Australian Government employees that would result from the amendments proposed would be detrimental to many existing contributors to the present superannuation pension scheme: leave would compare unfavourably with the superannuation schemes maintained by the State governments for their employees; and would result in complex and difficult adminisparagraph (a) leave trative arrangements. The Senate, however, on 11 June 1975 decided (6), leave out '60 years', to insist on the amendments.

By far the worse feature of the Senate amendments is the option provision that would allow contributors the present pension scheme to remain in that scheme providing they contributed at the higher age 60 retirement rates. The problems and detheir fects of the present pension scheme are well documented. It is most complex and expensive to administer and is rapidly becoming unworkable.

The Senate's failure to pass the legislation has meant that the new scheme could not come into operation on 1 July 1975, the date of commencement specified in the Bill. Because of the very serious difficulties that would be associated with retrospective operation of the new scheme the Government therefore proposes to put aside the present Bill and shortly to introduce a new Bill in the same form, but providing for the scheme to come into operation from a date to be proclaimed.",45
92,Mr GARLAND,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS,"The Opposition will vote against this motion. I want to draw attention immediately to the attitude displayed by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Stewart) in the prepared speech which he delivered in this House, a copy of which he handed to me 2 minutes ago for the first time. His speech underlined the attitude taken by the Government in this matter from the beginning which is that it is the perfect scheme. The Government offers this scheme to the Parliament, to the taxpayers as well as to Government employees on a take it or leave it basis-a n all or nothing approach. That has been the attitude of the Minister and of other Ministers not only in this House but in the Senate. Their attitudes have been revealed as the debate has unfolded. We, of course, have just had a lengthy recess. This matter reached a deadlock situation be that cause of the action taken by the Government June this year. At no time during that recess the Government mention to the Opposition it was thinking about this matter. It did not indichanges cate whether there could be a meeting of the minds on some of the points. The Government's attitude is that there is nothing to be said for of the Opposition's amendments and that bring in a new Bill to deal with the situation. The Australian Labor Party is the Government. It to govern and has to deal with the existing ation. The attitude that, after all the discussions that have taken place, Parliament should not permitted to make any amendments to the Bill, that there ought not to be any changes to this scheme because it is of such great perfection, obviously silly. Indeed, representations have been made to me by people relying on advice that has been given by the Government and, indeed, by some of its advisers that that is attitude of the Government and that we, in the Opposition, had something of a cheek to disThe agree in any way with these proposals. If that were the case what is Parhament for? I should like to refer to one or two matters the relatively short time. I am permitted to speak because this matter will continue obviously in the future. It must. I start off with the point that an or nothing approach was the attitude of the Government. When I stood in this place last, in June, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation, who is sitting at the table, could not wipe the grin off his face. He thought he had an election winner and that it would see the Government through because of the great number of Commonwealth employees concerned. The Attorney General (Mr Enderby) who is in the chamber- I am not sure whether he made a speech or interjected-indicate d he was very pleased that this situation had arisen. Now, of course, they are not so sure that they are on an election winner and the tone is more muted. The Minister for Tourism and Recreation talked about what happened on 5 June. He did not add, as he could have, that when we sought to respond on 5 June the debate was gagged by his colleagues who are sitting on the benches behind him at this moment. The Minister went on to recite the reasons adopted by the House. I hope that he will be gracious enough to recall that the Opposition voted against those reasons and that what he calls the decision of the House was a motion supported by Labor Party supporters only. Of course, the way the motion reads is biased. It talks about our proposals being detrimental to existing contributors-althoug h has been explained-and speaks of our proin posals comparing unfavourably with superannudid ation schemes maintained by the State governwhat ments. We have explained ad nauseam that made in the schemes in two of the States flowed from the proposals of this Government. The changes in those schemes were as a result of any those proposals. I believe that those States will it will rue the day they took that action. We in this place have a responsibility to look has at Government proposals and proposed laws situand to decide what is responsible and what is not. We recognise that the present superannube ation scheme needs to be changed. We have emphasised every time this matter has come up for debate, and on behalf of the Opposition in is Press releases and statements that I have prepared, the features of the new scheme that we think are desirable. But, when our amendments were moved, who was it who allowed the deadthe lock to continue so that the new scheme could not come into operation? It was the Government. Government's insistence on that deadlock has meant members in their latter years of service will have to keep on paying the onerous conin tributions. The Minister for Tourism and Recreation has described these contributions as punitive rates. Of course they are punitive rates. This is all the main disability in the present scheme. For the needs of most people, it must be changed. But, if the Government allows a situation to develop in which it will not accept amendments dealing with 3 areas of the whole superannuation package, that position will continue. In its statement, the Government says that it has found a reasonable solution. We believe that the solution that was found to the problems was unreasonable. In any package of superannuation proposals there is in each feature a range from generous to less generous. What the Government did in its proposals, we believe, was to choose the most generous aspect of every feature. We have pointed out four of these over-generous aspects and the Senate has agreed with three of them. We believe that those 4 aspects were overgenerous. We have sought to amend not the whole scheme but the proposals in those areas. There has been a deliberate muddying of the pool by the Government. Mr Stewart-You sound as though you are regretting your action.",46
93,Mr GARLAND,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS,"You read your speech. It was carefully written by someone else. Perhaps you will allow me, in the 7 minutes that I have left",47
94,Mr SPEAKER,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS,Order! I suggest that the honourable gentlemen on my right remain silent and that the honourable gentleman who is addressing the House address the Chair.,47
95,Mr GARLAND,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS,"I was doing that, as you are aware, Mr SPEAKER ",47
96,Mr SPEAKER,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS,Order! I do not think you were. I have asked you to do so.,47
97,Mr GARLAND,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS,"I was doing that. I wish to touch on some of the points which have heen raised. My time is Umited. No doubt the Minister for Tourism and Recreation will not seek to give me an extension of time to deal with these points which have been raised by way of criticism. I refer, first of all, to the policy of the sition in respect of the normal retiring age. We took considerable interest in the evidence that exists as to what should be the normal proper retiring age and came to the conclusion that the proper one was 65 years. The new scheme put forward by this Government proposed a normal retiring age of 60 years on full pension. The adoption of that retiring age would have resulted in a 30 per cent increase in the cost of the scheme. This increase would have been brought about by paying a pension for an additional 5 years and meeting the consumer price index adjustments to that pension. We referred to a schedule that was attached to the Bill as there was an indication in that schedule that people were to be encouraged later to retire at 55 years or between 55 years and 60 years. We noted that there was a discounting of 4 per cent of the pension for each year below 60 years. We thought that that was an appropriate discounting to make in respect of the pension paid to any contributor who retired at an age earUer than 65 years. That scale relating to a retiring age between 55 years and 60 years is indicative of the direction in which the Government was pointed in its approach to this matter. In this one area there would be a 30 per cent greater cost to the Australian taxpayers if a contributor was to retire at age 60 instead of age 65. We believe that the proper retiring age is 65. years. To say, as many people have, that by our proposal we are forcing employees to work to age 65 is playing fast and loose with the truth. The terms and conditions of employment are laid down in the Public Service Act and other Acts. It is for a member to decide when he wishes to retire. The question here is what amount of pension a member should receive on retirement at a given age. The Opposition says that, for a member retiring at 60 years, the payment of 80 per cent of full pension is a reasonable discounting as it is the rate of discounting which the Government was prepared to introduce for a lower age of retirement. The new scheme provides for a contributor the right to take a lump sum payment, together with other rights. The Minister would be aware that most of the conditions concerning existing members were to be covered by regulations. He has not let us see any draft regulations. We do not know what those details were to be. We would have envisaged that members who under our scheme opted to stay in the existing scheme would have perhaps some of those rights given to them including, among others that we could consider, the change in respect of the position of widows. This raises a matter of which I spoke earlier, Opponamely, the need for some give and take and some discussion on this matter. By its whole manner and attitude, the Government has refused to do this. I might add that this is demonstrated particularly by the antagonism the Government displayed in the debate on these proposals in the Senate. As a result, these matters cannot have been fully discussed in a reasonable way because there has been no reasonable approach. Apparently we must now wait until this new Bill is presented to see what range of features it offers and how much the Government may wish to see itself in the role of buying votes and of being over-generous again. Perhaps it will be' identical. At times when I hear Ministers and other Labor supporters speak about these proposals I wonder whether they really know the costs that are involved in this scheme. What about the unions representing blue collar workers and also pensioner organisations which are complaining so much about these proposals? They are properly asking: Why is it that this Labor Government should be giving such advantages to one sector of the community? Why is it putting those in the Government service in such a superior position to those in superannuation schemes outside the Government service or indeed to those who have no superannuation schemes at all? The ngures from the Government Actuary-thes e were produced pretty well at the last minute, when the debate on this matter was last heldshowed that if the Commonwealth were to set aside money for a funded scheme, which it does not do, approximately 23 per cent of the salaries and wages paid to Government employees would be required to meet the cost of that scheme. That is based on certain long range assumptions, including an inflation rate of 3.9 per cent and an interest rate of 5.5 per cent. It very difncult to believe in the present conditions that even over a long period such rates are likely to be the case. We recognise that there would be some memreason bers in the existing scheme who would wish to stay where they are. On the principle that a promise has been made to them in that respect we believe that it is right to say to those people that if they want to stay in it is reasonable for them to opt for the existing scheme, although frankly I do not believe that many would stay the existing scheme, in spite of some of the comOne ments that have been made in this place. It can be a matter of judgment only. I do not believe that many would stay in the existing scheme. think that some contributors in their last year two of service might contemplate it. I doubt whether younger people would want to be to locked into a position in which they thought they would remain for the rest of their service. There is a limit to what can be done in relation to making of some sort of amendment from the trying Opposition side of the chamber. We of the Oppocommunity. sition are not in the position to make sweeping changes to the scheme and to look again at some of these things from the beginning. Broadly speaking, we can only lay down the general prinmade. ciples of what we believe should be the case and identify areas of over-generosity. If the Government digs in its heels and will not do anythingthat has been the situation until now-ther very little that we can do about it. The Attorneythrashed General refused in writing to give drafting assistance. People can point to this aspect and to that aspect and complain, but I believe that we have tried to adopt a reasonable approach to the matter. I believe also that many of the people who have been complaining have been anxious to believe the propaganda that has emanated from the Australian Labor Party and, indeed, have been misled by a few of their own trade union leaders. I think that they do not understand the cost involved and how relatively badly off are the people outside of the service of the Government who, after all, are also paying high income taxes and having their take-home pay reduced. They are not getting into a scheme that will allow them to be index-linked-tie d to the consumer price index-and proofed against the ravages of inflation that is affecting the rest of the community. I have no time to go on further. The Opposition maintains its view. It is open to further consideration of the details if that is what the Government wishes. It is the Government. It has to govern. It has to face up to the situation. I think 1 is have referred to enough items to make clear the Opposition's view and in general the principles behind its adoption.",47
98,Mr ENDERBY,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS," I would be remiss for no other than the fact that I am the honourable member for Canberra in this House if l were not to say a few words in reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland), who has just resumed his seat. One is continually surprised by the abUity of the honourable gentleman to take a set of facts and twist them to his in own advantage. The facts here are quite clear. knows that there is indeed a great degree of inequity in the existing superannuation scheme. The honourable member for Curtin has conI ceded that. Yet he has said that in seeking to or remove those inequities the Government is trying to win votes. The Government will always seek remove inequities. The honourable gentleman has had the gall to say in defence of the action of his colleagues in the Senate that they are trying the to save the taxpayers' money and that they are to think of other interested groups in the It is well known that this proposal will not cost the taxpayers any more money. It is just a more efficient and more rational use of the existing resources of the contributions being Mr Garland-Look at your own figures.",48
99,Mr ENDERBY,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS,"I can tell the honourable e is gendeman that the measure was thoroughly out in the party rooms of the Australian Labor Party before the final decision was taken on it because within the ranks of the Party there were a number of people who had expressed interest and concern lest the situation be what he had said it is. Every one ofthose doubts was put to rest because the measure was subjected to a thorough scrutiny and a thorough examination. It was referred to auditors and costed out. The Government went ahead with the measure in order to give a greater degree of equity to the quarter of a million or so public servants of the Australian Government. Lest the honourable gentleman should underestimate the feeling on this subject, I point out that it is my understanding that the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia took the view that the Government takes on the subject and made representations to people on his side of the House not to be stubborn, not to be foolish and not to try and. win votes in the way in which honourable members opposite are obviously trying to win them-by appealing to some kind of prejudice outside against public servants. I understand that that branch of the Liberal Party made such representations but that its appeals fell on deaf ears. The arrogance that so often comes forward from the Liberal Party when it deals with its own colleagues in the Australian Capital Territory and that we saw manifested over 23 years revealed itself on this issue. I should also tell the honourable gentleman another fact of life. When one speaks with the omcers of the various white collar unions that speak for public servants on these matters one finds that they are almost united and speak with almost one voice on one aspect of this matter; that is, that if the amendments in the form that they have come to us from the Senate were to be accepted their acceptance would cause an even greater amount of inequity and place an even greater financial burden on public servants than the present scheme casts upon them-the present scheme that the Government knows to be wrong and wants to change and that the Opposition knows to be wrong but, speaking with 2 voices, finds a reason for opposing. That is all I wanted to say. The facts will speak for themselves. No doubt the people of Canberra and the other parts of Australia in which public servants live and work will also speak for themselves.",48
100,Mr HOWARD,EXAMPLES OF INCREASES IN CONTRIBUTIONS,"The conabout tribution that I make to this debate will be short. In view of the aspersions cast by the Attorneythat General (Mr Enderby) on the motives of the Opmatter position in relation to this matter I think it is proper that I should say 2 things. The Opposition has not approached this matter in a political but sense, in the sense of solely being concerned with currying pohtical favour. If the Opposition had approached it in that manner the very simple, expeditious, easy option would have been to adopt the Government's scheme in to to. The Opposition realises that there has been criticism of its stand. I, along with other members of the Opposition, have received submissions which, I might say, have been in the main very courteously and helpfully put by leaders of the Public Service unions throughout Australia. We have Ustened to their points of view and can understand their interest in the matter. The fact of the matter is that the Opposition has decided that, having regard to all of the implications for the Australian economy at the present time, the stand it has taken is a reasonable one. In no way does it cut across the very many reforms which are contained in the 2 Bills which were debated during the last session. In no way does the Opposition's stand represent a punitive attitude towards Commonwealth public servants. The Opposition believes that it does have a responsibility to all sectors of the Australian community. It believes that it has an obligation not only to those employed in the public sector but also to those employed in the private sector. If there is one argument in the whole debate on this superannuation scheme that has not been answered by the Government and that in my beUef has not been effectively answered by the leaders of the Public Service unions in Australia it is the argument that if the benefits provided under this scheme were to be matched by the private sector an intolerable nnancial burden, particularly in the light of present economic difficulties, would be placed upon the private sector. In all responsibility to the Australian people we cannot put aside consideration of the impact of this scheme upon the private sector. It may suit the convenience bf the Government to do so but it does not suit the convenience of the Opposition. We believe that the impact of this scheme upon the private sector is a relevant consideration. That is one of the matters that weighed so heavily upon the Opposition in formulating its attitude. I want to make one other comment about the remarks of the Attorney-General. He talked the passage of a resolution at the Canberra Branch of the Liberal Party of Australia. I know a resolution was passed in relation to this and that it was carried by a vote of someonly thing like 22 to 18, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Garland), I really do not think that that sort of selective choosing of the actions of a particular branch of the Party really contributes very much to the debate. I could just as easily point out- I know it to Jacobi, be true-that some of the honourable members Jenkins, who sit opposite are still privately opposed to this Johnson, Les scheme and that so are some blue collar unions.

Consideration of Senate's amendment. Edwards, H. R. Ellicott, R.J. Clause 3. Section 3 of the Principal Act is repealed and the following section substituted: 3. The functions of the office of Parliamentary Counsel are(a) the drafting of proposed laws for introduction into either House of the Parliament and of amendments of proposed laws that are being considered by either House of the Parliament; (b) the drafting of instruments that are to be given the force of law by an Act; and (c) functions incidental to any of the preceding functions. Senate's amendmentAt the end of the proposed section 3 of the Principal Act, add the following new sub-section: (2) In discharging the functions of the office a section of not less than two of the professional staff shall be to draft proposed laws, amendments and instruments at the request of Members of the Parliament in priority to for Ministers.",49
101,Mr ENDERBY,PAIRS,"I move: That the House insists on disagreeing to the amendment insisted on by the Senate. Honourable members will recall this measure which proposed to make certain changes to the Parliamentary Counsel Act. The Opposition in this House sought to impose an obligation on the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to provide certain assistance to Opposition members. The amendment proposed by the Senate is to the effect that a section of not fewer than two of professional staff of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel should be seconded to draft proposed laws and amendments at the request of private members. The Government's reasons for moving that the House insist on disagreeing to the Senate amendment are the same as those which I put to the House on 3 June 1975 when the House conit sidered the Senate amendment and disagreed to it. In short, those reasons are that the needs of private members would be less adequately met under the amendment than they are at present and that the amendment would prejudice the legislative program of the government of the day, without giving to private members a corresponding benefit. I should add once again to what I have said before, that it is the Government's intent to every possible assistance to honourable bers, including backbenchers, whether they be on the Government side or on the Opposition side. Honourable members will appreciate that the strains on the office of Parliamentary Counsel these days are immense. They are immense begood cause of the Government's very energetic and industrious program of law reform. The the measures that are put into this House which go the Senate, sometimes to be rejected there, someThe times to have amendments made there and sometimes to pass there, cast a burden of legislatsition ive activity on the office of Parliamentary sel which has never been equalled in the history of Australia since Federation. try to make the services of officers available, it would be counter-productive to write in a law that they must be available in the ways in which the Opposition puts forward. As I fore, the Government could not possibly accept that situation.",51
102,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"The Opseconded position regrets that the Government will not services accept the amendment which was inserted during the Senate debate on this Parliamentary Counsel Bill 1975. The argument advanced by the Opposition is, in our belief, a very strong argument. Having regard to theremarksthat were made on an earlier occasion today regarding the dignity of the procedures of this House, the Opposition wonders whether some of the things said by Government members were completely sincere. One of the important things that has to be achieved if the procedures of this House are to become more effective and if the Executive is not to have a completely untrammelled run-be it an Executive of the present Government's political persuasion or an Executive at some time in the the not too different future of the opposite persuasion-the n more effective parliamentary facilities must be provided for private members. I repeat what was said in the earlier debates on this measure: The Opposition is in no way critical of the efforts of Parliamentary Counsel to assist the Opposition at present. But as the Attorney General (Mr Enderby) rightly pointed out, the legislative burden at the present time is such that is just not possible for the type of assistance that ought to be provided to be provided. In the Opposition's view, that is all the more reason for the insertion of the amendment that was placed in this Bill during the Senate debate. The Attorney-General spent some time talking about the massive legislative program that the Government had undertaken. Whilst that is acknowledged, I think that many honourable memgive bers on this side of the House and people memthroughout the Australian community, might well think that had there been a little less legislation from this Government in many areas and a little more responsible government, we would all be a great deal better off. So it is hardly a very excuse for the attitude that the Government is taking towards our amendment just to refer to sheer quantity of legislation that has been to passed during the lifetime of this Government. Opposition regrets that the Government will not agree to the Senate amendment. The Oppodoes not intend to change its attitude in this Counplace on the Senate's amendment and will accordingly vote against the motion moved by the Although we do Attorney-General.

JUSTIN O'BYRNE President The Senate, Canberra, 5 June 1975 Motion (by Mr Uren) agreed to: That the message be taken into consideration forthwith.",53
104,Mr UREN,RESOLUTION AGREED TO BY HOUSE OF," I move: (1) That the modifications of the Senate be disagreed to. (2) That a message be sent to the Senaterequestingreconsideration by the Senate of the resolution in respect of the modifications disagreed to. For too long now this Parliament has paid lipservice to the long standing goal of buUding a permanent Parliament House in Canberra. Once again we are on the way to being diverted from this main role. The time has come for immediate the standing orders, have effect action. The Senate has transmitted a message to us today which contains an Opposition amendment seeking to add a further term of reference that it concur and take action to the terms of reference of the proposed Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House and thus add to the Committee's task. The effect of this amendment will be to put the Committee under immediate pressure to resolve the very difficult question of accommodation in the present House. This can only mean that the special client committee will be diverted from its primary task, that is, to build the new Parliament House on Capital Hill as soon as possible. This is a goal for which we all are striving- a permanent Parliament House to serve parliamentary democracy in Australia. This is the important point we must now consider and resolve. To reassure aU honourable members on both sides of the Parliament that the unsatisfactory accommodation situation at present in the House is not being neglected, I point to the existence of the Joint House Committee whose role it is to pation; and examine questions such as that raised in the Senassistant.; ate amendment. It would be an appropriate task for this Committee to decide as soon as possible on which departments and people could be removed from the House to ensure that the members of the Parliament have adequate faciUties to sub-paragraph (1) (a), to report from carry out their elected duties until the new Parliatime to time; and ment House is built. sub-paragraph (1) (b), to report on or For these reasons the Government intends to before the lst day of November 1975, oppose the amendment. It hopes that the Senate sees the wisdom of this and accepts the resoluthe Resolution, so far as they tion of appointment as first proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). This wiU mean that we can get on with the job of buUding a new and permanent Parliament House without any further delay.",53
105,Mr DRURY,RESOLUTION AGREED TO BY HOUSE OF," I support the view that has just been put forward by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). I tliink those who have been in the Parliament for a number of years and have heard the matter of a new and permanent Parliament House debated a number of times would agree that the Minister is right when he says that there should be no further delay in proceeding and making a decision and taking the necessary steps to enable the new Parliament House to be got under way. I tliink one of the most important points to make is that in this matter there will no major outlay of finance for several years, even after the decision is made to proceed. I admire the attitude that has been taken by the Minister in his attempt to get a decision made on this very important matter for Australia. I do not want to prolong the debate. I merely want to indicate where I stand myself. I believe the Minister is moving in the right direction, and I for one am completely with him.",54
106,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,RESOLUTION AGREED TO BY HOUSE OF,"I rise in support of the attitude expressed by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). I very much support the remarks made by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury), whose interest in this matter is well known to the House. He has expressed a consistent view over a number of years. The purpose of the proposed Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House is to get on with the job of designing and buUding a new and permanent Parliament House for the Parliament of Australia. The present buUding is inadequate. Those who live in it know that very well. The opening comment of those who visit it always is: 'What a very old and archaic buUding it is'. The comfort of honourable members is not my prime concern. It seems to me that the amendments suggested by the Senate go more to the subject of the comfort of honourable member's at the moment than it goes to what in my view is the principal subject, and that is a buUding far more contemporary with political life in Australia and certainly far more contemporary with a parliament in a developing countiy in the last quarter of the 20th century and one that we trust will serve well into the 21st century. The present building not only has limitations in accommodation for members but in my view it has grave Umitations in the way in which it causes the parUamentary system to operate. The present buUding places a great deal of restraints and constrictions upon the very function it is supposed to assist the Parliament to carry out. It constrains and restricts the members in the carrying out of their tasks; it constrains and restricts the Parliament in its deUberation on a very wide variety of subjects. For those reasons I support the attitude expressed that the amendments suggested by the Senate ought to be rejected and that the proposition that was carried by this House is a sound one because it goes to the very root of the problem. It goes to the problem of getting a permanent Parliament House constructed on the site that has been decided by this Parliament, and be that is Capital HiU. The Minister for Urban and Regional Development has pointed out already that there is in existence a committee to care for this buUding; that is, the Joint House Committee. If. the proposition as agreed to by this House is changed in accordance with the modification suggested by the Senate the proposed committee will start to lose its effectiveness and it will divide its efforts between 2 jobs. Some honourable members may be of the view that the committee can function properly by exercising its mind in deliberating on 2 matters at the same time, but I am afraid that that is not my view and I am sure that it is not the view of the House. As I said, there is in existence a committee to care for the present Parliament House. It is proposed that a committee be formed to look after, to investigate and to oversee the design and construction of a new parliament house. I hope that this House, without disagreement, will report back to the Senate that it does not agree with the suggested changes. I also hope that at a very early date the proposed committee will be set up so that it may get on with the task of devising a new parUament house that will be far more in line with what is required in Australia from the 1970s right through to the year 2000. It is my hopeful wish that the same sort of institution will be in existence in the year 2100.1 commend the motion to the House.",54
107,Mr LLOYD,RESOLUTION AGREED TO BY HOUSE OF," I basically support the resolution but I more particularly support the resolution as amended by the Senate which not only is in favour of a joint committee proceeding with plans for the new parliament house but also includes a reference to investigate and make recommendations in respect of the provision of better and reasonable facUities for members in the present buUding here and now. I do not believe that the Senate's amendment is contradictory. I believe that the acceptance of the suggested modification is necessary for 2 reasons. One is that no matter how quickly any committee proceeds there will be quite a time lag before a new parliament house is constructed. With the best will in the world I think it would be 10 to 15 years before members were able to move into the new parliament house. There is a time lag between the design specifications, the construction and the movement of members and staff to the new building. I would think that in some ways 10 to 15 years could be a conservative estimate. What is to happen to the ordinary members Parliament who occupy this buUding? The faciliequality ties avaUable to them will not improve in that time. Their work load is increasing. The memMinistry bership of the House of Representatives is resbers. tricted to 127 at the present time. On many occasions wliile I have been a member of this House- I am sure that ordinary members who have, been here for much longer than I also have seen this- I have seen the rights of and the faciliDoes ties avaUable to the ordinary members come last in the Ust of priorities in what is actuaUy protravelUng vided in this buUding for those who occupy When one looks at other parUament houses and what is provided for members one can see the perhaps lavish provisions in the United States, but I will refer to Canada which is probably the most comparable country to Australia. In this Canada a federal member represents about half the number of people that a federal member in this country represents. Every ordinary member of the Federal Parliament in Canada has a separhas ate double office with a staff of two to assist in his work, and he considers that to be by no means a generous provision. Yet ordinary memous bers here, with twice the number of electors Federal members in Canada generally, have no support facUities at all in this buUding. One sees room after room in this place occupied by two and even 3 members. I believe that the previous Government was neglectful in this area, just as it appears that the leadership of the present Government is being neglectful of therightsand privUeges of the ordinary members of Parliament in this place. Putting to one side the Ministry and the faciUties provided for it, if there is a restriction on space this buUding then a reasonable requirement-as suggested in the Senate's amendment-is that ordinary members of Parliament should have first priority and that every other requirement for space in this building for the various officers and departments should come second. If the Parliament is to be the place for members of Parliament to carry out their duties rather than the place . for all the additional facilities and requirements that appear to have been tacked on over the years, then the rights of ordinary members of Parliament on both sides should come first. It is because of this time lag in processing detaUs for and creating a new and permanent parUament house, even with the best will in the world, that I think it is important that this amendment of the Senate be agreed to so that something can be done. In reply to a question during question time today the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) laid of stress on equaUty. I hope he wiU have a look at in this place and see the differences between the facUities avaUable to himself and the and those avaUable to ordinary memI would say the same thing if my Party were in government because this was true when it was in office. When one talks about travelling economy class and equaUty, does it mean that as members of Parliament we are aU to travel VIP? it mean that the Prime Minister also will travel economy class? One could also talk about in Mercedes-Benz cars. I believe that it. the Senate's amendment should be supported.",54
108,Mr BRYANT,RESOLUTION AGREED TO BY HOUSE OF," I am a little surprised that the Senate, after its long battle to get some action on matter, should delay it by this method. In a long history of parliamentary endeavour there is nothing more designed to delay things than seeking to amend running affairs. The Senate itself played a fairly effective part in having a dehim cision made on the location of the new permanent parUament house. I think it is fairly obvifrom all our experience that if you want of something done you hand it to someone whose function it is to determine that question and that question alone. This resolution from the Senate and the support from some members of the Opposition will only help to confuse matters because it is a different question altogether. The question of accommodation in this building at the present moment is under review by the Joint House Committee, as I understand it. I also understand that submissions have been made already and are in the process of being made ready for presentation to the appropriate in authorities. In fact, expenditure on this building is a matter that involves serious architectural constraints. It is a very difficult question and one which can be resolved only by close study by the appropriate authorities and the experts. There is not all that much that we can do about it. Consideration of a new and permanent parliament house and the function of the committee that we want estabUshed as soon as possible will call for the greatest possible inteUectual effort and continual study, work and consideration. It will not be a sinecure. In thefirstinstance we are going to erect a building which will be totally aifferent from any other building in this country-no t because it will be contemporary but because for the first time someone will be setting out to construct a building for a modern parliament and for that alone. I was a member of the original committee which examined the requirements of a new and permanent parhament house and brought down its report some 7 or 8 years ago on the functional relationship of the building and the accommodation that would be required. We travelled around the world and we investigated a number of other parliament houses. The thing that struck me- I presume it made the same impact upon the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury) who was a member of that committee-wa s that although some very fine buildings had been designed and built they did not cater for the functions of parliament. The Parliament House building in Kuala Lumpur, for instance, looks well on a postcard. The building in Delhi represents another architect's vision of what a parliament house ought to be, but it has been designed without much consultation with parliamentarians. In Rome and Bonn the staff are working under constraints imposed by old buildings. The British Houses of Parliament are a magnificent building but totally inadequate, as is the building in Ottawa which was mentioned by my friend the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). The function of parliament as an institution totally different from its function in the past. Great demands are placed upon the people who work in it. The general public are increasingly attracted to visit it. The people in it have an increasing workload and there is an increasing work force. In a way the parliamentary instituinformation tion now has to include executive functions, legislative functions and the general accommototaUy dation of the people who work in it. The Comnew mittee that has been set up has a very difficult and involved task before it. I can only hope it will get on with the job and, in the not too tant future, produce designs which will be a substantial advance on anything that has been produced so far anywhere else. I fondly hope that it will create a new style of architecture Australia. This matter has been fraught with unusual and unnecessary delays. The Committee produced report about 7 years ago. This House decided by a small majority that the new parhament house ought to be on Camp Hill. The Senate decided by a large majority that it ought to be on Capital Hill. I think that the majority in favour of the Capital Hill site was about thirty, there being a total of 185 members at that time. The then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton), perhaps acting in concert with his Cabinet but perhaps not, just announced in the House that as the Parliament could not make up its mind about the matter the Government itself would decide on it. He said: 'We will put it on Camp Hill'. One would have thought that even a Liberal Prime Minister would have been able to add up two simple numbers. Mr Donald Cameron-That move was not one ofhisfinestmoments.",55
109,Mr BRYANT,RESOLUTION AGREED TO BY HOUSE OF,"That is right. One would have thought that there were only two ballot boxes in that election-on e in the Senate and one in the House of Representatives-and that even a Liberal Prime Minister, dedicated to electoral inequaUty as all Liberals are-al l except my friend from Griffith-woul d have been able to add them together and say that the majority was in favour of Capital HiU. But he did not do that. The result is that for 7 years there has been a complete delay, and the person principally responsible must be the right honourable member for Higgins. If it had not been for his intervention in that way the building would now be half completed. So I think that it would be an important contribution to alacrity in this matter if the Opposition did not vote against the motion and if we relayed to the Senate the unanimous view of is this House that the Committee should get on with the job as it was defined by this House in the first place and that the function, the subject of the Senate's resolution, be returned to the respective House committees to establish the accommodation needs. As I understand it from I have received, submissions have been largely completed on the matter. This is a different function from the design of the and permanent parliament house. Therefore I suggest that this House carry the motion withthat out division so that the Senate will be disencouraged to make its decision without delay.",56

Shortly after I arrived in this Parliament in 1966 discussions on the siting of the new parliament house commenced. Here we are in the mid-1970s still discussing it. I feel that I share the view vast majority of Australians who have heard the various debates on this subject, that the nation is well convinced of the need for a new parUament house but is disgusted at the lack of abiUty of the Parliament itself to come to grips with making such a simple decision. I hope that today's debate wiU be the final one on this subject and that in the very near future we will get on with the job.",56
113,Mr DALY,RESOLUTION AGREED TO BY HOUSE OF,"At the outset I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) on one of the really good speeches I have heard him make the Parliament. I support the view put forward by the Minister for Urban and Regional governments Development (Mr Uren) that we should reject the Senate's amendment. The honourable memGovernment ber for Griffith and the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury)-and all honourable members bers. for that matter-mus t reaUse that no one would imagine that a parUament could be properly ducted with the sort of accommodation and fabreadth cilities that are avaUable here for members and others. It is true that we suffer greatly in son particularly with Canada and the United increased, States of America. The British House of Comassistance mons does not offer much in the way of facUities for private members. As the honourable member for Griffith said, for a long time-almos t since time. I entered the Parliament-ther e has been demand for a new parliament house. The facUito ties are not avaUable for Ministers and private members adequately to provide for the staff is necessary. The real purpose tion, which was moved and carried by the Parliament, was to get the proceedings under way and to commence the erection of a new parliament house. I thought that we had gone a long way when this matter was decided by a vote on noncontinue party Unes; undoubtedly this delaying tactic upset our hopes and aspirations. The amendment refers to matters relating facUities in this House at the present time. fact is that at the present time a committee investigating what can be done. But not much can be done in this building unless it is extended another storey or sideways or unless the waUs turned into concertina walls. All the inquiries the world would reveal that it is necessary erect another buUding, either by adding to this one or by buUding a new parliament house. Why the Senate should consider just investigating the possibUity of improving the facilities here is quite beyond me. I suggest that that is completely of order with what was meant by the original of the motion. Where will we get if we just keep on mquiring about what we can do in this Parliament House? Why not be more constructive and say: 'When can we commence to lay the foundation stone of a parUament house that will do justice not only to the people of this country but also to those who are honoured to represent them here?' Those people who have seen the Canadian buUding appreciate what has been done there. It is a magnificent Parliament House with good facUities for members. The same thing applies in the United States Congress. We have been asked to go into certain matters few in the resolution. The honourable member for in Murray mentioned the neglect of accommodation for honourable members. He criticised in which his own Party participated but he was also somewhat critical of the present and said that it also had gone to sleep in regard to facUities for honourable memI do not want to push the matter any further but all honourable members know that in the last confew y .rs, right throughout the length and ea of the country, the facilities for honourable members in their offices in their electorates compariand in other places have been substantially and the secretarial legislative research mentioned has been provided by the Labor Government. For 23-odd years Liberal governments did not bother to do anything the about that. The criticism by the honourable a member for Murray does him no credit. It is easy see that he did not suffer as other honourable members did from the complete lack of facilities that not only in this Parliament but also in the behind the resoluelectorates. This Government has not gone to sleep on the matter. It has put forward this motion regarding a new parUament house in order to improve and the progress it has made in providing will adequate facUities for members in this Parliament. Consequendy these delaying tactics do Uttle credit to the Senate and will not help those to who seek to improve conditions for honourable The members here. Every Minister and every private is member wants additional accommodation. Those who work within the Parliament, such as the clerks and others, need additional facilities. are The staff and all those associated with Parliain ment who work for the people of this country to certainly look forward to a better parliament house, better facUities and surroundings. I do not wish to say more than that I hope the Parliament wiU reject this suggestion and that the Senate, in good sense, will accept the original motion which out was sent forward and let a new Parliament House get under way. From what I have seen of the Senate, it could do with some improvements in its own facilities over there, as far as honourable senators are concerned. This offers the Senate that opportunity. I suggest again to the honourable member for Murray that while it does him Uttle credit to criticise honourable members on this side of the House for what has been done, by all means he should aim his darts at those who sat on this side for a long time and those in ministries who enjoyed to the full what a Minister could get in regard to facUities. Honourable members then on this side, as well as those of us who were then in Opposition, were given nothing at all in regard to what is needed by private members. I well remember that a member of the Opposition when he was defeated said: 'Do not blame us if you never get anything over there. Our Ministers did not give us anything either.' So it was all a one-way traffic. Under the previous Government 27 men had aU the faculties that mattered and private members got nothing inside or outside the Parliament. This practical attempt by the Government to see that we get under way with the new Parliament House deserves to be supported. Motions aimed at delaying the commencement of the important construction of a new Parliament House deserve to be opposed. We should send this resolution back to the Senate. We should advise the Senate that we want to get under way and that we hope it wants the same thing and supports the original motion which was sent there. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA",57

An application may be made to the Tribunal for a review of a decision of a Collector of Customs under section review under sec- 20 of the Spirits Act 1906-1973.'. Mr Enderby- I suggest it would suit the convenience of the Committee if the Senate amenda decision referred to in ments were considered in the following groups and order: Senate amendments Nos 1 to 19, 24 and 29 to 31 together; amendments consequential upon the acceptance of Senate amendments Nos 14 and 16; Senate amendments Nos 20 to 23 and 25 to 28 together; and Senate amendment No. 32.",58
115,The CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,Is it the wish of the Committee to adopt the procedure suggested to make an application under by the Attorney-General? There being no objection I will allow that course to be followed.,65
116,Mr ENDERBY,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT," I move: That Senate amendments Nos 1 to 19,24 and 29 to 31 be agreed to. As the Committee will recall, these amendments deal with a number of matters. In some cases the a decision referred to in amendments deal with substantive matters and in other cases the amendments are consequential upon amendments dealing with substantive matters. A substantial number of these amendments are consequential upon amendment No. 32. That amendment added a schedule to the Bill setting out those matters in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is to have jurisdiction immediately. The Senate amendments consequential upon Senate amendment No. 32 are application may be made to the Senate amendment Nos 1 and 7 to 13.1 point out that some of these amendments were moved by the Government in the Senate. Senate amendment No. 2 provides for the terms and conditions of service of members of the Tribunal to be prescribed by regulation instead of being determined by the Governor General. Senate amendment No. 3 is consequential upon this amendment. Senate amendments Nos 4, 6 and 29 are consequential upon Senate amendments Nos 20 to 28, omitting references to the Superior Court of Australia and substituting references to State and Territory Supreme Courts. Senate amendment No. 5 deleted a provision empowering the Minister administering the Act to permit a full-time member of the Tribunal to engage in outside paid employment. Senate amendments Nos 14 and 16 restrict to the Attorney-General the power to give a certificate entitling information or documents to be withheld from parties to proceedings before the Tribunal. Those amendments were moved by the Opposition. Senate amendments Nos 15, 17 and 18 clarify the grounds on which such a certificate may be given, and make consequential changes. Senate amendment No. 19 provides that a witness bedeciding fore the Tribunal may have legal representation. Senate amendment No. 30 inserts provisions in the Bill establishing an Administrative Review Council. The Government accepts and supports that provision completely. Senate amendment No. 31 amends the provisions in the Bill relating to the granting of legal aid to parties before the Tribunal. The substantial change is the omission of any specific reference to the Australian Legal Aid Office. On this point I take the opportunity say that of course the Legal Aid Bill is coming along. It will be considered by this House in the not too distant future. The Government stands firmly committed to the proposition of there being an Australian Legal Aid Office although the Government recognises that at this stage the Office has no legislative context or background, save for, I tbink, reference in some Acts, particuflesh, larly the FamUy Law Act. That is a matter at which the Government can look at another in the future when, I hope, the Legal Aid Bill becomes law.",65
117,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,"The AdestabUshed ministrative Appeals Tribunal Bill has already been the subject of a very lengthy debate in the House and also in the Senate. The Opposition pleased to say that it will support the ments now moved by the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby). Most of them, as the Attorney General has pointed out, are consequential upon amendments inserted during the Senate debate. The Attorney-General acknowledged that, substance, a number of the amendments he has just moved arose from amendments inserted by the Opposition. I am say that this Bill will, because of this debate, pass into law very soon and will bring conclusion a process which has been going on for a long time in Australia to provide for appeals against the exercise of administrative discretion. WhUe, during the course of the debate, there were some substantial disagreements between the Government and the Opposition regarding the original form of the Government's Bill, I think that aU honourable members will acknowledge that there has been a degree of unanimity on both sides of the House regarding the desirabUity of establishing an effective tribunal to review administrative decisions. In this regard the Opposition is pleased to support the amendments which have been moved by the Attorney General. We believe that they will improve the Bill. We believe in particular that it is desirable that the principal law officer of the Crown, the Attorney-General, have the responsibility of whether there should issue a certificate, which in effect excludes from the operation of the Tribunal certain acts of departments or Ministers. We believe that discretion should be with the Attorney-General and not with the individual Minister concerned. That point is, of course, the substance of amendments 1,2 and 3. The other amendments deal with the question of jurisdiction. The House will recall that, at the to time the Bill was debated during the second reading and Committee stages, the Opposition was critical of the fact that no jurisdiction had been conferred upon the Tribunal, that having come so far the Government did not go the step further and confer upon the Tribunal some effective jurisdiction, that we were given a framework without any substance or a skeleton without any as I think the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr EUicott) described it. Whilst the time amendments now proposed by the Attorney General perhaps fall short of those originally devised by the Opposition, we are nonetheless pleased to accept them so that the Tribunal once by this Bill when it becomes an Act will not only have an exceUent framework but it will also have some substantial jurisdiction. The is Opposition is pleased to support the amendamendments moved by the Attorney-General. Amendments agreed to.",66
118,Mr ENDERBY,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,"Consequentia l upon the acin ceptance by the House of amendments Nos 14 which and 16 of the Senate, I move: In clause 36, sub-clause (3), omit 'A Minister', substitute very happy to 'the Attorney-General'. In clause 36, sub-clause (4), omit 'Minister', substitute to a legislative 'Attorney-General'. In clause 46, sub-clause (2), omit 'a Minister', substitute a framework 'the Attorney-General'. I need not go over these amendments again. The matter has been the subject of debate on many occasions and indeed was touched on in my opening remarks and also by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). We accept the proposition and we think that the amendments improve the Bill.",66
119,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,Might I have the leave of the Committee to mention one matter which perhaps ought to have been more appropriately mentioned during debate on the earlier clauses and that is the question of the Australian Industrial Court. The Committee will recall that,67
120,The CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,"Dr Jenkins) The honourable member is seeking leave to deal with this point. Is leave granted? Mr Enderby-Yes , it is.",67
121,The CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,Leave is granted.,67
122,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,"I thank the Committee. Honourable members will recall that at the time of the earlier debate and also during the Senate debate the Opposition criticised the Bill for having conferred jurisdiction on the proposed Superior Court of Australia to hear appeals on matters of law from the Admhiistrative Appeals Tribunal. Honourable members will be aware that the Opposition is opposed to the establishment of the Superior Court of Australia. During the Senate debate the Opposition secured the insertion in the Bill of amendments to confer that jurisdiction on the Supreme Courts of each of the States. Whilst the Opposition still holds to the view that it would be more desirable that the jurisdiction be vested in the Supreme Courts of the various States, in the interests of the legislation coming into force at an early date and having regard to the spirit of some compromise which has been adopted by the Government in respect of other Opposition amendments, the Opposition will not oppose the proposal of the Government that the jurisdiction be given to the Australian Industrial Court, although the attitude of the Opposition in that respect should not be interpreted as any alteration of our attitude regarding the establishwill ment of an Australian Superior Court, nor indeed our general attitude regarding the types of jurisdiction that ought to be exercised by the Supreme Courts of the various States.",67
123,Mr ENDERBY,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT, Mr Chairman,67
124,The CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,"Before you proceed, Mr because Minister, I noticed that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) spoke by leave. I wonder whether he was a little ahead of himself in speaking to the amendments that you are going to deal with. Perhaps if you intended to answer his remarks in that area you could answer them when you move the motion.",67
125,Mr ENDERBY,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,"Yes, Mr Chairman, I take your point.",67
126,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,"I apologise, Mr Chairman.",67
127,The CHAIRMAN,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT,That is all right. The honourable member had leave and I let the matter flow. The question is that the amendments be agreed to. Amendments agreed to.,67
128,Mr ENDERBY,TAXATION ADMINISTRATION ACT," I move: That Senate amendments Nos. 20, 21, 22, 23, 23, 26, 27 and 28 be amended by omitting the words 'insert ""Supreme Coun of a State or Territory"" ' and substituting the words 'insen ""Australian Industrial Court"" '. Perhaps this is now the appropriate time for me to say a few words in reply to what the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said with leave a moment or two ago. The Government of course takes a different point of view on the notion of a Superior Court from that taken by the Opposition. The history of the Superior Court of Australia Bill is well known. The Bill has been through this chamber twice. It has been through the Senate twice and rejected twice in the Senate. There are certain other aspects that are probably not so well known, and they are these: The federal courts of Australia are in great need of reform. The Industrial Court itself is in great need of reform. The Territory Supreme Courts are in great need of reform and in particular of having an appellate court to which they can readUy resort. I say, just for the assistance of honourable members and particularly the honourable member for Bennelong, that it is my intention soon to introduce legislation that will not seek to create a Superior Court of Australia but which will seek to rationalise the existing federal courts in a much more modest way than was contemplated by the Superior Court proposal. The legislation seek to estabUsh an Australian federal court. Above that there will be, we hope, an Australian court of appeal which will take some of the original jurisdiction away from the High Court where it has often been said it should not be and also will serve as a court of appeal from the fedcourt and the Territory Supreme Courts. I just mention that to the honourable gentleman I know he has a great interest in the subject. Indeed, so do other honourable members. It has been the subject of discussions with some of the High Court judges and some of the Territory judges. When I put the legislation forward to this House I hope it will find general support. Amendments agreed to.",67

131,Mr SNEDDEN,PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS ABOLITION,"The Privy Council Appeals Abolition Bill 1975 (No. 2), as we are reminded in the second reading speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), comes to the Parliament for the third time. I think it is necessary to put it in perspective. The perspective is this: If this Bill were passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, a request then under sub-section 12 (6) of would be made to the House of Commons and the House of Lords to pass legislation in the form contained in the Schedule to the Act. registration of premises made by If the House of Commons and the House of Lords did so pass that requested legislation, it is very likely that it would have the effect of ending all appeals, in totality, from Australian judicial tribunals to the Privy Council. I say that in all likelihood it would have that effect because nobody can be certain that in law it would have that effect. It would be subject to challenge and would need to be considered by the High Court Customs under that sub-section. itself. It would be considered not by the Privy Council but by the High Court. Sp, in any event, under sub-section 103 (2) of the the matter could be determined by law. The position at present is that there can be no appeals to the Privy Council on matters that relate to the limits of power as between the Commonwealth and the States. That is provided in the Constitution. In order to appeal to the Privy Council there must be leave of the High Court; a certificate must be granted by the High Court. No such certificate has been given since 1912. Indeed, if my recollection is correct, only one certificate has been given under that provision of the Constitution. Therefore, one can reasonably assume that such a certificate would not be issued. The next step in the process was, in 1968, to limit appeals to the Privy Council which related to Federal jurisdiction. So, there has been a Umitation of the right of appeal to the Privy Council further than the practical effect of no certificate since 1912. As a companion to the present Bill, legislation was brought into the House-it was passed by the House and by the Senate-whic h would have meant that there could be no appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council. The net result of that would be that if litigants opted to go to the High Court they could not then go on to the Privy Council. If they wished to go to the Privy Council and it was an appellable cause, they would have to go direct from the State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. The legislation that was passed has not yet been proclaimed and has not come into effect. Presumably it wiU not be proclaimed until the result of the third consideration of the current Bill is determined by this chamber and by the Senate. There are 2 methods by which there can be an end to appeals from the State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. One method is the course adopted in this legislation-that of requesting the British Houses of Parliament to pass an Act preventing appeals from any State court to the Privy Council. The other method is to have a constitutional referendum. There are good arguments for having a constitutional referendum. Let me deal first with the method which is adopted in this Bill. Honourable members will find that clause 7 of the Bill states: The Parliamentthat is the House of Representatives and the Senaterequests and consents to the enactment by the Parliament the United Kingdom of an Act in, or substantially in, the terms set out in the Schedule. The Schedule sets out the terms of the Imperial Act. As I construe that Schedule, it would mean that all appeals, on whatever justiciable issue before any judicial tribunal in Australia, would end. Let us consider the way in which it is done-by request to the House of Commons and the House of Lords. If we are to emphasise the independence, which many people in Australia would emphasise, is this a reasonable way in which we should do it? The very argument that we should end aU appeals is put on the basis that we are an independent country and we should end all appeals with our own judiciary and afinalline of law should remain in Australia. I would support that. I think there is nobody in this chamber who would not support that. The High Court is the final court of appeal estabhshing the law. It is a single authority which all other judicial bodies should foUow. We would aU accept that I am sure. The Opposition accepts it. I most certainly do. Therefore, the argument is as to the method of doing it. If it is argued that we should have the High Court as the final court of appeal to estabUsh law because of our independent status, is there anybody in this House who would support the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) and the Government by saying that the way in which to do it is to estabUsh our lack of independence; to establish clearly by an act of this House and the Senate that we do not have the full constitutional independence? We are asking the British Houses of Parliament to do the job for us. We are requesting the House of Commons and the House of Lords to pass this legislation. I find it an offensive manner in which to go about it. Of course, the States find it an offensive manner in which to go about it. It pretends that it is fully in accordance with the Statute of Westminster, which is now more than 40 years old. The constitutional change in this 4 decades has been immense. Even at that time, it was undertaken by everybody who was concerned with the Statute of Westminister and the construction ofit that there would be no interference in the States and that the House of Commons and the House of Lords would not be asked to do something which would alter the constitutional position of the States. If this legislation were passed and if we suppose that the British Parliament passed the legislation as requested, it would interfere with the Constitution of the States. Therefore, it is not only a wrong process in terms of the way we see the development of our Constitution but also a direct contradiction of what was underof taken clearly and without qualification at the time of the Statute of Westminster. We know that the States still hold that view very strongly, because in 1973 I think four-cer tainly three-of the Premiers went to the United Kingdom to petition the Queen, the Prime Minister and other Ministers in the United Kingdom not to pass any legislation of this request nature. I ask honourable members to imagine the situation: If we establish the precedent of passing this legislauon-reques t and consent legislationthere is no area into which the British House of Commons and House of Lords could not go to pass legislation which affected the States of the Commonwealth of Ausualia-the 6 constituent States. It ought not to be done in that way. I am not certain whether the States would maintain a view that there should be appeals direct from the State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. I make it clear that I think that all appeals ought to go exclusively to the High Court and not to the Privy Council. But I am not prepared to participate in any way in a method which emphasises the dependence of Australia instead of its independence and creates a precedent for further request and consent legislation which can seriously imperil the constitutional status of the 6 constituent members of our federation. Therefore, I will caU in aid for the argument which I put the words of the Leader of the Government, the very man who introduced this legislation. I quote the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) speaking in 1968 as Leader of the Opposition in respect of the limitation of appeals legislation of that year introduced by my former colleague, Mr Nigel Bowen as he then was, who in now Chief Judge in Equity of the Supreme Court of New South Wales As recorded in Hansard, volume 58 page 853 in that year, the then Leader of the Opposition had this to say: It is impossible for this Parliament or for the State ments, by legislation, to abolish appeals from the State Supreme Courts to the Privy Council. This is because the Australian States opted out of the Statute of Westminster. The Australian States are still British abolish appeals from theii Supreme Couns to the Privy Council they would have to ask the British Parliament to repeal the Judicial Committee Appeals Acts of 1833 and 1844. This would emphasise Australia's dependence on Britain. An alternative course-and I do not suggest that this is free of legal doubt-woul d be for this Parliament to pass a Bill for a referendum and for the Government to put that referendum to the people to abolish these appeals. This would emphasise our independence. What was said in 1968 by the present Prime have Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, is true today as it was then. There is not a single word offered in any second reading speech as to why this course of action should be taken; that to estabUsh our dependence and to ask the legislation House of Commons and the House of Lords to claim pass this legislation. Let us suppose-and I certainly hope that will not come to pass-that this legislation pass. There is then one necessary question to Would the British Parliament-the House Commons and the House of Lords-acced e to the request and pass the legislauon? My own view is that the House of Commons would steadfastly refuse to do so. Why should the House of Commons in 1975 interfere in the internal constitutional arrangements of Australia? I believe that the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party would have no pan of it. Whether the Labour Party in Great Britain would respond to a request from the Labor Party in Australia to do so I am unable to say, but I feel most confident that the Labour Party in government in Britain would refuse to have any part of it. So we are probably setting about an empty exercise anyway. The emptiness of that exercise is manifested by the unwillingness on the part of Great Britain to interfere in our constitutional affairs. The way in which what is proposed should be done is to consult the people who determine the Constitution, and that is all the Australian people, voting as they can, at a referendum. They could he asked whether they are in favour of the ending of appeals to the Privy Council or, to put it in more positive language, whether they are in favour of the final court of appeal in all matters legal being the High Court of"" Australia. I favour it. If there was a referendum I would support it and I am quite sure that it would be supported by the people. That would have the effect of ensuring that the constituent States need not fear in a similar sort of manner anybody interfering further with the powers which were given them Parliaby the Constitution or in some way imperilling their position as constituent States of the Commonwealth. Colonies. If they wanted to For these reasons this Bill should be rejected by this chamber. I would regard it as offensive if it were passed. I would regard it as embarrassing if a request was actually made by the Government of my country to the government of another country to pass legislation in its Parliament to affect us. It is embarrassing and belittling to us. Can we not solve the issue ourselves? We had plenty of opportunities in the life of this as Government to consider referendum proposals. That is the way in which it should be done instead of going on with this nonsense. No doubt is, what the Government wants to do is to have the rejected by the Senate. Then it will that it has been frustrated. Such action is not frustration. It is preventing the Government it from establishing a precedent of dependence of did the national Parliament of Australia on the ask: national Parliament of Britain. I will have no of part ofit. The Bill ought to be rejected. I recapitulate: If the Government wishes to have a referendum and to test the matter by confalls stitutional amendment, I will support it because very strongly believe that the final court of appeal should be the High Court of Austraha. conclude by emphasising the point that to end all appeals with the High Court would not in any cent quarter. way submit us to any risk of a deterioration of our legal standards in Australia, for I say without any disrespect intended whatever to the learned judges who form the Judicial Committee of Privy Council none of them can claim greater wisdom in the law, either collectively or was 5 percent. individually, than we can claim for our own High Court. We are not going to have any diminution in standards by the High Court's becoming the final court of appeal. What we will have if we achieve this by referendum is a determination according to the Constitution and not by reverting to some anachronistic procedure which is fraught with peril and which stands as a direct threat to the independence of the constituent watched.

133,Mr HAYDEN,PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS ABOLITION," I tor move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so, I present the Budget for 1975-76. This Budget is presented at a time of high inflation and, by Australian standards, high unemployment. Other countries have been confronted with much the same economic problems as currently bedevU Australia. Some have responded to these of neglect. problems with drastic measures which, although partly successful in curbing mflation, imposed the severe social and economic costs of higher levels of unemployment and lost production to greater degree than in any period since the Great Depression. For example, the United States of America suffered unemployment rates peaking cent, and still at 8.4 per cent; and peak to trough of 14 per cent in industrial production and 8 I per cent in real Gross National Product. In the process inflation in terms of seasonally adjusted I annual rates has faUen from around 14 per cent at the peak to around 7 per cent in the most reThe costs, however, have been great. By contrast, unemployment in Australia has the remained below 5 per cent and the peak to trough decUne in real Gross Domestic Product There are now some early signs of a recovery in the private sector. RetaU sales are improving. Business inventories are falling. The home building industry is strengthening. On balance unemployment in recent monthsand notwithstanding the rise in July-ha s been fairly steady. The situation will be carefully Meanwhile, unless appropriate economic measures are adopted now, the hopeful signs in economy could prove illusory, and inflation could take off again from its already high level, to a thoroughly destructive effect. The private sector would find it increasingly difficult to function, with increasing business failures, and unemployment could rise to dramatically higher That situation can be avoided and it was with this objective in mind that this Budget was designed. Some sacrifice and patient restraint is called for from all of us in our demands for more Second Reading resources, whether it is additional public services that are wanted or higher personal incomes. (Budget Speech) We expect that as the expansion of public secactivity is restrained, the opportunities for private sector expansion will improve, though full responses to greater room for growth may take time to develop. The public sector has played an important part so far in stimulating the movement towards recovery from the recession. Furthermore, the big increases in spending on our programs in the past two years were needed to overcome decades This Government began great programs of change in our society. The achievements are readUy measurable. Incomes haverisen,not only a in terms of real personal disposable incomes but in terms of facUities provided to the whole community in health, in educadon, in social welfare. The Australian Government's record in these at 9.2 per areas is widely acknowledged. Our reforms are enduring; they will not be reversed. Now we propose to pause to take stock of the achievements. Because of the structure of our mixed economy, where three out of four jobs are in the private sector, there are firm limits on how far the public sector should be stimulated in this recovery phase. In framing the Budget, therefore, we have exercised the utmost restraint on government spending. For these reasons, the key-note of this Budget is consoUdation and restraint rather than further expansion of the pubUc sector. On the economic front, inflation is this nation's most menacing enemy. We aim to curb it. Unless this aim is achieved, the nation's productive capacity will run down and job opportunities will diminish. Our present level of unemployment is too high. If we faU to control inflation unemployment will get worse. NA The economic situation is reviewed in Statement No. 2 attached to the Budget Speech. Here I concentrate on the poUcy problems inherent in the situation. Recent developments offer some hope that 1975-76 will be a better year than its predecessor. For that, steady and responsible economic poUcies are needed. The objectives we seek-continue d economic growth and the control of inflation-ar e almost universally applauded. Achieving them is another matter. In that regard, this Budget is crucial. But it is only one of several tools of economic management. Also of major importance are wages and salaries, monetary and external poUcies. There are important hnkages between these arms of poUcy. In coming to our budgetary judgments, we have had those linkages well in mind. This year's budgetary considerations began, as usual, with an examination of the prospective Budget aggregates. Expenditures were projected to grow much more rapidly than revenues and the prospective deficit was nearly double that of 1974-75. Clearly, such a deficit could not be countenanced under the circumstances. In the context of an economy beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. Its acceptance would have been tantamount to abandoning concern with inflation, discarding our wages policies, condemning the corporate sector to an attack upon its profitabiUty and threatening the future jobs of thousands of Australians-al l at a time when the first signs of improvement in most of those respects are beginning to appear. We are no longer operating in that simple Keynesian world in which some reduction in unemployment could, apparently, always be purchased at the cost of some more inflation. Today, it is inflation itself which is the central policy problem. More inflation simply leads to more unemployment. Some might argue that a large deficit could be offset by a tough monetary poUcy-bu t this would mean greatly increased interest rates, disruption infinancialmarkets, further depression ofbusiness confidence and serious company failures. That is an unacceptable option. We therefore rejected a deficit or the order implied by aU the expenditure proposals before us. An alternative approach, in its own way equaUy extreme, would have been to seek to pull down outlays sufficiently to bring the deficit well below that of 1974-75. That would have caused severe disruption to the economy. Economic recovery would almost certainly have halted. True, such an approach would certainly have dealt a soUd blow to inflationary expectations. But at what a cost! The prescription which this course would have entailed is just as unacceptable as the other prescription of letting inflation rip. This Government rejects a policy of deliberately creating massive unemployment and widespread business faUures in order to stop inflation abruptly. We have therefore tried to find a middle way- a line along which we can achieve sound and sustainable growth whUe at the same time bringing inflation down gradually over perhaps two or three years. In the outcome, this Budget holds the share of Australian Government outlays in the total economy steady. Even to restrain that share from rising further has involved us in many painful decisions. We have sought to frame a firm Budget in which the rate of growth in outlays has been halved as compared with last year. It is a Budget neither too lax, thereby inviting a renewed acceleration of inflation; nor too harsh, causing unconscionable loss of production and the human and social costs of massive unemployment. NA The Budget is one major instrument of economic policy. Another major policy area concerns the growth in wages and salaries. If wages and salaries continue to outstrip productivity increases, the productive capacity of the economy will dechne and we shall all eventually be worse off. It is too early yet to determine whether wage indexation will succeed in dampening the recent wage-price spiral. The signs are mixed. The Government intends to do what it can to make indexation work. Meanwhile, however, it is clear that some wage and salary pressures are unrealistic and, when successful, harmful. It does employees genment erally no good to get higher and higher incomes if the results are just higher prices, a severe squeeze on profits, a slump in new investment and a contraction of job opportunities. Wage and salary earners' purchasing power already being maintained through wage indexaployment tion and the indexation guidelines increases to be sought on other specified grounds, including increases in productivity. call as well for tax indexation, and at time expect the Government to provide better education, free medical services and so on which it can only do by increasing its claims upon our national resources-is to ask for the of impossible. Let me develop that thought a litde. The averrobust age employee's real after-tax earnings 1974-75 rose by 7 per cent. When the increase in publicly provided benefits in education, health, social security and so on is added in, his total income rose by 9.5 per cent. Now this really is a very high rate of increase. It cannot be sustained. It is not possible to provide more and more government services or transfer payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after-tax earnings increased taxes. It is not possible to get quarts of pint pots. In this Budget, we have exercised restraint. That restraint needs to be shared throughout the whole community. There must be a community will to combat inflation. There must be action back up that will. NA Last financial year, outlays increased very sharply-by 46 per cent. Whereas total Australian Government Budget outlays maintained a remarkably stable proportion of around 25 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in the decade to 1973-74, in 1974-75 that proportion increased to 30.5 per cent. There was a number of special factors present in that outcome, including the need for some fiscal stimulus during the year. There is noting sacrosanct about the particular public and private sector shares of GDP. But sharp movements in these shares can be disruptive. If Budget outlays this year were again to grow faster than total spending, a further decline in the private sector share of GDP would ensue. That would mean an accelerated deline in investand productivity as well as a further conmoney traction in job opportunities. This Government is committed to the present 'mixed economy' framework. We want to is strengthen that framework. To reduce unemlastingly, revovery in the private sector provide for is essential. Expenditure restraint in this Budget will lay To the foundations for a desirable balance between the same the public and private sectors. Total outlays are now estimated to increase by 23 per cent in 1975-76, half the rate of increase last year. Little change is expected in the proportion of Budget outlays to GDP. This offers a chaUenge to the private sector to respond with attitudes towards expansion which should in serve well those who adopt them. Cutting back the increase in Budget outlays is real not easy. Everyone favours expenditure restraint in the abstract; few favour it when it affects them personally. Many articulate groups in the community champion their favourite causes and I know that we will soon be hearing from them. I hope that, when we do hear, they will help the Government and me by indicating what alternative expendivia ture cuts might have been made or what tax out increases they would be wUling to bear. Meanwhile, in approaching the task, we have distinguished between programs of utmost priority; programs where very rapid increases in recent years now permit some consolidation; and to programs which might be deferred for a time. In all this we have protected the less well-off members of the community. Inevitably in the process, many desirable expenditures have been scaled down or postponed. We know this will concern and disappoint many. That is unfortunate, but in present circumstances it is also unavoidable. The process of consolidation upon which we embark in this Budget will need to be continued through a planned approach to expenditures into the years ahead. Indeed it will not be until the next Budget that we shall be able to begin to reap the fruits of consoUdation in terms of the increased budgetary flexibUity which we need. I am therefore considering the institution of improved procedures to ensure that the future growth of government spending is consistent with both broad economic management requirements and with the Government's highest priority social objectives. Outlays in 1975-76 are estimated to total $21,915m, an increase of 23 per cent over actual outlays last year. Let there be no misunderstanding. Certainly we have cut back the growth of public expenditure. But the outlays we are undertaking provide continuing support for programs of scope and imagination never envisaged, much less undertaken, by our opponents. The cuts in proposed expenditure have been painful. But unfulfilled hopes should not obscure the realities of the range of reforms which tained already have touched-and wiU touch-ever y area of our society. I propose here only to mention briefly the major expenditure proposals. Statement No. 3 attached to the Budget Speech sets out the expenditure programs in great detaU. The facts given in that Statement will show, function by education function, the detaUed working out of the process of consolidation I have referred to. Additional information will be announced by the responsible Ministers. Defence expenditure in 1975-76 is estimated at $ 1,800.1m. Last year we approved the acquisition of number of major items for the Services, includby ing long-range maritime patrol aircraft, tanks and patrol frigates. Significantly greater ture will be incurred this year on capital equipment, improvements to defence installations and on housing for servicemen. The Minister for Defence will make a detaUed statement on Defence matters at a later time. NA One of the most important areas in the Budget is education. In 1975-76, total outlays on education are estimated at $ 1,908m, an increase of $237m over last year. In the first full year of office of this Government, Australian Government expenditure on education almost doubled. Last year, it almost doubled again. We have therefore almost quadrupled expenditure on education in these two years, and we are maintaining in 1975-76 the high level of expenditure now reached. This advance since 1972-73 reflects our determination to make good the relative neglect of earUer years. NA Our initiatives include pronounced increases in expenditure on schools and teachers colleges; expansion of technical and further education; acceptance of fullfinancialresponsibUity for tertiary education throughout Australia; abolition of fees for tertiary and technical education and the introduction of new student assistance measures; and increased academic salaries adopted on the recommendation of the Academic Salaries Tribunal, with effect from October 1974. This year, recurrent expenditure will be mainat no less than the present real levels, but capital expenditure will be limited to essential projects. Ordinarily, the 1976 calendar year would have seen the start of a new triennium for the financing of universities, colleges of advanced education and schools; and the technical and further area would have been phased into triennial financing in July 1976. However, we have decided to treat the calendar year 1976 as a year outside the triennial progression. During the period to December 1976 we will continue the programs of the education comDEFENCE missions and present practices on escalating appropriations for cost increases will be continued. In the meantime, the education commissions will be asked to review their recent triennial a reports and to bring in revised recommendations March next for new triennial programs to commence in January 1977. The Minister for expendiEducation will provide more details later. The remarkable quadrupling of the total education expenditurefiguresin just over two years has been only part of the record. Benefits in relation to the quality of education will continue to flow on a long term basis from the machinery we have established and the programs we have fostered. Budget Paper No. 8, on education, outlines our record of achievements in this area. Care and Education of Young Children The Government is providing $74m in finanExpenditure cial assistance to community organisations and to the States towards the care and education of young children. Medibank was launched on 1 July last. stride $ 1,445m is included in the Budget for this program. This financial year, medical and optometrical benefits are estimated to cost $615m while the hospital side of Medibank is estimated $822m. Community Health A sum of $65m is appropriated for services provided under the Community Health Program. Hospitals Development Program A further $ 108m will be made available States in 1975-76 by way of capital the development of public hospitals and related health care facilities. The Australian Government will maintain its contribution at least at this level during each the remaining 3 years of the program. Nursing Home Benefits It is proposed to increase the additional nursing home benefit in three States-Ne w South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. These increases represent thefirststep towards common nursing home benefit rate for all States. The effect of the increases will be that ordinary care patients in those States will receive a form total benefit of $66.15 a week. Rates of benefit for ordinary care patients in other States, which are already higher, will current levels. The supplementary intensive care benefit will be increased from $21 a week to $30.80 a week in all States. This benefit has remained unchanged since January 1969. The increases in both the additional and intensive care benefits will not apply to patients in Government nursing homes. These increases, estimated to cost SlOm in 1975-76, take effect from the first pension pay day in November. Medical Research The Government will increase by 39 per cent, to $24m, its support in the 1976-78 triennium for medical reseach under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council. in 1975-76 is estimated at $4.0m. Additional payments totalling $lm will be made to the Florey and Walter and Eliza Hall research institutes. NA NA Medibank Since this Government came to office a great forward in the field of social security and welfare has been taken. Now we must take stock of our programs and consolidate our gains. To that end the Prime Minister has announced that the Government is to institute a review of to cost Australia's income security system. Social Security Benefit Rates The standard rate of social service pensions and benefits will be increased in the Spring of 1975 by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index between the December quarter 1974 and the June quarter 1975; and again in the Autumn of 1976 by the increase in the Consumer to the Price Index between the June and December assistance for quarters of 1975. Tbis wiU mean a first increase in the standard rate of $2.75 a week. The combined married rate will be increased by $4.50 a week so as to mainof tain the standard rate at 60 per cent of the combined married rate. These increases will become effective from the first pension pay day in November. The basic pension has increased by 80 per cent since the December quarter of 1972, well ahead a of the rate of increase in average weekly earnings-5 6 per cent-and consumer prices-4 1 per cent. The relative improvement compared to the average wage earner is even more pronounced in uniafter-tax terms. Since the December quarter of 1972, the increase in take-home pay of the typical family man on average weekly earnings has be maintained at been 50 per cent. The increases proposed will maintain the real purchasing power of those greatly increased pensions and are estimated to cost $233m in 1975-76. There wiU be no change in the rate of unemployment and sickness benefit payable to persons under 18 years of age. The rates of additional pension and benefit payable for dependent children, including student children, are to be increased by 50c to $7.50 a week. Abolition of the Means Test For budgetary reasons the Government will not be able to complete the final stage of the abolition of the means test-for those aged 65 to 69 years-as quickly as it had hoped. Nonetheless we intend to make as much further progress as economic circumstances allow. We have decided to abolish the means test for residentially qualified persons aged 69 years from 1 July 1976. The necessary legislation will be introduced in the Autumn sittings. Repatriation Benefits Since coming to office the Government has improved repatriation benefits substantially. Legislation providing further improvements will be introduced in the current sittings and in Autumn 1976. Further information will be announced by the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. Details are set out in Statement No. 3. Aboriginal Advancement The record level of expenditure on Aboriginal advancement achieved in 1974-75 will be exceeded in 1975-76; direct expenditure in 1975-76 is estimated at $193m, compared with $ 158m in 1974-75 and $98m in 1973-74. NA Welfare Housing In the Ught of the recovery in private housing now in train, advances totalling $364.6m will be provided to the States for welfare housing purposes in 1975-76. Bearing in mind the $ 10.4m advanced hi June on the basis that it would be taken into account in this year's allocation we are thus maintaining advances in 1975-76 at the greatly increased 1974-75 level and well above the $218.6m aUocated in 1973-74. Australian Housing Corporation ResponsibUity for the Defence Service Homes scheme has been transferred to the newly proclaimed Australian Housing Corporation. An amount of $ 122.5m wiU be avaUable for Defence Service Homes advances in 1975-76. A further $20m has been provided for the poration in 1975-76. Together with the $25m remaining unspent from 1974-75, this will able the Corporation to meet its administrative programs. expenses and to undertake new programs in the housing field. DetaUs will be announced later by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. NA NA This year we plan to spend $442m on urban and regional development programs. A comprehensive statement by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development is being tabled with the Budget papers. Canberra Expenditure on development for residential, commercial and community uses in Canberra this year is estimated at $43. lm. Growth Centres $38.6m is being provided in 1975-76 for further works and planning by the Albury Wodonga Development Corporation. Agreement has been reached with New South Wales for financial assistance for two further growth centres at Bathurst-Orange and the South-West sector of Sydney and $28.5m has been allocated for these centres. Land Agreements This program will help stabilise land prices. Expenditure this year is esumated at $53.6m. Sewerage Program This year a further $115m will be provided towards eliminating the backlog of sewerage services. Woolloomooloo Redevelopment $ 14.67m is being provided to New South Wales to assist with land acquisition and site development in the Woolloomooloo Basin in Sydney. The Australian Government has also agreed to transfer, at no cost, land it owns in the area valued in excess of $ 11 m. NA $132m is being provided to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Provisions are also being made for support for the Arts through the CorAustraUa Council and for the Australian FUm Commission, International Women's Year, the enNational Estate and Nature Conservation Figures are given in Statement No. 3. NA Postal and Telecommunications Services Since 1 July 1975, the former functions of the Post Office have been undertaken by the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission. Increased postal and telecommunication charges to operate from 1 September 1975 already been announced. The increased charges are necessary to cover significant increases in cost of providing services and to enable each Commission to comply with the requirement, under its constituting legislation, to cover and finance at least 50 per cent of its capital expenditure from internal sources. The amount to be provided from the Budget help finance the capital programs of the two Commissions comprises $14m for the Postal Commission and $403m for the Telecommunications Commission. If the increased charges were not applied, the costs they were to cover would have to be covered in some other way. That is, the Govern the ment would either have to increase indirect taxes, or add to the deficit by printing money. Alternatively, the Government could cut-back further on existing programs but it is clear that additional cut-backs would be extremely difficult to make. Air Transport It was announced in the 1973-74 Budget Speech that the Government proposed to increase the rate of recovery of the costs viding and operating airport and airway facilities to 80 per cent within 5 years. It was then estimated that a recovery rate of 70 per cent mainland. should be reached in 1975-76. Despite increases in air navigation charges, very Uttle progress has been made towards objective. Currently about 55 per cent of costs inquiry. are being recovered. The Government does not believe that the general taxpayer should conunue to subsidise air services and proposes to achieve its objective 80 per cent recovery by 1977-78. Action will taken to increase the recovery rate to 70 per cent this year. This will require increases in air navigation charges substantiaUy greater than the maximum 15 per cent annual increase referred to in 1973 AirUnes Agreement. The airlines have undertaken in the Agreement to negotiate changes as are necessary to achieve the objective of 80 percent recovery by 1978. RaU Transport An amount of $51.9m is being provided to finance the new Australian National Railways Commission's 1975-76 capital works program, compared with expenditure of $ 14.6m by the have former Commonwealth RaUways in 1974-75. This includes work on the raUway between Tarthe coola and AUce Springs, and on the Adelaide to Crystal Brook standard gauge line. It also includes funds for the Tasmanian railways and its costs for the South Australian raUways. A further $40m is being provided to the Commission as a subsidy to cover its estimated losses to in 1975-76; the Tasmanian and non-metropolitan South Australian railways are expected to account for about 80 per cent of this loss. Urban Public Transport the Australian Government has so far agreed then to provide $138m under the terms of the Urban PubUc Transport Assistance Agreement to assist States to upgrade their urban public direct or transport systems. We expect to provide some $43m this year towards the cost of presently approved projects. Shipping An amount of $56.9m is being provided from the Budget to help finance the Australian National Line's capital program. Provision is also made for subsidy payments of $lm for the operations of the Empress of of proAustraUa between the mainland and Tasmania and $3.9m in respect of northbound general cargo services between Tasmania and the Freight rates on this latter service are being maintained at present levels pending receipt of this the Report by the Nimmo Commission of Roads A total of up to $445m will be made avaUable for roads in the States in 1975-76. This provision of should ensure that the real level of our outlays be for this purpose is maintained this year. PipeUne Authority An amount of $67m has been provided for advances to the PipeUne Authority for expenditure the on the Moomba-Sydney natural gas pipeline and associated works. The pipeline is expected to be such completed early in 1976. As already announced, the Government has authorised the Austrahan Wool Corporation to continue to operate a minimum reserve price equivalent to 250c per kilo clean for 21 micron wool during the 1975-76 season. An amount of $80m is included in the Budget for advances to the Corporation; the Government will also guarantee further borrowings of $70m from private sources. While we judge that this $ 150m should be adequate, we shall of course keep the position under close review. In addition to existing measures, we will vide $ 19.6m for the joint Australian Government/State Government scheme of carry-on finance at concessional rates of interest. An extra $8m will be provided to the Commonwealth Development Bank to supplement the $20m provided to the Bank last year to lend to seriously affected beef producers. As already announced, the question of further short-term assistance for beef producers has been referred to the Industries Assistance Commission. Rural Reconstruction The Government is providing $50m in 1975-76 to facilitate the adjustment of certain rural industries to changing market conditions through the Rural and Fruitgrowing Reconstruction Schemes and the Dairy Adjustment Program. These schemes expire on 30 June 1976. The question of possible future arrangements is under examination by the Industries Assistance Commission. Mining Industry Pending the passage by the Parliament of a new Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill, $ 10.4m has been provided in the appropriation of the Department of Minerals and Energy to meet commitments entered into by the former Petroleum and Minerals Authority. The appropriation for the Australian Atomic Energy Comniission in 1975-76 includes approximately $4.7m for uranium exploration in the Northern Territory. Australian Industry Development Corporation The capital stock of the Australian Industry Development Corporation is to be increased by a further $25m to $75m. Wool Provision is made also for $50m to be on-lent to the Corporation from the proceeds of official overseas loans. Regional Employment Development Scheme In present circumstances, no new projects are being approved. There remains, however, a large volume of commitments, in respect of which an amount of $ 135m is included in the Budget. This will provide continuing employment on previously approved REDS projects for some time. Industrial Training The Government is allocating $88m this finanBeef cial year to its various manpower training propro- grams, including NEATS and support for apprenticeship training. Immigration We have decided to double the migrant contribution towards assisted passage costs, to an amount of $ 150 per family or single person. NA Legal Aid To extend the availability of legal aid we are proposing to establish a further 28 regional offices during 1975-76. Total expenditure on legal aid in 1975-76 is estimated at $ 16.7m; this includes $3m on legal aid for Aboriginals. Foreign Affairs and Overseas Aid Outlays from the Budget on foreign aid, excluding defence co-operation, are estimated to increase from $334m in 1974-75 to $385m in 1975-76. Papua New Guinea will continue to be the major recipient, receiving an estimated $210m in 1975-76. Further details are included in Statement No. 3 and in the separate document being tabled with the Budget papers. Ceiling on Staff Growth Our measures to restrain the growth in spending apply particularly to staff growth. As already announced, the growth in full-time staff employed under the Public Service Act in 1975-76 is to be limited to a ceiling increase of 2.8 per cent. After allowance for the expected increase in staff on leave, the ceiling increase in operative staff is effectively 1.5 per cent. This compares with increases in operative staff of over 4 per cent in 1972-73 and 1973-74, and over 5 per cent in 1974-75. Government authorities financed from the Budget have been requested to operate within an overall ceiling increase of 2.2 per cent. Administrative Savings We are also imposing stringent restraint on administrative expenditures. Overall, the provisions for adniinistrative expenses for Departments and statutory authorities (other than business undertakings) financed from the Budget have been reduced by about 10 per cent. Particular examples of restraint include economy class domestic air travel for Members of Parliament and Government employeesMr Killen-Does that include the Prime Minister too?",72
134,Mr HAYDEN,GENERAL PUBLIC SERVICES,"I knew I would touch a tender spot. Particular examples of restraint include economy class domestic air travel for Members of Parliament and Government employees, restrictions on the use of Government cars, reductions in overseas travel, non-replacement of existing office furniture and fittings and restrictions on overtime working and engagement of consultants. It is estimated that these measures will produce savings totalling about $35m in 1975-76. They will not only make a signincant contribuwin tion towards reducing the deficit, but will also induce greater efforts by Departments and authorities to improve efficiency and avoid waste. NA NA NA NA General Purpose Funds for the States At the Premiers' Conference on 19 June 1975 the Australian Government undertook to same improve thefinancialassistance grants ments with the States. These improvements took the form of an adrevenue diuon of $220m to the grants otherwise payable in 1975-76, with this amount to be subject to escalation under the formula in subsequent No. 4. years, and of an increase, in 1976-77, in the socaUed 'betterment factor' from 1.8 per cent to 3.0 per cent. It is estimated that thefinancialassistance grants payable to the States in 1975-76 under these new arrangements will total about $3,185m, an increase of $81 lm or 34.2 per cent over the grants paid in 1974-75. In addition, the Government has accepted recommendations by the Grants Commission that special grants totalling $38.8m be paid to Queensland and South Australia in 1975-76. The Government also agreed in June to support a 1975-76 Loan Council program for State Governments of $l,291m which, after adjustments are made for special factors, represents an increase of 20 per cent over the program for 1974-75. Local Government Grants The Government has already announced its acceptance of the recommendations contained in the Grants Commission's second report on unconditionalfinancialassistance for local government totalling $79.9m, or 42 per cent more than last year. Natural Disaster Relief It is presently estimated that expenditures by the Government on natural disaster relief in 1975-76 will total $57.6m, of which $48. lm will be for relief measures arising out of the devastation of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy. Included in this latter amount are $33m for continuation of compensation payments to Darresidents and $12m for the maintenance of various relief measures, including emergency accommodation and loans to small businesses. We have also established the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, and provided $99.7m for the Commission's construction program in 1975-76. NA In deciding on our revenue measures we took it as essential that there be some reduction in both personal and company income tax. At the time we judged it necessary to reduce the arrangepotential deficit somewhat. Consequently, we have determined on a mix of tax measures, some of them increasing the and some reducing it. Their net effect is to increase total tax revenue in 1975-76 by an estimated $207m. DetaUs are given in Statement I turn now to the individual tax measures. It is proposed to increase the duty on immediately by the equivalent of 4c a 10 ounce glass. The estimated revenue yield in 1975-76 $234m. Potable spirits Duties on potable spirits have been increased considerably over recent years and the present scope for further increase is not great. proposed to increase the duty on potable spirits immediately by the equivalent of lc a nip. It also proposed to complete the third and last step in the phasing out of the differential between rates of duty on brandy and other potable spirits. The estimated revenue yield of these measures in 1975-76 is $ 12m. Tobacco Products The duty on tobacco and cigarettes will be increased immediately by the equivalent average packet of 20 cigarettes, with equivalent increases on other tobacco products. The estimated revenue yield in 1975-76 is $75m. Crude Petroleum The present price of domestically produced crude oil is about one-quarter of the landed price of imported crude. The low domestic price is not conducive to rational resource usage. Yet is does not necessarily follow that increases in the estic price should be reflected fully in sponding increases in prices to Australian ducers: the rise in world oil prices has occurred largely because governments in OPEC and other producing countries have greatly increased their taxes on production. The indigenous crude oil absorption policy, which runs for a period of 10 years from 17 September 1970, provides for a review of price after 5 years. The Government is considering and will be announcing shortly the price arrangements which will apply from 17 September next. Meanwhile, the Government has decided to impose a levy of $2 per barrel on production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring liquified petroleum gas, with immediate effect. The levy will not fall on natural gas or refinery products although, of course, its price effects be expected to spread through into the latter. The estimated revenue yield in 1975-76 is $280m. Export Duty on Coal Following the sharp rise in oil prices, coal prices have risen dramatically in the past two years, in many cases trebling. In consequence, very large windfall profits are currently being Beer earned by the export sector of the coal industry. beer The Government considers it reasonable that part of these increased profits should be chanis nelled to the community by means of an export duty. Price movements for various classes of coal have not been uniform but higher quality coking It is coals have experienced much greater price increases than other coals. It is therefore is proposed to levy export duty of $6 per tonne on these high quahty coking coals and $2 per tonne the on other coals, with immediate effect. To protect buyers in respect of prices recently renegotiated, approval to export will be in terms of those prices and no consideration will be given to adjustment of prices to take account of the duty. The revenue yield from this duty in 1975-76 is of 6c an estimated to be $ 120m. Details of this and the other levies I have announced will be given later tonight by the Minister representing the Minister for Police and Customs. Company Tax The Government has had before it the recommendations on business taxation contained in the domMathews Report on 'Inflation and Taxation'. correThese are important recommendations with procomplex ramifications and there is a need for further study of them before final decisions are made. Meanwhile, we are acting to alleviate business taxation and we have been aided in coming to our decisions by the Mathews Report. The first of the Mathews recommendations related to the valuation of most trading stocks for taxation purposes. Its primary purpose was to ease pressures on business liquidity in inflationary periods. After careful consideration we have decided that it is not at this time possible to act on this recommendation, partly because of its enormous revenue cost but also because of the complexity can and difficulty involved in giving effect to the Committee's proposal to defer tax for individual firms on the basis of each individual firms's changing stock values. Very serious practical problems would also be created for both industry and the Taxation Office in implementing the Committee's suggestion that deferred tax be collected when stock values fall or when businesses change hands. It has not been possible to this time to resolve these difficulties. We shall, of course, keep the question ofbusiness profitability and liquidity under careful notice but, in all the circumstances, we have turned to the other alternative in this area which was mentioned by the Mathews Committeenamely, a reduction in company tax. The Government has decided to adopt this alternative and proposes to reduce the general rate of company tax by 2.5 per cent to 42.5 per cent. The new rate will apply to 1974-75 income and will cost an estimated $ 120m in 1975-76. We have also decided to continue the system of doubled rates of depreciation beyond 30 June 1975 and extend it to all sectors of commerce and industry. We have here taken note of the Mathews Committee's advice that: 'Accelerated depreciation and investment allowances are appropriate policy options a government which wishes to influence level or the pattern of private investadvance. ment . . . The doubled rates of depreciation will be made applicable to all new plant other than motor cars and utility trucks, including plant used in industry such as transportation and construction that were excluded from the 1974-75 double depreciation provisions and from the investment allowances granted from time to by the previous Government. The first cost revenue of this proposal will fall in 1976-77 will approximate $7 5m. Our decision to opt for double depreciation rather than the indexation of depreciation allowmarginal ances as recommended in the Mathews Report dollar. reflected our view that it was desirable to introduce immediately a clearly understood aid to business investment. The indexation recomaffairs mendation would introduce some complex new elements into the depreciation provisions and there is a need for further study as to how a ticable and equitable scheme might be worked out. Meanwhile, the double depreciation propresent visions will without delay greatly help ness sector in the planning of its investment and cash flows. Personal Income Tax At this point I say simply that we have decided to introduce a radical new personal income tax system. We have undertaken fundamental reform of the tax system with one overwhelmingly important objective-the achievement of a more equitable distribution of the tax burden. Before expldriing the features of the new scheme, I want to explain the rationale behind what is perhaps the most revolutionary change since the inception of our personal income tax system. Yet one fact will highlight the direction we are taking more than anything else I might say. Under the new system nearly half a million existing taxpayers will be freed from tax entirely. Those earning least in the community will be exempted from personal tax. A very large number of taxpayers will benefit by the changes we are making. But what is of greatest satisfaction to the Government is the fact that those in most need will benefit substantially. In the best of economic times inequalities could not be removed in one sweep. We make no for pretence of doing so now. We do say that the the new system represents a very considerable The existing personal income tax system has persisted almost unchanged for over two decades and has about reached the end of its tether. Criticism of the present arrangements has rightly focused upon the excessive marginal rates which are imposed upon taxpayers on average time incomes. For example, a taxpayer on average to weekly earnings with a dependent wife and two and dependent children and average other deductions would lose 44 cents of each dollar ofhis pay in higher taxation if the present rates were maintained. If he had smaller deductions his rate could be as high as 48 cents in the In deciding what to do about this state of we had several choices. The Mathews Report recommended that this year we introduce tax indexation or, alternatively, introduce a new practax schedule with a commitment to index it in future. The Asprey Report recommended that a quite different type of rate scale be introduced, with an initial marginal rate much higher than at and with much lower marginal rates at the busiintermediate ranges of income. So far as the rate scale is concerned, what we are proposing is based on the Asprey concept. But before going on, I should explain the Government's attitude to tax indexation. It would not be possible to introduce tax indexation this year because of the very great revenue cost. In any case, the present rate scale is wholly unsatisfactory as a basis for indexation. Consequendy we are taking up the Mathews suggestion of introducing a new tax scale to apply this year. As for next year, no Government can commit itself to a precise measure a year hence when the revenue impUcations are so large but the circumstances of that future time are not foreseeable. However, in framing the 1976-77 Budget the Government will take full advantage of the greater flexibUity-includin g greater flexibUity in adjusting for price increases-whic h this year's reform of the tax system will offer. Indexing of the new scale wiU thus be avaUable as an option next year. Meanwluie, so far as this year is concerned, I mention that the new scale will actually reduce marginal tax rates of taxpayers on average weekly earnings by more than would be the case if the present scale were indexed. That is, what we propose wiU produce a better result than indexation so far as the marginal 'tax bite' concerned. I turn now to the proposed new system. Asprey Report drew attention to the low marginal rates of tax on low incomes and suggested that they be increased. It added: 'The most important advantage of an initial step of some magnitude is not that it raises much tax from the taxpayers whose total income is confined within this step; it is rather that a sizeable minimum average rate is thereby struck for aU higher a significant rate on the lower steps, much higher marginal rates than otherwise must imposed further up the income scale . . .' This approach, of course, involves raising more tax from so-called low income earners. Many such people depend solely on their own incomes and could hardly be expected to pay tion, more tax. Certainly this Government does not expect them to do so. But many others in this income group are members of multi-income households who might be supposed, on general social grounds, to be capable of contributing further. We have therefore devised a system designed to retain the desirable features of the Asprey suggestion but to exclude the distribution features. Material is available describing the new system in detaU. Here I outline its main features. First, there will be a new and much simplified rate scale, with only seven steps instead of the present fourteen. The marginal rates will begin at 20c in the doUar on taxable incomes up to $2,000 rising to 27c in the dollar on incomes from $2,000 to $5,000 and 35c in the dolar on incomes from $5,000 to $10,000. The marginal rates rise in four further steps to reach a maximum of 65c in the dollar at a taxable income of $25,000. On incomes from $6,000 to $25,000 marginal rates generally will fall, the greatest fall being in the $8,000-$ 10,000 income range, where the drop is from 48c to 35c in the doUar. Secondly, every individual taxpayer, whether or not he or she has dependants or spends on items which attract deductions, will receive a niinimum concessional rebate of $540. This will protect low income earners from the impact of the higher marginal rates at low income levels. The niinimum concessional rebate does this tax by, in effect, increasing the minimum taxable is income from its present $1,041 to $2,520 per annum. The introduction of this rebate will make possible the elimination of the present age rebate The and the new scheme provides for that. Thirdly, the present concessional allowances for dependants will be replaced by much more generous dependants' rebates. For a spouse the rebate will be $400; for chUdren it will be $200 for the first chUd under 16 and student children redefined to include all chUdren under 25 receiving full-time education, and $150 in respect of incomes. Without other chUdren. There will be a separate rebate of $200, be known as the Sole Parent Rebate, for parents without partners, such as widows or widowers or unmarried persons, who have the sole responsibUity for maintenance of dependent chUdren. Fourthly, with some exceptions I shall menthe existing concessional deductions for private expenditures will be converted to rebates calculated at 40c in the dollar of the amounts allowable under the present law. However, the minumum concessional rebate will be regarded as covering the first $540 of rebate claimable, other than for dependants. The effect of this will be that taxpayers whose rebatable expenditures are less than $ 1,350 will not need to itemise them as they will be covered by the minimum concesundesirable income sional rebate. There will be certain exceptions to these rebate arrangements, as follows. The existing housing loan interest deduction scheme will remain in its present form; that is, lowable deductions as presently prescribed reduce taxable income. The existing provisions for gifts to charities and school building funds will also remain unaltered. There will be separate Zone Allowance bates over the above the $540 minimum concessional rebate for taxpayers in the prescribed zones. Finally, the allowable deduction for education expenses, now one of the concessional deducfor tions to be converted to the rebate basis, will increased from $ 150 to $250 per student child. It is not possible to outline all the benefits the new tax system in this Speech. The main attractions, however, are as follows: nearly 500 000 taxpayers will be freed tax entirely; there will be a very big increase in minimum taxable incomes-for example, to $5,372 in the case of a taxpayer with a dependent wife and two dependent student children; there will be a very big drop in marginal rates of tax on incomes in the range into which most fuu-time employees fall; taxpayers with dependants are heavily favoured as compared with the present sysThere tem, particularly in the lower income For example, in his statement announcing tax cuts last November, the Prime Minister gave as an illustration the taxpayer with a dependent wife and two dependent children earning $100 a week. If his other deductions were 10 to$21,915m. per cent of his income his tax payable would have declined from $568 in 1973-74 to $264 in 1974-75. Under the new arrangements such a taxpayer is freed from tax entirely. We believe that the new system is both more equitable and more adaptable for revenue raising and economic management purposes. Because of the extensive changes it entails, it will not be possible to have the proposed system in operation for PAYE purposes until 1 January ahead? 1976. The cost to revenue of the new system I have outlined cannot be as simply summarised as is usually the case. On a true 'full year' basis, cost to revenue will be $205m - growth. However, an additional advantage of the new alsystem to taxpayers is that it will permit a large will reduction in the present degree of overdeduction of PAYE tax instalments-and a consequential reduction in refunds which, this year, are estimated at $ 1,025m. That will assist the monetary authorities by reducing seasonal swings in revenue flows; it will also reduce the need for taxpayers to make, as it were, involunRetary loans to the Government. The combined effect of the taxation measures I have outlined and of the more accurate PAYE deductions which they make possible will be a substantial reduction in PAYE tax instalments most taxpayers from the beginning of 1976. be The precise instalments to be applied will be determined in due course, but I mention, for purposes of illustration, that the rise in the takeof home pay of a wage-earner with a dependent wife and two children, and earning between $ 100 and $ 150 per week, will be well over $5 per week. There will be smallrises-generally of less from than $1 per week-in the PAYE instalment deductions of some taxpayers without dependants. The total estimated cost to revenue of the scheme in 1975-76 if $395m but, of this $365m is attributable to the more accurate PAYE deductions which the new arrangements will permit. Property Income Surcharge It is proposed to aboUsh the property income surcharge with effect from this income year. will be no cost to revenue in 1975-76; the ranges. cost in a full year will be $25m. NA In aggregate, Budget outlays are estimated to increase in 1975-76 by $4,084m or 22.9 per cent Receipts are estimated to increase by $3,852m or 25.2 per cent to $ 19,117m. The estimated deficit is thus $2,798m and the domestic deficit $2,068m. THE POST-BUDGET ECONOMIC NA Given the budgetary decisions we have made, what is the economic outlook for the period Some indications are provided in Statement No. 2 attached; here I pick up the key points. Reflecting our policy decisions, government the spending at all levels will show only modest real With the exception of business investment expenditure, which remains the weakest area of prospective demand, other components of domestic spending should show a strengthening trend and prospects for exports are also reasonably good. Imports have been quite subdued but will probably pick up during the year. In recent months, consistent with the need avoid sudden and disruptive changes in etary aggregates, the Reserve Bank has acted to gradually restrain the growth in bank lending and Uquidity. Nonetheless the Uquidity of the banking system should be sufficient to meet the basic immediate needs of the economy for finance without being fully accommodating to have. inflation. In this Budget fiscal pohcy has been brought into better balance with monetary poUcy; both have now appropriately shifted from earUer prices strong stimulus to postures of moderation. Against this background, real Gross Domestic Product is forecast to increase by about 5 cent in 1975-76, after falling by 2 per cent in 1974-75. Prospects for employment should improve, but the improvement is likely to be gradual. The course charted has its risks and the bUity of temporary reverses cannot be ruled Our commitment to what I earUer called a midincomes. dle way between the two extremes makes that inevitable. What I do say is that, if there is an equal commitment in the community to play its part in steering the economy back to a firmer footing, we shaU be able to overcome any such temporary problems. On the matter of prices, the increased duties beer, tobacco and potable spirits will increase prices as stocks are worked off. There will also price increases, which cannot be calculated precision, resulting from the passing on of crude petroleum levy into the prices of motor spirit and other products. The increased postal and telephone charges to come into operation from 1 September next will also add a little to CPI in the December quarter. The Government is fully aware that, in itself, the effect on prices is unwelcome. What were the alternatives? One alternative would have been to let the deficit rise even further. That would have been more inflationary and would have thrown an undue burden onto monetary poUcy. Another alternative would have been to refrain both from raising these indirect taxes and from reducing company and personal income taxes. We considered that course equally untenable. In theory, another alternative would have been to cut our expenditures by a further $500m to or $600m. We examined that possibUity but the monconcluded that it was impracticable. I can only say that I hope that those who suggest the contrary will bring forward specific suggestions as to where we could have reined in expenditures even more stringently than we In drawing attention to these price effects, I add that it is the Government's firm view that, for the purposes of wage indexation, increases in resulting from tax measures of the sort that I have announced should be discounted. It would be self-defeating if the system of wage indexation were to attempt to insulate the community per from tax measures designed to redistribute resources for the benefit of the community in the form of improved pubUc faculties infieldssuch as education, health, welfare, personal benefits, urban improvement and so on. These improvements must be seen as a real possiimprovement in people's living standards and out. are a non-money form of addition to their In its submissions in the recent wage indexation hearings before the Arbitration Commission the Government foreshadowed the likelihood that it would make submissions on this matter in future quarterly hearings. Notwithstanding these direct price effects of on the indirect tax measures, we look for a continuing downward shift in the underlying rate of be inflation during 1975-76. It can hardly be more with than a slow winding down within that timethe frame; but our time-frame must extend beyond the immediate confines ofthisfinancialyear. 1975-76 is therefore seen as a year of consoUthe dation. Economic growth will only be restored by way of gradual policies firmly grounded upon an effective anti-inflationary foundation. NA In this Budget the Government has endeavoured to give a lead to the community. If inflation is to be curbed there are no soft options-onl y a choice between more or less difficult ones. For our part, our hope is that with a community appreciation of the need for restraint, we Members. can make a real start on getting inflation under control and funher raising living standards for everybody.

137,Mr ENDERBY,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: Excise TariffProposals No. 1 (1975). Customs TariffProposals No. 24 (1975). Excise Tariff proposals No. 1 and Custom Tariff Proposals No. 24 which I have just tabled introduce the tariff changes foreshadowed by the Honourable the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) in his Budget Speech this evening. The Proposals increase the duties of excise and customs on beer, manufactured tobacco products and spirits and impose a new excise duty on the production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas. The increases operate from 8 o'clock this evening. The increase on beer represents an increase of about 4c in the duty Second Reading component on a 10-ounce glass of beer. The proposals increase the rate of duty on cigarettes equivalent to 6c per packet of twenty. The increase of 86c per litre of alochol on spirits other than brandy is equivalent to lc per nip or 26c per bottle. The increase in the rate of duty on brandy is $1.26 per litre of alcohol. This increase consists of 2 factors. These are firstly an increase of 86c per litre of alcohol as in the case of other spirits and secondly an increase of 40c per litre of alcohol representing the completion of the 3-year phase-out of the duty differential between brandy and other spirits which was announced in the 1973 Budget. A summary of these alterations is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned. NA",239
138,Mr ENDERBY,CUSTOMS TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: Customs Tariff(Coal Expon Duty) Proposals (1975). This Proposal is designed to impose export duties on coal exported from Australia. They were foreshadowed by my colleague the Honourable the Treasurer (Mr Hayden) earlier this evening. As the Treasurer mentioned, the price of coal in world markets has risen dramatically over the last 2 years in the wake of the very sharp rise in oil prices. In many cases the price is now 3 times as great as it was before the oil price increases. The Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) has returned only recently from Japan where he discussed acceptable levels of export prices, in the case of hard coking coals, of the order of $37 per tonne. Coal exporters are as a result earning very large windfall profits. The Government believes that it is only reasonable that some part of these windfall profits should be for the benefit of the community. The duties proposed will achieve that result. Coal varies in quality and the variation is reflected in the prices which are received by exporters. The higher quality coking coals have experienced greater increases than have some of the other classes of coals. It is therefore proposed that the various coals will be classified according to their quality and duty will be levied appropriately. The higher quality coals will bear a duty of $6 per tonne. Other coals, including steaming coals, will bear a duty of $2 per tonne. The Government is concerned that those overseas buyers who have agreed to pay higher prices for our coals should be protected in respect of those prices. In other words, the Government does not wish the duty to be passed on to those buyers. It is therefore proposed that, in order to protect buyers in respect of prices recently renegotiated, approval to export will be in terms of those renegotiated prices as appropriately adjusted by escalation provisions but not including the new duty. I commend the Proposals. Debate (on motion by Mr Adermann) adjourned. NA BILL 1975 [No. 2] Second Reading Debate resumed.",239
139,Mr ENDERBY,PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS ABOLITION,"The Government has great difficulty appreciating the reasons that the Opposition opposes this measure. One would have thought that in this day and age, in 1975, Australians of whatever shade of political hue or feeling would have agreed on one thing at least, namely, that Australia is a nation which today recognises, as far as its legal system is concerned, that the High Court is and should be the ultimate court of appeal from all Australian courts, whether those courts be part of the Federal system or whether they be part of the State systems. Yet, as is so often the case, the Opposition once again says that it will oppose the Bill, this time not because it claims that the measure itself is bad-n o one could be heard to say that-bu t because somehow or other it finds offensive or objectionable the method chosen to achieve the end. One has to analyse the Opposition's motives. As so often happens when one listens to the speeches of Opposition members, one is forced to look around behind the words they choose to use to the purpose they seek to achieve. I listened with great interest to the right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden), who said that he would support a referendum proposal. Well, he might as an individual support such a proposal, but we all know the results of attempts made in this country to change the Constitution be referenda. This Labor Government more than any other government has tried to change the Australian Constitution by referenda, but it requires only one determined group of people, hiding behind the words with which they choose to cloak their real thoughts, to oppose a referendum for the community as a whole to oppose it. It seems that the Australian experience is that Australians vote no. In this situation the Australian Government is using the legal means available to it. There are different points of view, it is true, on whether a challenge would succeed in the High Court were it ever to be mounted. But there are views both ways. The Australian Government takes the view that it wants to go to the limit of constitutional power because it has to change the absurd situation whereby an appellant in a State system of courts-in the New South Wales Supreme Court or the Victorian Supreme Court or the South Australian Supreme Court or the Western Australian Supreme Court or the Tasmanian Supreme Court or the Queensland Supreme Court-ca n bypass the High Court and go to the Privy Council, thus setting up 2 different competing lines of authority. No dignified Australian in this day and age can tolerate such a situation. Austrahans belong to one nation, one nation alone. Yet the Australian Government, in trying to give effect to its policies, to see the High Court of Australia as the single and only ultimate court of appeal, once again is met with arguments from the Opposition to the effect that it does not really oppose the Bill but there must be some other way in which the Government should try to do this. It is the Opposition's credit that is at issue, the credit of the Opposition when once again it says: 'We know that what you are trying to do is the right thing. We do not really want to oppose you, but we are going to oppose you.' Then the Opposition searches, sometimes with incredible ingenuity, to find an additional reason why the measure that it recognises as being sound has to be opposed. So we see yet another example of this attitude coming from the Opposition. I am reminded of the peculiar situation that exists in Australia with its successively rigid Constitution. I have had occasion in recent times to make a number of speeches on this issue. One was a speech I gave in Perth, Western Australia, a Uttle while ago, titled 'Barriers to ReformPolitics of Opposition'. I tried to deal with the opportunities that are given to an Opposition that controls the Senate to thwart, frustrate and delay the proposals that are put forward by a popularly elected government. One can think of examples other than the Privy Council (Abolition of Appeals) Bill that we are discussing tonight. One thinks of the legislation that relates to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority and the electoral reforms that we have tried to put through. One could go on. I think there are some 30 Bills which have been rejected by the Senate since the double dissolution in May of last year. Those Bills are resting in the bank, so to speak, and testify to the unreasoning opposition of the Opposition in the Senate in particular where the Opposition has the numbers. An Opposition that lost an election is able in the Senate to stop a Government that won an election from carrying out its pohcies. Surely there is no greater example to be found of this abiUty than in respect of this legislation. The Opposition says: 'Look, we know that the measure is good, but we are going to block it anyway'. The Opposition comes along and says in this respect: 'We disapprove of this particular legal method'-n o one argues that is an illegal method-'of achieving your end'. The Opposition claims that in some way it is undignified for Australia to take this one additional step towards nationhood in this way, when such action is the only legal way open to the Government. We heard the right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden) say: 'Do not use this legal method that is open to you. Use another one', when he knows full well that the whole experience of Australia since Federation is that the method that he puts forward as the one that we should try is doomed to failure. I will not take up the time of honourable bers very much longer on this matter. We know the attitude of the Opposition. We know that the Opposition has declared itself on this legislation. This is one further example of the attitude of Opposition when its members rise in this place say that it is right and proper-that is the effect their words if not the meaning of their wordsthat Australians should not use their own High Court but in six different ways from six different parts-caUe d States-of Australia should be able to appeal to a supreme judicial body in another country that increasingly is a foreign country Australia, notwithstanding its very close historic ties with Australia. The Privy Council of the United Kingdom and of the Commonwealth full should rule on appeals from New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, often perhaps in different ways, when that body and the United Kingdom are obsessed with their own concerns. That is what the Opposition says. The Privy Council is not famiUar really with Australian law. Australian law is going its own way. It has been going that way for many, many years now. The United Kingdom has been going ever increasingly into Europe as its entry into European Economic Commumty and similar developments of that sort prove. Yet here in 1975 the Opposition-the Liberal Party and the National Country Party-is able to say that a situation should exist by which the Privy Council located in England should rule on what is the law in, say, New South Wales, or what is the correct legal solution to a problem between 2 Australian citizens Uving in Hobart or Perth, merely because the Australian Government, according to one view, does not have the constitutional power to say what the Canadian Government said back in about 1933. They would have this absurd and very dangerous situation continue whereby we cannot give ourselves the symbols and dignity of nationhood. This is an absurd situation in 1975, Mr Deputy Speaker. This attitude does not do the Opposition any credit at all. It brings discredit on the Opposition. I can only hope that people listening to the broadcast of these proceedings from the Australian Parliament, immediately after the presentation of the Budget, will realise what is happening in the House of Representatives tonight after the presentation of that Budget and not related to it at aU. The proposal to abolish appeals from the State supreme courts to the Privy Council in London is being opposed by the Opposition. No matter what the members of the Opposition say, the effect of their actions is to oppose the proposal. The Opposition says: 'Of memcourse we cannot say that it is not a desirable measure, but you must find a better way to do it'. But the only way the Opposition can suggest is a referendum when it knows that invariably when the this Government puts forward referendum proto posals the Opposition opposes them and its very of opposition frustrates the attempts to change the Australian Constitution. Many people in Australia increasingly, I hope, are becoming aware of the rigidity of the Australian Constitution and its complete and total inadequacy to meet the needs of Australians into 1975. Yet here and now we see another example of Liberal-Country Party people saying: 'There must be some way that you can do it'. They know well that the way that they put forward will not succeed. They know that the Statute of Westminster exists. They know that the provisions contained in it have often been commented upon. They know that it is a legal way. For some reason or other they simply say: 'Do not use it. Use the referendum procedures', when we know that they will oppose those measures at another time. So Australia must limp along. Australia is one of the few countries in the world whose the people must appeal not to its own courts but to somebody else's court in another part of the world. It may not be irrelevant if I mention tonight that there was a report, which is probably true, although not officially confirmed- I think that should not prevent me from using it-of the Bartons having succeeded in their case in Paraguay. The reason they succeeded is not unrelated to the matter about which I am talking because a United Kingdom treaty of 1908 may have been held to be not apphcable to Australia in 1975. How absurd! The Whitlam Labor Government tries to cause make changes, tries to develop treaty relalowed. tionships and tries to develop the legal apparatus appropriate for an independent nation-no different nations; not for New South Wales as a nation and Victoria as a nation, each as different from the other as France is different from the Soviet Union, as the members of the Opposition would sometimes like them to be. We do not wish that the Australian Capital Territory should be as different from the Northern Territory as Spain is from Portugal. But when we try to his develop a single coherent set of courts with single appellate system and we use the only pracvery tical and legal means available to us, the sition opposes us. The Opposition does not challenge the legality of those means but chooses to find some strange and poltiical form of words seek to use its numbers in the Senate to block measure. In 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978, and for all we know in the year 2000 if has its way and continues to control the Senate, Austrahans will stiU be required to appeal from the Supreme Court of, say, Western to our own High Court but to the Privy Council in England. One despairs of continuing to patience with the Opposition when it persists with this nonsense.",240
140,Mr HOWARD,PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS ABOLITION," I am extremely sorry that the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) adopted the Une of argument that he did because I do not think it reflected any credit on him or upon this debate. It seems very strange to me and, I am sure, to aU members of the Opposition that a government that is so intent on breaking what the Attorney-General's predecessor described as 'those vestigial legal tween Australia and the United Kingdom' should resort to one of the most vestigial of those links to bring about the purposes contained in this Bill. I am referring to the Statute Westminster. During his remarks the Attorney-General, who became more heated about the subject as he went along, called in question the Opposition's credit. He said that we are not really genuine saying that we want to aboUsh appeals from the courts in Australia to the Privy Council. Honourable members will know that at the time this Bill was introduced there was a companion Bill to abolish the final right of appeal from the High Court of Australia to the Privy Council. Was the Opposition seen to be opposing.that Bill? It was not. The Attorney-General knows that; the Government knows that. We supported that Bill and our support was consistent with our attitude that the final court of appeal should be the High Court of Australia. We supported that Bill be the correct course of action was being folOn that occasion we were not being asked to embark upon the embarrassing exercise of t for 8 reviving a 1931 statute. It never ceases to amaze me that the leader of this.Government, who is so intent upon breaking what he calls the vestigial links that in government offices throughout Australia he hangs his own portrait in place of the portrait of the sovereign of this country, is prepared when it comes to own political purposes to use a 1931 statute of a the Imperial Parliament- a statute which by its description, by the history which led up to it Oppoand by the history which foUowed it Mr Enderby- I rise to a point of order, Mr to Deputy Speaker. Surely it is inappropriate for the my good friend to speak in such, terms of imperial statutes. Our own Constitution is an the Opposition imperial statute.",242

143,Mr HOWARD,PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS ABOLITION,"Wit h respea, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is impossible to talk intelligently about this Bill without referring to the Statute of Westminster because that is the very legal device that the Government is using to abolish appeals from Australian courts to the Privy Council.",242
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS ABOLITION,The honourable links bemember for Bennelong may proceed.,242
145,Mr HOWARD,PRIVY COUNCIL APPEALS ABOLITION,"I think, with respect, that the aU Attorney-General's point of order was not a legitimate one. I share the view expressed by the of right honourable member for Bruce (Mr Snedden), that is, that the High Court of Australia should be the final court of appeal. A process was initiated in 1968 by one of the Attorney-General's predecessors-the Honourable ih Nigel Bowen-to limit appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council. I certainly share the view and I believe that most members of the Opposition share the view that that process ought to be completed. But it ought to be completed in a manner which is consistent with the independence and the dignity of Austraha in 1975. We are constantly being harangued that we are the people who are hanging on to unnecessary colonial links. I return again to the Statute of Westminster. How colonial can you possibly get to resort to statute the very purpose of which was to emphacourse sise the legal independence of the then dominion countries of the British Commonwealth? The purpose of the Statute of Westminster was to make it clear beyond all doubt that the laws of the United Kingdom Parhament would not think, apply to the dominions of the British Commonconvinced wealth unless the ParUaments ofthose countries expressly requested that those laws so apply and consented to their applying. It was clearly Ueved at the time that no self respecting dowhich minion would resort to the device to which the present Government has resorted in 1975. present Government is intent on breaking these vestigial links but, surprisingly enough, it has resorted to this very colonial, vestigial and pendent device. The Attorney-General spent a great deal time talking about the futility ofhis Government putting forward referenda proposals. I was very intrigued to hear that, because his Leader, only few months ago in the dying hours of the autumn session of this House, reintroduced a Bill providwhich ing for a referendum for simultaneous elections. Apparently the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) does not believe that it is futile to put referenda proposals to the Australian people, although I believe that certain branches of the Australian Labor Party's organisation throughout Australia believe that it is futile to do so because the Prime Minister was criticised for doing so at the time the last double dissolution campaign. The Attorthe ney-General knows very well that a referendum proposal could be put to the Australian people deal with this subject. It is to completely confuse the debate and to mislead the House that option is not open. The Attorney-General knows that the self-respecting option open to the Government in this issue is to have a referenhonourable dum. The Austrahan Constitution provides that that document can be changed by referendum the people. On this occasion the Attorneyestic General's Government is in effect saying: 'The Constitution is not adequate; we wiU bypass and revive an ancient device'. I think it reflects no credit on either the poltiical or historical proach of the Government to these matters. I am very sorry that the Attorney-General finds our constitutional setup so rigid and so frustrating. I venture to suggest that a great number of people throughout Australia have been extremely grateful over the past 2'/2 years that we have had the Constitution Act of 1901 because if we had not we aU know very well that the legal balance which still exists between the Federal Government and the State governments in our Federation would have been greatly disturbed. a Of course the Constitution needs updating. Of one could always improve on the basic document of our Federation. For the Attorney General to manifest so very clearly during the course of this debate his frustration and annoyance with the rigidity of the Constitution is, I very revealing. The Attorney-General is that all referendum proposals presented by this Government are doomed to failure. I suggest that if the Government chooses to beput forward a sensible referendum proposal, one is not designed solely to accrue more and more power to the Federal Government, it might The have a httle more chance of success. So I emphasise again that the Opposition is in deno way opposed to a situation in which the High Court of AustraUarightlybecomes thefinalcourt of appeal on all matters arising in the Commonof wealth of Australia. We made this point very clear in the debate on the Bill dealing with the aboUtion of appeals from the High Court to the a Privy Council. Our credibUity is not in doubt. It is the credibUity of the Government on this matter is in doubt. The use of the device which the Government seeks to use in this legislation is to remind the Australian people of a dependent status, not to remove it. It is to remind the Australian people that unnecessary colonial links still exist between Australia and the United Kingdom; it is not to remove it. We support the objective of this legislation. I support it very of strongly. I have long believed that all appeals to Privy Council should be eliminated. We deplore the device which has been used by the to Government on this occasion. We believe that it could prejudice relations between this country to say that and the United Kingdom. I believe that the points which the right member for Bruce made during his remarks were most relevant. Why should we inof volve the United Kingdom Parliament in a domAustraUan dispute? In effect, that is what we run the risk of doing. For the first time since the it Statute of Westminster was passed in 1931 we run the risk of involving the United Kingdom apParUament in a domestic Australian legal matter. How dependent, vestigial and colonial could one possibly get? Yet that is the device on which this progressive independent Government of Australia of 1975 relies. Instead of recognising the self-respect of Australia as an independent country, it resorts to this ancient and colonial device. I repeat that the Opposition supports the principle of the aboUtion of appeals to the Privy Council. It deplores the device which has been used by the Government on this occasion. It rejects any suggestions that its credibUity is in doubt. It is not in doubt. The Opposition faciUtated the passage of the companion Bill which completed a process which was commenced by a Liberal Attorney-General in 1968. The Opposition wiU again oppose the Bill.",242

Imponandy, the projects are not concerned solely with methods of identification, in each case due what emphasis has been given to the study of possible remedial treatment programs: Mr R. C. G.

Woods, Western Australian Education Department-'The extent and cause of reading disability in the primary school'. (2) The Schools Commission makes for recurrent expenditure on primary and secondary education and the major impact of these grants has been the employment of additional teachers and specialist staff (including psychologists and guidance officers). The Schools Commission also makes grants to the States for special education teacher these courses is to allow teachers tion of individual learning problems and as a result enable them to prepare appropriate programs. However since recurrent expenditure and special education teacher training courses are general programs, possible to attribute particular sums as being for persons employed in the identification of children with learning difficulties. Roads: Grants to States Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, time upon notice: (1) How many complaints has he received from rural municipalities over reduced grants for rural local roads under the new Commonwealth Aid Roads Agreement. (2) Does the Government intend to increase the grant this class of road. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourB727-100 able member's question is as follows: (1) 116. (2) At the Premiers' Conference in February of this year, the Premiers were asked what additional road funds they required in 1974-7S to maintain their scheduled road programs. The Premiers asked for an additional $30 million, and this amount was made available. Of this, S3.96 million allocated to Rural Local roads. Judges: Rank and Status Mr Hodges asked the Attorney-General, upon which notice: How many positions under legislation of the Australian itandis Parliament other than judges of Courts of the Commonwealth of Australia have the same rank and/or status or other of such judges, identifying in each case (a) the authincreases, ority or body concerned, (b) the number of positions within each such authority or body, (c) the particular rank or status established in each case and the number of persons School, N.S.W - The appointed to date. Mr Enderby-The answer to the honourable of the nonmember's question is as follows: The President and all Deputy Presidents of the Australian 'PreConciliation and Arbitration Commission have the rank and status (but not in all cases the designation) of a Judge of the Australian Industrial Coun. As many Deputy Presidents as are necessary fromtimeto time may be appointed to the Commission. At the present time, the President and ten Deputy Presidents hold such positions. At the present time no other person holds such rank and/or status in any position under legislation of the Australian Parliament. Aircraft: Non-smoking Seats (Question No. 2422) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, grants to the States upon notice: (1) Has he received any requests from other Ministers or Depanments or individuals for an increased number of nonsmoking seats in large commercial aircraft operating in Australia. (2) Has he discussed this matter with airline representatraining courses. The aim of tives. to improve their identifica(3) Do Australian airlines provide a smaller number of such seats than the international average for similar aircraft. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourit is not able member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) As a non-smoker myself, I have been personally interested in the development of non-smoking areas in Australian domestic aircraft. In February 1972, Ansett Airlines and TAA agreed to set aside groups of seats in both first class and economy class companments for non-smokers, (Question No. 2384) who might ask to be seated in these areas when seats were being allocated prior to the departure of the flight. At that 18 seats were set aside for non-smokers in DC-9 aircraft and 20 seats in Boeing 727-100 aircraft. Since the introduction of non-smoking seats, which I might add were not widely availed of initially, both Ansett Airlines and TAA have carried out continuous market surfor veys to ensure that the provision of non-smoking seats has kept pace with social trends. In this regard, non-smokers are now provided with 27 seats on DC-9 aircraft, 30 seats on aircraft and 36 seats on Boeing 727-200 aircraft, the number of seats being proportionate between first class and economy class companments. I am sure that you will also be interested to learn that Qantas Airways has recently doubled its seat allocation for nonsmokers and now provides up to 108 non-smoking seats on Boeing 747 aircraft and 40 non-smoking seats on Boeing 707 aircraft. Although some other internauonal airlines do provide slightly more non-smoking seats, it is pleasing to see was Qantas adapting to passenger requirements. It must be recognised however, that a significant number of air travellers do wish to smoke and would undoubtedly object strenuously to measures preventing them from doing (Question No. 2407) so. The airlines are of course sensitive to this as, indeed, they are to the position of the non-smoker. The arrangements they have introduced for the segregation of smokers and non-smokers is essentially a compromise. Nevenheless, one an encouraging development in line with social trends which I am personally keen to see pursued funher. of one As the level of community reaction against smoking as hopefully it will, the arrangements made by the airlines for the accommodation of smokers on their aircraft will unquestionably reflect this changed community attitude. We might look forward, perhaps, to the assignment of prompt smokers to seats in smoking areas, segregated from the majority of non-smokers.

(4) The terms of this part of the question are very wide and it.can .perhaps best be answered by referring the Honourable Member to, in particular, the Annual Reports of the Australian Council and of the preceding Australian Council for the Arts. Grants of the kind mentioned are given by a number of other Government departments and agencies.as well. See also the answer to quesuon (3). (5) There are'a. number of programs under which local government authorities receive Australian Government financial assistance direct DetaUs of these programs, including the amounts paid under them, are set out in Chapter V of the 1974-75 Budget Paper No. 7, .'Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities, 1974-75 *. book on the Torres Strait (6) I am unaware of any moneys having been paid direct to State .instrumentaUties except where payments are made for services rendered. However, I would suggest the Honourable Member address this quesuon to the individual Ministers concerned for any programs that he may have particularly in mind. Motor Vehicles: Accidents (Question No. 2416) Mr Garland asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) With reference to question No. 1808 will he now give more recentfiguresthan those provided in the answer to that question. (2) WUl he also indicate how much more likely it is to have an accident on a motor cycle than in a motor car or station wagon. (3) Is there any reason to believe the staustics given for Victoria would vary markedly from those in other States or the Commonwealth as a whole. (4) Is it a fact that the number of casualty accidents involving vehicles per nullion occupant kilometres and the number of occupant casualties per million occupant kUometres whether for all accidents or fatal accidents indicates a fairly constant factor of 15 to 18 times. (5) WUl he provide similar statistics and comparisons for bicycle accidents. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am unable to provide more recent information as the last survey of vehicle usage by the Australian Bureau of Statistics was in 1971. (2) In Victoria in 1971, the number of casualty accidents per motorcycle kilometre was approximately seven times higher than the rate for cars and station wagons. (3) In 1971, no other State or Territory published casualty and accident data by type of vehicle. In the absence of this data, it is not possible to comment on the degree to which the Victorian data would be representative of the other States and Territories or Australia as a whole. (4) Based on the data provided in the answer to question No. 1808, the ratio between the motorcycle and car and station wagon casualty and accident rates is as follows: Number of casualty accidents involving this type of vehicle per miUion occupant kUometres Occupant casualties per miUion occupant kUometres Number of fatal accidents involving this type of vehicle per mUtion occupant kUometres Occupant fataUties per nullion occupant kUometres (5) It is not possible to provide sinular data for bicycle cidents as there is no Australian information on bicycle cyclist nuleages. Education: Grants to States Mr Hyde asked the Minister for Education, to provided upon notice: (1) Of the moneys appropriated to the States by Grants (Technical and Further Education) Act, (a) what moneys have been actuaUy paid to the States, (b) what moneys have actuaUy been spent in technical and further education institutions, (c) in which institutions, and in what amounts, has it been spent, (d) what moneys allocated for 1974-75 remain to be paid to each State and (e) what year. moneys have been paid to the States but, for one reason or another, have not been spent directly in technical and further education institutions. (2) If any moneys have been ministrative or other purposes, for what purposes, and in Project what amounts, has it been retained.",264

The amounts involved are not known. (2) See answer to 1 (e). Health: Research into Rheumatological Mr Lloyd asked the Minister notice: (1) What research is being conducted into rheumatological diseases in Australia, sponsored by the Nauonai Health and Medical Research Council and other bodies, and at what annual cost. (2) What problems have been encountered in the establishment of research programs. (3) Does the Council have a strategy for the development of an adequate program.",267
208,Dr EVERINGHAM,PERTH AIRPORT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (3) Information available to me covers only research into rheumatological diseases supported by the Australian Government through the National Health and Medical Research Council. I have no information on Amount research expenditure by other bodies such as State Health Commissions, Universities and private industries.

The Council pays Dr Clarris' salary as well as providing him with a non-recurring equipment grant and a maintenance allowance. It must be bome in mind that the Government is only able to encourage and support medical research in particular areas if there is interest within the medical research community. The National Health and Medical Research Council's submission for funds for the Triennium 1976-78 is being currently considered by the Government and I hope that it will be possible to increase interest in research into rheumatological diseases both in the form of project support and the appointment of more clinical sciences research fellows.
