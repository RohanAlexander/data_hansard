DUTY ON MAIZE .  the general debate on the tariff the Minister for Trade and Customs promised that before the Easter adjournment he would let the House know the result of the negotiations with South Africa for a reciprocal trade treaty, and that in the event of those negotiations not being successful the duty of 3s. 6d. per central under the general tariff would operate against maize from that country. Can the Minister inform the House of the stage the negotiations have reached ?  Government has informed the Government of South Africa that it proposes to abrogate the 1906 treaty before entering into negotiations for a. reciprocal treaty which has been found necessary in the interests of Australia owing to the alteration of the South African preference to British goods, and I propose to introduce a motion, before the tariff is disposed. of, for the abrogation of the existing treaty as from 1st July next. As the motion must be approved by the Senate, which has adjourned for some weeks, the 1st July is the earliest reasonable date at which it can become effective. STEAMER CLAN MCNA UGH TON.  ister noticed the report in this morning's newspapers of a resolution of the Iron Workers Union that unless all repairs to the damaged steamer, Giant MCNaughton, are effected in Australia the vessel will be declared black, and no repairs done to enable it to continue its voyage ?

6,Mr CHARLTON,OIL EXPLORATION IN,"In view of the disclosures made last evening by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks), who asserted that certain interested persons were endeavouring to frustrate the efforts to locate oil supplies in Australia, will the Prime Minister see that every precaution is taken to prevent interference with the boring operations now in progress ?",14
7,Mr BRUCE,OIL EXPLORATION IN,"The statements made last evening by the honourable member for Wentworth were very serious. Representations in regard to this matter had previously been made to the Government, aiid are now being investigated. SOLDIERS' REST HOME , BENDIGO .",14
8,Mr HURRY,OIL EXPLORATION IN,"F o r several years the Soldiers' Rest Home at Bendigo has been successfully carried on by the Ladies' Red Cross Guild and has done very valuable work. Recently the home was closed, and protests against that action have reached me from various bodies, including, the Bendigo Fathers' Association. Will the Minister for Repatriation explain the reason for closing the institution ?",14
9,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,OIL EXPLORATION IN,The home is being closed because of the dearth of patients of a class that would be benefited by the treatment it offers. NA OFFICERS .,14
10,Mr CHARLTON,ELECTOR AL RETURNIN G,"Can the Prime Minister furnish me with a reply to the question I asked on Monday, regarding the payment of increased allowances to returning officers for extra work entailed by the general election!",14
11,Mr BRUCE,ELECTOR AL RETURNIN G,"I stated recently that a report had been received from the Public Service Board, and that .the Government was considering the matter. In that report the board stated that it could not recommend an increase over the amount granted under the classification. It would appear, however, that in making that report the board was under the misapprehension that the Public Service Arbitrator, in fixing the maximum salary at £480 per annum, had taken into consideration the extra overtime that would be involved under the compulsory voting system. determination of the Public Service Arbitrator was made on the 5th February, 1924, whereas it was not until the 4th July, 1924, that leave to bring in the Compulsory Voting Bill was given. In view of this apparent error, and also of the fact that the 1925 elections were the occasion of the initial application of the compulsory voting law, and that the difficulties incidental to the innovation - were accentuated by the fact that the elections were held some three and a half months earlier than the anticipated date, the matter has been referred back to the board, with a request that it shall review the whole position. NA FILMS.",15
12,Mr MARRS,IMPORTATION OF BRITISH,"Has the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs been drawn to a statement in the Argus today by the manager of the Australasian Film Company that, in order to encourage their exhibition in Australia, the company had imported several hundred thousand feet of British films, but although they are free of duty, the Customs Department has demanded the payment of a considerable duty on the material of which they are made. Therefore, the films are still in bond and cannot be exhibited ?  paragraph mentioned by the honourable member, and I have also received an official letter from the Australasian Film Company in regard to this subject. have been too busy to investigate the complaint, but will do so at the earliest possible date. OIL AGREEMENT BILL . PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",15
13,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION OF BRITISH,I desire to make a personal explanation. I intended to oppose the ultra-socialistic measure introduced yesterday by the Prime Minister to increase the capital of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries.,15
14,Mr SPEAKER,IMPORTATION OF BRITISH,The honourable member is criticizing the bill rather than making a personal explanation.,15
15,Mr GREGORY,IMPORTATION OF BRITISH,"I would have asked for much fuller information in regard to the proposal than was given to the House. Unfortunately, after the bill had been The introduced, I left the chamber to keep an appointment with the Prime Minister. - Naturally I assumed that members of the Opposition would offer the same opposition to the bill .as they did to the original bill four years ago, and that the debate would extend for some time, but on returning to the chamber I found that the measure had been passed through all its stages. I desire to make it .clear that had I been present I would have done my best to retard its passage. TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS.",15
16,Dr MALONEY,IMPORTATION OF BRITISH,An article was published in Smith's Weekly recently regarding Dr Philip de Luca's discovery for the treatment of tuberculosis.

18,Mr COOK,IMPORTATION OF BRITISH,"What is the intention of the Minister for Trade and Customs in regard to giving further tariff protection to the saw-milling industry?  had from the Department and the Government more careful consideration I than the duties on timber. Last year the Tariff Board devoted two or three months to a very exhaustive inquiry into the timber industry, and submitted a report, - which has been printed, in which certain minor dnties recommended. Since then honourable members interested in the timber in dustry have asked that a further inquiry be made, and as soon as the T a r i ff Board has completed investigations that are now in progress, I shall ask it to report upon any new developments in connection with the timber industry since last yeax.  T a r i ff Board recommended the imposition of an increased duty on shooks. result of the recent bush fires a lot of the young timber is now suitable only for case making, and must be - used soon or it will be useless.",15

When speaking yesterday, I intended to refer to the delay that has taken place in making the information available to honourable members"". It would have been possible to publish the balance-sheet some time ago, but it was withheld u n t i l the Government had determined whether the debit to profit and loss, which would have been shown if the balance-sheet had been published before the passing of the bill , should be included or not. the bill has been passed by this House, were the balance-sheet, showing the probable figures for this year and the actual result of the last year's operations, can be made available.

35,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"On the 18th March the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) asked the following question: Has the attention of the Minister for Defence been called to an occurrence which took place at the Liverpool Camp, when certain trainees marched out of camp as a protest against the food supplied to them? By omitting the whole item and inserting in its stead the following item : « * - * (2) Asparagus Tips or the rates whichever rate (A) Quarter-pints and smaller sizes (B) Half pints and over quarter pints (o) Pints and over half pints (D) Quarts and over pints (it) Exceeding a quart I replied that I would have the matter RAILWAY. investigated, and am now in a position to inform the honourable member that from a report of an inquiry submitted in connection with the occurence, it would appear that in the 1st Divisional Casual Camp at Liverpool, at the evening meal on the 12th March, four portions of meat issued to one mess were found to be fly-blown and were replaced immediately. The meat was in good condition when issued from the kitchen, and was probably infected during the distribution in the mess huts. The systems of cooking and preparation of the food were normal and satisfactory, and I have issued instructions that all possible steps shall be taken to prevent infection during distribution to the mess huts. There was no ' ' r i o t "" or unseemly behaviour on the part of the troops as reported in some sections of the press. PAPERS .

Trade and Customs) [11.26]-Hon orable members will remember that when this item was under consideration there seemed to be an almost unanimous desire that the duties on asparagus should be increased. It was felt that big developments were in sight in asparagus-growing and canning, and it was generally thought that, our climate being ideal, and other conditions being good as compared with conditions in other parts of * (2) Asparagus Tips(A) Quarter pints and smaller sizes (B) Half pints and over quarter pints (o) Pints and over half pints (p) Quarts and over pints (E) Exceeding a quart The effect of the amendment will be that sub-items 2A, 2D, and 2E will remain practically unchanged, but that, in the case of sub-item 2B, which applies to halfpints and over quarter-pints, and 2c, which applies to pints and over halfpints, specific duties have been substituted for ad valorem duties-. I submit the amendment to the committee with some confidence. My reason for suggesting the deferred duty is that I am still without conclusive proof that Australia is producing, or can produce, the bulk of the asparagus required in this country.",18
36,Mr LISTER,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,Corio) [11.29] - I am sorry to hear the Minister's statement. Ee has certainly gone a little way in the direction I desired.,19
37,Mr FOSTER,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,What do the honourable member and his supporters want?,19
38,Mr LISTER,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"What we ask for. T ask the Minister not to defer the duties at all, but to make them operative immediately. Considerable quantities of. Australian-grown asparagus are stored in. the various States, and a market for it cannot) be found, because of the Californian competition. The committee should be made aware of the fact that asparagus produced in California isalmost exclusively grown by black labour. Filipinos are employed at the rate of 36 or 38 the world, Australia ought to be able to supply the whole of its requirements of this vegetable. Since then, I have very carefully considered the suggested amendment of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), and the whole subject has been re-investigated. To meet the wishes of the committee, I move this amendment, which goes farther than the original proposal: That the item be amended by adding the following :* * * * "" And on and after 1st July, 192G. * * Britiih Intermediate Tariff. * General Tariff. * per dozen Preferential 9d. Is. Is. 3d. per dozen Tariff. 3s. 4s - OS. - per dozen i 4s. lis. 7s. 6d. - per dozen 5s. 7s. 6d. 8s. Gd. - per gallon. Is. 9d. 2s. 6d. 3s/' cents-, which equals Is. 6d.. or Is. 7d. a day. The bulk of the work in the canning factories is done by Chinese labour, under the contract system.. My complaint is not against the wages paid, so much as against the class of labour employed. Australia cannot hope to compete in primary or secondary industries against goods produced by Asiatic or other coloured labour. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, because there is no possibility of disposing of the present stocks of asparagus in Australia if the duty is not made operative forthwith .  his original proposal, the Minister seemed to me to have "" out-Heroded He r o d "" ; but in the present case he has gone even further than that. He states that the committee is practically unanimous in its desire to increase the duty. I can assure him, however, that I am not of that opinion. It would be infinitely preferable to reduce the production costs in. the industry.. The Minister asserts that the most favourable climatic conditions for the growth of asparagus exist in Australia. If that be so, the industry enjoys a natural advantage, and, therefore, his argument does not support his case. The proposal must increase the cost of living, and encourage a demand for a furthe r increase in wages, thus helping to place Australia in a more insular position than it now occupies.",19
39,Mr MAHONY,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Dalley) [11.37] The proposal of the Minister is probably satisfactory, so far as it goes; but it would be highly dangerous to postpone the operation of the duty. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), who has taken keen personal interest in this matter, has shown that ample stocks of asparagus, grown in Australia, are ready to be placed on the market. If the duty is deferred, the effect will be to flood our market with foreign supplies sufficient to last for years, with the result that the duty, when it becomes operative, will be of no value to local producers. If the duty is justified at all, it should be made operative immediately. I positively refuse to support a deferred tariff. The Minister should pay no heed to the honourable member  orable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), but should be guided by those who support Australian industries. I hope that he will not throw this particular industry to the wolves, since it is seriously threatened by competitors that employ cheap and nasty labour.",20
40,Mr MANNING,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Macquarie) [11.40]. - I think that this matter has been well considered, and that an overwhelming majority of the committee supports the duty; but it would be dangerous to defer its application, since the importers would flood the market before the duty became operative. W it h the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green), I think that every consideration should beshown to an industry whose competitors have an advantage over them by reason of their employment of cheap coloured labour. The honourable member for Forrest suggested that the M i nister, who, in his first proposal, had "" out-Heroded Herod,"" had now gone even f u r the r ; but the honourable member's argument seems to have "" out-Prowsed Prowse."" Asparagus is purely a luxury, and, in order to retain a market for it , an article of the first quality must be produced. I have ho doubt that the honourable member, because of his previous arguments against protection, fel t bound to say that an increased duty on asparagus would both increase the cost of living and cause a rise in wages.",20
41,Mr MAUN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Perth) [11.43] - I have rarely heard a more inconsistent speech than that of the honourable .member for Corio (Mr Lister). The unfair competition, of which protectionists usually complain, consists in the employment of lowpaid workers. The honourable member, however, confessed that he did not take exception to the wages paid by Californian producers j his chief objection was that they employed foreigners. Therefore, he contended that the competition was necessarily unfair. Could a protectionist argument be more ridiculous? If the wages said to obtain in California are paid, they are an indictment of protection, because it is claimed that protection prevents "" sweating,"" and keeps wages high. It is almost incredible that such low wages are paid in a wonderful protectionist country like the Dnited States of America. The same argument was repeated by the honourable members for Dalley (Mr Mahony) and Macquarie (Mr Manning). Nothing has so displayed the insatiable greed of the protectionists as the speech of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) who complained of what he termed the small concession which the Minister was willing to grant. I should not have spoken had it not been for his illogical, absurd and in consistent statements.",20
42,Dr MALONEY,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Melbourne) [11.46]. - Scientifi c and medical opinion is unanimous that it would be wise in the in terests of public health foT every t in containing f r u it or vegetables to be embossed - with the date of canning, in order to prevent labels with different dates from being put on them. The practice of embossing tins in this way is in operation in the ""Dnited Kingdom and in the United State of America, in connection with many forms of tinned food, as well as tobacco and cigarettes. In view of the wide-spread feeling that cancer is caused largely by tinned foods, especially when the foods are old and when opportunity has been given for the acid in the vegetables or f r u it to attack the tins, I suggest to the growers that in future seasons - I realise it is now too late to adopt the suggestion for this year's crop-the y should adopt the system of embossing the date of canning on the t in .",20
43,Mr JACKSON,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Bass) [11.48] - I move That the amendment be amended by leaving out the words "" on and after 1st July, 1926."" If the imposition of the higher duties be deferred u n t i l . the 1st of July next, the Australian market will in the meantime be flooded with supplies from the United States of America.",20
44,Mr R GREEN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Richmond) [11.50]. - It was not my intention to take any further part in this debate, but  man abandoned the rule about calling from each side alternately ? He has called two successive speakers from the same side.",21
45,The CHAIRMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Mr Bayley) There is no written rule on the subject, but the practice in this chamber has been for the Chairman to recognize in turn the members of the various parties.",21
46,Mr R GREEN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) has given us a clue to his outlook on life. He said that, seeing that it is possible in other countries which employ cheap coloured labour to produce articles more cheaply than they can be produced in Australia, rooms ? where our standards of living are higher, the wages and working conditions of those countries should apply to Australia also. ",21
47,Mr R GREEN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"That is the only i ference which can be drawn from the honourable member's remarks. I shall not fessor and the frogs. stand for the introduction into Australia asked of conditions similar to those obtaining dissection, in the United States of America, which, interests while ostensibly a white man's country, has a big coloured problem and working conditions quite dissimilar from those - Australia. I therefore support the of them. amendment moved by the honourable memthe ber for Bass (Mr Jackson). W it h believe that if there is justification the duties being increased at all, the crease should be made immediately. Australian manufacturers should not be exposed to the risk of the market being flooded with importations from overseas.  [11.53],-It was the invariable rule of the ex-Speaker, as it is of the present Speaker, to call on honourable members from each side alternately.",21
48,The CHAIRMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,Mr. Is the honourable member raising a point of order 1 ,21
49,The CHAIRMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Then the honorasparagus able member must address himself to the amendment before the Chair.  unable to understand the action of the Minister in giving way on this item to the wishes of. a few honourable members who are in a minority in this chamber. He should not disregard the great majority of honourable members who have assisted him in connection with this tariff schedule. I do not say that minorities have no rights. Were the honourable  Swan (Mr Gregory) to stand alone they would still have their rights; but the Minister would not be justified in attaching to their views the same i m portance that he would attach to the views held by the majority. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister) submitted sufficient evidence to make it clear that the asparagus industry in Australia is not different from other in dustries.   honourable member for Forrest (Mr . Prowse) is not capable of assisting any Australian industry. The attitude of n - the small minorit y which opposes this tariff reminds me of the story of the proThe professor for a number of frogs for to demonstrate in the of scientific research. A friend told the professor that i u a pond in his back yard were thousands of in frogs, and that he could supply cartloads Two days later he called on professor, and handed him a small him I box containing three frogs. When refor minded that he had stated that he could in - supply cartloads of frogs, seeing that Our there were thousands in the pond, he replied that he had been led to think so because of the noise which emanated from the pond, but that he found only three when the pool was emptied. Those three frogs had made all the noise - The honourable members for Swan (Mr Gre (Mr M a n n ) are like those frogs in that Bayley) - they make a big noise. Those engaged in growing asparagus in Australia are increasing the area under cultivation. 1 remind honourable members that the grown in Australia is, at least, equal to that grown in any other part of the world. I ask the Minister not to be influenced by the small section of the committee which favours deferring the imposition of these duties u n t i l the 1st of July next. Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) 111.59] I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bass (Mr . Jackson). This is a comparatively new industry in Australia; each year greater areas are being placed under cultivation.

58,The CHAIRMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Mr Bayley) I cannot accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bass (Mr .

The effect of this amendment is to in crease by 2s. per dozen the duties on certain specified caps and hats. As it is the desire of the committee that "" shoddy"" material shall practically be excluded from Australia, the raw material used in the manufacture of caps will cost considerably more, as .manufacturers will now have to use genuine cotton tweed or woollen material made in Australia. Further, the proposed duty will give an increased measure of protection against the importation of some caps and hats manufactured of "" shoddy "" material, which cannot be excluded from the country except by a heavy duty. The operations of this Australian industry are perhaps greater than many imagine, as the output is valued at approximately £200,000 a year. Australian factories axe so efficient and so well', conducted that the importations with which they have to compete arevalued at only £25,000 a year. The local, in dustry controls the bulk of the Australian trade. Strong; representations on this subject have been made by certain honourable members, and investigations have been in progress for some time. The matter has been carefully investigated departmentally and also I understand by the Chairman of the Tariff Board, and it has been decided that unless this amendment is carried the Australian industry will be placed in a serious position.",22
59,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Y a r r a ) [12.10] Whilst we are thankful for small mescies, I do not consider the proposed increase in duty sufficient. I therefore propose to place a few facts before the committee, although it is perhaps too late to ask for an amendment to be made at this juncture. I hope the subject will be further considered before the tariff is in another place. It is true, as the Minister lian cap manufactures have control of the bulk of the Australian, trade, but their manufacture consists principally of schoolboys' caps, which represents a fair tensive trade, aa nearly all Australian, schoolboys wear caps. If we eliminate the value of schoolboys' caps from the total valne, it will be found that the trade in men's tweed caps is held by importers, as shown by the following figures: - In 1917-18, the importations were 4,000 dozen; in 1918-19, 3,000 dozen; 1919-20, 2,344' dozen; 1920-21, 6,600 dozen. It will be seen that between 1918-19 and 1920-21 the imports of this article have more than doubled. I do not wish to see an exceptionally heavy duty imposed on schoolboys' caps, as;,, although the local manufacturers are working ona small margin- I have seen their figures-they have been able under the present tariff to hold the Australian, trade. I amassured that the manufacture of men's, caps is not at present extensively undertaken, in Australia.. Imported caps,, a sample of which. I submit, are invoiced in Great Britain alt 12s. per. dozen or. Is. each, notwithstanding that the material in them costs 7 M . in Great Britain .",23
60,Mr WATT,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"A r e they not sold in Australia at 10s. each? The Mr Scullin - Not as much as that. The cost of the material is 7Jd., lining l j d . , peak and canvas I d . , button and thread £d., making the total cost in Great Britain I OJd. These caps which cost Is. in Great Britain are made in the homes of poor people under sweated conditions of the worse character, recalling the "" Song of the S h i r t / ' The cost to Australian manufacturers importing tweed as they were doing before this duty was imposed would be 15s. 3d. per dozen caps with landing charges 20s;. 3d. or a total cost of 35s. 6d. per dozen., without profit. By using Australia, tweed purchased at 5s. 6d. a yard, samples of which I submit, they are able to do better. The Minister said that as the increased duty of 2s. did not cover the increased cost of the raw material due to the increase in the tariff, he proposes to increase the duty by an additional 2s. But that does not meet the competition.",23
61,Mr STEWART,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Then increasing, the tariff sometimes means increasing the cost?",23
62,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"In some instances it does and no one haa argued to the contrary.. In many cases, however, the effect of the tariff has been to increaseoutput, l y excheapen thecoat of productionand also the price of the article.",23
63,Mr STEWART,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,The intention is to increase the price.,23
64,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"The intention is to prevent caps made under conditions, totally opposed to Australian standards, from entering intocompetition: with, locally made caps.. I have never argued! that an increase in the duty always results in a reduction in the price of an article to the consumer. An article made under sweated labour conditions abroad cannot be made at a lower price in Australia. I have shown, time after time, in machinery lines, that the importers work on a very high margin of profit, when there is no local competition, and that when a duty is imposed to enable Australian manufacturers to compete against them, they substantially reduce their prices. But the public are not being exploited by the importers of these caps, which are made at a ridiculously low price. Honourable members must find it hard to believe that this cap that I exhibit was made for one shilling, but I have seen the invoices and know that it is so. porters formerly manufactured them here, but the competition from abroad became so keen, that they were compelled to cease manufacturing and import them. To enable them to regain the business, it will be necessary to impose a high duty of 15s. a dozen, plus 35 per cent, on the imported caps.  tax to put on school-boys' caps. Mr Scullin . ' - It is not proposed to tax the schoolrboys caps. I should absolutely refuse to consent to the imposition of a duty like this on them. The manufacturers have been quite frank in the matter. They have pointed out that they are able to* 'compete successfully - with the overseas manufacturers of school-boys' caps, and make a little profit.",23
65,Mr WATT,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Thos e caps are not tweed, but cloth.",24
66,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"They are made of flannel. It is not - suggested that this heavy duty should be placed on them, 'but only on men's tweed caps. I have been in consultation with officers of the Tradeand Customs Department, as well as with the manufacturers, in regard to these caps, and I can understand the point of view of the department. the figures before it , we were doing all but £25,000 worth of the £200,000 worth of business done here annually in caps, and it naturally concluded that the local manufacturers were holding their own. The fact was that they were only holding their own in, one line, namely, the school-boys' caps. Seeing that we have put a heavy duty on the importation of cheap woollen tweeds from abroad, we should not allow the material to come in neairly free if made up into caps. I am sure that the Government does not stand for that. I can quiteunderstand the difficulty of determining, in a moment, a point like this, and I suggest that the Minister should consult with his department and interview representatives of the manufacturing firms on the matter. If he is satisfied that the facts are as I have stated, he could take steps to amend the item when the schedule is before another place.  with the matter immediately? We could amend the item to read "" Men's tweed caps.""",24
67,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"-It would no* be a The im- fair thing to spring a matter like this on the Minister or on the department. I had not thought of this way out of the difficulty u n t i l this morning. We eould let the item pass as it is, on the understanding that the Minister would reconsider it , and if he felt it desirable, have an amendment proposed in another place. Surely we are not willing to 1 allow the Britis h manufacturers, who make these caps under shocking conditions, to have the business in preference ? to the local manufacturers who formerly had it . I trust that the Minister will adopt my suggestion.  must say that the cap manufacturers are well represented by the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin). He has admitted that it is not necessary to in crease the duty on school-boys' caps, aud that only men's tweed caps need consideration.

The Commonwealth Government is committed I to an expenditure of £20,000,000 for the building of roads throughout Australia. and Because of the great development in motor traction, good roads are essenPractial, and I am sure that no honori n able member is in favour of allowing cement manufacturers, or indeed any manufacturers, to make illegitimate profits.

The necessity for good roads is supreme, outweighing all considerations in favour of the retention of the duty of 35 per cent, on road-making machines as set out in the schedule. At any rate, that - was the general feeling of the committee on Wednesday - night. In view of the fact that within the next ten years the Commonwealth wil l be spending £20,000,000 and the States £15.000,000 on road making, the manufacturers of Toadniaking machines - vvill have an unprecedented How of husiness which should enable them to build up their industry - without the additional 5 per cent. duty.

92,Mr GULLETT,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"He n t y ) [ 2 . 2 6 ] - I support the amendment. I appeal to the Minister for Trade and Customs to return to the decision he reached on Wednesday night in response to the demand from this side of the chamber. Road construction is of paramount importance. There is no municipality in the Commonwealth that is not hampered by the excessive cost of conI f it had struction. Out of every 20 miles of roads in Australia 19 miles are in a bad There is condition. Consequently the excessive wear and tear on every for m of transport means a big loss to business men of every kind. This loss is of more importance It is than the loss of an additional 5 per cent, duty to the industry engaged in the manufacture of road-making and stone-crushing machines. The committee would best serve the interests of Australia by agreeing to the amendment.",29
93,Mr MCGRATH,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Ballarat) [2.28]. - I know that honourable members are anxious to get to a division on this amendment, but I cannot allow to go unchallenged the statement of honourable members on the Ministerial side that a 5 per cent, reduction in the duty will not affect the industry. The Country party is strongly opposed to centralization.",29
94,Mr STEWART,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,That is why we are fighting this tariff.,29
95,Mr MCGRATH,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"The additional duty has already led to the estabashmen t of a road-making machine factory in Ballarat. The reduction of the duty will bring the industry to an end. There are 60 men employed in it , and they have already turned out for the Country Roads Board three rollers which have proved to be better than any previously supplied to the board. As a maitter of fact the board has just given the factory an order for a fourth machine.  has an advantage in making roadmakiug machines.",29
96,Mr MCGRATH,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Of course, and we want that advantage to be maintained. Without the increased duty, this industry would not have been started. I believe that if the duty is maintained, 160 men will be employed in the factory at Ballarat, aud there will be a reduction in price of the machines. It was foolish of the Minister for Trade and Customs to listen to a few members of the Country party the other night. I was reminded of the story of the man who thought he would get tons of frogs from a pool, but only succeeded in obtaining two frogs. Honourable members in the Ministerial corner make a great deal of noise, but their numbers are very few indeed, and their views are quite antagonistic to the general feeling of the country. should encourage country industries. In this case, an industry has been established because of the imposition of an creased duty that the Country party now wishes to abolish.",30
97,Mr YATES,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Adelaide) [2.30] - I hope that the Minister will stand to his guns, and not alter the proposed tariff on this item. The Country party members have said that a reduction of 5 per cent, in the British preferential tariff is only a small item. It would be a very small item so far as country roads are concerned because the increased cost of road-making machinery would be spread over a considerable area. But from a manufacturing view-point, this is indeed a big item. The honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) has shown that a reduction the duty would adversely affect the manufacturer of road-making equipment committee divided. in his electorate. I am surprised at the attitude of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett). He is evidently opposed to the development of al l Australian industries. Only the other night he said, in effect, that Australian whisky was nothing but poison. I hope that the Minister will not accept that sort of dope. Members of the Country party are try in g to make him believe that this proposed duty will penalize country districts. Mr M . CAMEBON - So it will .",30
98,Mr YATES,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Let me remind the honourable member of something that happened in his own district. A. railway was constructed from Adelaide to Will lunga under the guarantee principle, the district councils concerned promising to make good any loss on the line. According to the latest returns, there has been an annual loss of £35,000 on this railway of only 30 miles, and yet these district councils have never been called upon to the make good their guarantee. In the same, electorate a railway runs from Adelaide to Victor Harbour. At the last New Years' Day celebrations at Victor Harbour, the town, by the way, at which Sir Henry Barwell made his famous statement about black labour, the present State Premier promised the residents there a bitumen road from Adelaide, despite the fact that two railways already serve that district, and that there are fewer primary producers there today than there were 35 We years ago. The honourable member for Barker (Mr M . Cameron) cannot deny what I am saying. Compared with those in - things and the tremendous taxation that they have imposed upon the people of South Australia, the effect of the proposed duty will be infinitesimal.' The honourable member advocates a reduction of 5 per cent, on this item to enable the British manufacturers to compete successfully with our own manufacturers. Rather than accept his advice, and that of the Country party, the Minister should stand to his principles, and be all Australian by insisting that, where possible, we shall manufacture our own machinery. A fte r all, road-making machinery is made here as cheaply as it is anywhere else. Questiou-That the words proposed to in be left out stand part of the sub-item (Mr Rodgers's amendment)-put .

The T a r i ff Board Act provides that before any classification can. be made or before any deferred duty can be i m posed, it must be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report, the evidence to be taken on oath and in public. The principle of the deferred duty is that it shall not operate until the bulk of the Australian requirements of the article concerned is made locally.

100,Mr SEABROOK,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Franklin) [2.44] In 1921 the duty on sheet glass per 100 square feet was 2s., 3s., and 4s. This glass is not manufactured in Australia, Notwithstanding what other people may say, I maintain that the T a r if f Board has had no evidence whatever to j u s t if y the imposition of the proposed duties of l i d . , l f d . , and 2d. per lb. A case of glass contains 100 square feet. I wish to give the committee some idea of what the increased tariff means. We have always understood that the highest protective duties are imposed in the United States of America,, but the duty proposed in this schedule on glass is 100 per cent, higher than the American duty on glassi The sooner an industry that requires so much protection goes out of existence the better. I wish to see in dustries established in Australia as much as any one else, bnt we are dealing here with an item which will affect almost every individual in Australia. duty is agreed to, every man who builds a house in this country must pay over 100 per cent, more for all the glass he requires. This duty will increase the east of building. I . have here a few figures which will give honourable members some idea of what this item means. The lightest quality of glass imported weighs 16 oz. to the square foot, and the next lightest weighs 21 oz. to the square foot. These two kinds of glass represent nearly 90 per cent, of all the glass imported. The 16-oz. glass is imported in boxes each containing 100 square feet, and the price of a box of this glass in London is 15s. Under thisitem the duty will be 12s - 6d. In addition to this, there will be a charge o£ 3s. 8d. for freight, insurance, and wharfage-. The ad valorem duty on a box of this glass would be 7s-. 5d., and need not be taken, into consideration. duty under this item, plus freight, will amount to 16s. 2d. on a bsx of glass which costs .15s. in London. These are actual figures which, cannot be disputed, and they show that the total protection afforded, on. glass of this quality is 107 per cent. The protection on 21-oz. glass amounts to 115 per cent. The company that isasking for this enormous duty has never made a square foot of sheet glass, and does not intend to do so until this item is passed. Manufacturers who have been making glass for hundreds of years have discarded in its manufacture what is known as the Fourcault system, but that is the very system which the Australian company proposes to install. Mr E . RILEY - How does the honourable member know that ? He is entirely wrong.",31
101,Mr SEABROOK,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"I have had reliable information. I am informed that the company proposes to install plant for the Fourcault system of manufacture. It is well known that by the adoption of thissystem it is possible to make only 20 per cent, of clean glass that would be suitable for the Australian market. This means that all the bad glass, containing flaws and blows, which would amount to 80 per cent., must be sent to other markets or disposed of here at a loss. That is the reason why the company has asked for such a high duty. It is putting in an inefficient plant, and for that reason is asking for this enormous duty. Mr E . RILEY - That is not true.",32
102,Mr SEABROOK,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"The honourable member will have an opportunity to disI f this prove what I have said, if he can. The duty proposed is unfair and unnecessary, because the kind of glass to which it refers is not manufactured here, and it would be twenty years before the Australian company could produce enough of it to^ meet Australian requirements. Is the Government prepared to impose this tax on the people of Australia for all that time ? I am not much concerned about imparts from foreign countries, but I do want to seethe proposed duty on British imports of glass considerably reduced. : For the information of honourable members. I may say that the quantity of glass imported to Australia from the United Kingdom in twelve months was 1,858,057 squarefeet, and from Belgium and other countries, 9,983,648 square feet. We haveheard a great deal, from honourable members opposite about the low wages The that are paid in England,, but in the glass-manufacturingindustry there the wages paid are practically equal to those paid in Australia.  should give thewages paid in Belgium in the industry to be fair. 1",32
103,Mr SEABROOK,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"The wages paid to unskilled men in the industry in Great Britain are 8s. per day of eight hours; to semi-skilled workmen, 12s. 2d. per day; and to skilled labour, 20s. 8d. per day. These figures give an average weekly wage of £ 4 Is. 6d., and"" the average worker, in Australia is paid' £ 4 6s. per week. It will be seen from the figures that there is very little difference between the wages paid here and those paid in the glass-manufacturing industry in Great Britain . In Belgium and other countries, the wages paid in the industry are very much lower-as low as 4ff. 2d. per day-and theoperatives have to work seven days a week. The glass produced in other countries by the Fourcault system is sent to such countries as China, Japan, India, Russia, where the people are not particular about the quality of glass they use, and it is sold at a very cheap rate. In Australia we want the best glass it is possible to obtain. I hope the Minister will see his way to accept a reduction of these duties, and I move That in sub-item (B) the rates as on and after the 1st July, 1926, be omittedwith a view to insert in lieu thereof : per lb. (British), £d.; (intermediate), l j d . ; (general). 2d.; or ad val. (British), 30 per cent.; (intermediate), 50 per cent.; (general), GO per cent. Mr E. RILEY (Soutli Sydney) [2.55]. - The manufacture of glass is one of the most important industries that could be established in the Commonwealth. I was at first disposed to take the same view of this item as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) has taken on the information supplied to me; but as the glass-manufacturing industry is to be started in my own electorate, I made further inquiries, and obtained information, which has satisfied me that the M i nister is on the right track in submitting these duties to establish this industry. I shall not go into details, but wiil confine myself to advocacy of the establishment of new industries in this country. No Other country in the world has experienced so phenomenal a growth as Australia, and every one must admit that great quantities of glass are required by our people. The honourable member for Franklin has said that we have not produced in Australia one square foot of sheet glass. We have produced other kinds of glass. The company which has been referred to is making ornamental glass, and has now decided to manufacture sheet glass.",32
104,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"W h i c h is a very different proposition. Mr E . RILEY - J u s t so, but the material of which ornamental glass is made is used in the manufacture of sheet glass. This company sent its ablest representative on two trips through the great glass-producing countries of the .world to secure the best information on its manufacture. The company has spent nearly £10,000 to secure that information, and it is therefore unthinkable that it would install an old-fashioned system for the manufacture of glass. It is composed of business men, and gives the assurance that it will use the iatest appliances to produce the best possible glass.",33
105,Mr SEABROOK,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Shee t glass? Mr E . RILEY - Yes , sheet glass. As soon as this item is passed the company will send cables to obtain the best and most up-to-date machinery. We ought to be proud of a company that is prepared to establish a new industry in Australia. This company is putting nearly £300,000 into the industry, will employ a large staff of men, and will make this country self-contained so faT as its requirements of glass are concerned. I cannot understand honourable members objecting to proposals intended to enable usr to provide our own requirements. We have the necessary sand and other elements required for the manufacture of sheet glass, and we should be proud to know that there is a company that has the courage to try to establish the industry. What is proposed is a deferred duty, and it will not operate unless the works are established and sheet glass is manufactured there.  quality. Mr E . RILEY - This Parliament takes no risks in the matter. The Government is responsible to this House, andbefore this duty is put into operation the factory must be erected and glass of a satisfactory quality turned out. The company has acquired a considerable block of land in my electorate, and a regular mountain of sand that is as good for the manufacture of glass as any to be found elsewhere. The company is prepared to put sheet glass on the market as cheaply as we can obtain it now. I trust the Minister will stand by the item and give Australian workmen an opportunity ' to produoe an article which has not been produced here before.  Trade and Customs) [3.0] - The Government will adhere to the duties mentioned in the schedule, but I assure the honourable member for Franklin that the deferred duty will not operate u n t i l the local glass is satisfactory in quality and quantity.",33
106,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,Perth) [3.1.] - The honourable member for South Sydney seems prepared to believe almost any story that is told to him . Mr C. RLLEY - The free traders have been whispering some nice stories in the honourable member's ears.,33
107,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"The remarks and interjections of the honourable member show that he does not know what he is talking about. The honourable member for South Sydney exhibited samples of fancy gilass, and said, "" If an Australian firm can make that, it can make sheet glass."" Fancy and sheet glass are made by entirely different processes. In the production of fancy glass, the molten material is run from the furnace into small moulds and compressed into shape. The making of sheet glass is a very much more complicated process.",33
108,Mr MCGRATH,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,If the local company cannot make sheet glass the duty will not operate.,34
109,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Glas s is one of the most difficult materials to run in a molten state, because the slightest changes in temperature cause variations in the stresses, and prevent the production of a uniform product. According to the evidence given before the Tariff Board by the applicants for this duty, they intend to employ the Fourcault process, and that, the honourable member for South Sydney says, is the best in the world. It is not. It was introduced in 1902, and has not anywhere produced high class sheet glass in sufficient or regular quantities.",34
110,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"In Belgium alone fourteen firms are utilizing that process. Mr ""MASTS - It has been tried in almost every country in the world, and it has been abandoned by the best glass makers. It is still in use in Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia, and some other countries, because although they get only 20 per cent, of first class glass from it, they can sell the other SO per cent., with its stresses, lines, and faults, to adjoining countries whose standards are less advanced than our own. The process employed in England, Avhicli is the best in the* world, is extraordinarily difficult, and complicated. The molten glass is blown out of the furnace by compressed air into elongated cylindrical forms. These cylinders can be uniformly heated in all parts, and maintained at an equal temperature. After reheating they are cut longitudinally and pressed or rolled flat, and then annealed in the ovens. Obviously, such a complicated process would not be resorted to unless it were found essential to good results. Mr E. RILEY - The men who are about to start the manufacture of sheet glass in Australia are not new chums. Mr MANN"" - They are. The expert to whom the honourable member has reral ferred has had no experience, except bottle blowing.",34
111,Mr MCGRATH,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,Does he not know much as the honourable member?,34
112,Mr MASS,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"It is evident that he knows more about the business than orable members opposite, when he can stuff such extraordinary stories down their throats and induce them to support the imposition of a heavy duty.  able member should recognize that the manufacturers cannot get the benefit of the duty until they make good. Mr MANN' - And who is to judge whether Or not they make good? This proposal has been already favourably reported upon by the Tariff Board, which did not even take into accountthe defects of the Fourcault process, and eventually the. board will be asked to decide whether its own recommendation is producing satisfactory results. Repeatedly I have pointed out that the members of the board cannot be experts on all subjects, and in dealing with matters of which they have no knowledge, their inclination is to accept the statements put before them by interested parties. If the board accepts the Fourcault process as one of the best and most up to date in the world, it casts a grave doubt upon its knowledge and judgment.",34
113,Mr FENTON,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,The leading glass manufacturers of all countries are adopting this process.,34
114,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"They are not. With company after company it has beeu a failure, and dt is only effectively and economically employed by manufacturers who can get rid of a large proportion of their products in countries that do not demand an article of high quality. Australia has a high standard in building construction, and should endeavour to maintain it, but that standard will disappear if the competition of the best quality of glass is shut out. British sheet glass sets the highest standard for the world, and it supplies 20 per cent, of Australian requirements. There is plenty of scope for extra duties on the other 80 per cent.",34
115,Mr FENTON,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,Belgiu m supplies that 80 per cent.,34
116,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"I am not offering any opposition to the intermediate and genetariffs, but I am asking for a reducin tion of duty in respect of British sheet glass. Protectionists always profess to as advocate what is best and most up to date, and they sneer at free traders as antiquated. Two hundred and fifty years honago, a window tax was introduced into Europe, and it is always quoted as an instance of the antiquated ideas and barbarism of an earlier age. It was eventually abolished because of its evil effects upon the health of the community. It has remained for the protectionists of today to revive the antiquated idea of a tax on windows.",34
117,Mr MARR,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,A tax on wind.,35
118,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"The honourable member is not prepared to rise and p it his wind against mine. Throughout this tariff debate he has not been game to rise and say one ""word in favour of these prohibitive duties. This duty will add to the cost of housing, and I hope that hencef o r th protectionists who have revived the tax on windows will not boast of their up-to-dateness.",35

120,Mr MARR,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,The honourable member regards himself as an authority on everything that comes before the chamber.,35
121,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,I rise to a point of order. Are the remarks of the Honorary M in ister relevant to the item?,35
122,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING," The Honorary Minister is not addressing himself to the item, and I ask him to do so.",35
123,Mr MARR,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"I am making a personal explanation. I resent the imputation contained in the statement that I have sat silent because T was not game to say anything about the tariff. These proposals were discussed and approved by Cabinet, and the Minister/for Trade and Customs is the spokesman of Cabinet. If the honourable member for Perth would discuss the tarif f - reasonably and temperately, and not try to ram his own ideas down the throats of everybody else, business would proceed much better. . Mr C. RILEY (Cook) I resent - the anti-Australian remarks of the honourable member for Perth (Mr . M a n n ) . He and members of the Country party have no sympathy with Australian secondary industries. In connection with the growing of wheat or cotton or wool, considerations of inefficiency never enter their minds; but when we are talking of the millin g of wheat or the weaving of woollen and cotton goods, those honourable members do nothing but charge Australian secondary producers with inefficiency. Being a good Australian, I have f a it h in my country, and in its captains of industry. The honourable member has said that the process employed in the manufacture of glass articles pressed is different from that used in the manufacture of sheet glass. It wag unnecessary for him to tell us that. School boys and girls in the third class know that there is a difference between the two processes. The honourable member has endeavoured to prejudice the committee on this item. He said that the company which is about to undertake the manufacture of sheet glass has not taken all the difficulties into consideration. I anticipate that there will be certain difficulties, but I have f a i th in the men who are prepared to invest from £250,000 to £300,000 in the business. Many skilled men in the glass-making industry aTe walking the streets of Sydney unemployed. Their condition is due to the heavy importations of glass from England and Belgium. Specially trained experts in the manufacture of sheet glass have been brought out to this country by this company at great expense. They are quite satisfied with the prospect, and are showing greater f a i th in Australia than is shown by the honourable member for Perth, who claims to be an Australian. I am satisfied that if the duty is i m posed Australia will, within twelve months, be producing sheet glass comparable with the best Belgian sheet glass. I hope that the committee will pass the item, and, by so doing, will demonstrate its f a it h in Australian industries and Australia's captains of industry. Honourable members may safely ignore the antiquated ideas of the honourable member for Perth. Mr .SCULLIN (Y a r r a ) [3.17]. - I wish to correct one or two errors made by the .honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann). He asked whether the [3.12] - articles placed on the table were intended to illustrate the manufacture of sheet glass. They were not. They are here to support a request that the Minister should extend protection to the manufacturers of -'f.hem. At present, the manufacturers of these articles hava no protection; they have, apparently, been overlooked. I have been, assured that they can employ 500 more men in the existing works if they are given protection. I hojM the Minister will consider their request, and grant it when the schedule reaches another place. The examples of blown and pressed glass displayed on the table are a credit to the manufacturers of them. The honourable member for Perth rushed in with his very limited knowledge. Mr MANN.'-The honourable member is issuing his instructions.",35
124,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"I am making a request. I do not like the word "" instructions."" Unlike the honourable niembeT for Perth, I do riot pretend to be an expert, but I have enough technical knowledge to know that when he described the Fourcault process be did not describe it correctly. He said it wag a process in which glass was raffed out flat.",36
125,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,Did I ? The honourable member had better make quite sure of that.,36
126,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"As a matter of fact, it is drawn out flat. There is a great difference. If I misunderstood the honourable member, I am aorry.",36
127,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,I believe it is drawn out between rollers.,36
128,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"It is drawn, but not hammered, out. I have seen two samples of this glass, and what impressed me was that one could not see the marks, due to the hammering system, under the old method.",36
129,Mr MANN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,There is no such thing as hammered glass.,36
130,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"If the honourable member knew anything about it , he would know that there is.",36
131,Mr SEABROOK,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,What kind of a hammer is used ?,36
132,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"A mallet, not a sledge hammer, such aa ought to be used on the honourable member! mittee, I think, can be quite satisfied about the system, which is in operation elsewhere. I have a copy of a cablegram sent by an expert in London to the Australian glass manufacturers, in which it is stated that the process has been established, and has proved a success. cablegram is as follows:Fourcault process definitely established and proved a success-. Fourteen works Belgium alone operating: or construction"" present time, including large plant entirely financed by Plate Glass Company. Fourcault output Belgium now 200,000,000 feet per year. The cablegram proceeds to substantiate that statement, and shows that the system is established as a success in other countries* If that is true, the Government should give these people the protection they are seeking. 1 hope, also, that the Minister will provide protection for the manufacturers of pressed and blown glass. Amendment negatived. Item agreed to. Postponed item 262 (Marble).",36
133,Mr FORDE,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Capricornia) [3.24] - I am pleased to observe that the Minister has given some assistance to the marble industry by increasing the rate of duty. He has granted, a 10 per cent, increase on slabs, scantlings, or blocks, sawn on one or two faces; a 10 per cent, increase on slabs, scantlings, or blocks, sawn on one or more faces, and one or more edges or end's; and 5 per cent, on wrought marble n.e.i. The proposed, increase is, however, inadequate. In Central Queensland there are marble quarries in which local people have invested large sums of money,, and there are also marble quarries in the Angaston district of South Australia. There has been a considerable increase in importations of marble during recent years. In . 1913 we imported £51,775 worth of marble, and in L925, £77,400 worth. Importations of marble from Ital y i u 1921-2 were: I h rough, £ 4 5 3 ; sawn, £ 2 2 , 8 4 6 ; and wrought, £9,950, making a total of £33,249. For 1923-4 the figures were-: In rough, £ 2 4 7 ; sawn, £ 2 8 , 3 7 5 ; and wrought, £15,683, making a total of £44,260. In 1923-4 the importations from It a l y were £11,00 0 in excess of those for 1921-2. The request for an increase in the duty on imported marble was made on the ground of depreciation, of currency in Italy , inability to impose a dumping duty, low wages in Italy, and high rates of freights in Australia. A number of Australian marble The com- companies have suffered considerably as a result of inadequate protection. A sum of £30,000 hag been invested in the quarries in Central Queensland, and probably a similar amount in South Australia. Owing to the depreciated currency in It a l y , the old protection The is quite inadequate, and has closed down the Australian quarries. The normal rate of Italia n currency is 25.23 lire to the £ 1 , but it is now, approximately, 140 to the £ 1 . The Tariff Board made its last inquiry into the need for protection for the marble industry 14th and 30th January, 1925. On 14th January there was ouly one witness, who was from the Angaston Marble Company, of South Australia. No witnesses were examined in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisleast bane, or Rockhampton. The board ought Australian to have visited Rockhampton. It visited the South Australian marble quarries, but did not go to Central Queensland. day. My chief request to the Minister is that he should arrange for the Tariff Board, the next time it is in Brisbane, and, i possible, before the schedule is considered in another place, to visit Central Queensland, and make personal inquiries into the operations at the marble quarries there. When the board; as far back as 1923, wanted to find out certain things about the Queensland quarries, ib sent telegram to the sub-collector of Customs in Rockhampton, who collected the infororder mation, and telegraphed it to the Customs Department in Melbourne. Members of the board would certainly be greatly pressed if they could see the Central Queensland quarries. I have some photoQueensland. graphs taken last January of the quarries, F.S.T.O., and the marble from them. I hand them to the Minister for his edification. Machinery that cost about £30,000 lying idle. When the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs (the late Sir Austin Chapman) visited Rockhampton on the that 27th October, 1923, he received tation representing the marble interests of Central Queensland, and in the course of his reply lie statedRegarding the work of the Tariff Board. desire to explain that it inquires into reports upon matters referred to it, and makes a recommendation to the Minister. But I point out that no personal inspecopinion:tion of the marble deposits i u Central Queensland was made by either the M in ister or the board. The following is an extract from a letter from the board, you dated December, 1923:I beg to inform you that it has not been found possible to impose dumping duty marble imported from Italy: but the question of providing greater protection for the industry by an increased duty is receiving consideration, and will be dealt with nexion with the next revision of the tariff. No inspection, however, was made of the Queensland quarries by the board. to Last year Australia sent £80,000 to countries for marble, and I submit we should endeavour to keep that trade on within the Commonwealth. In Central Queensland no less than 18,000,000 tons of the finest marble in the world is procurable; yet every decade Australia purchases marble abroad to the value of at £1,000,000. It is impossible for the quarries to cope with the competition from Italy , where the wages paid in this industry are from 7 to 12 lire a On the 17th March the It a l i a n currency equalled 121 lire to the pound sterling, and last July it was as high as f 145 lire to the £ 1 . When the exchange is normal the lira equals 9d.; but at the present time it amounts to only 2d., which means that the wages now paid in It a l y are equal to only Is. 6d. a day. The Italian Government has imposed an a export duty on all rough marble sent out of that country. It has done this in to encourage employment in Italy in connection with the working of the marble. Some of the best geologists in Australia imhave reported very favourably on the quality of the marble found in Central Mr E . C. Saint-Smith, Government Geologist of Queensland, reporting on the 15th May, 1921, ou the deposit of marble in Central is now Queensland, statedQuite apart from the marble obtainable from other leases, there can be no doubt whatever these two quarries alone would not be a depuworked out in 50 years. I have been informed by those associated with the industry in Central Queensland that a sample of the Ulam Carrara marble 1 was sent to Mr Harold Parker, the and Australian sculptor. Having exhaustively then tested it , he furnished the Central Queensland syndicate with the following I have now given the block of white marble that you were good enough to send me a trial, as promised. I have pleasure in reporting to that, in my opinion, it is very good quality, and quite suitable for sculpture. . . . . . It is very like the statuary marble of Greece, and should have a great future before on it for buildings, monuments, &c. local For a few years after the war the Australian marble quarries obtained a fair l y in congood market in this country, and some of the importing firms reported favourably on the Queensland products; but, owing the depreciation of It a l i a n currency, other and the refusal of the Commonwealth that Government, to impose dumping duties, thousands of tons of cheap Italian marble were imported until it became impossible for the Australian quarries to compete against the Italian product. Dumping duties would probably have beeu imposed had it not been for the existence of a treaty between Great Britain and Italy , dating back to 1883. Touching on this matter, the Tariff Board reportedIn considering the request for a higher duty, it would seem necessary to hear in mind the fact that the currency of Italy has greatly depreciated, and that the price of Australian marble has been reduced below a payable level in order to meet the competition from Italy. Two Australian companies at least have been unable to carry on in opposition to Italy. If it were not for the treaty between Italy and England, which prevents Australia charging dumping duty on goods from Italy, it seems vrry probable that the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act would be applied to marble from Italy. It seems to me that that treaty should not have been allowed to influence the action of the Government, since it was made before the establishment of federation. The duty on imported marble provided in the schedule before the committee should be increased by 5 per cent. All I ask stage is that the Minister arrange for the Tariff Board or one of its omcers to report on the Central Queensland, quarries by the time the consideration of the schedule is begun in the Senate. I should like the board, if possible, to visit Eockhampton and submit a report, which could be considered by the Government and the Senate. quote from other letters, which show that marble from Central land was highly spoken of by firms using it a few years ago. D . W . Custer and Company, of Sydney, on the 18th February, 1921, wrote as follows: The samples show a quality equal in texture to most of the Italian marble imported into Australia, and should find a ready sale amongst the monumental and building trades. By omitting the whole of sub-item (D) (4) (twice ooourring) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item :"" (D) (4) Chassis, but not including Rubber Tires(A) Unassembled (B) Assembled Messrs.

Will i a m T r a in and Company, of South Melbourne, reported on the 4th February, 1922The last blocks of marble received from you have turned out well, and we are carving a soldier out of it. Our sculptor says he is well pleased with it, and considers it as good as the imported marble. It may be objected that these laymen are not, competent to give an expert opinion. I shall, therefore, quote the view of Professor H . C. Richards, D.Sc, of the University of Queensland. .He statesFrom the dressed specimens, it is seen that the marble can be worked very well indeed, and there is no evidence of cracks or brecciation. Analysis shows Queensland marble equal to any in the world. The marble quarried in New South Wales at least and South Australia has also been the at this subject of favourable comment; and now I hope the Minister will take steps to have a request for an additional increase of duty made by the Senate.

This ^would encourage the manufacture in Australia of batteries, which - would come under another item. Unassembled chassis would be admitted free under the British pref erential rate if an assurance was given that they would be equipped with Australian made tires and batteries. The same security should be given with regard to the assembled chassis as with the unassembled chassis, namely, that they should be fitted with Australian-made tires and batteries. The object of the amendment is to encourage the use of locally manufactured equipment, and the assembling of motor cars in Australia.",39
135,Mr MABITS,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,Is that position not already met by the duty on tires and batteries ?,39
136,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,I do not think so. A duty is placed on tires in order to protect the Australian tire industry. want to encourage chassis being imported without tires.,39
137,Sir GBANVIZLE RVKIE,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Would it be difficult to ensure that Australian tires would be put on the chassis. - I Mr Scullin - No . In 1934-5, over 70,000 chassis were imported into Australia, 75 per cent, of whioh were rubber shod. That means that 210,000 tires entered Australia during that year, their value being about £1,842,360. Yet motor tires are manufactured in Australia. I admit that - the whole of Australia's requirements could not be met at once, but they could be met within sis months. This regulation should be deferred for that time. Should my amendment be agreed to, £500,000 more capital would be invested in this industry, and employment given to a prefer- greater number of workmen. I ask the Minister to give it favourable consideration. MT . PRATTEN (Martin-Minister for Trade and Customs) [ 3 . 4 7 ] - I am afraid the Government cannot accept the amendment, because it would interfere with our policy of giving substantial preference to the Mother Country in respect of motor cars, if we can do so and still preserve the interests of Australia. For the reason that during t h o war period the B ritis h motor industry was engaged in the manufacture of munitions, it suffered from the competition of the United States of America. In spite of what has been saifl here, it is the earnest desire of the Government to encourage British trade with Australia; these duties have been designed to give the B ritish motor car industry the maximum encouragement. The assembling of B ritish motor cars in Australia has commenced, and I believe that under the Government's proposals the assembling of American motor cars in Australia will proceed .at a greater rate than heretofore. During .recent years Ford, Dodge Brothers, and other makes of motor cars have been assembled here. The margin between unassembled and assembled chassis before the introduction of this schedule was only 2J per cent., whereas under this tariff that margin is increased to 5 per cent. Seeing that great developments have taken place in the assembling of chassis in Australia with a margin of 2£ per cent, only, we I should expect even greater developments with a anargin of 5 per cent. The question of the manufacture of tires in Ausnot tralia is receiving the earnest attention of the department. Although I am unable to say so definitely, I am of the opinion that the Australian tire factories are already working to their utmost capacity. I understand that further developments are projected. If 'the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) will withdraw his amendment, I promise him that the Tariff Board will teep closely in touch with developments, and that I shall have no hesitation whatever in submitting to the Government any proposal considered necessary in the interests of Australia. Notwithstanding what has been said during this debate, motor cars can be bought in Australia today at prices which are very much lower than was the case when these duties were first imposed. The Government is very reluctant to alter its policy regarding. preference to British motor cars. A reduction of the preference to Great Britain would not help the assembling of motor cars in Australia. I realise that the manufacture of motor fires in Australia is an 'important industry. If the Australian factories can add to their production, I shall see that their interests are conserved. Mr 'FENTON - On e firm has already increased its capital by £500,000 in an- have been consulted. ticipation of increased business. That firm should be assisted.  one firm has increased its capitalbut it will probably be twelve months before it can increase its output of tires. In the circumstances, I am afraid that the amendment, if carried, would have very little practical result.  give us an assurance that the assembling of British chassis will be undertaken i Australia to any great extent in thenear future?  ceived from the Association of British Manufacturers a memorandum in which they assured me that the assembling in Australia of British motor cars was now being carried out toy Barlow Motors Limited, F.

138,Mr COLEMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Reid) [3.55] - I am astonished at the attitude adopted by the Minister. This is one of the most important items in the schedule, both in so far as it affects our secondary industries and in its relation to the unfavorable trade balance with the United States of America. In the mamifacture of motor tires, the United States of America is probably our principal competitor. Figures supplied by the Tariff Board show that last year motor tires to the approximate walue of over £1,800,000 entered Australia on imported chassis.",40

140,Mr COLEMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Ha d their entry been prohibited by a higher duty on the rubber-shod chassis, as suggested hy the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin)., that trade would have been captured for Australia. The honourable member's proposal is to defer this duty for six months, to enable our manufacturers to increase their plant to meet the increased demand for tires in Australia. This motion is the result of careful consideration, not only by honourable members on this side, hut also by some honourable members on the Government benches who It reserves a proper ratio of preference; it does not destroy British preference as stated hy the Minister.

142,Mr COLEMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"We say that unassembled chassis, not including rubber n tires and batteries, if security is given that they are to be equipped with Australian tires and batteries, should be admitted at the following rates:-British , free.; intermediate, 2$ pea"" cent.; foreign, 5 per cent. The assembling in Australia of all the motor cars used in this country would result in greatly increased employment. So far as tires are concerned, an unanswerable case has been made out.  tional tires can be made here.",40
143,Mr COLEMAN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"We ask only that the duty be deferred for six months, by which time, as the Minister is aware, it will be possible to manufacture in Australia all the tires we require. I should have preferred a motion prohibiting the importation of anything in connection with motor chassis that can be manufactured in Australia, but, unfortunately, the tariff is being rushed through, and there is no time for a full discussion. Tires and batteries are manufactured in Australia.",40
144,Mr HUGHES,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"Bumper s and shockabsorbers are also made here, and to a greater extent than are batteries. Mr COLEMAN"" - I should be glad if the honourable member were successful in adding them to the list. A duty has to be paid on tires, whether attached to the chassis or imported separately, the rate being, British 3 s. 6d., intermediate 2s., and general 2s. 6d. per lb. Batteries are admitted free if attached to the chassis, being deemed part of the chassis; but replacement batteries, separately as such, are subject to a specific duty of Britis h 27$ per cent., intermediate 35 per cent., and general 40 per cent. As batteries are satisfactorily manufactured in Australia, it is an anomaly. Batteries, like tires, should be dutiable whether imported separately or not. H a l f a dozen firms are manufacturin g motor car batteries, and among them the Clyde Engineering Company; but their sales are confined to replacements when the original batteries are worn out. As batteries are manufactured in Australia, the same conditions should apply to them as to tires. According to the evidence given before the T a r if f Board, for the year ended the 31st December, 1924, 72,551 chassis were i m ported into Australia,, each fitted with a battery, which, at the American cost of £6 15s., gives the total value of £489,719 in respect of batteries alone, or nearly half a million of money. The manufacturers in Australia can produce all the batteries required to meet the demand in the Commonwealth. It was stated in evidence before the Tariff Board that one firm could increase its output from 7,000 to 60,000 a year within 60 days. As no less than 80,000 batteries are used in Australia every year, this industry is of the greatest possible importance. Batteries used for various purposes, including wireless, and I earnestly trust that if for political considerations the Minister cannot accept this amendment he will allow the question to be determined by a free vote. As the committee has shown great patriotism in its desire to help Australian industries in directions where the economic conditions and the value of the production are far less than in this particular instance, I trust that it will be decided to allow the deferred duty to operate. If it is found impracticable the Minister can bring down a recommendation later, but he should accept this amendment, which has been thoroughly examined by honourable members on both sides of the chamber, and hag also received the consideration of technical officers. I trust that the amendment will be carried in spite of the difficulties which the Minister has raised concerning it .",41
145,Mr SEABROOK,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"F r a n k l in ) [ 4 . 3 ] imported I heartily agree with the sentiments ex in this respect, but I think the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin) has gone a little too far with his amendment. If the honourable member had l e ft the duty on assembled chassis as it is, Britai n would still have had the preference of 12$ per cent. If the honourable member had made the duty payable on unassembled chassis under the general tariff 7$ per cent., the proposal would probably have met with the Minister's approval. Preference should be given to unassembled chassis so that the work of assembling would be done in Australia. Most of the factories assembling chassis would, I am sure, give an undertaking to use Australian tires and bodies, and thus a tremendous amount of work would be provided. I trust the Minister will do something in this respect.",41
146,Mr HUGHES,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"No r t h Sydney) [4.5] . - I am in agreement with a great deal that has been said by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman), but will not vote to reduce the present Britis h preference.

The rates for unassembled chassis areBritish, 5 per cent.; intermediate, 10 per cent.; and general, 12$ per cent. We wish to give preference to unassembled chassis, in connection with which an undertaking is given by those assembling them that they will use Australian tires and bodies. If the right honourable member wishes to restore the British preference, the rates could be made British, free; intermediate, 5 per cent.; ancl general, 7$ per cent.",41
148,Mr HUGHES,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,I wish the British manufacturer to receive preference over others.,42
149,Mr SCULLIN,LIVERPOOL TRAINING,"On unassembled chassis, the rates could be-made-British , free; intermediate, 5 per cent.; and general 7$ per cent, to those using Australian material in assembling, which would preserve the same preference as between 5 per cent., 10 per cent., and 12$ per cent.  Even in its amended form the amendment reduces the margin of British preference, because the proposal in the schedule is that the rates on unassembled chassis shall be British, free; intermediate, 7$ per cent.; and general, 12$ per cent. Therefore, the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), that the rates shall be British, free, intermediate 5' per cent., and general 7$ per cent., will reduce the intermediate rate by 2$ per cent, and the general rate by 5 per cent. Whichever proposal is adopted, it will have the effect of reducing British preference.

It is proposed to erect a telephone exchange building on a site which has been acquired at the corner of Harrington and Davies streets, Hobart, and to install therein an automatic telephone switching system, together with necessary engineering services, including air-conditioning, heating, de-humidifying, and compressed air cleaning plant. The existing manual exchange which serves the subscribers in the Hobart telephone exchange area will reach the l i m it of its capacity by about 1928, and it is impracticable, owing to building limitations, to extend the existing plant in the present building.

ADJOURNMENT. CUSTOMS TARIFF : OPPOSITION ASSISTANCE - WACKETT-WIBGEO N FLYING BOATVENTILATION OF CHAMBER.",45
159,Mr BRUCE,HOBART AUTOMATIC,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External A f fair s ) [ 4 . 3 4 ] - I move That the House do now adjourn. tele- On behalf of the Government, I express appreciation of the assistance which every honourable member in this House has given us during the almost continuous sittings of the last few days. I recognize that it is the duty of honourable members of the Opposition to obstruct, but, to a certain extent, they forgot their natural instincts, and allowed a very valuable measure to be placed on the statute-book for the benefit of Australian industries. The Government will not in any sense take that action as a precedent. We shall expect to find them in their natural mood when the House reassembles.",45
160,Mr R GREEN,HOBART AUTOMATIC,"Richmond) [4.35] The Wackett-Widgeon flying boat, as honourable members know, was constructed by the Royal Australian A i r Force. Ori ginally it had an engine of 230 horsepower. Can the Minister for Defence (Sir Neville Howse) state whether that engine was sufficiently strong to carry-a pilot and four passengers, or was the machine under-powered? If it was under-powered, has it been replaced by a 360-horse-power Rolls-Royce engine? I understand that Flight-Lieutenant Mein tyre and a number of senior officers of Royal Australian Air Force - went to Sydney to hold further tests of the machine. Have those tests been completed 1 If they have, what was the result?",45
161,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,HOBART AUTOMATIC,"Calare-Min ister for Defence) [4.36] - The tests to which the honourable member referred are still proceeding. If he will write to me, I shall he very pleased to furnish him with information relating to those tests when they have heen completed.",46
162,Mr SCULLIN,HOBART AUTOMATIC,"Yarra) [4.37] - Hon orable members of the Opposition appreciate the thanks of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), but remind him that they did not require them. We were working, uot, for the Government, but for Australia and its industries. There would have been no fight on the tariff had it not been that our place as an Opposition was taken by honourable members of the Country party who sit in the corner opposite. Those honourable members not only opposed, but obstructed business, although they went to the country recently under the leadership of the Prime Minister, and, as a part of the Government, pledged to the programme that was put before the country by the right honourable gentleman. The mandate which they received was forgotten by them immediately they took their seats in this House. I can assure the Prime Minister that whenever the Government comes down with a measure that is in the interests of Australia and its development it will find us, not opposing, but cooperating with, it.",46
163,Mr GREGORY,HOBART AUTOMATIC,"Swan) [4.38] - I had no desire to speak, but I cannot refrain from telling the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) that honorablo members of the Country party went to the country at the recent elections in the interests 5f the Empire, of which Australia is a part, and with a keen desire to see returned to this Parliament a party that would introduce legislation in the interests of this country. The tariff was quite a dead letter. We are unablo to congratulate the Government upon the tariff that it has passed. I look forward with some dismay to a period of depression, because I feel that the heavy imposts that are to be put upon certain key industries will make manufacturing in the Australia very difficult. We shall, however, be able to show the people of Australia that this policy of very high protection is ruining the country. I hope that the knowledge which is being gained by the people will lead them to return fo this Parliament in the near future a Government that will exhibit a far greater sense of proportion than has been shown during the last week, and realise that a moderate tariff is of greater advantage to Australia than the heavy duties which have been imposed.",46
164,Mr BRUCE,HOBART AUTOMATIC,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.39] - I regret that my attempt to say a courteous word should have provoked a debate. Fortunately, it did not last very long. It was quite unnecessary for the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) to speak to the motion. The remarks of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) were merely an indication of professional jealousy of the way in which honourable members of the Country party had carried on their obstruction.",46
165,Mr SPEAKER,HOBART AUTOMATIC," Before putting the motion, I express the hope that honourable members have appreciated the improvement in the ventilation of the chamber during the last few weeks. I consider that it has been better than at any previous time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear! Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.40 p.m.",46
