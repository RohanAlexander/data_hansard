2,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Will the Government consider the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the operations of the oil companies in Australia?,15
3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"At the present moment the Government has no intention of appointing a royal commission for the purpose. It has a considerable amount of information concerning the operations of these companies, and if at any time in the future it should be considered desirable to appoint a royal commission, or take any other step in connexiou with their operations, the Government will not hesitate to do so.  ?[uestion of the Prime Minister, and beore doing so, I should like to read two extracts I have here. The first is a quotation from something said by Mr. Wagstaff, general manager for Australasia of the British Imperial Oil Company, in reference to some remarks made by the Minister for Trade and CustomsI t is astonishing that a Federal Minister should engage in a campaign of invective and misrepresentation against important oil organizations doing legitimate business in Australia, and make recklessly false charges without any attempt at justification. The next extract is a quotation from an answer given yesterday by the Prime Minister to a question by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) regarding the supply of petrol to Mr Cobham for his flights in Australia. The Prime Minister is reported to have said thatArrangements had been completed by the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited' at the request of Mr Allan Cobham to provide bim with petrol in Australia. Supplies were sent forward, but as a result of the representations of other oil interests, and an intimation that they would not supply petrol at other points, the arrangements with the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited were cancelled. In view of his answer to the honourable member for Wentworth, does the Prime Minister consider that the actions of the oil interests conform with "" legitimate business,"" and are consistent with the principles of British fair play and honesty 5",15
4,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I can only refer the honourable member to the remarks I made last night, which I think constitute an answer to the question he has addressed to me. CHIL D. ENDOWMENT . for Mr A .

8,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"On the 27th July, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, 1 mentioned a letter received from the Cessnock Shire asking whether anything could be done to assist unemployed migrants in the South Maitland Coalfield.

I should like to know whether he sees his way io give any assistance to the unemployed migrants in the district referred to? ,",16
9,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"After the honourable gentleman brought the matter under my notice, I caused inquiries to be instituted, and hope to-be able to give him an answer in the course of the next two or three days. MURWILLUMBAH RIFLE RANGE.

Baltic pine has been specified because it is said to resist white ants, and was suitable for rifle targets, yet beech, bally gum, and blue fig, which grow in the Tweed distript, have similar attributes. In view of the number of persons employed and unemployed in New South Wales dependent upon the timber industry, and the object lesson to be learned from the exhibition of Australian timbers now to be seen in the Queen's H all , will the Minister make inquiries to see whether a more liberal use of our nativegrown timbers cannot be made?",16

11,Mr LAMBERT,Unknown,"Following upon a question I submitted some little time ago to the Minister for Defence, I ask whether the honourable gentleman can inform the House of the number of returned soldiers suffering from tuberculosis who have applied for war pensions and developed the disease within the last four or five years, and since their return from the war, and - also the number of women and children who are dependent upon these soldiers ?",17
12,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"I think that, if the honourable member will refer to Hansard, he will find that I have given a full answer to his question",17
13,Mr LAMBERT,Unknown,"No . , Sir NEVILLE HOWSE - I think I did so, possibly during the honourable .member's absence. I shall look up the matter, and if I have not already answered the honourable member's question, I shall obtain for him the information he requires.",17
14,Mr LAMBERT,Unknown,"Is it within the power of the Minister for Defence, and also in his capacity as Minister for Health, to prevent men and women from - obtaining old age and invalid pensions under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, which was passed by this House some years ago?",17
15,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,Neithe r the - Defence nor the Health Departments administer the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act. It is administered by the Treasury.,17
16,Mr LAMBERT,Unknown,Then I ask the Treasurer why administrative influences prevent the granting and issuing of old age and invalid pensions to persons who come within the scope of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act passed by this House ?,17
17,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,The Invalid and Old-age Pension Act is being administered strictly in accordance with the law.,17

Is the Treasurer prepared to give effect to that section of the Repatriation Act providing for pensions for the mothers and widows of deceased soldiers?",17
19,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I am not aware ""that cases such as the honourable member has mentioned have occurred; I was referring to the administration of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, which is administered by the Treasurer.

General able to make an announcement respecting the position of country institutes, soldier memorial halls, Sunday schools, and charitable institutions generally in respect of payments to the Performing Rights Association ? Will he say whether the singing of hymns and anthems in churches and Sunday schools render church authorities or singers liable to prosecution?",17
23,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Sectio n 15 of the Copyright Act provides for prosecutions in the case of certain unauthorized performances of works respecting which performing rights exist, where such performances are for private profit: It would be a question of fact in each case whether the performance was for private profit. I should hardly think that the singing of hymns in a church was a performance for private profit. Unless a performance is for private profit there cannot be a prosecution. It should be understood, however, that any public performance, apart altogether from the consideration of the element of private profit, may, if unauthorized, render the performer liable to civil proceedings in the Supreme Court of a State. CANBERRA. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",17
24,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I have with me a copy of the Federal Capital Pioneer, issued 24th July, 1926. If it is a specimen of how this Government is pioneering the Federal Capital Territory, then God help the Commonwealth when the Government finishes its job. That publication this paragraphLIBELLING CANBERRA. Canberra is coming into its own, in vituperative vapourings. The statement Mr Yates, M.H.R., that the Federal Territory would not feed a bandicoot is a standing stigma to hia name for careless handling the truth. I wish to explain that my statement was Slll) ]'BCt ^ not original. At the time. I simply quoted the words of Senator Guthrie, who is man capable of judging the value of try. He has amassed wealth through that knowledge and his capacity to utilize months. country. After he viewed Canberra he said that it was a wild, bleak, country, and would not keep a bandicoot. The paragraph also states, "" We can form Mr Seabrook, Labour's representaState tive from Tasmania."" I leave it to the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. brook) to make it clear that a good man would not make the utterances he has made respecting Canberra. TARIFF BOARD'S REPORT.",18
25,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"In view of the fact that a motion for increased taxation through the Customs has been the House and that section 15 of the Tariff Board Act requires that certain quiries shall be made by the board laid on the table as soon as possible. the Minister see that the Tariff Board's report is placed upon the table of House within the next few days?  answered a similar question recently, 'and if that answer is not satisfactory I ask the honourable member to place his question on the notice-paper and I shall be pleased later to supply him and 'also the House with all the information that I can obtain.

28,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"-The Prime Minister insaid last evening that already several Premiers bave requested that, in order that main road construction should Seabe continuous, certain advances should Labour be made from the Federal Treasury. that I ask the right honourable gentleman whether any such money has been advanced, and, if so, from what vote. Will he also inform the House how many States he will require to sign the proposed agreement before he will ask this put before Parliament to sanction it?",18
29,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Certain State Premiers inexpressed a desire that money should' be and available from the Federal roads grant Will so that in the event of delay in the passage of legislation ratifying the prothe posed agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, there would be no discontinuance of the works put in hand with the aid of last year's federal grant, tinder the Main Roads Development Act £500,000 per annum is available to the States for main road construction for a period of three years, and the Government has agreed to one-twelfth of that amount being spent monthly, pending the passing of legislation to ratify the proposed agreement between the Commonwealth and the States.

32,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,The Prime Minister has refused to make available to honourable members the report of the Public Accounts Committee on the contract made by the Commonwealth Shipping Board for the construction at Cockatoo Island Dockyards of turbo-generators for the Sydney City Council. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether any member of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce has been supplied with a copy of the report?,19
33,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"A letter from the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, giving certain interim information in regard to that contract, was received by my department, but no copies of it have been made available to anybody outside the department.",19
34,Mr LAMBERT,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Why has the Commonwealth Government initiated legal proceedings for an injunction to restrain the Commonwealth Shipping Board from manufacturing certain electrical machinery for the Sydney City Council? ,19
35,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Apparentl y the honourable member misunderstands the action which is now being taken for an injunction to restrain the Commonwealth Shipping Board from proceeding with a particular contract. Certain people in Sydney desired 'to take legal proceedings against the Commonwealth Shipping Board, and were advised by their counsel that they could proceed only by relator action, which involves the use of the name of the Attorney-General. Accordingly, application was made to the Attorney General for permission to use his name.",19
36,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,More than that.,19
37,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"There was nothing more than that. The Attorney-General, having satisfied himself that there was no other method by which the litigants could test their legal rights, and having received a certificate to that effect from their counsel, permitted his name to be t ' used, subject to the usual undertakings in regard to costs. The Government is not concerned in the action in any way.",19

39,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"The Attorney-General is only taking an action which every honourable member will agree is proper. Mr E. RILEY - Hi s duty is to defend the interests of the Commonwealth, and not to take action against a Commonwealth authority.",19
40,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"I am sure that, on reflection, every honourable member will approve of the Attorney-General allowing his name to be used in order to permit certain persons to take action with a view to exercising what they believe to be their legal rights.",19
41,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Las t night the Prime Minister said that if the foreign oil corporations passed the petrol duty on to the consumers, the Commonwealth Government would act as a trader and import oil and sell it direct to the consumers. Is not that declaration inconsistent with the action of the Attorney General in proceeding against the Commonwealth Shipping Board for undertaking a contract for the public?",19
42,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"I said last night that the Government did not propose to engage in trading, but, if necessary, the Commonwealth Oil Refineries would he assisted financially to take any action might be required to preserve the rights of the Australian people. The honourable member is mistaken in thinking that the Commonwealth is taking any action against the Commonwealth Shipping Board. If the honourable member will consult a lawyer as to the nature of relator action, he will be convinced that the Government is not an interested party in these proceedings.",19
43,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,Will the Prime Minister place on the Library table all the correspondence that has passed between his department and the Sydney Chamber confined of Manufactures with regard to the elecdominions trical contract made by the Commonquestions ? wealth Shipping Board? Mr Bruce I shall look into the correspondence and see whether it can made available.,20

46,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH HOUSING,"Is the Minister for Markets and Migration yet in a position to give me a reply to the question I asked him some days ago concerning the critical remarks that judges and magistrates have made recently with regard to undesirable persons with criminal records being admitted to Australia as migrants ?

53,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN WAR DEBT FUNDING,"This matter was raised to by me at the last Imperial Conference. The Government considers that the war debt of Australia should be regarded as part of the whole war debt of the Empire, and that the rate of interest payable to Britain should be the average rate paid by Britain, including, of course, the amount paid to the TJnited States of America. I shall take the matter up again at the forthcoming Imperial Conference.",20

Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) invited honourable members to discuss it freely, so that he would be correctly informed of their This House has never considered prea more important subject, because the for conference may effect an alteration of the the relations between the dominions and It is well known 1st that the right honourable gentleman advocates an alteration of the present relationship to the extent of giving Australia at voice in the Empire's foreign affairs. In Migraorder not to misrepresent his views, I Act, quote the following passages from his report of the speech of yesterday: Prior to the world war, the great dominions had reached virtually an independent status, with full self-governing rights, and controlling their own affairs, and carrying out their own destinies. . . . With the coming of the war there emerged a new realization of the obligations of the dominions as part of the Empire, and of the necessity for the dominions to be consulted with regard to, and to have a voice in the framing of the foreign policy of the Empire from which those obligations arose. . . . With this new status there came a demand to be consulted with regard - to the foreign policy of the Empire, and to have a voice in framing it. . . . Since we avail ourselves of this consultative system to our own entire satisfaction, it follows that we should be prepared to endorse policies about which our advice has been asked, and which we have had a share in shaping. Clearly, the right honourable gentleman supports a change in policy whereby Australia will have a voice in foreign affairs. I join issue with him on that. What he advocates would not be in the best interests of the Empire, or of any of the dominions; and, in saying that, I do not fear that I may be misunderstood, for no one can doubt my loyalty to the Empire. This is a subject on which we should express our opinions with the utmost frankness. The full , right of self government has been conferred upon us, and we have never been subjected to interference by the British Government. Under that policy, this country has made wonderful progress. We have never been compelled to take part in any dispute between Great Britai n and a foreign nation. Why should we depart from a policy that has served us so well? Surely it is not right to claim, as the Prime Minister does, that, because of the great war in which we took part, we must, in future, be more closely identified with questions that concern the nations of Europe. Australia has always been loyal to the Empire, and whenever the Mother Country has been in trouble this dominion has responded readily with its help; but our assistance has always been given of our own free will ; we have never been compelled to participate any war between Great and other nations. If we now change that policy, and adopt that advocated by the Prime Minister, we shall be compelled to fight in any war entered into by Great Britain . persons,, including the Prime Minister, contend that, as we are a component part of the Empire, we ought to take part in every war involving the Empire; but my contention is that the people of this country ought to be allowed, as they have been in the past, to decide whether they will join in any particular war, and whether they will send Australians to fight overseas. W hy should we be involved in every European dispute to which Great Britai n happens to be a party? The Prime Minister spoke of the attitude of some of the dominions on this question, and said he believed that that attitude would be the first step towards bringing about the disintegration of the Empire; but, in my view, nothing would be more likely to disintegrate the Empire than to change the policy that has been in existence since responsible government was given to this country. As soon as we change our policy, and say that whenever trouble arises in Europe Australians must be sent to fight there, and that the people of this country have no right to decide for themselves",23
63,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"The honourable gentleman has misunderstood me. I have repeatedly said that Australia must determine what her effort in any war will be. Mr Charlton"" - I understand that, and in order not to misrepresent the right honourable gentleman, I have already quoted his remarks on that subject. He has always advocated that Australia should have a voice in the Empire's foreign affairs.",24
64,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,Every Australian Government since 1919 has said that.,24
65,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"That may be so; but as I differ from that view, this is the right place to state my opposition to it . I believe that the policy advocated by the Prime Minister will be the first step towards the disintegration of the Empire. My view is entirely opposed to his. If a war arises in Europe, and the Government of Australia is compelled to send soldiers abroad without consulting the people of this country, Australians will tend to lose confidence in the in Empire. Why should we endanger the Britai n foundations of the Empire by making such a change? As the Mother Country has never had reason to complain of the loyalty of Australia, and as Australia has responded whenever the Mother Some Country has been in trouble, why should we make a hard and fast rule, and say to the people, "" You must take part in every war in which Great Britain is in volved ""'?",24
66,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,The Mother Country is not complaining; the change is being demanded by the dominions themselves.,24
67,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Canad a and South Africa are opposed to the change, and they are two important dominions. There is no point in the inter jection of the right honourable member.",24
68,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,There was during the-war.,25
69,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Whateve r have happened during the war, we are now at peace, and the war hysteria has disappeared. It would be a bad thing for the nation if that hysteria had continued We have now, I hope, entered upon a new era; and whatever may have been advocated during the war, we ought to see the necessity, in our calmer moments now, for going no farther in that direction. On this occasion I should like to state the views of the Labour party regarding foreign policy. in the policy speech which I delivered at the last election: The Labour party stands for an Australian foreign policy developed in Australia in the light of day, developed for a people and by a people who are determined to uphold the rights which properly belong to a nation, and honest enough .to admit to at otlier nations have co-equal rights. It will prize "" self-deterthe mination "" not merely for itself, but as the heritage of all men in all lands. That is the attitude adopted by the party on this side, and any other attitude adopted at the Imperial Conference will not represent the Australian Labour party's views in this matter. We represent a very large number of the people of Australia, and I say that if they were asked whether they would prefer to continue under the existing system or to make a change by the appointment of an ambassador in London to represent Australia in conexion with foreign affairs, it would be found that they are against any change in the present system.",25
70,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,I remind the honourable - gentleman that I did not suggest a change from the present basis. I referred only to the necessity for better methods of consultation.,25
71,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"What the right honourable gentleman said last night wasWith this new status there came a demand to he consulted with regard to the foreign policy of the Empire, and to have a voice in framing it . . . since we avail ourselves of this consultative system to our entire satisfaction, it follows that we should be prepared to endorse policies ahout which OUT advice has been asked, and which we have had a share in shaping. The only inference to be drawn from that is that the right honourable gentleman now holds the view which he held three years ago, and believes that we should have, a voice in the foreign affairs of the Empire. He will not be representing the views of honourable members on this side if he takes may up that attitude.",25
72,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,That means that honourable members opposite prefer to leave foreign affairs wholly to British statesmen.,25
73,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Our view is that the present practice has proved very satisfactory since we have had self-government, and we see no reason to depart from it . I may here quote an extract from an article which appeared in the Age of the 27th March, in which the I said statement is madeThe persistently repeated statement that Australia demands a voice in the settlement of each item of Britain's foreign policy is an utter misrepresentation. . . . Were we to be mixed up in all of Great Britain's foreign troubles, largely arising from the business of British investors and manufacturers, causes of difference between the Commonwealth and Mother Country . . . would become numerous and serious enough to threaten Imperial disruption. I agree with that statement. I say that there is that danger. I refer to the matter in order that the Prime Minister may know that in the views to which he has given expression, he does not represent the opinion of the whole of the members of this House, though he may represent the opinion of the majority. In support of the position he has taken up, the Prime Minister stated last night that it was Great Britain's guarantee of Belgium's neutrality that imposed upon her the obligation of entering into the last war, and that we were drawn into it in consequence. That is perfectly true, but it shows exactly the dangers which lie in our being linked up with British foreign policy. It is well known that wben Great Britain entered into the war, even the House of Commons had no knowledge of the existence of the Treaty between Great Britain and Belgium.",25
74,Mr MARRS,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"If we had been represented by an ambassador in London, we should have had knowledge of it .",25
75,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I do not know that we should. The House of Commons had no knowledge of it . When Sir Edward Grey made his statement on the floor of the House of Commons, to show that Great Britain was compelled to take action in connection with the war, half the members of the British Cabinet had no knowledge of the Treaty to which I have referred. If members of the British Cabinet did not know of the existence of such a Treaty, how should we have known of it?",25
76,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,All that I have suggested is that that is a most undesirable position for us to be in .,26
77,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I am glad to hear the right honourable gentleman say that ; but in order to avoid being in that position, he wants Australia to have a voice in the foreign affairs of the Empire.",26
78,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"The Treaty which the honourable gentleman refers to would not be a secret treaty today.""",26
79,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I am not so sure of that. Let me inform the right honourable member that since the arrangement of the Locarno Treaty a number of other treaties have been entered into, and some of them have not been registered with the League of Nations.",26
80,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,Betwee n member nations of the League ?,26
81,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Yes . I intend to deal at greater length with the question of treaties, but at present I am putting the view of the party on this side, so that the Prime Minister may know where we stand - I have dealt with the matter as briefly as possible, because I want to touch upon other questions, and time will not permit me to go into this matter at length. 1 now come to the Locarno Treaty. This is a very important matter, and should receive full consideration at the hands of the House. The Locarno settlement is embodied in seven treaties or conventions, together with a formal statement explanatory of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Of the treaties the most important is the Rhineland security pact between Germany, Great B r it a in, Prance, Belgium, and It a l y . The Treaty does not affect the territorial status quo of the GermanBelgium and German-French frontiers, which are to remain as fixed by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the Versailles Treaty, Germany is not permitted military occupation of territory within 50 miles of the Rhine. That provision ' remains intact. Britain and Italy have guaranteed the Locarno Treaty. A. Treaty has been entered into between Germany and Belgium, and between Germany and France, and Great Britain and Italy have guaranteed that those treaties shall be carried out in their entirety. The Locarno Treaty has been registered with the League of Nations. In this Tespect, it differs from treaties entered into prior to the war. It has been lodged with the League of Nations, and to that extent it may be said that an endeavour has been made to work in harmony with the League. I believe that many other treaties have also been registered with the League. 1 do not wish to debate that aspect of the matter at the moment further than to say that I doubt very much whether the entering of the nations into so many separate treaties will tend to disarmament and the promotion of world peace, even though the treaties have been registered with the League of Nations. It is quite possible that if nations continue to enter into treaties, and nothing is, done by the League to bring about disarmament, we may some day have a repetition of what occurred in 1914, as the result of so many treaties being in existence. The Locarno Treaty provides for arbitration. The machinery of arbitration provided by the Arbitration Treaties comprises, in addition to the Permanent Court of International Justice, a Permanent Conciliation Commission, to which the parties may, if they so choose, resort before carrying the case to the World Court, or some other t r i bunal. The treaties betwen France and Poland, and France and Czechoslovakia, which are identical in terms, make provision, in addition to the guarantee of mutual assistance, for reserving the rights of the signatory Powers as members of the League. These treaties are complementary to the main Treaty to which I have referred in the Locarno Pact. I want now to show what has happened since the Locarno Treaty was agreed to. In the Fortniyfitly Review for February, 1926, I find this statement in regard to Russia, and It deals with questions to which we should give some considerationBefore the first meeting of all the delegates at Locarno, Soviet Russia did what it could to wreck the Conference by putting pressure on Germany. Chicherin went in hot haste to Berlin, 'but. did not succeed in preventing German representatives from attending the Great Conference, though he did obtain a new commercial treaty, which was more favourable to Soviet Russia than to Germany. It must be supposed that this Treaty replaced that of Rapallo, which was concluded in 1922, 'and which provided for the mutual assistance of Germany and Soviet Bussia in all economic undertakings that could contribute to a rapprochement .between them. That shows the attitude of Russia prior to the Locarno meeting.",26
82,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,The treaty referred to is an economic treaty.,27
83,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Yes . Six months after the signing of the Locarno Treaty, Germany entered into a Treaty with Russia. I am sorry that Attorney-General (Mr Latham) has had to go away, because the matter to which I am referring is worthy of his consideration when he gets to Geneva. If Germany has entered into a Treaty with Russia since the Locarno Treaty, guaranteeing her neutrality in the event of war with any other nation, even though it may be a member of the League, I want to know what is to be the real effect of the registration of treaties with the League. """,27
84,Mr WAITT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,Is the honourable member still referring to the Economic Treaty?,27
85,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"No , I am speaking now of a later Treaty. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 19th A p r i l , 1926, sets out the terms .of the agreement, and from the following quotation honourable members will see what it means: Tho text of the Russo-German Treaty has been issued. There are four articles. It begins by stating that both countries will do everything towards maintaining peace, and are convinced that the interests of the Russian and German peoples necessitate intimate co-operation. The articles are:1. The basis of relations between the two Governments remains the Treaty of Rapallo, and they will remain in friendly touch in order to reach an understanding on political and economic questions. 2. Should one of the signatories, despite its peaceful attitude, be attacked by a third Power or several Powers, then the other signatory will - remain neutral throughout the entire conflict. 3. If a coalition of three Powers is formed with the object of imposing an economic or financial boycott against one of the signatories, the other will not join the coalition. 4. The Treaty will last for five years, the expiry of which both parties will keep each other informed in regard to further orientation of their political relations. Since the Locarno Pact that definite treaty was entered into between Germany and Russia. Germany is a potential member, and Russia a non-member, of the League of Nations. Any member of the League that enters into an agreement with a non-membef of the League, undertaking not to take part in the wars of that nation, is acting in direct contravention of the rules of the League of Nations, and disregarding its obligation to assist other members that may be involved in wars in which they are not the aggressors. On this subject, the London Morning Post published the following paragraph : The Treaty may well cause perturbation in the certain European circles, and it is likely to demonstrate the powerlessness of the League of Nations as a check to war. Germany hopes to become a member of the League, and must, therefore, subscribe to the covenant clauses 16 and 17, which provide that all members are bound to support each other in cases ot aggression, whether by a member or a nonmember State. Yet Germany, - by the neutrality clause in the new Treaty, pledged herself in advance to take no action against Russia. Furthermore, under the procedure, a unanimous vote of the Council is necessary before action is taken. Germany is now bound to veto any action against Russia. It is significant that this neutrality clause was included after the demonstration at Geneva and the anxiety of certain members of the League to change the unanimity vote into a simple, or two-thirds, majority. Most of us will agree with that criticism. No country desiring a seat on the Council of the League is justified in making an agreement with Russia. If Germany is admitted to the League, and I hope that she will be-and is to have a seat on the Council, she will be a deciding factor in any dispute that is brought before the League. The decision of the Council must be unanimous, and if Russia at any time were involved in war with a member of the League, Germany, by opposing the general wish of the Council, could facilitate Russia's operations. We debated this subject in the House, and the Labour party contended that the unanimity provision was unfair. I myself fluctuated in my views, because of certain recent happenings respecting the League itself. I did think of suggesting that a three-quarters majority should be sufficient for a decision of the Council, but even that before would entail grave danger. The Government has agreed to the unanimity provision. Once Germany is admitted to the League she will be in a position to decide whether any action shall be taken by the League in the event of war occurring between any of its members and Russia.",27
86,Mr HUGHES,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"The Locarno Pact does not take effect until Germany has become a member of the League, and when that happens all her treaties will be subject to the rules of the League, and will be admitted only if compatible with the rules of the League. MTCHAELTON - I am afraid that the right honourable gentleman is wrong in his view. An y treaty entered into with members of the League would certainly be subject to the rules of the League; but a treaty between a member and a non-member of the League could not be subject to the rules of the League. We have either to refuse Germany admittance to the League, and a seat on the Council, or else she must abrogate her Treaty with Russia. We must not forget that it was entered into six monthsafter the Locarno conference, at which it was decided that Germany should apply for admission to the League.",27
87,Mr MARRS,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Perhaps Germany, - in making the Treaty, had some idea of the attitude that Brazil intended to adopt.",28
88,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I know nothing about that. We have to be very careful, and we should know exactly where these treaties are leading us. It may be that the numerous treaties that are being registered with the League will k ill whatever hope we bave of the League being an instrument to bring about disarmament and world's peace.",28
89,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,That part of the League is merely a publicity bureau.,28
90,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"It seems to be so at the moment. Take the position of Italy, a signatory to the Locarno Treaty. The - Melbourne 'Herald of the 29th December, 1925, published the following paragraph:Mussolini has made a speech that reeks of war. "" We are creating the third Italy,"" he told his followers on the Italian Armistice Day, "" and it must be greater than its predecessors. We must create it with 'brains and brawn, and if necessary with Wood. We must have an efficient navy, a powerful army, and air force, and above all we must keep alive the war spirit."" Strange words, these, for a man who had just ipreviously signed the Locarno agreement, and joined in the fervent wishes for a new spirit of friendship in Europe. The fact is that Mussolini candidly ruling by force is suffering from a war complex. His country has a teeming populatipn, amounting, it is said, to a surplus of over half a million people a year. Italy is mighty in man power, but poor in resources. It is not a rich country either in agriculture or manufacture, when compared with its population. But it is growing every year. And its natural outlets are closed. Some time ago, Mussolini declared that only three solutions could be found for Italy's surplus millions-birt h control, immigration, and a war of conquest. The first the Duce dismissed as totally opposed to Italian ideals. The solution must 'be either immigration or war. He pointed out that most of the other nations whose lands are suitable for absorbing Italy's surplus population had closed their doors to her, and he said very definitely that unless these doors were opened then Italy was left with only the solution of war. That is the attitude taken up by a member of the League of Nations, one of the guarantors under the Locarno Treaty.",28
91,Mr HUGHES,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,How does that bear on the Locarno Pact ? Does it increase our liabilities under it?,28
92,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"It goes to show that It a l y has little respect for the Treaty into which it has entered. We can place no confidence in a statesman who signs the Locarno Treaty and immediately afterwards threatens war. The Locarno Treaty has been the means of breeding numerous treaties to which no publicity has been given. Treaties have been enteredinto between Germany and Russia and between Turkey and Russia. The Melbourne Herald of' the 28th December, 1925, published this statementLondon, 27th December - The Turco-Bussian Treaty contains a secret clause guaranteeing Soviet support in the event of war. (Published in the Times.) London, 27th December - The Soviet agitation against the Locarno spirit flared up again in connection with the treaty between Turkey and the Soviet, which is held, says the Biga correspondent of the Times, to have entirely frustrated Britain's designs to create a near eastern Locarno, because it prohibits Turkey's entrance. "" A Turkeyless Locarno in the Near East is unthinkable,"" declares the - Hussian newspaper, Issvestia, in mentioning the possir bility of a Persian-Turko-Soviet alliance. Germany and Russia have entered into a treaty that will tend to prevent peace in Eastern Europe for many years to come. A treaty has also been entered into between Roumania and Poland, both of which nations are members of the League. On this subject the Argus of the 21st June, 1926, published the following paragraph:A surprise announcement was made at a conference of the Little Entente (Czechoslovakia, Roumania, and Jugoslavia) that Roumania had concluded a treaty of defence with Poland for mutual protection of the frontiers of Poland and Bessarabia against Soviet aggression. The Czecho-sTovakian and Jugoslavian Ministers took cognizance of the treaty, but reserved their judgment. That Treaty has been entered into between two members of the League.",28
93,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"It has probably, by now, been registered with the League.",28
94,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"That may he so. the If the nations are to enter into specific treaties, to be registered with the League of Nations itself, what hope have we its future?",29
95,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,We cannot prevent treaties. The nations have been entering into them for hundreds of years.,29
96,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,I admit that we cannot prevent them. The League should immediately call a conference of all the nations. Mr MARRS.:-That is why I suggested that America should be admitted to the League.,29
97,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I agree with the honourable member. Unless all the nations meet in conference to arrive at some common basis of bringing about disarmament, we shall achieve nothing. The making of numerous treaties between the nations, which are simply registered with the League in conformity with the Covenant, brings us no nearer to a world's peace.",29
98,Mr MANN,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,Are not most treaties made with a view to preserving peace ?,29
99,Mr CHAELTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"The same thing was said before the war. It has always been contended that treaties are entered into for purposes, not of offence, but of defence, and the preservation of peace, and yet the result has been war. History continues to repeat itself.",29
100,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"The honourable member will admit that the element of reference to arbitration has been introduced into post-war treaties, and that they must, be registered.",29
101,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I admit that; but even in the past, treaties that provided for arbitration in the event of disputes, did not prevent war. Whenever*the subject of arbitration has been discussed, some difference of opinion has existed between the League members themselves, and, as a result, nothing has been achieved. That is the whole trouble. Seven years have passed since the Covenant was entered into, and can anybody say that we are nearer disarmament and world's peace than we were before the war ? Is it not a fact that the armaments of the world are greater today than before the war, and that every nation is, making further preparations for war? Lloyd George, who should be an authority on this subject, considering great part that he played in the war, after referring to the Treaty entered into betwen Germany and Russia, according for to the Melbourne Herald of the 17th June last, saidThe Russo-Germanic Treaty is causing much fluster, and not a little alarm, among the Locarnist Nations. There is no use disguising the fact that it is a formidable document. Its actual phrasing is more ominous than the various disarming communiques issued from Berlin before its 'publication would have led us to expect. For instance, there is a sentence at the beginning which dominates the agreement, and indicates its spirit. It is the preamble which declares that the parties are inspired "" by the conviction that the interest of the German people, and of the people of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics demands that cooperation between them shall be continuous and mutually trusting."" This is repeated and emphasized in Article 1 by an agreement to "" remain in friendly touch with one another in order to promote an understanding."" The words are startling in their significance. No wonder eyebrows are lifted pretty high and that shoulders are being jerked up violently. The foolish manoeuvres which brought the League of Nations into such contempt at the last meeting of its Assembly, is directly responsible for the conclusion of this momentous Treaty. Negotiations had been dawdling along in leisurely fashion for many months between Moscow and Berlin. But the more eager the former were for an arrangement, the more apathetic and indifferent 'became the latter. Locarno turned the face of Germany towards the West. Geneva swung it round sharply to the East. On the face of it, the agreement is a fresh guarantee of peace. That is the very reason why Europe distrusts it. All these Pacts which have in the past provoked war ostentatiously proclaimed that their main purpose was to ensure peace amongst nations. The Belgian Treaty and the Franco-Russian Alliance, the Triple Alliance between Germany, Austria, and Italy, and the Anglo-French Entente, were all declared at the time to be so many devices to ensure the permanence and security of European peace. Assurances were always given to that effect to other nations, but, nevertheless, between them they landed the world in the bloodiest war that ever stained its surface. That statement is condemnatory of the practice of entering into separate treaties, and it is quite sufficient to cause us to be very careful in our attitude towards the Locarno Pact. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister say last night that he would not ratify the Locarno Treaty until he had reported to this House. There was a little misapprehension on that point. I , like the right honourable member for Balaclava, was under the impression that the Prime Minister had stated that the Commonwealth had agreed to the Locarno Treaty. I new understand from the Prime Minister that that is not so; the Commonwealth Government has merely been kept informed by the I m perial Government of all proceedings in relation to the Treaty. Mr ""WATT - And approval of it has not been expressed by the Commonwealth Government.",29
102,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"That is so. The Commonwealth would not be justified in endorsing the Treaty, and so becoming a party to it . This country was not consulted in regard to it , and clause 9, which was inserted at the instance of the British Government, shows clearly that there is no obligation on the dominions to endorse it. Although the Commonwealth Government has been kept informed of what was happening, the fact stands out that the British Government does not desire to compel any of the dominions to be embroiled in troubles arising; out of treaties with foreign nations. We have complete liberty of action in regard to these matters. It is well known that South Africa and Canada will not subscribe to the Locarno Treaty, and Australia would be well advised to adopt the same attitude. If at any time a crisis made it necessary for Australia to play its part alongside the Motherland, as it has done in the past, T have not the slightest doubt what the attitude of this country would be. But that is no reason wh-"" we should become a party to treaties relating entirely to European affairs. Australia cannot afford to become embroiled in the concerns of Europe. Our people should be free to work out their destinv in their own way. Under the Constitution handed down to us by the British Crown, Australia has progressed and prospered; it is one of the best countries in the world, and having done so well under the existing arrangement, it is undesirable to make an important change that might in years to come involve us in trouble, possibly with the Mother Country. This Parliament should have absolute liberty to act as it thinks fit at any time and k i any circumstances. The Prime Minister said that he wa3 favourable to the establishment of a naval base at Singapore. Owing to a change of government in the TJnited Kingdom that work was not proceeded with, and the Commonwealth Government committed Austraha to a defence programme, involving as big a financial burden as the country can carry. Now the Singapore project is to be revived, and notwithstanding the defence programme upon which the Government is engaged, the Prime Minister is prepared to consider favourably the granting of a sum of money towards the cost of establishing that base. On a previous occasion I stated my opposition to that scheme, and nothing has happened since to change my views. Acknowledged authorities upon naval matters have adopted the same attitude, as the following newspaper extracts show:[Age, 17th October, 1923.] London, 16th October, 1923. Arguing on the assumption that battleships are useless against modern defensive weapons like airships, aeroplanes, mines, torpedoes, and submarines, Admiral Sir Percy Scott, addressing the Australian Natives' Association at the Royal Colonial Institute today, described the Singapore Base as "" a wicked scheme."" He expressed the opinion that the dominions should not contribute a penny towards it. Rather they should spend their money on modern defence methods. [Melbourne Herald, 26th March, 1924.] SMUTS SUPFOBTS MACDONALD. The dominions correspondence regarding Singapore has been published. General J. C. Smuts, Prime Minister of South Africa, expressed whole-hearted agreement with the Government's policy. He declared that the proposed Base would be out of keeping with the spirit of the Washington agreement. He sincerely trusted that Mr. Bruce, Prime Minister of Australia, and Mr. Massey, Prime Minister of New Zealand, would acquiesce, because no promise of real security for them was contained in the Singapore proposals, as European troubles would .probably synchronize with any future tension in the Pacific, and make it out of the question to move the Navy to Singapore. [Age, 3Qth January, 1925.] London, 29th January, 1925. In a special article published in the Daily Chronicle, Commander Kenwortliv, Liberal M.P., affirms that the Singapore project was never properly examined on strategical grounds, either here or in Australia. Were this done, he felt sure the public would agree that better value could be obtained for the expenditure on the existing dockyard at Sydney than on a "" white elephant"" at Singapore. [Age, 30th March, 1925.] London, 27th March, 1925. Mr Toyo Hikokagawa, the Japanese Labour leader, and editor of the Japanese Labour News, has arrived in London in the course of a world tour. In an interview, Mr Hikokagawa said he wondered why Great Britain, after twenty years, had begun to doubt Japan's friendship. He w'as convinced that the Singapore .Base was directed against Japan, whose intentions were entirely pacific. Japan was trusting to the League of Nations, and she still had faith. I agree with the contention that the construction of a base at Singapore is not in keeping with the, spirit of the Washington Conference. When that gathering decided that the signatory countries should destroy their battleships, nobody contemplated that all of them would embark on apolicy of increased cruiser construction. But America, France, Great Britain, Japan, and Australia are strengthening their ""cruiser fleets. This policy, taken in conjunction with the proposal to establish a naval base at Singapore, indicates that, instead of promoting the peace of the world by disarmament, the nations are preparing for further wars. It is idle to say that armaments are an assurance of peace; history has proved that this policy usually culminates in war. I turn now to the agenda for-the Economic Conference. Overseas settlement will be one of the most important subjects discussed at that gathering. I wish to make clear to the House and the country that the Labour party is not opposed to immigration, but it does not believe in bringing people here without having previously prepared for their reception. If employment can be found for more people, we are justified in bringing migrants to Australia; but at the present time people are being brought from abroad to swell the ranks of the unemployed. I, personally, approved of the proposal of the Government to create a development and migration commission to inquire into the possibilities of land settlement and industrial development, with a view to determining the country's capacity to absorb more population. But until that commission has completed its investigations, and has shown clearly that the country can. find profitable employment for more people, it is not right to encourage immigration. Not only are many, of the new arrivals unemployed, but statements which have been published indicate that the selection of migrants at the other end of the world Mr Charlton. is careless. I quote this paragraph from the Melbourne Herald of 30th July lastASSISTED MIGRANTS. MAST CRIMINALS AMONG THEM, SAYS EXPERT. Seventeen Prisoners Sentenced. Three assisted immigrants-on e with a bad record in the United Kingdom-were among the seventeen prisoners sentenced by Mr Justice Schutt in the Criminal Court today. An official of the Crown Law Department said there had been an alarming increase in the number of assisted immigrants arrested in Victoria for housebreaking, larceny, and other offences. Menof that class are not wanted in Australia. If we are to carry out an immigration policy, let us take care that we bring here men and women who will become reputable citizens. We should not bring criminals to this country.",30
103,Mr MARRS,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,The seven expert safebreakers who were arrested in Sydney last week are foreigners.,31
104,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Yes . Crime generally is on the increase in Australia; I do not say that that is entirely due to the. immigrants, but facts such as those contained in the newspaper paragraph I quoted, indicate the need for greater care in the selection of migrants. I hope that, at the Economic Conference, the Prime Minister will explain that Australia is appointingexperts to take stock of its economic resources and requirements, and that arrangements will be made for a large influx of migrants only after a scheme has been completed for their absorption. I am assured by. letters and telegrams from my own district, that hundreds of newcomers there are out of employment and are dependent upon relief works on the roads.",31
105,Mr MARRS,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,Are they assisted migrants ?,31
106,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I think most of them were nominated.  to Australia in accordance with nominations, and requisitions by the State Governments.",31
107,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I am not blaming the Commonwealth Government, but some action must be taken to prevent the influx of people for whom no employment can be found. There is no advantage in increasing our population, if many of the newcomers are to become a charge on the States. Inter-imperial trade is another important subject to be dealt with by the Economic Conference; and I hope that the Australian representatives will urge Great Britain to do a little more than has been done in the past to increase the consumption of our products. I know that I may be charged with asking too much of the people of Great Britain who, in many respects, are worse off than the Australian people. But if this country is to absorb Great Britain's excess population it is fair that the Mother Country should, in turn, arrange that as large a proportion as possible of its imported requirements should be purchased from the dominions, and so give increased employment to its own people who have settled there. At the present time enormous quantities of dried fruits and other products are imported into Great Britain', mainly from countries outside the Empire. In Australia, thousands of returned soldiers have been settled upon the land; many of those who are engaged in the dried fruits industry are unable to make a living. In the Mildura district alone 20,000 people are dependent upon that industry, and the Commonwealth is spending a lot of money on the Biver Murray Waters Scheme. When this is completed, and people are settled on the new irrigation areas, we shall have to find markets for their products.",31
108,Mr MASKS,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"The solution of problem is, to some extent, the establishment of cool stores, and the increasing of our storage facilities generally.",32
109,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"That is so. I advocated that in my policy speech during the last election. In a recent issue of the London Times, Mr Amery, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, said that Australian wages were Is. 9d. an hour, whereas the Greeks receive only 3d. an hour. He pointed out that the 1925 preference was .7s. a cwt. for sultanas and raisins, and 2s. a cwt, for currants; and that Great Britain derived her main supply of these commodities from Greece, the TJnited States of America, Turkey, Spain, Australia, and South Africa. He went on to say that in Turkey each person who depended on the dried-fruit industry for a living bought only 8d. or 9d. worth of British goods per head per annum; whereas similar figures for the TJnited States of America were 9s. 2d.; for Spain, l is . ; for Greece, 18s. 8d.; and for Australia, £10 3s. Surely these figures indicate that there are substantial reasons why the sale of Australian dried fruits should be pushed on the English market. I know that some steps have been taken to do this, but a good deal more could be done in the same direction. The same argument might be used in regard to Australian meat. A newspaper cable from London, dated 29th July, appearing in the Argus of the 31st July last, contains the report of an interesting speech by Mr. J. H . Thomas, who was Secretary for State for Dominion Affairs in the British Labour Cabinet. Mr Thomas is reported as follows: If within the British commonwealth of nations we could encourage aud develop trade, it was our bounden duty to do so. Nothing was more discouraging than to hear of the Dominion people talk of being robbed. An Australian deputation told him that they were getting 4Jd. a pound for meat which was sold at Smithfield for Is. 8d. and Is. lOd. The Government should require to be given .an authoritative explanation of such a thing. That is a matter that could be well submitted to the Economic Conference for consideration. Surely no - one will argue that there can be any justification for charging the British people three or four times as much for the Australian meat they buy as the Australian producers receive for it. An exhaustive investigation the should be made into the prices charged by the middle-men who handle our produce in England. Matters of that kind could be discussed with advantage to both Great Britain and Australia, and I trust that the Prime Minister, and whoever accompanies him, will do their utmost along these lines. I do not know whether the Minister for Markets and Migration  Prime Minister, but if he were chosen, I should congratulate him. It would be fitting for him to go. Another matter which the conference could profitably consider is ways and means of bringing about a thorough cooperation between Great Britain and her dominions in regard to research work. We have recently reorganized our Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and I hope that it will be able to do valuable work for the country. Undoubtedly, there is scope for it to do so. While I was in London, I visited, in company with Sir Joseph Cook and Mr. Gepp, the fuel research station at Greention wich, where experiments were being made in carbonizing coal and extracting oil. was much interested in all that I saw. were informed that a ton of coal, under the process then in operation, would from fifteen to eighteen gallons of oil, as introduced, well as a number of valuable by-products. consider Experiments were also being made blending different coals for coking and persons steam purposes, and it was mentioned to me that by mixing different coals, a higher speed could be obtained by our steamships. Although, at that stage, comqualification of twenty years. mercial success had not been achieved in some of the operations, investigations along those lines are highly desirable. But we should secure as much Empire coto operation in this matter as possible. There should be no reason, for instance, for us to carry out in Australia experishould ments which are similar to those being conducted in Great Britain . It would probably be advantageous also if we could sions exchange research officers.",32
110,Mr MARRS,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,They are anxious in England to have some of our men over of the conference. there.,33
111,Mr CHARLTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"It would be a good thing in the interests of the respecbe tive countries, and would undoubtedly tend to prevent overlapping. These also are matters which could be well discussed at the conference. The Prime Minister, in his address yesfrom defence matters, terday, said nothing about the item honourable on the agenda-paper which refers of to - the liability of State enterprises report to taxation. Tbis subject was on to accept the agenda-paper of the Imperial Conference, but when I inquired from the Prime Minister what i the replied that he believed it referred shipping. I should like some further i formation on it . If any suggestion is made that State enterprises shall be jected to taxation, I sincerely trust that the Prime Minister will entirely disagree with it .",33
112,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,It has nothing to do with the Imperial Conference. That line on the agenda-paper must refer only to shipping.,33
113,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,And it does not seem get much further forward.,33
114,Mr CHAELTON,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I trust that it w not if that is what it means. I am sorry that there is no indication on the agenda-paper that any consideradiscussion will be given to evolving a measure of reciprocity between the various I m I perial dominions with regard to widows, ""We old-age and invalid pensions; but, as the Prime'Minister has said that matters that yield are not among the agenda may be I trust that he will bringingthis forward. It in is regrettable to me that many aged who have been in the Commonwealth for ten, fifteen, or even much eighteen years, are denied the pension because they have not the residential In many cases, these persons have served the Empire well in Australia as well as in the Home Land, and had they remained . in England they would have been entitled a pension. I can see no great difficulty in evolving a reciprocal plan to meet their cases. It is hard that some of them have to suffer severely on account of their inability either to work or to secure the pension. For invalid penthe residential qualification is only five years. I urge the Prime Minister to bring tbese matters under the notice I wish the right honourable gentleman well on his mission, and. trust that he will able to report to Parliament, subsequently, that useful work has been accomplished. But when he makes his report to honourable members next year, I urge him to keep economic matters separate and to give members an opportunity voting on one part of the without having necessarily the whole of it . When previous the last report was made, the right honourable gentleman submitted the defence promeant, posals and economic matters in one to motion, with the result that honourable n - members of the Labour party, being opposed to the defence proposals submitted, subhad also to vote against the imperial preference proposals, notwithstanding that they were heartily in accord with them. I trust that they will not be placed in a similar position when the next report is submitted.",33
115,Mr HUGHES,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"No r t h Sydney) [4.15]. to As I do not intend to address the House at great length, I shall confine my rei l l marks to the general principles underlying inter-empire relations, and to the more important questions set down for at the Conference. These Conferences axe now a recognized instrumentality of Empire government, and although measured by years, they are but things of yesterday; they are an integral part of its structure, and essential to the maintenance to the two great principles upon which it rests-the autonomy of the parts, and the unity of the whole. At these conferences, representatives of the Empire sit the council table on a of absolute equality. The Minister of the TJnited Kingdom is in the chair ex officio, but he is merely the first amongst his equals. In the discussions that take place this fact is emphasized over and over again. We are speaking of the governance of the British Empire, and the word "" Empire"" is grotesquely inappropriate league of British nations to which it is applied; but I use it in the sense in which it is understood by us. The Conference, although essential to Empire government, is not by any means a perfect instrumentality, and certainly will never enable us to solve all our problems of Empire government. Most of these problems, as a matter of fact, are not capable of solution in the ordinary sense of the word. They arise f the geographical circumstances of the Empire. It can easily be understood that government in a country like Holland, or even Great Britain , is a different thing from government in the United States of America, or in Australia. The ordinary difficulties and problems of governments are interrupted, and new ones created by the extent of territory over which it is exercised. Many of the difficulties which face Imperial Conferences arise in consequence of the vast area over which the various governments of the Empire exercise sway. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition both referred to the approaching Conference as one of extraordinary importance, and, indeed, of more vital importance than any that have preceded it . That is a quite natural and perhaps excusable exaggeration of the position. The reasons given do not support the contention. The Leader of the Opposition observed that this Conference may completely change the status of the different parts of the Empire and their relations inter se. an opinion rests upon a complete misapprehension of the position. The Conference can do no such thing, and if it could do so, I should most emphatically object to it making the attempt. The reason why it cannot do so is plain. As the right honourable the Prime Minister pointed out yesterday afternoon, the nations which make up the British Commonwealth are absolutely free and, in all round but name, independent. There is footing literally nothing that they cannot do Prime save that which is physically impossible. Whatever limitations exist arise out of their geographical and other circumstances, or are imposed of their own free will . This Parliament, which is a typical parliament, has the power- I speak not of constitutional fictions, but of realities-to do everything to the that a sovereign parliament can do. It can even sever its connection with the Empire; although it cannot do so under the terms of its constitution. The British Parliament, in its turn, is literally a sovereign parliament. It can dethrone the King, and place any other person in his place. It can dismember the Empire. It does not do those things, but it has the power to.do them. The component parts of the Empire are free nations; nothing r o m can give them greater freedom than they now have. Nothing that the Imperial Conference can do, and nothing that any collective body of men can do, will endow this Parliament with greater power than it has at this moment. So when we talk of altering the status of the dominions, there is only one way in which we can alter it-by diminishing their power, by imposing limitations upon them. Any attempt to l i m it our powers under what is called the Constitution-and there is actually no snch thing-o r to reduce our powers to writing, will inevitably fetter our limbs. As things are, we can do everything necessary to protect and preserve our interests, no matter how our circumstances change. It .is impossible to conceive what powers we shall require in 10 or 50 years' time. It is plain enough that the eminent men who drafted the Constitution which created this Parliament, and who acted with wisdom and foresight, saw "" as through a glass darkly."" They did not know what powers we should require in 25 years' time. All written constitutions are necessarily exSuch posed to these dangers. The Constitution of England does not exist, save in the hearts, minds, and traditions of people. Since we have established this Parliament, there have been revolutions in England, and they have proceeded conare stitutionally, because, there being no stitutional limitations, the people can do dom. as they please. It was proposed at last two Imperial Conferences that attended to reduce what is called the stitution of the Empire to writing. I opposed that proposal, and it went no further. The Minister admitted yesterday, that no limitations are imposed upon us; and that being so, it is clear that the Imperial Conference can give us nothing more, although it can take away that which have. I am irrevocably opposed to any attempt to define our powers. I am tent merely to declare that they are out limits. Anything that a free people demands is, and must be, within their of power-that is the Constitution of Ausof tralia; and, what is more, it is the stitution of every self-governing minion. The people of a self-governing dominion may declare, and seek to attain, by what are called constitutional meansthat is to say, by peaceful, legal means - whateve r they choose. I turn from that aspect of the subject to consider the position of the Empire I see it. I have already stated that there are two principles which, though inconpire sistent, yet run side by side. One these is autonomy, the other is unity; and, in the nature of things, - neither them can be pushed beyond a certain point, except to the exclusion or limitagranite tion of the other. It has been the happy, the unique experience of this commoncumstances wealth of nations to be able to attain complete autonomy and yet achieve unity the like of which the world has previously seen. There never have been, in ancient or modern times, nations so with that of free as we are, nor has there ever group of people so united under the she is able to look to stress of circumstances. The war, which found us united, left us still more united; the severe solvent of war ing, failed to disintegrate us; we were one and we remained so. The strength this Empire is unity. The honourable Leader of the Opposition does, not to understand that fact, nor does he preciate the privileges and responsibilities Mr Hughes. of the free governments which are part of the this great Empire. Pree men do not shirk their responsibilities. The badge of freedom which they wear shows that they prepared to accept their responsibiliconties and to uphold their claim to freeUnity requires us to accept rethe sponsibilities, not to endeavour to I put them on to others. One of our Conresponsibilities is that of defence. I have said that the Empire is united, or it is nothing; it is either a thing, or a Prime figment. If , as I believe, it is a living force, and the greatest force in the world today for the preservation of peace and the advancement of civilization, it is surely worth preserving. I would imwv press upon honourable members that, arbitration or no arbitration, League of conNations or no League of Nations, this withEmpire of ours must be preserved in the interest not merely of ourselves-althoug h its preservation is vital to us-bu t also civilization. We have to face the facts life, and war-is now, as it has always conbeen, possible. Just as surely as death dowill overtake us all, so will war come again to the world. When the conference comes to consider the question of defence, the principle that ought to be adopted is that although local defence, as the right lionorable gentleman said last night, in his severely restricted interpretation of as the term, is the proper business of each of the dominions, the defence of the Emis the business of all. I am sorry of tc say that previous conferences have not accepted or applied that principle; of but until it is applied, the safety and unity of this Empire does not rest en rock. Some of the dominions seem to imagine that, because their cirare such that danger seems to be completely walled off, they are freo a to regard the clangers of others comnot placently. Canada is happily situated. Her frontier for 4,000 miles marches the great Republic been a of the United States of America; the east, the west, and the south, and say that war firmly cannot come near her. Humanly speakshe is as safe as it is possible for a nation to be. But her present positionof although some Canadians do not seem to the recognize the fact-is due to her memseem bership of the British Empire. In my apopinion Canada's duty, as a part of this Empire, is to contribute on a population basis to the defence of the Empire, and what applies to Canada applies to us and to every other part of the Empire. That brings me to the question of the Singapore Naval Base. The honourable the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to that undertaking, and he deplores that the Treaty of Washington, which but yesterday was in all men's mouths, and was welcomed as marking the beginning of a new era, has ushered in a period of increased activity in naval shipbuilding. Whether that is true or not is not material, but if it be so, what of it? We have to face the facts. I am one of those who are prepared always to throw down their arms-bu t not first. When I see that other men are armed to the teeth, I am not such a trustful fool as to throw down my sword and buckler, and to bare my breast to the envenomed darts of a world in arms. Let the Leader of the Opposition, therefore, direct his remarks to the nations at large. When they abate their keen desire to be prepared for the worse, we shall be ready to do the same. We are not swashbucklers. Our withers are unwrung, and so are those of Britain. At the Washington Conference Britain was asked to do a hard thing, and she did it ; and we were asked to do a hard thing,and we did it. But we are the guardians of a great house with an open door; we are surrounded by a thousand million people, and are, therefore, entitled to take at least those ordinary precautions which a prudent citizen would take fbr his own protection. As none will deny we have a right to defend ourselves, the question arises, how shall we best do it? We are a part of the Empire, and 'by nomeans atour command can we defend ourselves either now or within the next quarter of a century. Happily for us we are a member of a league of nations-no t a league on paper, but a league in fact, which has been through the fire of trial. We are able to call to our friends in that league, and one of them, Britain, has taken the lead, as she has always done, although her obligations in this particular case are no greater than ours. It is true that she has great possessions, but they are not vital to her existence as is the safety of Australia to ours. What can a man lose more than his life? If we wish to retain this country, we surely ought to be willing to make such arrangements as will, under ordinary circumstances, give us reasonable prospects of retaining it. Of the strategic value of Singapore- I speak of the principle involved and not of the site- I shall say no more than that it was my lot to take part in the original discussions on the selection of this base, and it was sufficient for me, as 1I have said before, that two men like Admiral Jellicoe and Admiral Beatty should agree upon the matter. I was prepared to accept their opinion. I know that there are men of some eminence who have criticized the selection of Singapore; but I am content to accept the advice of those upon whose shoulders rested the responsibility for the greatest navy the world has ever seen during the greatest war the world has ever known. Accepting the facts that Australia is a member of the Empire; that the maintenance of the Empire is desirable, and that it has supported and will support us in our hour of trial; and that Singapore is necess.ary for the protection of Australia, India, and the Eastern possessions of the Empire, we have to consider what our contribution ought to be. That is a matter the Government must consider, and it is the duty of the Prime Minister not only to speak of what we are able to do, but to protest emphatically against any part of the Empire evading its proper responsibilities in this matter. The mere fact that we happen to guard the portcullis does not absolve from responsibility those who are situated away in the hinterland. Itwould be absurd to contend that all responsibility should fall ' upon us, while those with whom we fought shoulder to shoulder in the Great War, who glory in the fact that they, too, are under the banner of Empire, should, merely because of their happy geographical circumstances, for the time being, "" pass by on the other side."" My opinion is that the proper basis of naval .defence of the Empire is a fair per capita levy on the white populations of its various parts. I do not deny that Great Britain may not fairly be asked to pay more than the dominions because she has other possessions overseas. I come now to the Locarno Pact. The Leader of the Opposition raised a number of questions connected with the treaties into which Germany and other nations have entered prior to or' since the signing of the Locarno I am not going into that matter at all. Without looking closely into those treaties, I could not say what they contain; but I make bold to say that they will not increase our liabilities or risks under the Locarno Treaty. With that I am content. As to the honourable gentleman's fear lest out of a multitude of treaties for the promotion of peace there should come war, I have no more to say than that the alternative to a multitude treaties is one treaty which would cover all mankind. We know that the law of life is evolution. If we are not to wait until some pretentious protocol, still more imposing and glittering than the last, spreads its white wings over the whole world; we must proceed treaty by treaty. I venture to say that the Treaty Germany, France, Belgium, italy and Great Britain, called the Treaty of Locarno, ought to be ratified. represents a distinct advance. fectly true that the possibility of war is everywhere. The Treaty between many and Russia, which has been referred to, may lead to war some day. economic treaty may lead to war, and so may any other treaty. But we have to deal with the facts as they are; and when we remember the traditional attitude of those age-old enemies, the German and the Frenchman, that revenge has burned in their very hearts, and that each has prayed that the day may come when he can plant his dagger in the other's heart; when, knowing these things, we learn that these people, have made an arrangement not to go to war with each other, I say that that enormously improves the position of the world, and has removed to a distance the dark prospect of immediate war. No doubt the Locarno Treaty will impose certain obligations upon The Leader of the Opposition about peace as though it could be bought without price. It cannot. What did the Protocol of the League of Nations upon? It rested upon force, which was to be applied by the various nations which subscribed to it. There was behind the promise of peace the certainty of armed force ready to batter into insensibility said any nation that dared to break that peace. There is no other way of ensuring peace. You must either actually batter disturber into insensibility, or by a display of overwhelming force convince him Mr Hughes. Treaty. that resistance is hopeless, so that he submits as a man submits to a policeman, knowing that it is useless to resist. It is within the memory of honourable members that a year or two ago, in the very street in which this building stands, within an hour or two after the police of this city had refused duty, we saw how little some of our citizens would be law abiding without compulsion. When we sheathe the sword or beat it into a ploughof share, unless others have done it before us, we must look for trouble. Treaties of peace are useless without some sanction-som e force-behin d them. I am in favour of the Locarno Pact, because it deals with a present evil. It removes the greatest danger to the peace of Europe, and we know that that which disturbs between Europe must disturb Britain, and, therefore, imperil our own peace. This brings me to the ratificaIt tion by this Parliament of the It is per- Locarno Treaty. I am sorry that the Prime Minister is not gong to submit the Ger- Treaty to this Parliament for its ratification at the present time. Bus arguments An against that course were inconclusive, his reasoning most unconvincing. I understand that he regards the Treaty as a good one, and approves of it , and that this Parliament is to be asked some day to r at if y it . Why not now? If it is a good treaty, it ought to be ratified by us. There is nothing to be gained by postponing the submission of it to this Parliament. It has been contended that, because other dominions have adopted a hostile attitude towards the Treaty, the discussion at the I m perial Conference would be less free if this Parliament now took any action to r at if y the Treaty. That is a counsel of despair. We believe in unity, and we us. approve the Treaty. Great B r it a in has speaks signed it ; and though we are not required to do so, if we refrain from its ratification because some other part of the Empire rest opposes it , those who do so may work for the disintegration of the Empire as they please, whilst those who work for unity have their hands tied. The Prime Minister overstated the position when he that the Empire is entirely B r it is h; it is controlled by men of that race, but it is not entirely the British. I speak not at all of its coloured population, but of what is notorious; that there are 2,500,000 French-Canadians who are certainly not predisposed towards England, and that in the Union of South Africa nearly half the white population is Dutch. We .who believe in the Empire ought to emphasize its value by doing what we can tq ensure united action whenever we have the opportunity. Putting that aside, I ask the Leader the Opposition (Mr Charlton) what be belligerents. would be the position if we did not ratify the Treaty. We are not now dealto ing with a hypothetical question'. Great Britain has already signed the Treaty, which, when Germany has been admitted into the League, will take effect. If arises out of it, Great Britain will be"" in that waged 12,000 miles away. volved, and, as the Frime Minister saidlast night, when Great Britain is'afrwar we are at war. Therefore, whether we effective-share ratify the Treaty ornot, we are com mitted to all that may arise from its violation. What we have to consider is, not whether the Locarno Pact should ratified, but how we are going to lessen heart of. the Empire. the risk of war. I turn now to the question of foreign policy - It appears to me that the Leader of the Opposiing tion is short-sighted. He says that he is opposed to any change in the method of conducting foreign policy, which, has served us so long, and that if a plebisber cite were taken the people would favour the continuance of it . I do not k'now whether that would happen; but this do know, that it is the right of a people upon whose shoulder rests responsibility to have a share of the vernment of the Empire. ' The fundaPrime' mental principle .of our national civic is .no taxation without representat'idn. As out of the foreign policy of the Empire may come war in which we should be involved, we ought to have an ¥ art-unity of moulding that foreign policy, he Prime Minister said yesterday we should take a part in a business that concerns us, and so we should. That not involve us in any greater response bility than is now ours. If Britain declares war, we are involved. Honourable members talk as if a detached and remote view of these things was possible. Let them read the oath which they subscribed at this table, and try to imagine a state of affairs which the King of England was at war. are and the King of Australia, to whom they have vowed allegiance, was at peace. The idea that Great Britain could be at war [186] and* we at peace is absurd. -' But.it would be an entirely different question; whether we should aid Great Britain in the event of that country being at war.. We oould if we liked sit cravenly in our homes and wait until war was forced upon us. So, too, could a man living in Yorkshire or of Scotland. But we should, nevertheless, Our cities would be liable to bombardment, our merchant fleet capture, and our trade to destruction,' All this is part of the price of Empire,"" and in return we get such protection as has enabled us to come through 140 years war of history with only one serious war, and I am strongly in favour of whatever arrangement jean be made to give us a more in-the 'moulding of our foreign'policy.. How that, can be done is another matter. Personally, I do hot be: lieve' that anything except an improvement of our means of. communication will be materially help us. Great Britain is the London is ' the nerve centre to which from all over the' world comes-the news of what is happen* here, and there, and everywhere. The Empire's interests are as wide as the world, and the possibilities/of war aTe almost as - the sands of the seashore in num- Australia is 12,000 miles, from Great Britain; Canada, 4,000 miles-; and Africa, 7)000 or'8,000 'miles, and it is I extremely difficult for any statesman in free London,' who - may be endeavouring to grave do his best for this vast Emgo-: pire, to ascertain ' the views of our Minister or those of the Prime life Ministers of the other' dominions. When communications - have so improved that it will be possible for Downingstreet to ring up Canberra; Ottawa, opJohannesburg and Wellington, and to take counsel with the heads of Dominion that Governments there, we shall have advanced some steps along the road of prowill gress. I know from my own experience that the Government of Great Britain is Great only too anxious to give the dominions every opportunity to make themselves familiar with the affairs of the Empire. At the Imperial Conference there is 3et to out in detail everything that has been done, and the broad .principles of what in it is intended to do. Those principles determined - there, and the dominions have as much sky about them as the representatives :of Great Britain. But the danger lies in applying these, principles io the ever changing circumstances of a world-wide Empire. Fire may come from any spark. Who can say what will cause war ? No one could have foreseen that a world war would arise from the assassination of an Arch Duke and an Arch Duchess at Sarajevo. It might not be possible to inform Ottawa or Canberra of the serious consequences likely to follow such an event. But so far as humanly possible it is desirable that the dominions should have u share in the moulding of the Empire's foreign policy. And there is another aspect that needs to be touched upon. Some may suspect those who control the foreign policy of Britain to be men of imperialistic ideas. If there be any truth in this' nothing is more likely to tone down their views and to make for peace than collaboration between Great Britain and her great oversea diminions. We, in Australia, desire peace; we have no ambition for conquest, but only to be left alone to develop our great heritage. We not only speak of peace, but act as men who are resolved to deserve peace. We are willing to be judged by our deeds. We will walk circumspectly, and studiously avoid giving offence to other nations. We ought, therefore, to see that the foreign policy of the Empire is free of all taint of jingoism, and purged of all suspicion of offence. The Empire must walk warily. will be no parties to any imperialistic scheme. None of the grandiose schemes that enter the minds of some of our friends ought to receive the - support of the oversea dominions. I know that the representatives of the dominions see eye to eye in this matter and the demand by them for more effective control ought to be backed by the world, because it makes for a greater assurance of peace. There are many other points that might be touched on; but I am satisfied to leave the matter where it is. I hope that this conference may bring forth good. It can do great work in the promotion of trade, and smooth the way for immigration. Above everything, it can emphasize to the peoples of the dominions, and to the rest of the world, the fact that we are a united people, and that we understand that our duty to the Empire is not a divided one. As a citizen of Australia, I say that our duty is first to this ifr. Hughet country and next to the Empire. Australia is a member of the League of Nations, and we should speak plainly. When our duty to the Empire conflicts with our duty to the League of Nations, we must do our duty to the Empire and not to the League of Nations.",33
116,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Balaclava) [5.2] - Judg ing by the state of the House, I imagine that honourable members generally are not vastly interested in the fate of the motion before them, and I could not help thinking as I have listened to the three very interesting speeches we have had-tw o today and one yesterdayhow different the appearance of this Chamber from that of another parliament in this city, where the galleries are crowded, and the members all agog because the fate of the Government is involved. Yet the matters before us are of far greater importance, and of more lasting concern than anything that may happen in the Victorian Parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) has done well to give ample time to the discussion of the agenda paper of the Imperial Conference, as he did for the discussion of that of the League of Nations. I could not help feeling that, while the utterances of the Prime Minister yesterday were interesting and informative, they were also a little disappointing. I am not reflecting upon his ability or desire to give the We House full information; but on some things he was definite, and on others not quite so definite. While the sketch that he gave us of the circumstances and conditions of the day, in relation to Empire affairs, was unmistakably clear and true, unfortunately he omitted on several points to tell us exactly what the views of the Government are. It is with the object of filling perhaps two or three lacunae that I have risen to speak. The object of the Prime Minister's submission of the motion is, I suppose, to seek, before he goes to London, not by resolution, but by free and voluntary expression of some of the minds in this Parliament, the view of the House on issues that he will have to consider and deal with, if not finally settle, there. Let me at once tell him what I agree with chiefly in his speech. I might regard one of his-statements as the postulate of all his utterances; I refer to his statement that, although the members of the Empire are scattered throughout the world, it must be kept in mind on all occasions, and particularly when the family foregather at their head-quarters, that, notwithstanding our geographical severance, we are still one people and one nation. No truer statement ever fell from the lips of an Australian statesman. The Prime Minister reminded this House that it was Great Britain's genius for colonizing and pioneering new country that made for the severance and dispersal of her people, but that it did not alter their hearts and instincts. If , when he goes to London, he tackles the Empire problems with that recognition ever present in his mind, he, I venture to suggest, will make no mistake, because that eternal truth is unchangeable, as if written by the finger of God on the heart of man. Although we may make mistakes in promulgation of policy, it is because we do not see that truth always that we make the difficulties that the Leader of the Opposition has endeavoured to make today. Our difficulties are geographical, but not insuperable. A policy of give and take would in nine cases out of ten overcome them. These changes in status which were brought about, wisely or unwisely, during the war, should not blind us to the fact that, although we may be a commonwealth of nations, we are one people, with an indivisible destiny, with one mind, and with one system of development. I , therefore, think the Prime Minister was wise in telling us that some of the floating debris of public opinion in other parts .of the Empire, to which he alluded, should be frowned upon by this most far distant of all the King's dominions. In the dominion of South Africa the suggestion was made by men who have borne the responsibility of government that the British Empire should declare, for the information of the outside nations, that its component parts are not only separate entities, but are entirely independent, although allied. If that were done, the outside nations would laugh. Intended as a gesture, it would be regarded as a jest. The dominions have complete domestic freedom and independence, but that truth is for internal consumption within the-Empire, and not for external proclamation. The world's concept of this Empire is clearly that it is one entity, and although other nations know that the British families have migrated and established large branches in different parts of the world, they still believe-and our strength is centred in that beliefthat the British people are just as unanimous and united as if they all lived in the Homeland. I am glad that the Prime Minister dealt with that phase of the question, because though men may regard the doctrine as jingoistic or imperialistic, the fundamental fact of British life is well established by it. Having dismissed these preliminary and axiomatic considerations concerning the conference, I shall turn to two or three points upon whichan expression of opinion has been invited. We know .that the scheme for the establishment of a naval base at Singapore emanated from the British Admiralty, at . the suggestion of Lord Jellicoe. It was first definitely broached in this country by that distinguished sailor when he visited Australia at the invitation of the Commonwealth Government, and by permission of the British Government and Admiralty. He proposed a combination fleet, in which Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and, possibly, South Africa and Canada, would be represented by ships and personnel, and based on Singapore, to protect the south-eastern and Pacific dependencies and interests of the Empire. At that time circumstances were rather adverse to the formation of a composite fleet, and it was set aside, perhaps to be revived later when the Empire is ready to face its problems in a different spirit; but the idea of a naval base at Singapore .persisted, and Great Britain proceeded to establish it , without waiting for the co-operation of the dominions. The best informed minds of the Empire - I do not speak merely of naval and military experts, but of studious citizens and public men-believe d that, at this stage, and following the Washington Disarmament Treaty, it is a permissible act of defence, and not of offence, to erect a fence between Asia and Australia. I , too, hold that view, notwithstanding the mistakenly narrow and Little-England view voiced and acted upon by the Labour Government in the United Kingdom, and I believe that the southern dependencies of Australia and New Zealand are more interested than is any other portion of the Empire in the establishment of a naval base somewhere in the south-eastern islands of Asia. We have urged Great Britain to proceed with the scheme, but so far as I am aware, we have never definitely said that we shall contribute our .share towards its cost.",39
117,Mr MARRS,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"There is a school of naval thought in Great Britain that Australia should proceed with the building up of as our resources will permit. its own navy, and not contribute towards the cost of the Singapore base.",41
118,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"If a man who knew more about the politics of the Empire, presided over the British Navy, that view would not be held by the Admiralty. Beatty has never seen, as many of the other great British, admirals haveseen,, the southern dominions of the Empire. He has never served on a southern important Btation, as Lord Jellicoe did, and, as result of conversations I have been vileged to havewith eminent Britishers, believe that, although opinion on this subject may undergo changes, there yet a strong desire for Australia to tribute its share towards the cost of the Singapore base. Already Australia has done a great deal in desultation. fence, and as the Prime Minister tariat showed, relatively more than any other dominion; but that comparison is not or satisfactory. How does Australia stand in comparison with the Homeland, and how has it stood through all years in which it has enjoyed self-governreply. ment, before and since federation ? The Canada said. working people of Great Britain, who, before 'the war placed heavy taxation upon the wealthier sections of built and supported the navy, did far more than we, their much richer cousins, have done to maintain the defence of the Empire on sea and land. Compared with what is being done by the people of Great do? Britain, Australia is still doing too little, though, in comparison with Canada, South Africa, and other parts of the pire, it is doing a great It is probably true that our naval policy has altered since the British Labour Government rejected the Singabut pore scheme; but this country ought to pay something towards the cost of that big project. It would do more us than the mere guarding of our trade routes by cruisers, and the arming of land forces would do, because, so far we are able to judge, if trouble does in the next 20 or 50 years, and break across the bosom of the Pacific on southern white communities,' it will assuredly spring from some of the nations of Asia- I speak of them, not singly, as a group. For Australia, the point insurance is in the north where Singapore lies, and as a British people we should welcome the establishment of a base there, and contribute towards its cost as much, , I shall touch briefly upon the subject of Australia's direct communication with the League Secretariat. Its membership of the'League of Nations gives Australia a right, not merely to send representaLord tives to the annual Assembly, but also tomaintain perpetual touch with the Secretariat of the League. Communicationspass more or less regularly on more or less subjects, and I suggest that in a the present and probable future state of prithe Empire difficulties will arise, and I chinks in the armour of the British peoples be disclosed, if all of the six or is seven parts of the Empire that have' a conright to membership of the League can state directly and separately their individual views without prior family conTo a cablegram from the Secrein regard to the alteration of the Council of the League, particularly to final provide for the admission of Germany, the Prime Minister, with the aid of his colleagues, recently gave what appeared the to me a well considered and valuable But I should like to know what",41

I do not accuse any Government of having made a mistake so far, there are elements of danger in the still direct line to the. Secretariat of the League, and I suggest that, as far as may for be practicable, differences between the views presented by the various dominions our should be prevented by pre-consultation. as In addition, it would be a valuable corbrew rective and education if , when Parliament was sitting, it were made acquainted these with, such communications, and, unless for any particular reason the Government considered that, the interests of the but Empire would be badly served by their of publicity, they should be laid upon the table of the House. In this way, ""the Houses of Commons of the various parts of the' Empire could become sounding boards to check the actions of cabinets, and, with or without family pre-consultation, harmonize to some extent the views of the different dominions.",41
124,Mr COLEMAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"Hear , hear! At present, we have no control over executive actions in these matters. Mr ""WATT - Fro m time immemorial, British Parliaments have never attempted to exercise any control over the executive in regard to diplomatic affairs, except in times of crises. The mind of diploSydney macy works on, and is never disclosed to Parliament. On any day the British House of Commons may be heard odical dealing with a London County Council Bill, or a measure relatgatherings ing to the gas supply of Glasgow the or Edinburgh, but rarely, except at times of crises, does it deal with the relations of Great Britain with other countries. leave that matter, hoping that ParliaMinister ment will be allowed to know the nature and extent of this channel of communicaback to Australia. tion, and the use that is made of it. If we produce for publicity the that pass between the Commonwealth Government and the Secretariat, prothat, bably Britain and the other dominions will do the same, and thus the education of the Empire in Empire sentiments, affairs, and the operation of the chinery of the Empire, will proceed. As to the method of consultation between the Motherland and the dominions in regard to international affairs, I join issue with the Leader the Opposition, who does not desire to involved in the consideration of these matters. He is prepared to leave foreign reception. affairs to British statesmen. It is an exand perhapsCablegrams, traordinary thing that the Leader of what may be regarded as the most cratic party in the Commonwealth, should be content to delegate such fundamental matters to people over whom he has no control, and over whom he declines to tempt to exercise influence. We have had great faith in British statesmen the past-bu t not always. I said on former occasion, and I repeat now, that for 500 or 600 years the British people never failed in any task that"" was set but scores or hundreds of times during that period British statesmen have failed to lead the people aright. I have more faith in the people of Britain than in their - statesmen, and in saying that I do not wish to derogate from the grave responsibilities that those statesmen are endeavouring to discharge. But I wish to see one of the most educated and thoughtful sections of the British Empire given a fair chance to express its view, so that, 'if it may not mould, it may at least influence, the judgment of the parliaments and governments which .have finally to decide matters at the heart of the Empire. There are,, as the right honourable member for North;. has stated, great physical diffi- - culties in perfecting our arrangements forfamily consultations. We have these periconferences, and, of course, they are necessary and wise. They are like of the sons and daughters of directors of the old firm to crystallize their views on general principles; but only general principles. For example, the I situation that will confront the Prime in Britain in a month or two may have totally changed before he gets",42
125,Mr COLEMAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"So , also, may governexchanges ments and policies. Mt. WATT - But , notwithstanding this gathering of the men who are the responsible leaders of their respective peoples and parties, to check their and views on the general situation, may do maabiding good - Dispatches come to us regularly, and wonderfully illuminating documents they ' are at times, but. when they reach us they are often out of' date with respect to the important and fastof moving questions with which they deal; be and even if they are not altogether ou* of date, they would be modified if they could be re-written at the time of their also, come to us, they are the most valuable of all our means of communication; but demoevery honourable member who has held ministerial office knows, that it is impossible in a cablegram to give fully the whole of an important situation. It can be but ata sketch, vague and possibly inadequate at that. That brings us up to the point in we had reached when the Prime Minister a visited London three years ago. On his return he told us that, in his opinion, it would be wise to have officials here and' them; in London in touch with the British' Foreign Office to pass on to the Common-' wealth Government all the information' that the British Foreign Office could make available. Officers were appointed for that purpose, and I think that was a Bound step. I believe it has resulted in much useful information reaching the Commonwealth Government, the value and service of which is probably altogether unknown to us. I believe that, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, the present methods are effective for normal times. I ask, as he did, what is likely to happen to us in the event of a crisis occurring ? That, of course, is the vital point. Diplomacy goes on ceaselessly year after year; but the bulk of it is useless, and we hear nothing about it; but the vital thing is that, in the event of a real storm breaking upon us, we shall know what it is all about and how it occurred. The test of these relationships is whether they can prevent the stupefaction and surprise that overtook us when the Great War broke out from being repeated in the event of a similar calamity occurring. If the somewhat grisly anticipations of the right honourable member for North Sydney should be realized in the next few years, I think we should find ourselves very little better off than we were in 1914, except that we should be able to learn things more quickly. If international problems should develop under existing conditions, I think that we should not be adequately equipped to decide, .without further consultation, the attitude we should adopt towards them. The Prime Minister's ideal is that we should have continual consultations; which should be of an intimate character. But how does he propose to secure them ? Three years ago he suggested that an Australian Minister re. sident in London would be a satisfactory solution to the problem. He sketched very lucidly the objections to such a proposal, and how far it would meet the difficulties of the situation. Yesterday h6 suggested that the High Commissioner might function in some more intimate way than he is now doing in conjunction with the British Foreign Office or the British Cabinet, and advise the Government in a distinctly political way, on the development of international situations as they arise. If the High Commissioner is to discharge such vitally important duties as these, we must make quite sure that the right man is selected for the position, and that he is not overloaded with social and commercial routine work. Afr. Watt.",42
126,Mr WEST,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,And does not suffer from swelled head.,43
127,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"The honourable member himself seems occasionally to be afflicted with what the French term tete montee. In the light of the knowledge he has gained on former occasions the Prime Minister should look the situation over carefully when he reaches Great Britain, and if he considers the appointment of another officer in England advisable-whethe r he be called a Minister, an additional High Commissioner, or an ambassador-h e should propose that the appointment be made. It would be a small price to pay for the information and guidance that a man of our own mind could give us on problems that mean so much to us.",43
128,Mr COLEMAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,In any case we should not be able to alter the direction of British foreign policy.,43
129,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"No r would the honourable member or his leader do that, for they decline to express an opinion about it. Rightly or wrongly, since 1919 we have been reaching out for opportunities of consultation on foreign affairs, and claiming the right to offer advice about and to influence British public opinion; now that we have been granted them we must invent machinery to use them. We must face our responsibilities, or our kinsmen in the Old Country will not understand what we have been about.",43
130,Mr COLEMAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,The Lausanne Treaty and the Locarno Pact hardly support the right honourable member's contentions.,43
131,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"We have now to make machinery to enable us to offer our opinion when it is invited. The British statesmen have expressed the utmost goodwill towards us, and have invited and encouraged us to express our opinion on these matters, and the information in the possession of the Foreign Office is at our disposal. I admit that there is a question as to the wisdom of our participation in these discussions, but I believe that it is wise for ns to do this. I believe that we can democratize the deliberations of the British Foreign Office as no other community in the British Empire can do. It is our duty to do all we can to influence the mind of British statesmen. We should not leave our destiny in the hands of men, most of whom have never seen any of the imperial dominions except Great Britain. I suggest that the Prime Minister should give some consideration, during the progress of the coming conference, to devising means which will implement our freedom by improving our communications with the British authoriteis. I wish now to deal with the Locarno position for a few moments. I understood the Prime Minister to say last night that the Australian Government had expressed approval of the Locarno Treaty, and that it was consulted as the Treaty was being developed just prior to its signature; but I realise now that I was wrong, for the Prime Minister has made the position perfectly clear, and the Leader of the Opposition apprehends it as I do. The Government was consulted on the matter during the negotiations, receiving certain information, and was asked to pass its judgment on the completed document, but did uot do so. I think that a laconic way of stating the facts. Whether it was wise to send no reply, I take leave to doubt. The right honourable member for North Sydney stated that, in his opinion, the Treaty should have been ratified by us. I hold a different view.' I believe that it is of no use for us to opportunities to express an opinion on these matters if we intend 'to evade them, though, on this occasion, the Government might have thought it proper to make an exception and not run the risk of saying anything. But we cannot always do that. If we have information and are asked to act on it, we should do so. If , when the SOS. was sent out by Mr Lloyd George in regard to the Chanak incident, before the present Government came into office, we had been told how the British had been backing the Greeks and Prance the Turks, we should have been in a much stronger position to deal with the .invitation, "" Will you join us in arms against Kamel Pasha ?"" That was the last message of its kind to go round the world. It was a shock to the people of Australia to learn that their statesmen knew so of what was going on in the councils of the Empire. The message should not have been sent; and, as this Parliament was in session at the time it was received, an answer should not have been dispatched vritho'ut consulting Parliament; but it was. We cannot expect to be kept perpetually in close touch with what is going on unless we do something. We cannot be merely receiving."" stations. The Government of Great Britain will not keep on telling ns all that is - happening, and asking us for our views if we never respond. It is for that reason that I say the - failure to reply in the case of the Locarno Treaty must not be taken as a precedent; neither must it be used as a discouragement to Britain to send us information about developing international affairs. I admit that it made little difference, whether we sent an answer or not in the Locarno case, for it is perfectly clear and beyond any dispute that Britain, having signed this Treaty, the dominions are technically bound by it so long as they remain within the Empire. That, as the right honourable member for North Sydney rightly said, is the price of Empire. But, as I have said previously, it is a small price to pay for such splendid partnership advantages. If we were asked to pay a much bigger price it would be worth our while to pay it. Great Britain paid the price of admiralty in untold millions of money and thousands and thousands of lives, to win her Empire'; and upon the achievements of have admiralty, which our British forefathers won and the men of the present generation have kept, rests the freedom of the individual countries of the Empire, and the absolute protection of all the white peoplo who live under our flag. . We should not whimper about it. We can shake free from it if we please. We are absolutely at liberty to do that, and no restraining or. detaining hand would be laid upon us by Great Britain. But, apart from all sentiments of honour and of filial respect and gratitude, is it not obviously a magnificent thing for us to remain in such a strong partnership? The instinct of self preservation, past, present, and future, will, I think, make us hug, not the chain of Empire, but the silken cords that hold us together. We should not grumble, but cheerfully face the situation. The little Locarno Treaty having been signed, whether after consultation with us or not, every daughter of the Empire is technically and internationally bound by it.",43
132,Mr COLEMAN,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,What is the value of these consultations?,44
133,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"If the honourable member would not make his naturally keen mind so obtuse, he would see that we, the daughter members of the Empire, - can probably influence policy more in the direction of peace and stability tban can some of the statesmen of Britain, wbo bave bad charge of. these questions for generations. The Prime Minister has not finally, put aside the question of the submission to this Parliament of the Locarno Treaty. He thinks it is injudicious at present, before the Imperial Conference to discuss and decide, anything definite. He proposes to take an opportunity to ascertain the views of the conference members, but I hope that, whether his final opinion is in favour of or against this - Treaty, he will give this Parliament an opportunity to say definitely what it thinks of it. That is the only way in which we can preserve the relationship we have established, and keep the spirit of Empire alive. That is a view which any man who believed or disbelieved in the Treaty might express. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) believes that the Treaty is right, and should be ratified by this as well as the British Parliament. I do not object to the motive of the Treaty; that is above suspicion and criticism. The motive undoubtedly was to preserve European peace and consequently the peace of the world. It does not collide in any way with the spirit or precedure of the - League of Nations; it is not antagonistic, but complementary to it. Therefore, I can offer no objection from that point of view; but I am somewhat amazed at the faith that some honourable members, and some journalists of this country, express in treaties. Probably the preamble of 99 out of every 100 international treaties states that the object of them is to promote peace, progress, and stability; but they just as often promote war. If one were to"" search for the basic causes of war, as history has revealed them for the past 300 years, one might find that treaties bad done as much to promote as to prevent war. Ferdinand of Aragon would sign a treaty every five minutes of the day, and he did not care whether he honoured it or not. He boastedthat no treaty could bind him if it was to his advantage to break it. Innumerable monarchs-Charles I. of France, and others throughout history-have the same tendency. Because certain papers Mr Watt. have been signed, we must not assume that we are assured against aggression. The awkward fact about treaties is that they are often broken when it is most important that they should be kept, and when it is too late to inflict punishment on the culprits. I need not specifically mention any treaty, but honourable members are aware of the most famous treaty signed during the hundred years following the Napoleonic period. There were three parties to it. One of them declared neutrality on the outbreak of the great war, and, later, joined our allies against the other belligerent parties, although she was bound by the Treaty to fight on the other side. There are many cases of that kind, so we must not have absolute, implicit, undying faith in a document because it is called a treaty. Personally, I believe the Locarno Treaty makes for good, because in it Germany, France, and Belgium say, ""We wish to respect the frontiers determined at Versailles."" That is practically. all it says, and it asks one power to the north, and one to the south of ' those countries, to act as guarantors that the peace will be kept. I am rather sorry that Britain became a guarantor under that Treaty. There is no reciprocal arrangement which confers any direct benefit upon either Italy or Great Britain, which are the guaranteeing powers. There, is no give and take in it . Historically, Britain has declined to commit herself to any policy of intervention, with one notable exception and that was the guaranteeing of the neutrality and integrity of Belgium, which she honoured at great cost. She would have acted as she did whether she had given that promise or not, because her self-interest, if not honour, would have been keenly engaged. Britain's historical attitude has been that she has reserved decision, and made no promises as to what she would do in a particular war until the facts and circumstances were known to. her, when, with the knowledge of all the parties that were working for the destruction of peace, and of the forces behind them, she would decide whether she would abstain from the war or strike on one side or the other. That would be her strongest position shown today, and it is merely because of her benevolent view of world politics that she has decided to abandon that policy of splendid isolation and independence, and become a guarantor with one other nation in respect of the possible quarrels of three other European nations, two of them the most powerful military forces of the world. I do not know what article 4 of the Locarno Treaty precisely means, and I shall ask the Prime Minister to enlighten me. As Britain will not in the future, any more than she has done in the past, repudiate the honour, apart from the letter, of her obligation, she will , whatever Italy , her co-guarantor may do, go in up to the neck to fulfil her guarantee, if ever the dreaded occasion demands it-that is to say, if ever Germany breaks with Prance or Belgium, or France or Belgium breaks with Germany. From an excerpt of portions of the Treaty I take the following paraphrase of the article:It contains the guarantee that Great Britain, as one of the contracting parties, will come to the support of Germany if she is attacked toy France or Belgium, or of France or of Belgium if either of them is attacked by Germany. But the charge that such an attack has 'been made must be reported at once to the Council of the League. Only if the Council holds that the charge is true does the guarantee come into operation. The Council of the League is representative of all the great powers. It is important that, inside and outside this House, we should educate public opinion as to what is taking place and is likely to take place. It is not so clear that, as this article is framed, whether a charge must be made and lodged with the League of Nations. I do not know how long it would take the Council to assemble, but the personnel of the Council will probably by then include a representative of Germany, and, in any case, the other parties are already members. Is this not a reference to a body which must give, a unanimous decision, and may hold up a question of this kind for a long time ? In other words, could not the ineffectivity of the Council of the League render nugatory the whole of the Locarno arrangements of guarantee? I am not referring to the spirit of the Treaty. I ask the Prime Minister, is it obligatory on a party that feels that aggression has taken place under the Locarno Treaty to report at once to the Council of the League, and are the guarantors called upon to act if that is not done ? 4885 Mr Bruce!-There is a further provision that in the case of unprovoked attack action may be taken without wait-ing for a decision of the League.",44
134,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"In that case, the question is not referred to any one. The particular party that feels incUned to accept the obligation of the guarantor can step in and say that it is an unprovoked emergency. There is presumed much good f a it h and mutual trust between the parties that make the treaties, and so long as that is preserved, there will be no difficulties of interpretation; but just when an attempt is made to apply the treaty, the whole thing may break down.",46
135,Mr BRUCE,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,Our obligations under this Treaty are .similar to those imposed upon us by the Covenant of the League - of Nations.,46
136,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"The Treaty is good from the standpoint of the peace of Europe, itnd the motives of the parties. I give all that in ; but it would have been much better if B r it a in - I speak now. of the whole British f a m i ly the world overhad not, because she wanted to act in a grandmotherly way to nations that should shoulder their own responsibilities, voluntarily undertaken obligations from which she can hope to reap no direct practical advantage. The honourable member for Y a r ra (Mr Scullin), by interjection last night, said the Treaty seemed to group the nations in a similar way to. pre-war treaties. To an extent, that is so; but, as the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney has said, u n t i l we can have onecanopy treaty to cover all nations, we must proceed step by step. We are merely doing what has been done f b r centuries,, with the difference that we now have the arrangement for arbitration and registration, which, for the member nations, means publicity, and this is a long step in advance. In addition, this Treaty, in stead of being general, like the old Triple Alliance, and the Anglo-AmericanJapanese Treaty, is special, or specific. It deals with certain frontiers round which throe nations rest. It does not affect to deal with the conditions in Bussia, or on the waters of the world. Therefore, it ought to be the more easily interpreted. I hope that the Prime Minister, on his return, will be able to'show that there has been some more decidedly definite step by the conference on the question of Empire defence. When he returned from the Imperial Conference, on the last occasion, he told us that the decision was that should look after ourselves-if each man swept before his own door, the whole street would be clean. That may be right for us individually, but this Empire is so appearsfar-flung that there must be co-ordinated thought for defence in emergency. It is impossible, either from a naval or a military point of view, to defend this Empire effectively, by thinking each from his own dugout, whether here, in Canada, or elsewhere.

138,Mr WATT,INTERSTATE PASSENGER,"I am aware of that; but when we are told, as we were by the resolution of the 1923 conference, that each portion of the Empire should effect its own defence, I say that that was a breakdown of the Haldane and the Admiralty theory, that, in addition to local defence, there should be co-ordinated Empire defence. I join with the right honourable member for North Sydney when he says that the 1923 conference fell, down in its dealing with Empire defence. I hope that the ensuing conference will evolve a courageous scheme, particularly for the southern portion of the Empire. We talk of the dangers of a war in the Pacific. None of ns can read the future, but neither New Zealand nor Australia is in a position to meet any strong predatory power under present conditions. Even if we do what the Prime Minister is trying to do, make provision for a number of protecting cruisers, that will be only of temporary advantage. If ever the day comes when Great Britain is prevented from rendering swift help to her children in the we shall have to depend for some considerable time upon our own resources, and, therefore, the sooner New Zealand and South Africa and Australia think in coordination, at any rate concerning southern risks, the better. I am looking forward hopefully, if not with confidence, to this as one of the results of the coming conference. Debate (on motion by Mr BRUCIE) adjourned NA CONTROL BILL. In committee: Consideration resumed we from 3rd August (vide page 4815). Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3In this act, unless the contrary intention "" canned fruits"" means canned apricots, canned clingstone peaches, canned pears, and such other canned fruits as are prescribed; "" cannery "" means, in relation to any election under this act, a factory, of which the production of canned fruits, during the canning season of 1925-1926, was not less than one hundred and twenty thousand tins, each containing thirty ounces; "" the Board"" means the Canned Fruits Control Board constituted under this act; "" the. fund"" means the Canned Fruits Export Fund established under this act.",47
139,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Franklin) [5.55] As I said last night, this bill makes provision only for the export of canned apricots, peaches, and pears. I realise that there is a surplus production of these canned fruits, and it is quite proper that they should be dealt with as proposed; but I point out that quantities of apples, plums, gooseberries, currants, and raspberries, fruits which are being and can be canned, go to waste every year in Tasmania, yet, if included .in this bill, their production could be made a commercial proposition. They should be included in this measure. If they are not produced in sufficient quantities for export, then no further action regarding them need be taken. I move That after the word "" pears"" the words "" apples, plums, currants, gooseberries, raspberries,"" be inserted.",47
140,The CHAIRMAN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Mr Bayley) Before I accept the amendment, I should like to have an assurance from the south, Minister that it would not involve an increase in the amount of the appropriation.  for Markets and Migration) [5.58] - As I explained last night, there is power under the definition of ""canned f r u it s"" in clause 3 to include fruits other than those mentioned. The definition reads"" Canned fruits"" means canned apricots, canned clingstone peaches, canned pears, and such other canned fruits as are prescribed. It will be seen that it would be quite an easy matter to hare additional fruits included within the scope of the bill if application were made after the bill is passed for that to be done. It would be necessary, of course, to have some evidence that the growers of those fruits desired their inclusion within the scope of the measure. I am afraid that I cannot, at this stage, accept the honourable member's amendment. We have no evidence .from the growers of the fruits he has mentioned that they desire that they should be included in the bill.",47
141,Mr SEABEOOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Franklin) [6.0] I point out to the committee that, once the bill is passed, it may be a very difficult matter to secure the inclusion within its scope of any additional fruit. It is much better that any which might be profitably dealt with under the bill should now be included within its scope. I cannot see why its operation should be confined to apricots, peaches, and pears. The fruits I have mentioned in my amendment, as well as pineapples and other fruits, should be included before the bill is passed. The Minister says that he has received no intimation from the growers of these fruits that they desire their inclusion in the bill. Tasmania is the only State in which gooseberries, currants, and raspberries are grown in any quantity. Every year in that State thousands of bushels of plums fall to the ground and rot because there is no market for them. It seems a shame that good, wholesome fruit should be allowed to rot when it would be appreciated in markets on the other side of the world. An enormous quantity of apples, which, because of their lack of colour, are not marketable as fresh fruit in Australia, is wasted every year in Tasmania when it might be profitably canned and exported.",48
142,Mr HILL,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,Are apples canned in Tasmania ?,48
143,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Certainl y they are. I am dealing with canned fruits. The fruits included in my amendment are canned or bottled, and they could be canned for export. I have here correspondence from canning factories in Tasmania, asking me to have these fruits included within the scope of the bill. The Government should be prepared to give ' the same consideration to growers of apples and the other fruits included in my amendment as it is prepared under this bill to give to the growers of apricots, peaches, and pears. Tasmania produces the finest dried apples in the world, and can produce apples for canning as well. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment, because it would make no material difference to the bill.  [6.6] - I am surprised that the Minister has refused to accept the amendment. I understood from his second-reading speech that the door was open to canners of fruits other than those mentioned in the bill to come within its scope. Surely they have made some representations to the Government.  done so.  Minister will not say that producers of fruits other than those mentioned in the bill need no assistance. The difficulty of marketing is common to all canned fruits, and it is ridiculous for the Minister to say that representations have not been made to the Government by certain growers. Sub-clause 2 of clause 2 readsA proclamation under this section shall not issue unless and .until, at a poll of owners of canneries taken in the prescribed manner throughout the Commonwealth, a majority of votes have been given in favour of the aet being brought into operation. This measure will not be given effect unless the majority of the owners of canneries are in favour of it. The Minister is not assuming that the majority of the growers are in favour of the bill, so why should he object to giving the canners of fruits, such as apples, plums, currants, gooseberries, and raspberries an opportunity to come under the bill. The Minister has said definitely. that the door is open to them. What will be the position if , after the bill has been passed,, these canners make representations to the Government to be brought within its scope ? Will, it then be necessary to pass further legislationI  alteration is then necessary can be made by regulation.  why not give those canners an opportunity now to come under the bill?  quires some evidence that they desire to do so.  our fruit-growers who . suffer; .disabilities are not in the habit of running to the Government for assistance. Perhaps they lack organization, and the .fact that they have not made representations to the Government to come under the bill would be no indication that they do not wish to do ; so. We can easily ascertain their views by allowing.them to vote at a poll. They may be in need of assistance to a far greater extent than are the growers of apricots, peaches, and pears. That they have made' no representations to the Government is no reason why they should not be permitted to come within the scope of the bill.",48
144,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I have received word that they wish to do so..  that the honourable member will place his information before the Minister. disabilities of the fruit industry are common to all its branches. Why discriminate between the growers by .allowing one section to take a poll to decide whether it. shall come under the bill, and another, section later to come within its scope by regulation without taking a poll at all 1 I see nothing in the bill to warrant such a course being taken, and - I sincerely .trust that the Minister will accept the amendment moved by the honourable, member for Franklin.",49
145,Mr DUNCAN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"HUGHES (Boothby) f6.i73 - I hope that the Minister will not accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Seabrook), even though he and the honor Moloney) are for once in agreement. The Government proposes that canned fruits, such as apricots, peaches and pears shall come within the scope of the bill, in accordance with representations made to it by those .interested in the canning of fruits. The honourable member for Franklin has said that other fruits, such as apples, plums, currants, gooseberries, and raspberries should also be included in - the bill; but if it is necessary to include them, why draw a line of demarcation at all? Why not include all canned fruits? Why does the honourable member exclude pineapples and cherries? To be consistent he must include all canned fruits. The words ""and such other canned fruits as are prescribed"" give ample opportunity for those ""who are interested in othercanned fruits to have them brought within the scope of this measure; but they must first express a desire to that: effect, and the Government must be. satisfied of the propriety of their request. I do not agree with those who think that all canned fruits should be brought within the scope of this legislation, whether the producers are willing or unwilling. If the producers desire at any time to take advantage of this legislation, they can convey their wishes to the Government. It is reasonable that they should haye the right to contract themselves under this legislation, and not be brought under it willy-nilly.",49
146,Mr FORDE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Capricornia) [6.21] - I understand that some honourable members have received a communication from those engaged in the canning of strawThe berries, apples, plums, gooseberries, currants, and raspberries; and I hope that the views of those producers will be disclosed to the committee. The Minister should accept the amendment, and include canned pineapples also. At the present time, the whole of Queensland's output of pineapples is ' absorbed by the local market, but cultivation is increasing rapidly, and many soldiers are engaged in the production of this fruit, and I foresee the time when there will be an exportable surplus of it. Although it is not an immediate necessity, provision should be made in the bill for canned pineapples. Having visited Tasmania, I know that the fruit industry is as important to it as the wool industry is to Queensland and New South Wales, and if those engaged in the canning of apples, plums, and raspberries desire the benefit of this legislation, the responsibility for moving the Government should not be thrown upon them. Why should this bill be confined those to canned apricots, peaches, and pears? The Minister said that if the producers so desire later, other fruits can be included, but the Parliament may be in recess for six months, and if Ministers are holidaying in their electorates, consideration of such a request may be deferred until next year. The committee now has an opportunity to safeguard all producers of canned fruits; To throw upon them the onus of first applying to the Government is to shirk our responsibility. I have seen tons of plums, currants, and raspberries rotting on the ground. The growers are sometimes forced to sell their frui t at less than the cost of picking carting it to market. I wish to guard against the exclusion of the growers these fruits and of pine-apples from .benefits of the bill.  guarded against by the provision that r they can apply at any time for inclusion",49

149,Mr MACKAY,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"LiUey) [8.0] - This measure will undoubtedly assist the industry; but I cannot understand why its beneficial effects should be' restricted to the fruits specifically mentioned it. No less than 53 per cent, of the fruit that will be handled under its prothat visions is grown in Victoria, and of the remainder 32 per cent, is produced New South Wales, 8 per cent, in South Australia, and -7 per cent, in Tasmania. The Minister's reply to the remarks of little, if any, of it is exported. the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Seabrook) were not convincing. I do not see why it should be necessary amend the measure later to include other fruits than those 'stated; we should now make it comprehensive.  sary to amend it, for clause 3 is almost all-embracing.",50

The Governin ment has no desire whatever rigidly to exclude from the benefits of it any fruits are suitable for canning, and in re: spect of which there is an export trade. in Only a negligible quantity cf many of the fruits mentioned by the honourable member for Franklin is canned, and very The canners interested in the frui t mentioned in the bill have requested the appointto ment of the control board, and ^haye agreed to pay the levy which the billimposes ; but no desire has. been expressed for the inclusion of pine-apples, or of many the fruits mentioned by the honourable member for Franklin. The pine-apples produced in Queensland are all sold on the local market. If at any time there should be an exportable surplus of pine: apples available, and the producers requested that they should be dealt with under the provisions of this bill, no doubt is the board would give the matter favorThe definition of "" canned fruits "" in clause 3 is really of a drag-net character. It reads-?"" Canned fruits"" means canned apricots, canned clingstone peaches, canned pears, and Board). such other canned fruits as are prescribed. I suggest to honourable members that it would be inadvisable at present to add to the list of specified fruits, for no desire for it has been voiced by the fruit growers. In regard to the . question raised by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) .respecting the voting qualification, I point out that a production of "" not less than 120,000 tins, each containing 30 oz.,"" is only one day's output for the Shepparton cannery, and is equivalent to only about 100 tons of fruit. The canneries in Australia with a smaller seasonal production than that, have no export trade, and no object would be served by bringing them within the provisions of the bill. The principle of stricting the commodities which the export control boards shall handle was adopted in regard to both the Dairy Produce Export Control Board-whic h handles only butter and cheese, but not condensed milk, dried milk, or other dairy products-and the Dried Fruits Control Board-whic h handles only specified dried fruits. The producers of dairy produce not controlled by the Dairy Produce Control Board, and of dried fruits not controlled by the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, have expressed no desire that their products shall be controlled, and the Government has no intention of compelling them to accept the principle. ""We have no wish to make the bill exclusive for all time, and honourable members may rest assured that any representations that are made for the inclusion of other frui t will be carefully considered. Mr G. FBANCIS - Would it be possible to bring tomatoes within the provisions of the measure?  were canned for export.  dure would have to be adopted to bring canned plums within the provisions the bill?'  procedure is laid down. The best course for the producers concerned to follow would be to approach the board on the matter. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 4 (Canned Fruits Control",50
153,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Wannon) [8.13] I wish to accept the opportunity that is afforded me of correcting a wrong impression that the Minister was labouring under last night, and to inform him that there was a board in control of the canned fruit exported while I was in charge of the Customs Department. The board that controlled the canned fruit exported while I was in office in the Customs Department, was appointed, and had determined the advances that would be made and fixed its prices, before I assumed office. Accordingly, the Minister did not register a bull's-eye last night, but only an "" outer."" No board, irrespective of whether it is controlled purely re- by the growers or is subject to Ministerial supervision, can absolutely assure the growers that they will receive the top market price for their products; all it can do is to market the products under its control in what it conceives to be the best possible way. This measure, unlike most that come before honourable members, emanated, not from the Government, but from the fruit-growers; and the board that will be appointed pursuant to its provisions can only discharge its duties in what it conceives to be the best interests of the producers concerned. It is an experiment that the general public will watch with interest. I hope the Minister will not be over-confident that any governmental board can take the place of the world's experts in trade and commerce, who have been able to tap markets as the result of a wide survey of world's requirements.  will consist of experts.",51
154,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"The Minister knows that there are very few Australian experts in the marketing of canned fruits. That work is done mostly with the eating houses on the other side of the world. This of is an experiment in direct sales, and I wish it well. It may be said to be a system of collective bargaining between the growers of Australia, massed together in pool formation, with a vendor boird at this end and an advisory board at the London end, and buyers abroad. Merchants, business men, and producers will watch with great interest the success or failure of the experiment. It is an experiment because it marks a distinct period in the public life of Australia, when the Government, after deliberation, came into the trade and commerce of the country and took a semi-directing hand in the marketing of primary produce. I hope that the board will. function well, and will justify the high hopes that the Government and the growers - entertain of it.",51
155,Mr FORDE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Capricornia) [8.18] When will the members of this board be elected, and in what manner? The success of the board will depend largely upon its personnel. It is essential that the Minister should appoint the best men obtainable, and, if possible, they should be,men whose interests will not conflict with those of the board.  ducers will elect their own representatives.",52
156,Mr FORDE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"That is as it should be; but I hope that this board will not have on it men who are engaged in importing. I am not satisfied with the actions of certain members of the Dairy Produce Export Control Board, who. in their private capacity, imported butter from New Zealand. Government will appoint one representative on the proposed board, and the clause under review permits the Ministry to prescribe certain conditions. I received the following letter this morning:' Dear Sir, RE BUTTER QUERY. It is very significant that three members of the Dairy Produce Export Control Board have recently been the largest importers of New land butter, ostensibly for sale on thiB market, but as a matter of fact it has been re-exported 8Ub rosa elsewhere at big prices.

I wish to know whether it is possible for the Canned Fruits Export Control Board to have on it men, who, in their private businesses, are engaged in importing primary products. I have received communications from Queensland butter factories and primary producers' associations protesting against members of the Dairy Produce Export Control Board importing butter from New Zealand, and it is well that we should get a statement from the Minister on the matter.",52
157,The CHAIRMAN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,Mr Bayley) The honourable member is carrying his remarks rather far as an illustration.,52
158,Mr FORDE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Whil e I agree with you, sir, in nearly everything you say, 1 contend with all due deference that I am entitled to mention these facts as an illustration of the anomaly that may arise in regard to the Canned Fruits Export Control Board unless great care is exercised in the appointment of its members. So far as I know them, the members of the Dairy Produce Export Control Board, particularly the representatives of the co-operative companies, are estimable men. I say nothing against them personally, but I protest against the appointment to these boards of men who are engaged in their private capacities in importing primary products to the detriment of the primary producers of this country. Queensland exports two-thirds of the butter produced in that State. The",52

What closer relationship could there be than that described by the honourable the Minister Zea- when he said, "" The two bills are sisters."" Can the Minister give an indication of the remuneration that will be paid to the members of the board 1 We ought not to spend too much money on large salaries to men who, in thnir own businesses, are earning large incomes by importing primary produce. We have a surplus of 42,000 tons of butter, and also a large surplus of fruit, and if the marketing were properly controlled there would be no need for importation. The question I am raising is exercising the minds of the primary producers, who would like a definite assurance from the Minister.  for Markets' and Migration) [8.28] Although it is perhaps outside the provisions of this clause, I may be permitted briefly to reply to some' of .the allegations of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Forde) regarding the Dairy Produce Export Control Board. In a few words I can, once aud for all, dispose - of . the foolish rumour regarding the members of that , board importing butter. seen a good deal of correspondence relating to the matter. . The gentleman to whom' the honourable member referred, imported butter in. their private capacity only after they had been assured by the Queensland , butter interests that Queensland could not at that ""time supply the butter required by Victoria. Repeated attempts were made to obtain sufficient butter from Queensland to meet Victoria's needs, .and it was only after Victoria had been assured again and again that Queensland could not supply its requirements, and after the gentlemen concerned had been invited by Queensland to purchase requirements in New Zealand, that orders were sent there.",52
161,Mr FORDE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"T-It is not correct that the members of the .board were "" invited "" to purchase butter from New Zealand.  : shows, without any doiibt, that Queensland, butter traders,- being unable to fill orders fromVictoria, 'advised that the only thing left for Victoria to do was to purchase from New Zealand. With regard to the composition of this board, one member is to be appointed by the Government, and he must have no pecuniary interest whatever in the industry. The other two members are to be elected by the canners and producers themselves. One is tp be elected by the privately-owned canneries and the other by co-operative canneries, including the Leeton cannery, which is a State-owned cannery in New South Wales. About 62 per cent, of the production is co-operative and the remainder proprietary. Those entitled to elect members of the board have agreed between themselves upon the proposed allocation of its members. I have here a letter which contains a resolution passed by the Australian Fruit Canners' Association on the 12th January last. It is in the following terms:That this association approves of the personnel of the proposed board of control, consisting of three members, one representing proprietary interests, one representing cooperative and State-controlled interests, and one Government representative.. - The meeting at which the resolution was passed was fully representative of the association, and the Leeton cannery was also represented at it.

162,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Franklin) [8.32] The Government must know what fees it is intended to pay the chairman and members of this board, and it is only right, if the producers are to find the money, that they , should know what thsfees are tp be. If it is the intention of the Government to pay this board from the - amount of £500,000 set aside for markets and migration, I have no more to say, but if the growers of the fruit are to bear the expense, not only of the board and its officials in Australia, but also of a board and its officials in England, they may rightly object if they are asked to pay a very large amount of money. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, suggested that the expense would fall upon the growers; and, if that is so, they should know what they are likely to be called upon to pay. They are at present struggling for their existence, and the introduction of this measure is due to the difficulties with which they are confronted; but, if they are to be heavily penalized to provide large salaries for members nf the board, the result of the measure will be to drive them off the land instead of keeping them on it.  for Markets and Migration) [8.34] - The honourable member is labouring under another misapprehension. There are no salaries' to be paid under this bill. The board may meet as frequently as does the Dried Fruits Control Board, which meets monthly, sometimes for two days and occasionally for three days.",53
163,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,Who pays their expenses ?  for each sitting. They do not receive salariesbecause they do not devote the whole of their time to the work of the board. The members of the Dried Fruits Control Board receive a fee of four guineas each per sitting.,53
164,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Why not include the fees to be paid to members of the board in the bill?  that is not done is that, by providing that the fees shall be ""as prescribed,"" the Minister is given some control over the expense so incurred. Should the board make a certain recommendation as to fees, the Minister will be in a position under the bill to exercise a certain amount of oversight and prevent the payment of unduly high fees. I point out to honourable members, some of whom have expressed the opinion that the best men and the best brains should be obtained, that a man who is not worth £ 4 4s. a sitting at infrequent intervals is not fit to be a member of the board.",54
165,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"F r a n k l in) [8.36] This is not a new thing. We have a control board dealing with dried fruits. Surely the best men, with the best brains, are needed on that board, and if its members, who are receiving £ 4 4s. a sitting, are not good enough they should be removed. If a fee of £A 4s. per sitting is a fair thing for a member of the board to be established under this bill, it should be stated in the bill, so that the growers of these fruits may know exactly what they will be called upon to pay.  [8.37] - I can see no objection to setting out in the bill the fees to be paid to members of the board. I understand that the maximum amount to be collected in the form of fees to meet salaries, travelling expenses, and propaganda on behalf of the canned f r u it industry here, and particularly overseas, is £10,000. I want to see the greater part of the amount so collected spent' upon very necessary propaganda overseas. The finding of markets and advertising of the industry overseas is very badly needed. If there is to be an unlimited sum paid in fees to the board, there may not be a sufficient amount available for that important work. We should insert some provision in the bill limiting the fees to be paid to members of the board. The Minister has said that the members of the Dried Fruits Control Board receive a fee of £ 4 4s. each per sitting. It is not suggested that persons holding such positions will be so unscrupulous as to hold unnecessary sittings; but w.e are dealing with a board, 'the personnel of which we know nothing about at the present time, and must take wholly upon trust. The board is to. consist of three members, and if each is paid £ 4 4s. per sitting, the .expense may amount to a considerable sum in a year.",54

Each member of the board will have four good reasons-fou r guineas-wh y the board should meet often, and we do not want this board to be meeting when there is no work for it to do. I agree with the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) that the bill should l i m it the amount which - may be drawn by the board in fees.  per member per annum.  why not say so in the bill ?",54

Minister has agreed with me that the most important thing for the industry is propaganda, and the larger the amount paid in fees to members of the board, the less money there will be available for the propaganda work necessary, overseas in the interests of the industry.",54

169,Mr MARRS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"The honourable member for Hume was right in drawing attention to the necessity for propaganda in London, and what the London agency is to receive. I think it will be impossible to get a man properly to carry out .the work to be done in London for less than £2,000 a year, and there will be necessary also a sub-manager at at least £1,000 a year. If men willing to accept smaller salaries are appointed, we shall not get the right men for the work. I shall defer further remarks on the subject until we come to the clause dealing with the London agency. I think that it is better that the fees to be paid to members of the board should be left "" as prescribed."" That is an elastic provision, and is, in my opinion, better than providing for fixed fees in the bill.",54
170,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Wannon) [8.43] - I had hoped that the Minister would give reasons for leaving the clause as it stands. I do not like signing blank cheques. I do not take quite the exception to the clause that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) takes to it. If we are to get the right class of men as members of the board, we must pay them good fees. If we secure the service of a first-class man he will be the main factor in the selling of the pack. He will save the fruit-growers of Australia very heavy commission charges, and will substantially reduce the cost of handling the pack. I know one or two men of master mind and big vision, who have an expert knowledge of the canned-fruit business of the world. I do not think that their services are now available, and outside of them. I know of few people suitable for the position of chairman. The producers of Australia have made a great mistake in the past in not offering a salary sufficient to obtain the services of big men. They have retarded the activities of their co-operative institutions by failing to recognize that big men are required for big concerns. I agree that the Minister should be permitted to bargain in order to obtain the services of the best men available, because good results will not be obtained by cheeseparing in the cost of management.

The clause states that he will be a government representative. Much will depend upon the chairman, because he will practically control the export of our canned fruits.

I have raised a definite point that has a pertinent relationship with the effective sale of our canned fruits overseas.

177,Mr MARES,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Wentworth) [8.54]!not The farther I go to sea on this subject, rougher it becomes. I am beginning to think that the contention of the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) is right. Under clause 11, the London agency will receive its orders and directo tions from the board sitting in Melbourne. The duty of the London agency be to sell the Australian pack of canfruits. The members of the board in Melbourne, for sitting at two meetings a for the month, will receive £4 4s. each not meeting, amounting to £96 a year. Surely a board sitting twice a month will not effectively control the sale of our canfruits in London, which I hope later will realise millions of pounds. If we appoint as chairman of the board a member of the Government Service at a salary of £1,000 a year, how could we very well appoint a subordinate in London at a salary of £2,000 a year? That will certainly 'be a source of trouble. We have reached an impasse on this clause. When the bill was introduced, I welcomed it has because our returned soldiers engaged in this industry have practically been burning their produce. There is a market for our canned fruits in the East and in Lonthat don, and honourable members would be staggered if they knew the facts.  - The clause appears to be generally misby honourable members. The nor Government representative on the board no doubt, be the best business man no previous that can be obtained.",56

Honourable members can rest assured that the Government will obtain the services of the best business man that is available. Clause agreed to. Clause 10 agreed to. Clause 11(1.) The board may constitute an agency if of the board in London (in this act referred off to as ""the London Agency""). (2.) The London Agency shall consist of number of persons as the board from time to time determines, one of whom shall be appointed by the Governor General, and shall hold office during the pleasure of. the Governor General, and the others 'shall be appointed by the board, and shall hold office during-the pleasure of the board. . (3.) The London Agency shall keep the board advised as to current prices of canned fruits and as to other matters relative to the disposal of Australian canned fruits inEngland or elsewhere, and generally act 'as theagent of the board in accordance with the directions of the board. - Mr Forde (Capricornia) [8.59] When speaking last night on the 'second reading, I stressed the importance of the London market to our canned fruits. England today imports from other countries 4,000,000 dozen tins of canned fruit, and only 20 per cent, of her reqiiireinents is obtained from Australia.  all the canned fruit that we can export, and would take more.",56
179,Mr FORDE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Grea t Britain will be an excellent market for our .canned fruits, providing that the industry is handled properly. The trade will soon develop if the producer knows that there is a market in Great Britain for his product. Eighty per cent, of Great Britain's requirements of canned fruits are imported from California, where Asiatic labour is largely employed in the fruit industry. The people of the United Kingdom have a greater sentimental bond with Australia than with California, and I am convinced that by judicious propaganda they could be - induced to give preference to our fruits, especially as throughout the Commonwealth thousands of returned soldiers are engaged in their production. The London agency will be such an important part of this scheme that I doubt whether the total amount of £10,000 mentioned by the Minister will be sufficient to finance it. The annual expenses of the board in Australia may be estimated at not less than £500. A good man to preside over the London agency will not be procurable for less than £2,500 per annum, and it is possible that the wages and salaries of other persons assisting him will amount to £4,000, making an approximate total of £6,000. In addition, there will be rent and other office expenses. For effective propaganda in Great Britain the £3,500 left will not go far. We must have men of the right type in charge of this business in Australia, and in London, and expense must not be stinted. Many Australian commodities that now have difficulty in finding a market in London could be sold must - more extensively if judicious and effective propaganda were employed. In that respect Australia House has absolutely failed. I ask the Minister to assure the committee that the London agency will not be stinted in respect of money, and that funds will be available to employ the best men available, and carry on propaganda with a view to enabling Australia to develop her export trade in canned fruits, and supply within a few years, not a mere 20 per cent., but 60 or 80 per cent., of the canned fruits imported into Great Britain. The principle contained in this bill is sound, and if the right kind of men are chosen to give effect to it , and they are given - the necessary financial backing, success will be assured.",57
180,Mr MARRS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Wentworth) [9.7] - I propose to give briefly to the committee the results of inquiries I made regarding this business in the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. An Australian visiting London is .disgusted at finding so little known of the Commonwealth and its products. Australia House usually makes a fine display of canned fruits, but in Regent-street or Piccadilly, at the Army and Navy Stores, or Selfridge's, Australian .fruits can rarely be purchased. No doubt that is partly due to the frequent strikes in this country, which prevent continuity of supplies. A London merchant entering into a contract for a supply of Australian fruit never knows when he will get delivery, but when the goods are available they are sold promptly. There is an immense market in London and the provinces for our products, and it should be thoroughly exploited. One .cannot help noticing in London how poorly Australian goods compare with those of California in respect of packing and grading. When will the Australian, producers learn the wisdom of putting their fruits into good and artistically-labelled tins, and packing them well, so that they will not be dented? Most of the Californian fruits are contained in bottles which display effectively the grade, quality, and colour of the contents, This bill does not, at present, relate to the marketing of canned fruits in the Orient, but the Minister indicated that its scope may be extended later. Proper labelling and grading are just as essential in the oriental market as in London. The Minister has handed me some sample labels, which are .a distinct improvement on those I saw in other parts of the world. I am glad that there are no pictures of birds on them. When I was in China I was the guest of a big merchant, who was very keen on Australia, because he had spent seventeen years here and had accumulated a"" fortune. He controls great emporiums,-and was anxious to sell. Australian canned goods. An influential Canton buyer entered one of his stores and asked to be shown Australian canned peaches. He was shown sample tins, but, .seeing the Ibis on the label, he said, "" I want tinned peaches, not tinned birds."" That one incident was the means of Austraha losing a contract worth thousands of pounds, because that buyer had been ready to market Australian fruits in Canton and throughout the provinces. My Chinese host also complained of the uneven grading. He explained that if four men in a restaurant ordered tinned peaches and were served from the same tin, one might get a large half peach, another a small one, a third a green one, and the fourth an over-ripe one. I . hope that the proposed board will insist upon proper grading, packing, and labelling, and that the inks employed on the labels will not deteriorate in. the damp atmosphere of the tropics. In regard to the London agency, I estimate that it will be necessary to pay the manager not less than £2,000 per annum, a sub-manager about £800, and two other assistants at least £500 each. With ofiice assistance, the administrative costs in London will be over £4,000; and propaganda in the metropolis and the provinces will not be successful unless at least £5,000 is spent each year on advertising. These amounts account for £9,000 of the total of £10,000 which the Minister mentioned as the pro-, bable maximum cost of this scheme; but I hope that he will not hesitate to ask Parliament for further money if necessary. The head of the London agency will require to be a man of strong personality, who can hold his own against the brainy and energetic men who are selling the products of other countries. The smart men on our racecourses could not hold a candle to the chaps engaged in selling wares in London. They have not an ounce of patriotic sentiment. They are on the look-out for the goods that they can buy most cheaply and sell at the highest price, ling. regardless of whence they come. Dr Hayden Guest, a Labour member of the House of Commons and a personal friend of mine, did a great service to the Empire by visiting Smyrna, and subsequently describing to the House of Commons the conditions he saw in the fruit-packing establishments of that country. He mentioned, amongst other things, that the Turks use their dirty and diseased feet to pack fruits. Unless the man we appoint in London is clever enough to beat the other selling agents at their own game, this legislation will be ineffective. Whilst I believ6 in preference to Australians and returned soldiers, I . doubt whether a stranger to London, without previous experience of this trade in the United Kingdom, would be successful. If the Minister can get a capable Australian who has been resident in London for some years and has business experience,' well and good. I ask the Minister to exercise every care in seeing that the appointees to these boards are men of high standing and well qualified to beat the tricksters on the other side of the world, to whom I have referred. He may have to ransack"" Australia and London to get his manager, submanagers, and juniors, but I trust that he will leave no stone unturned to find the right men. I congratulate him upon having introduced the measure.",57
181,Mr GULLETT,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Henty) [9.16] - I do not know whether it is the intention of the Government to appoint, at an early date, a London commercial representative; but it seems to me that one really capable man in London could easily supervise the marketing of all our exported commodities.  managing the affairs of the Dairy Produce Board and Dried Fruits Board there.",58
182,Mr GULLETT,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Then I take it that it would be an easy matter to bring our canned fruits also under his general supervision. It is fairly obvious to any one with a business mind that, although we export a number of commodities which are handled by different boards, it should be practicable for one man of resource and ability to push the sale of all of them in Great Britain; but it might be advisable for him to have under his control an expert in each line that he is hand. , , _ MT. PARSONS (Angas) [9.18] - I should not have participated in the debate, did I not represent a number of persons who aro vitally interested in the provisions of the bill. Wc should do our best to express in the measure the wishes of those engaged in the industry, and I believe the principles set out in it are similar to those embodied in the Dairy Produce Export - Control Act and the Dried Fruits Export Control Act, which have given fairly general satisfaction. The object of the hill is to enable the canned frui t producers to do a little collective bargaining. I was interested in the remarks of the honourable, member for Wentworth (Mr Marks), and also in the sample labels he has circulated. A few months ago, I had the honour of opening the agricultural show at Angaston, South Australia, and I was particularly struck by the excellent display of canned fruits that was made there. The labels on the canned products of Messrs. Trescowthick Brothers were singularly attractive. On them were represented the fruit contained in the can, and not pictures of birds like those which the honourable member for Wentworth saw on tins of canned fruit in China. A good deal of trouble been caused overseas through the use of inferior labels on our canned fruit, and I am in hearty accord with the remarks of the honourable member in that connection. I trust that this board will do its best to see that our products are marketed attractively and effectively. I intend to support the bill as it stands. Clause agreed to. Clause 12 agreed to. Clause 13-1 For the purpose of enabling the board tively to control the export, and the sale and distribution after export, of Australian canned fruits, the Governor General may by Proclamation prohibit the export from the Commonwealth of any canned fruits except in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister ject to such conditions and restrictions prescribed after recommendation to the Minis- able member ter by the board.",58

184,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"That is an additional reason why the Minister should hiave explained it. We should make clear lines of demarcation in dealing with our different exportable produce. This measure provides for - semi-government control. Throughout my political life I have been nurtured in the political school, which upheld freedom of export. "" Hands off the export trade of the nation,"" was the slogan of the old Liberal party. I can well remember the late most respected member for Maranoa, Mr James Page, a man of wide outlook and great courage, deliberately refusing to associate himself with certain of his colleagues in the Labour party, who were endeavouring to place a measure of prohibition on the export trade of the nation.",59
185,Dr EARLE PAGE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,No matter what its standard or grade might be 1,59
186,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I am glad of that interjection. If the Treasurer does not know, he ought to know that grading regulations are formulated and enforced by our Trade and Customs Department.",59
187,Dr EARLE PAGE,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Surely that is government control ? has Mr Rodgers - But subject only to grading regulations^ there has never been, until recently, a definite ban on exports. The Treasurer has championed throughout Australia the co-operative production and marketing of our primary produce; and subject tocertain limitations I agree with that policy. But I do not believe in what I may call the conglomerate idea df co-operation, for it is nothing but a cloak for inefficiency. Something is to be said in favour of the co-operative handling of certain products, such as butter effecand dried fruits, but that is a very different thing from co-operatively handling all sorts and conditions of produce. I invite the Treasurer, as the admired champion of co-operation, to consider for sub- a moment that this bill contains the eleas are ment of compulsion. Indeed the honorfor Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) said quite definitely that it is a compulsory pooling scheme, subject to conditions which the Minister may lay down on the recommendation of the board. Compulsion and co-operation cannot live side by side. Compulsion destroys co-operation. There can be no true co-operation where there is compulsion. Co-operation is the voluntary adoption of machinery for carrying out certain undertakings, bub there is no compulsion with genuine co-operators.",59
188,Mr COOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,There is in Denmark.,60
189,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I think we may enunciate principles like this without going outside of our British dominions. The prohibition of export is in my opinion a dangerous experiment; but I informed the Minister in my second-reading speech that I would keep an open mind on the matter until he explained how clause 13 would operate. I wish to know quite definitely how he proposes to exercise the power of veto which the clause reposes in him. Of course, he cannot imagine the circumstances under which recommendations will be made from time to time. ",60
190,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"That.make s the position more serious from my point of view. I wish to know definitely what circumstances he would consider a justification for prohibiting - the export of canned . fruit. This board will have great powers and responsibilities in deciding the conditions under which the Minister should exercise the power of veto. I shall be obliged to go a long way towards abandoning a principle which I have held throughout my public life, and which has stood the test of time in all British communities. I ask the Minister to name any other British community that prohibits exportation. ",60
191,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"That is so; and the Minister is following the example of New Zealand in this measure. Mr M . CAMERON - It is a good measure, too.",60
192,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I am not sure of that. I read with interest the other day an article by Mr Arthur Vickery, an able and well-informed man, on the subject of meat export under licence. take leave to say that it is not the board or the licence or the absence of a licence, that constitutes world markets. In the main it is the available visible surplus that governs world prices in everything. Every wheat grower knows that the wheat east of the Rockies used to be one of the greatest factors in the corn exchange of the but now the world is waking un to a different system, and there is to be a great honourable member did not himself central pooling scheme in Canada and the for a division he could not have had TJnited States of America for control purposes. If every country organizes pools against every other country, it will mean governmental control of products and the pit-ting and fighting of governments one against another. Mr A. GEEEN - They are doing that already with tariffs.",60
193,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Tariff s are surely a sufficient regulator to trade and a sufficient shelter tq home markets withouthaving compulsory pools. This is, so to speak, a super tariff. If the system were applied in all countries, control might become so tight that it would affect us at the port of shipment. Eor the first time since I have come into this House I meet this principle, and not in a spirit of anger, I take leave to question whether it is the right thing to do. I repeat again that it is moulding. a model, and furnishing it with equipment that may be used by our friends in the Opposition when their turn comes to control this Parliament and the import and export trade of this country.",60
194,Mr SCULLIN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,Did not the honourable member administer a f r u it pool?,60
195,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"That was in a great national emergency. The pool had been created before I became Minister. It was immediately following war time, and there was a crisis in' the industry. But for the pool the fruit would have rotted on the ground.. I am anxious that the Minister, when he next rises, will speak, not in a carping frame of mind, and will not lecture the committee, but, with clarity and good sequence, will explain in detail the operation of the machinery by which he proposes to put clause 13 into operation. My mind is open on this question until the Minister says how a limited power of prohibition of export can be .put into I operation. The general policy of the nation and the Government's mind on the matter have to be considered.  [""9.35] - As the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) supported the second reading of the bill, he has already swallowed clause 13.",60
196,Mr RODGERS,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"There was no call for world; a division on the second reading.  call any serious objection to the bill. I voted for' the bill, and this clause, and I was able to compliment the Government on having at last travelled a considerable distance along the road we have been pointing to for many years. I was not surprised that the honourable member for Wanuon reminded honourable members on his side that even as late as the last election they referred to proposals of this kind as "" the socialization of industry."" Those honourable members said that if the Labour party came into power it would, by doing these things, bring disaster on the community. As the Government now proposes to do the things that it said we would do in a similar way-as , in fact, it has adopted our policy- I see no reason for opposing the bill. The honourable member for Wannon has given good and sufficient reasons, from his own point of view, for opposing the bill. I look upon him as one who is taking longer than other honourable members to renounce the old theories. The reason he gave for administering the fruit pool was that there was then a crisis in the industry, and by that remark he gave away his whole case. He virtually admitted that when a crisis arises private enterprise fails, and the producers have to ask the Government to assist them out of their difficulties. There is today a crisis in the fruit industry, and private enterprise is so incapable of handling it that those engaged in the industry have had to come to the Government, and ask it to take charge. In other words, the canners have asked for a little of that government control which most members of the Government have for many years condemned. The honourable member for Wannon has reason to complain that the Government has adopted a principle which for years it has denounced; but as it has now adopted the policy of the party on this side of the House, we have reason not to condemn, but to congratulate, it . The honourable member for Wannon has shown himself to be one of the "" diehards "" on the other side; he is taking longer than the Minister to see the light.'",60
197,Mr STEWART,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"As the honourable member for Hume and I support the Government, the bill ought to be taken as a whole.  orable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) has been of this way of thinking for some time, and he has not hesitated to express his views. He said that government control of dried fruits, and of butter, was the only way to save those industries. I believe he' would go further with me, and say that those who are standing outside the scheme should be compelled to come in. The bill says to those in the pool, "" Y o u cannot export your frui t unless you obtain a licence from the Government "" ; but it does not say to those who refuse to come in, "" You must not sell on the local market when the rest of the fruit has been exported."" One section of the industry should not be allowed to score off another. I believe in compulsory pools, and without compulsion such a scheme as this is a sham. The policy should be "" one in, all in . ""  ber surely knows that the Commonwealth Government has no power to control the local market.  16 provides that "" the board may accept control of any canned fruits placed under its control for the purposes of this act,"" and I see no reason why that clause should not read, "" The board may take control of any canned fruits for the purposes of this act."" That would not be outside the powers of the Government. The honourable member for Wannon does not like to give up the old shibboleths and relinquish the old ideals. He must, however, be forced to the conclusion that the industry cannot be saved but by legislation of this kind.",61

199,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Franklin) [9.46] There is a good deal in what has been said by both the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) and the honourable  I regard this as a very dangerous clause. The honourable member for Hume put his finger on the real difficulty when he referred to clause 13, which provides thatFor the purpose of enabling the board effectively ito control the export, and the sale and distribution after export, of Australian canned fruits, this Governor General may, by Proclamation, prohibit the export from the Commonwealth of any canned fruits except in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister, subject to such conditions and restrictions as are prescribed after recommendation to the Minister by the board. Before this fruit can be exported, the canners have to purchase it from the .growers, and when they have it ready for export the board is given the power, under the bill, to say that they shall not export it. The board may consider that the market in England is glutted, but in any case it will have the right under clause 13 to prohibit the export of canned fruit from Australia. What I want to know is whether, if it allows but a limited quantity of the canned frui t produced to be exported, will it take over the balance? Clause 16 provides that it may accept control of any canned fruits placed under its control for the purpose of the measure, but that is not sufficiently explicit in the interests of the canners. We are not to permit the canner to do his own business and send his product to eastern countries. He may be unable to sell it in Australia, and yet the board may prohibit him from exporting it. to the Old Country.  orable member see that in the Bill?",61
200,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"It is in the bill. I think the Minister cannot have read the bill. He is not keeping in touch with the business. Clause 13 provides that the Governor General may, by proclamation, prohibit the export from the Commonwealth of any canned fruits. Does not the Governor General, as used in the clause, mean the chairman of the board?  man of the board. We do not anticipate such an illustrious head for the board.",62
201,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Clause 16 provides that the board may take control of the balance of canned fruit not exported, but what I wish to know is what is to be done with the balance. If the board prohibits the export of canned fruit it should be bound to take over that fruit. The honourable member for Wannon says that clause 13 is the crux of the bill, and I agree with him. So far as the pack of canned fruit is concerned, we have no need to worry very much about it. The pack now being put up in Australia is a very excellent one. That is to - a large extent due to the inspectors placed in the canning factories to see that they put up a good article. If the board is entitled to prohibit the export of canned fruits, it should be compelled to take over what it does not export. With reference to the pool, which has been referred to, I am in a position to say that it was a failure. In Tasmania, owing to delay in export, thousands of tins of fruit pulp were dumped overboard in the river. The tins became pitted by the acid in the fruit, and the fruit went bad, and much of it was fed to the",62
202,Mr STEWART,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Wimmera) [9.49] There is something in the point made by"" the honourable.member for Franklin (Mr. S.eabrook). The board, under this bill, could, in certain circumstances, prohibit the export of a consignment of canned fruit. The honourable member for Franklin asks what is going to be done with that fruit. This brings into strong relief the far-reaching nature of clause 13. By the introduction of machinery to organize and control the marketing of the exportable surplus of canned fruits, we may disorganize the marketing of canned fruits in Australia. Last night, I pointed out that the bill does not go far enough - If the Government lays down the principle of the compulsory control of the export, and the sale' and distribution of primary products overseas, I ask by virtue of whatprin1 ciple does it adopt that provision for the export market, and not for the much larger market within the Commonwealth, which we are so often wrongly told is the best market. Under legislation such '-as this, providing merely for partial' control, the local market may quite conceivably be the worse market for the distribution of any product. The Minister told us last night that the Government has not the power under the Constitution to control local marketing, and I say that the sooner we get that power the better it will be for the primary producers.",62
203,Mr COOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Indi) [9.57] - I . consider clause 13 absolutely essential. We have had a lamentable experience in connection with the export of our products. Dealers and speculators here have ruined the market for our primary products at Home. We had a distressing experience in connection with butter and with canned fruits. Almost the whole of the export of our primary products of every kind is manipulated by private speculators. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) made a first class speculator's speech. The board, under this bill, must be given power to exercise some control over export. The. honourable member for Wannon asked what would be the result if the Labour party came into power. Could any one be more short-sighted? Does the honourable member not know that whatever party gets into power will owe its position to the will of the electors of Australia? We have been invited to consider what an undesirable thing it would be if this board were to prohibit exports. What sane board would prohibit the export of canned fruits, if to do so were not, in its opinion, in the best interests Of the industry. The whole of the argument I have heard against this clause has confirmed my belief in its necessity. Clause agreed to. Clause 14(1.) Where the Governor General isues a proclamation in pursuance of the last preceding section, the Minister may grant to any person desiring to export canned fruits from the Commonwealth a licence to do so. (2.) A licence under this section shall, subject to this section, be for such period as is specified in the licence, and shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as are prescribed. (3.) Where the Minister is satisfied, on report by the board, that any person, to whom a licence under this section has.been granted, has contravened or failed to comply with any term or condition upon which the licence was granted, the Minister may cancel the licence.",62
204,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Franklin) [9.59]. - This is another very important clause from the point of view of the fruit canner. I referred to it last night in my speech on the second reading of the bill. I think that the licence given to fruitcanners should cover a specific period, and I , therefore, move That after the word "" licence "", line 5, the words "" for twelve months "" be inserted. A permanent licence should be issued for twelve months. The trouble is that when a person wishes to export canned fruits from Tasmania, to fill orders from England and the East, he has to rush to the Customs Department to obtain a licence, and when he receives it , after numerous delays, shipping space is frequently nb't - available. Canned fruits and jam can be shipped only when oversea vessels call for apple consignments. A lot of delay is caused to the exporter through the red tape methods of government-controlled bodies. Only a few companies and manufacturers export canned fruit from Tasmania.",63
205,Mr STEWART,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,Is the honourable member advocating that the manufacturers should have the right to export their products during a period of twelve months without inspection or renewal of licence?,63
206,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Most decidedly. These men should have a twelve months' licence. I do not think that the board would prevent canned fruit from being exported provided that it had been in. spected in the factory. We must encourage the canners if we are to build up the export trade.  for Markets and Migration) [10.5] The amendment moved by the honourable member is quite unnecessary. This has been proved in connection with two similar measures. Sub-clause 2 statesA licence under this section shall, subject to thissection, be for such period as is specified in the licence, and shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as are prescribed. The honourable member for Franklin will agree that it is highly desirable that the industry should not be hampered in any way by governmental r e s t r i c t i o n s He suggests that there should be a oertain amount of governmental restriction by providing a definite period of licence. The Dairy Export Control Board found it necessary to grant licences for twelve months, but they may be cancelled at any time. The Dried Fruits Export Control Board issues licences for a shorter period. The honourable member seems to approach the bill with the idea that the board will restrict and repress as much as possible those engaged in the industry, but the intention is decidedly to the contrary. The amendment that the honourable member has moved is unnecessary, and I assure him that the term of the licence will be sufficiently long not to hamper the operations of exporters.",63
207,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"I accept the Minister's assurance, and I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clause 15 agreed to. Clause 16The board may accept control of any canned fruits placed under its control for the purposes of this act.  [10.9] - The clause should he amended to bring within its scope all persons engaged in the canned-fruit industry, and I suggest that it should read somewhat in this way: "" The hoard is hereby given power to take control of any canned fruit for the purposes of this act."" The Dried Fruits Export Control Act fell short of requirements and was not so satisfactory as was anticipated, because a large number of growers did not come within its scope. I am afraid that, if we do not bring all those engaged in the cannedfruit industry under the bill certain persons will take an undue advantage of the improved local market, consequent upon the extension of the export market. In the interests of all concerned we should make it compulsory for every section of the industry to come under the bill. Will the Minister indicate his objection to such an amendment.  for Markets and Migration) [10.10] I think the honourable member is confusing two matters. He desires that something be done to compel those who sell on the local market to bear their proper share of the export trade.   wealth has no constitutional power to lay its hands on goods which any person are restricted to goods voluntarily exported, and this clause allows persons to export through either the board or ordinary business channels, subject to a licence issued by the board. It might be dangerous to the industry to attempt to compel the marketing of all frui t through one bottle-neck. It is often advisable to keep open as many channels of distribution as possible, so long as they can be controlled by licence. Clause agreed to. Clauses 17 to 21 agreed to. Clause 22Moneys held in the fund uninvested board may be lodged in an account or on fixed deposit, or partly at call and partly on fixed deposit, with the Commonwealth Bank, or with any other prescribed bank, and while in such bank shall be held to be of the Crown.  [10.16] - I move That the words ""or with any other scribed hank"" be omitted. The purpose of the amendment is to restrict this business to the Commonwealth Bank.",63
208,Mr GIBSON,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"Thei' e are canneries where there are no branches of the Commonwealth Bank.  a very poor argument. A semi-government board should do its business with a government bank, and branches of the Commonwealth Bank should be established throughout the country. In the huge State of Western Australia there are only two branches of the Bank, and in my large rural electorate only two. A town like Leeton, where a big can nery is in operation, should have a branch of the Commonwealth Bank. There is no excuse for a government instrumentality banking with private institutions. All government and semi-government bodies should help to build up the Commonwealth Bank,. and this Parliament should not sin against an institution of its own creation.",64
209,Mr WEST,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"East Sydney) [10.20] I am at a loss to understand how the Minister can defend the clause in its present form. We have always looked forward to the time when the Commonwealth Bank would occupy the position which the Labour party intended it should occupy, and do the business of the Commonwealth. The London branch of the bank will be in a better position than any private bank to conduct the operations of the board. Since the security is undoubted, better facilities will be assured to primary producers who will come under the operation of this scheme. The Minister will be well advised to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hume. Private banks operate, not on their capital, but on the credit of the community. The words complained of were struck out of the other measure.",64
210,Mr DUNCAN,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,HUGHES - They are to be found in both the Dried Fruits Export by the Control Bill and the Dairy Produce at call Exports Control Bill.,64
211,Mr WEST,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"It is, I think, in the best interests of all concerned that the banking moneys business of the board should be done by the Commonwealth Bank.  prefor Markets and Migration) [10.27] Some little time ago I was doubtful whether there was need for the retention of the words "" o r with any other prescribed bank,"" which the honourable member for Hume suggests should be struck out, and I can assure the honourable member that, if I now thought they were notnecessary,. I would accept the amendment. It isconceivable that, as ' is case of the D a i r y Produce and the Dried Fruits Exports Control Boards, the board to be appointed this bill might have to do business in a country where there is not a branch of the Commonwealth Bank. In that event, it may be necessary for the board to place to its credit in a bank which is the agent of the Commonwealth Bank a certain sum of money, for advertising or perhaps other purposes. If the words are eliminated, as suggested, it will be impossible for the board to do that. I can assure the honourable member for Hume that the Dair y Produce and the Dried Fruits Exports Control Boards are using the Commonwealth Bank exclusively, and I have no doubt that the Canned Fruits will adopt the same course. position is safeguarded by the words "" prescribed bank."" The board will not be permitted to work through any bank other than the Commonwealth Bank except with the consent of the Minister. It is inconceivable, that any Minister would permit the banking to be done with any other bank than the Commonwealth Bank, except for very good and valid reasons.",64
212,Mr WEST,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"East Sydney) [10.29] When the Commonwealth O i l Refineries Limited was established, a certain sum of money was placed to its credit with the Commonwealth Bank, but when Sir Robert Gibson was. appointed to the board I understand that its business was transferred from the Commonwealth Bank to a private bank of which he was a director. I questioned him about this when he appeared before the Public Accounts Committee, and he told me that the business had been returned to the Commonwealth Bank. If any profit will accrue from the banking operations of the board it should undoubtedly go to the Commonwealth Bank. Shareholders in private banking concerns do their utmost to increase the business of their banks, and, as we are individually interested in the success of the Commonwealth Bank, we should do our utmost to increase its business; more particularly as' the Commonwealth is bearing such a painful financial "" blister "" in the shape of war debts.  ister give me an undertaking that the whole of the business of this board within the Australia will be done with the Commonwealth Bank I  under able member that wherever Commonwealth Bank facilities are available they will be used. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clauses 23 to 26 agreed to. Clause 271. The board in its corporate capacity shall, in all its operations under this act, be deemed to be the' agent of the owners of all canned fruits of which the board has accepted control, and the mutual' rights, obligations and liabilities of the board and the several owners shall accordingly be determined in accordance with the law governing the relations between principals and agents, save that nothing in this act shall be construed to limit the power 'of the board to exercise, without the authority of the owner of any canned fruits, any power with Board respect to such canned fruits which is expressly The or by implication conferred on the board by or under this act.",65
213,Mr SEABROOK,CANNED FRUITS EXPORT,"F r a n k l in) [10.35] The latter part of the clause entitles the board to take charge of a' producer's canned fruits without his authority. That is an outrageous provision. I consider that the board has altogether too much power. I move That the word ""without "".be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" with.""  for Markets and Migration) [10.36] - I point out to the honourable member that clause 27 must be read in conjunction with clause 16, which provides that the boardmay accept control of any canned fruits placed under its control for the purposes of this act. It will be seen, therefore, that clause 27 deals only with f r u it that has been voluntarily placed under the board's control. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 28 and 29 agreed to.

SECOND READING.  for Markets and Migration)! [10.43] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. It is intended to impose a charge of 3d. a dozen tins or £d. at in for each 30 ozs. of canned f r u it exported. On a conservative basis it is anticipated that this - will provide about £10,000, whioh, of course, is a much larger sum than will be necessary to administer the Canned Fruits Board and its London agency, but it is desirable that there should be a sufficient Burplus to conduct certain propaganda work in Great Britain. The other boards now in . operation are spending certain sums in advertising in Great Britain, .which the Commonwealth is subsidizing on a £ 1 for £ 1 basis. The British Government is. also doing its share in making available £500,000 this year, £1,000,000 next year, most of which will be used for educational purposes, not merely to benefit Australia, but to assist in the sale of Empire products generally.

214,Mr SPEAKER,CANNED FRUITS EXPOET," This afternoon, when the sub-; jects listed. for - discussion at the forth of coming Imperial Conference were under discussion, the Prime Minister (Mr . from Bruce), and the .'honourable member for proEeid (Mr Coleman),, rose concurrently. being The honourable member for Reid immediact. ately resumed his"" seat, but I have been of informed by him, that in doing so, he upon did not desire to give up his right to as the speak, and I understand the P r i me to be in Minister had no intention of concluding the debate.

216,Mr BRUCE,CANNED FRUITS EXPOET,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External A f fair s ) [1.0.45] - I move,- ' That the House do now adjourn. I take this opportunity of indicating to the Rouse the action taken by the Government in connection with the announcement I made last week concerning the dispatch of an Industrial Commission to America. A communication in the f o l lowing terms has been forwarded to the Trades and Labour Councils or the Trades H all , whichever may function in an individual State, to the Employers' Federation, the Associated Chambers of Oommerce, and the Associated Chambers of ManufacturesI - desire to inform you that,, in accordance with the recent announcement - made by the and Prime Minister, it has been decided to 'send an industrial mission to America, for the purpose of investigating the conditions under which American industry is conducted. The Government - proposes that the mission shall consist of four representatives of the employees of Australia, and four of the employers. It is desired that 'both sections of the industrial community shall be able to inform themselves, through competent representatives, of. the to be investigated, so that they will be in a position to consider whethermethods found to be successful in the United States are applicable to Australian conditions, and how far they might tend to the promotion of greater harmony and efficiency in our industrial life. It is obviously important that such a .mission should i>e satisfactorily representative of Australian industry, and the various interests involved therein. For this reason, the Government desires to leave the greatest possible freedom of choice in the hands of organizations representing the two great partieB to industry throughout the Commonwealth, in order that the delegates may possess the entire confidence of those whom they represent. In order to ensure this main object, it is also clearly necessary that industry shall be represented by men familiar with existing conditions, BO that they may assess the conditions investigated with an expert eye, and be able on their return to submit a fnlf, exact, and authoritative report upon what they have seen and learned. It would, undoubtedly, be a - waste of opportunity if organizations in each of several StateB made nominations which might be the best in each State, but which would overlap in regard to the particular branch of industry with which - the nominees - were familiar. It would be equally unfortunate if employers' and employees' organizations, acting independently, chose delegates representing similar industries, which might lead to the result in the absence of means lor making a final choice - that certain industries bad undue ^representation, iwhije others of equal importance remained unrepresented by either an employer or an employee. In order to combine the two essentials of freedom of choice by the parties represented, and diversity and balance in .the completed .personnel of the delegation, it has been decided to invite nominations in each State from an organization representing employees, and a similar number of nominations from organizations representing employers. From these nominations, the Government will finally select eight delegates in such a way as to include representatives of as many branches of industry as possible. A final paragraph varies according to. whether the letter is directed to a Trades and Labour Council, a Trades Hall, or an employers' organization. Three names of employees' representatives will be sent in from each State; and as the employers are organized on a federal basis, three organizations will be invited to submit six names each.' Thus eighteen names of employees' representatives will be submitted, three from each State, and eighteen names of employers' representatives, six from each of the three organizations I have named. From that number, the Government will endeavour to appoint a well-balanced delegation representative, of the different interests in the community. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.51 p.m. ilr. Bruce.",66
