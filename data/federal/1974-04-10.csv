0,NA,Unknown,"I inform the House that this is the third Report in which the Committee has commented on restrictive practices. It did so in its First Import Prices Report (timber), in the Meatmeal Prices Report and now in this one. In this connection I take pride in informing the House that my Committee is the first arm of the Legislature that has asked the Commissioner of Trade Practices, who incidentally has issued six Annual Reports on his operations, to give evidence to it on the effectiveness of the existing legislation. Of course this evidence was limited to the restrictive agreements in the flat glass industry. The Commissioner's evidence is at Appendix II of this Report and the Committee recommends that the Parliament should take note of this evidence when deliberating on trade practices legislation. A dissent has been made from the recommendation that there should be new improved trade practices legislation on the grounds that imports of flat glass do not require the implementation of restrictive trade practices legislation and that the Commissioner of Trade Practices believes that there was not the practical effect in the flat glass agreements. 1 leave it to honourable members to read the report carefully, particularly the Appendix containing the Commissioner's evidence, in order the ascertain whether or not there is a meaning for or a justification of this point.of view. I commend the report to the House. Before you call on the next matter, Speaker, might I point out that there is agreement that a motion be moved that the report be now noted. Mr Daly- I ask leave of the House to move that the report be noted.",56
1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",56
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the debate adjourned? Mr Chipp-There is no point.,56

5,Mr HURFORD,Unknown,"I ask for leave to make short statement about this matter. with the' right honourable member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) that in these circumstances he should be given the opportunity later, if. he wished, to carry on a debate on the report. Therefore, I wanted to keep to that agreement and ask that the debate be adjourned.",56
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I think it might be better that when the right honourable member for Higgins returns to the House he be given leave tq make a statement. I think that would cover the matter. NA Report,56

8,Mr COHEN,SELECT COMMITTEE ON ROAD SAFETY,"Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.",56
9,Mr SPEAKER,SELECT COMMITTEE ON ROAD SAFETY,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",56
10,Mr COHEN,SELECT COMMITTEE ON ROAD SAFETY,"On 25 September 1973 I had the pleasure of presenting to Parliament the first report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety. The report recommended the creation of a national authority on road safety and commented on the constitutional position and statistical needs in the road safetyfields.During the intervening Mr months the Committee has devoted its time an to inquiring into the environment in which the motor vehicle moves, specifically roads, road engineering, town planning and roadside obstacles. I have very much pleasure in presenting this report to the House. I would like to make some comments on the Committee, its staff and the report itself. This is my second experience in chairing a House committee and I have been delighted with the work both of the staff and the members of . that Committee. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA",56
11,Mr CHIPP,THE PARLIAMENT," Mr Speaker, can I raise a matter of procedure? We were under the impression that there is a resolution of the a House that you leave the chair at 6.15 p.m. I agreed Can you give us some guidance?",56
12,Ms SPEAKER,THE PARLIAMENT,"I think that the honourable member will agree that I leave the chair at a time which is in conformity with what the Leader of the House suggests. Sometimes we sit beyond that time, as in the case of a division. But it has never been, I think, kept right to the minute.",57
13,Mr CMPP,THE PARLIAMENT,I accept that. But rumours are circulating in this place that we are going to sit right through the time normally set aside for the suspension for dinner. I would have thought that that should be understood now just before the Opposition is asked to assist Government in giving leave for anything. Could we have the intentions of the Government? Have they been conveyed to the Leader on our side or to the Whips or anybody? We want to be as co-operative as possible but 1 think that as a matter of courtesy we ought to be told what the Government intends to do.,57
14,Mr SPEAKER,THE PARLIAMENT,"Order ! Actually the time resumption of 6.15 is not set down in any standing order. It is a matter for the House to decide. Could the Leader of the House tell me what is the position?  House) (6.18)-by leave-Earlier this evening we requested the Opposition to proceed with some important supply Bills and I put to you. for reasons best known to itself the Opposition said that it wanted the Bills adjourned to a later hour this day. These Bills are exceedingly important. They must be in another place at 8 p.m. It will not take the full tea hour to deal with them. They could easily have been disposed of I would imagine in asIhat 15 minutes had they been accepted. But as sumption the Opposition does not agree there is no alternative for the Government but to go making through the usual procedures. If these proBills: cedures are taken to the full they will 50 minutes to implement. Quite frankly, the Government proposes to take this course of action unless the Opposition sees fit to co-operate. Mr Chipp-Again , with your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to say that we traditional want to co-operate. I have not been privy the discussions, if in fact there have been discussions. So might I suggest that the ourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) who tells me that his statement will take approximately 15 minutes to make, be given leave tofinishhis speech. We would to grant leave for him to do so. After consultation with my Leader and, I hope, with the Leader of the House during these 15 minutes, in which we could ascertain what the Government's problems and intentions are, we could come to a responsible attitude about it. We could see what the position is after we listen to the Government's case, if it is prepared to talk to us. So leave is granted.",57
15,Mr DALY,THE PARLIAMENT, I have great respect for the honourable member who has spoken. It is a pity he does not instil a bit the of that courtesy into some of his leaders. NA Suspension of Standing Orders,57
16,Mr DALY,FINANCIAL LEGISLATION," I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the orders of the day for the of the debate on the following BillsMr Chipp- I rise to order. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) bad your call, Mr Speaker. He has presented a report. He has asked for leave and leave is being",57

It should be understood by those opposite that these measures have nothing to do with this session of the Parliament but are to carry on the supply for the first three or four months of the next financial year, 1974-75. They are Bills that generally go through withto out any opposition. They are necessary for any whatever government might be in office. They honare a normal procedure, and quite frankly the Government does not intend to be stood over by the Opposition and ask what its intentions are before they are passed. Having said be happy so much, I formally move: That the question be now put. Mr Chipp- I ask for your guidance, Mr Speaker.",57

These are important measures on which there is generally no disagreement in this Parliament. It is true that probably lengthier time may have been allowed for debate, but the Bills are necessary for any government to carry on the business of the nation, particularly in the first half of the new financial year. The fact is that at this stage the Bills are not acceptable to the Opposition. The Opposition is refusing to pass them. It is obstructively stopping the Government from making this money available and the stopping of payment for all those things so necessary to the running of this country is something that the Government cannot countenance. Had the Opposition, not been obstructive and discontented and, I suppose, downhearted at the prospect that is facing them, these Bills would have gone through easily.",59

AYES Mr SNEDDEN (Bruce-Leade r of the Opposition) (6.51)- Mr Speaker, we did not divide on the motion for the gag because if we had divided, given that normally a division takes 7 to 8 minutes to count, it would have Klugman, R. E. Lamb, A. H . left for discussion on these Bills 7 or 8 minutes. By not dividing on this motion we will have 15 minutes to discuss 2 Bills, one MCKenzie, D. C. Morris. P. F. of which provides supply of $ 1,800m and the other of which provides supply of $513m. On this legislation which seeks to appropriate Olley, F. $2.3m this Government allows 15 minutes for Patterson. R. A. debate, but we have 15 minutes only because we did not divide on the gag. If somebody cares to divide $2,300m by 15 he will get an idea of what sort of a spendthrift government Uren, T. Wallis. L . G. this is, and he will get an idea of what sort of a government this is which treats parliamentary democracy in this way. Then, would you believe it, this Government says that the Senate has no right to review appropriations made in this House? The Government gives 15 minutes to debate legislation appropriating $2,300m, and then it says it ought to go through this House just like that and that when it gets to the Senate the Senate has no right to review it. If ever a situation has demonstrated that this Government has no concept of parliamentary democracy from start to finish, it is this one. If ever anything has shown that there is a determination on the part of the Government to live out its life in deceit and secrecy, it has been this. Mr Street-Dra g out its life.",60
37,Mr SNEDDEN,PAIRS,"Draggin g out its life, as I am reminded by the honourable member for Corangamite. Here is a government which is so unaware of what is happening that it could not even provide us with the times that it intended to allot for this debate until after the divisions were taken. It was so ashamed of the small amount of time that it kept the time secret, and it was not until the provisions of the House positively demanded that it state the times that it produced the timetable. It is perfectly clear to everybody that this Government has abandoned any sense of decency. It was dishonest from the moment it commenced its life as a government, and it will continue to be dishonest until the end of its life as a government. Can anybody forget the promise that was made Labor Party in Opposition? Remember that promise: 'Under a Labor Government there will be less inflation.'? Inflation has multiplied 3 times. Food prices have gone up 5 times. Dishonesty! Can anybody remember that wonderful phrase in the Labor policy document which said: 'Under a Labor government we will reduce interest rates.'? What has happened? Interest rates are the highest they have been since the Rum Rebellion. This Government said that taxation rates were crippling and that it would reduce them but it has increased them by over $1,500m this year. The Labor Party said that it would improve our armed forces. That is the only thing that it has lowered. The Prime Minister said that under Labor there would be fewer industrial strikes because, he said, Labor has an understanding with the unions. It has an understanding indeed! The unions are running this country. Honourable members opposite would not know what to do. They just do not understand. We made it clear in the House that when we come into government we will need the money which these supply Bills provide. We will need that supply for next year. We have not had an opportunity to examine the Bills to see whether the figures are right. How could we? They were introduced into the House an hour ago. We cannot examine them, but we were prepared to allow them to go through this House when the Prime Minister stated that there would be an election. He still refuses to state that there will be an election. Why? The probability is that Caucus is meeting at this very moment trying to make up its mind. Everybody knows that there was to be a Caucus meeting at 6.15. At 6.15 the Caucus meeting was called off so that the House could continue to sit. What did the Labor Party do? It sent the shadow of the Prime Minister, that very pale shadow of the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Mathews), into the chamber to listen. No doubt he will be doing the reporting. He will go to the Prime Minister like the good little chap, he is and say: 'Oh, dear Lord, this is what happened in the House'.  job as private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition.",61
38,Mr SNEDDEN,PAIRS,"I do not know about that. He has not done well enough to qualify for by the that job, but he will go ahead and report to the Prime Minister. It will sound like a negro spiritual with the words, 'Oh, dear Lord'. That is the sort of praying that will be needed. The Prime Minister, this man who is supposed to lead the destiny of this country, this man who is supposed to provide leadership, this man who has that duty entrusted to him apparently does not know to this moment whether he will have an election. If he does know, why does he not say so? Why does he not come into the House and say that there will be an election, the writs will be issued on a certain day, nominations will close on a certain day and the election will be held on a certain day. If he knows, why does he not say so? Mr Chipp-He has to get Caucus approval.",61
39,Mr SNEDDEN,PAIRS,"I am reminded by the honourable member for Hotham that this great leader cannot take a decision until he gets Caucus approval for it. So he has to nurse it to his bosom in secrecy because he cannot announce it. How can the people of Australia have confidence in a government which is being dishonest in every promise it has made, which has been shameful and deceptive in its actions, which appointed a man as Ambassador to Ireland on 14 March and had not disclosed it by 2 April and it was only by the efforts of a pressman that the ambassadorial appointment was disclosed? Then the Prime Mmister says: 'Well, of course, on 14 March the Hon. V. C. Gair became Ambassador to Ireland'. The Attorney-General knew, the Prime Minister knew, yet they allowed that man to sit in the Senate and never raised an issue about it. I do not feel any hesitation in reporting to this House that I had a telephone call from the Prime Minister just before 1 o'clock today. The Prime Minister said to me that he would like my co-operation to keep the Senate sitting after 5 o'clock because he would like these Bills to go through the Senate today. I said: 'Well, I will co-operate with you, but I would like you to co-operate with me by telling me the date for the issue of writs, the date on which nominations close and the election day'. 'Oh', he said, T do not know that I can do that'. Why could he not do it? Caucus had not told him, so he could not tell me. This man, the leader of this country, is going to ask the Australian people to allow him to continue to lead this country. Mr Katter-There is no harm in asking.",61
40,Mr SNEDDEN,PAIRS,"There is no harm in askPrime ing, as my friend says. But the Prime Minister is one of two things. There is no escaping from standing. from one of two alternatives. Either he does not know or",62

47,Mr SNEDDEN,PAIRS,"Mr Speaker, we have precisely 3 minutes left to discuss the appropriation of $2,300m. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) either does not know the dates for the closure of nominations, the issue of writs and the election because Caucus has not yetapproved them or there is another possibility - I think this is a real possibility-h e is dreaming up some political skulduggery. The whole of the Australian nation, and everybody in the House, has assumed that we are to have an election. The Prime Minister, for reasons of advancing his own political case, is prepared to abandon the national interest entirely and try to serve a narrow political interest of his .own. He therefore will not say it. His problem is this: There is in Tasmania a Liberal Party candidate named Michael Hodgman who is a member of the State Parliament. He would need to retire from the State Parliament 14 days before nominations close to be eligible to stand for the seat of Denison. The Prime Minister knows that Michael Hodgman will win Denison by a mighty majority. The Minister, if he closed nominations early enough, could disqualify Michael Hodgman",62
48,Mr HANSEN,PAIRS,What a lovely thought.,62
49,Mr SNEDDEN,PAIRS,"That was the Government Whip, the honourable member for Wide Bay. I hope that he enjoys being Government Whip for these remaining few hours, because he is coming to the end of an undistinguished period of service in this House at the next election. He deserves his fate when he supports a man who is able to contemplate a national election in which political opportunism, conspiracy and skulduggery are applied against a 'man who has the right to present himself to the people for election. There are 2 possibilities. Either the Leader of the Government, that is the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, that is the Prime Minister, the Leader of this country does not know what he can do, when he can do it or how he can do it, or else he is guilty of skulduggery. It is one or the other.",62

(2) What is the purpose of the investigations. (3) Have the investigations been completed and the report presented to the Government. (4) If so, when was it received and when will it be tabled. (5) If not, when is it likely that the investigations will be completed and the report tabled.",63
60,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Investigations into air quality in Canberra are being carried out mainly in relation to emissions by motor vehicles. These investigations are being conducted by Dr N. Daly of the School of Chemistry at the Australian National University. (2) The purpose of the investigations is to identify the development of points where pollutants may become dangerous and to predict the occurrence of photo-chemical smog. (3), (4) and (5) After the investigations have been completed later this year I will arrange for the report to be tabled. Australian Aircraft Industry: Rationalisation (Question No. 280) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: When is it expected that the Government will be in a position to reach a decision on the rationalisation of the Australian aircraft industry.",64
61,Mr BARNARD,PAIRS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: A revised plan for the rationalisation of the Australian aircraft industry is in the final stages of preparation by the Departmental/Industry Working Group. It is hoped that this plan will be considered by the Government in first half of this year. Road Safety: Breathalyser Equipment (Question No. 286) Mr Bennett asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to suggestions that, in the interests of road safety, breathalyser equipment be installed at hotels for voluntary check by motorists. (2) Will he have this suggestion investigated with a view to implementation. NA upon notice were circulated: Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of the existence of a number of devices designed to tell a motorist whether he is above the legal blood alcohol limit. There is a variety of 'Puff-Bag' devices where the colour of crystals changes if the legal limit is exceeded. There are also 'Ready-Reckoner' devices where one reads off a calculated blood alcohol concentration by relating the number of drinks and the time taken to drink them to one's body-weight. There are also reaction-testing devices which, whilst they do not assess blood alcohol concentration, can give a guide to the extent of impairment of those skills related to driving. (2) Yes. My Department is continuously watching progress in the development and assessment of such devices. Widescale implementation will, however, depend on their validity as indicators of blood alcohol concentration, the likely extent of their use and degree to which an adverse reading actually prevents a drinker from driving. Legal Aid Officers (Question No. 224) Mr Snedden asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Is concern being expressed by representatives of Aboriginal legal aid services at the decision of the Government to establish legal aid bureaux for the Australian community in each State, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory with a number of regional offices. (2) What arrangements will the Attorney-General be taking to ensure that the two legal aid systems can exist concurrently on a satisfactory basis. (3) Has the West Australian Law Society written to the Attorney-General informing him of the Society's opposition to the establishment of legal aid offices in Western Australia. (4) If so, has the Attorney-General replied to the Law Society, and what is his attitude to the Society's submission. Mr Enderby-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: (1) Concern was expressed recently. (2) There will be co-operation between the Australian Legal Aid Office and the Aboriginal Legal Services. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I will keep under review the operation of the two services. To that end there will be discussions between our respective Departments. (3) The Law Society of Western Australia has written to me expressing the view that there is no call for another legal aid organisation in Western Australia. It has asked that additionalfinancialassistance be provided by the Australian Government to expand the Law Society's scheme of legal aid. (4) I have informed the Law Society that the Australian Government has decided to establish the'Australian Legal Aid Office to provide greater legal assistance to persons in need. I pointed out that an Australian Government service of this kind must be readily and equally available to all citizens of Australia and it was not therefore possible to accede to the Society's suggestion of using its Legal Advice Bureau instead of setting up an office of the Australian Legal Aid Office. 1 believe that the task of providing an adequate, ready and equal service in the field of legal aid is too great for the private profession to bear alone and that there are areas in which the service can best be provided by salaried lawyers. Equally, there are areas where the service can best be provided by the private profession. I have written to the President of the Law Society asking it to let me have proposals for extending the legal aid services provided through the Law Society with a view to considering provision in this year's estimates for an Australian Government grant to supplement existing legal aid schemes.

(3) What action can be taken to establish an independent arbitrator to consider matters of rent and maintenance in respect of Australian Government subsidised aged persons housing. (4) What action can he take to settle existing disputes.",69
75,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) It is understood that one organisation in Western Australia, a pensioners' organisation, recently evicted a married couple who were not aged persons as defined in the Aged Persons Homes Act. The reason for the eviction proceedings was non-payment of a rental increase. Rent for a married couple unit at this home has been raised twice during the past four years from $4.00 p.w. to $4.50 p.w. and more recently to 85.50 p.w. Neither increases had been paid by the couple concerned although the increases have been accepted by all other residents. It is understood that this organisation does have a rule of the nature referred to by the honourable member but this was not the reason for the eviction proceedings - upon notice: (2) The Government recently accepted a recommendation by the Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing, set up by the Social Welfare Commission, that homes which have received, or are applying for, subsidy under the Aged Persons Homes Act be required to forward a copy of their rules to the Director-General of Social Security and that any rule which the Director-General considers to be repressive or contrary to normal civil liberty should be the subject of discussion with a view to amendment. If the discussion is not considered to factory to the Director-General, the Committee further recommended that he be empowered to make the amendment of such rule a prerequisite to the granting of any further subsidy to the organisation. I would consider that a rule forbidding a (resident of a home from making any public statement would be regarded as repressive and contrary to normal civil liberty. (3) My Department is at present exarnining the feasibility of involving itself in situations where there are disputes between organiations and residents of subsidised Homes over the levels of rentals or maintenance charges. (4) The Department made enquiries about the circumstances of the dispute in the case referred to in (1) above but decided that intervention was not warranted. Perth: Chic Affairs Bureau (Question No. 490) Mr Bennett asked the Minister for Services and Property, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the activities of the Civic Affairs Bureau in Perth. (2) If so, can he say (a) who are the principals of this group, (b) what is their real purpose, (c) whether it is a front organisation for a political movement, (d) whether it is controlled within Australia and (e) whether it has overseas connections. (3) Is the group controlled by the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. (4) If not, will he provide for such groups to be controlled by the recently foreshadowed controls in this area. Mr Daly-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My attention has been drawn to certain newspaper advertisements and publicity purporting to relate to the activities of an organisation in Perth referred to as the Civic Affairs Bureau. (2) The information available does not enable me to furnish the information sought. (3) No. (4) The review of the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act which I have foreshadowed, will include consideration of political parties or organisations. Outside Contracts for Department of Supply (Question No. 530) Mr Snedlden asked the Minister for Supply, (1) Has he prepared a submission for Cabinet seeking additional outside contracts for the Department's 14 factories. (2) If so, has the submission been considered by Cabinet. (3) When does he expect to announce his proposals in this area. Mr Enderby-The answer to the right honbe satis- ourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) It has been long-standing practice to attempt to develop non-defence workload for the defence production factories in period of low defence demand. Although certain factories are highly specialised, there are skills and plant which can be brought to bear for non-defence purposes. The Government is aiming to achieve a more satisfactory utilisation of those resources. A Cabinet Submission dealing generally with matters relating to the defence production factories, including that of workload, is currently being prepared. Patients in Nursing Monies: Intensive Care (Question No. 603) Mr MCLeay asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: When will the intensive care benefit payable to patients in nursing homes be increased.",70
76,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is aware of the acute years-long shortage of nursing home facilities and I hope to table this week the first part of a report of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission on Hospitals in Australia which will propose a planned commitment of national funds and facilities to relieve this problem. The matters of medical, hospital and nursing home benefits are under consideration by the Minister for Social Security to whom this question should therefore properly be directed. The honourable member will be aware that the approval of the Senate is awaited to a Bill which would greatly increase some of these benefits if the Senate is disposed to reverse an earlier unfavourable decision. Aged Persons Homes: Sound Proofing (Question No. 619) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: Has consideration been given to including the cost of sound proofing in subsidised aged persons homes in the capital cost for subsidy purposes; if so, what was the outcome; if not, when will he give consideration to this matter.",71
77,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: The cost of including sound proofing wherever considered necessary in the construction of an Aged Persons Home, has always been accepted as part of the capital cost for subsidy purposes. (Question No. 621) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: With reference to his answer to question No. 1234 (Hansard, 13 November 1973, page 3279), did his Department discuss with the Australian Medical Association reports that some doctors force patients to make cash payments for consultation fees prior to consenting to a consultation; if so, what was the outcome.",71
78,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: This matter was taken up by my Department with the Australian Medical Association which supplied the following comments: (1) The Australian Medical Association is not a statutory body and can advise, but not control the actions of individual members. (2) The practice of charging patients prior to a Benefits consultation is an individual decision by a doctor based on the particular circumstances existing in the area in which he practices, e.g.: (a) In certain industrial suburbs of Melbourne, there is a constantly changing population and the bad debts of some practices run at high levels. In such circumstances it seems not unreasonable that doctors should ask for payment at the time of consultation, provided that no patient is refused treatment in an emergency. (b) Where a particular patient has a record of non-payment on occasions in the past, the doctor would be justified in requiring him to pay his account at the time when any further treatment is given. In instances where doctors follow either of these practices, there is no evidence that treatment has been refused to patients in real need. (3) There is a difference between a request for a cash payment prior to consultation and insistence on cash payment. (4) As is the case with the Department of Social Security, this Association has no information as to the extent to which the practice is applied to patients. (5) Although Branches of the Australian Medical Association receive occasional complaints from patients concerning the practice, these complaints are not of significant frequency. (6) Prepayment for many services is an established practice in other areas of activity, particularly for services provided by Government instrumentalities, eg.: (a) Prepayment for telephone rentals by the Postmaster-General's Department. (b) Prepayment on public transport. Atawriginal Land Rights (Question No. 24) Mr Hunt asked the Minister representing representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a Doctors' Fees statement by the Minister for the Northern Territory that a clash between whites and blacks in the Northern Territory is inevitable. (2) Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the pre-election speech of the Prime Minister in which he said that the Austrahan Labor Party will establish once and for all Aborigines' rights to land and insist that, whatever the law of George III says, a tribe and a race with an identity of centuries-ofmillenia is proprietary company. (3) Can he say whether the latter statement has raised doubts in the minds of property owners outside Aboriginal reserves as to the security of their tenure and raised expectations among Aborigines that land now held by others will be given to them. (4) When does the Government expect the report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission. (5) Pending this report, have all applications Aborigines for titles to land on reserves been frozen; if so, how many applications have been frozen. (6) When will the Government make a decision this report so that doubts may reduction in tension between the races brought about.",71
79,Mr BRYANT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. The Prime Minister's Policy Speech said: We will establish once and for all Aborigines' rights to land and insist that whatever the law of George says, a tribe and a race with millenia-is as much entitled to own land as even a proprietary company.

80,Mr BRYANT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: See reply to Question No. 1338 which appeared in Hansard 13 December 1973. Questions relating to the particulars of services available to other persons throughout Australia should be referred to my colleague, the Attorney-General. Aboriginal Enterprises: Grants Mr Hunt asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: With reference to the answer to my question No. 1341 of 15 November 1973, does the Minister intend to establish an all-Party committee, as foreshadowed in his statement in the Senate on 25 October 1973, to screen all applications for loans, advances and grants for Aboriginal enterprises; if not, why not.",72

Indirect Taxation (Question No. 62) Mr Lynch asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What was the estimated increase in the Consumer III Price Index caused by indirect taxation measures in an identity of centuriesthe Budget. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: overall effects of indirect taxation measures the Consumer Price Index cannot be measured precisely. A major difficulty is that increased taxa45. tion has dampening effects on demand pressures but the ultimate impact of that on the Consumer Price Com- - Index is indirect and cannot be quantified. Calculations of the direct effects can, however, be made. In regard to the two major indirect taxation measures announced in the 1973-74 Budget, namely the increases in duty on motor spirit and on cigarettes and tobacco products, the direct effects on the CPI (Question No. 26) are estimated to have been about one quarter and one half of an index point respectively. In addition, the effects of the abolition of the exemption from sales tax of non-alcoholic carbonated beverages containing not less than five per cent of Australian fruit juice on the CPI is estimated to have been about No. one quarter of an index point. Overall, the direct of effects on the CPI of the indirect taxation measures in the Budget would have been of the order of one index point which, given the level of the index to (144.6 in the December quarter), would have been less than one percentage point. New Zealand Department of Maori Affairs (Question No. 104) Mr Lynch asked the Minister representing legal aid the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has the Minister received an offer of assistance from the New Zealand Minister for Maori Affairs. (2) If so, what was the nature of the assistance offered and has it been accepted by the Government. (Question No. 30)",72
82,Mr BRYANT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I have discussed with the New Zealand Prime Minister and the Minister for Maori Affairs the possibility of a co-operative exchange of officers of the New Zealand Department of Maori Affairs and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. While there is agreement to the principle of an exchange of officers, detailed arrangements have yet to be finalised. Proposed Black Australian Studies (Question No. 107) Mr Lynch asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has the Government received any proposals for assistance in establishing courses in Black Studies in Australian universities. (2) If so, what action has been taken.",72

TABLE 1: QUANTITY (IN KILOGRAMS) Cheddar cheese(a) processed (b) other Total Non-cheddar cheese Total",78
92,Mr MORRISON,A A A A A A,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At the meeting referred to on 23 February 1974, representatives of 27 consumer groups agreed to establish an Australian Federation of Consumer Groups, and elected a steering committee to draft a constitution for further consideration. The proposed Federation will be an independent body and the Australian Government's chief role in relation to it will be in consulting it on matters of interest to consumers. At the appropriate time, the Government will consider the possibility of providing some financial assistance to the Federation. (2) The steering committee is working on a draft constitution but has not yet completed it. (3) No appointment has yet been made. I expect the question of a permanent executive for the Federation will be a matter for the Federation to consider after it has been formed.

94,Mr HAYDEN,A A A A A A,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) At 2 March 1974 there were 4,226 people in receipt of Special Benefit including 50 migrants in accommodation centres awaiting first placement in employment in Australia. (2) The information sought is not available. However, of a total of 4,113 special beneficiaries at 29 December 1973, 256 were granted the benefit because they were suffering hardship and were unable to satisfy the residence qualification for a pension. (3) 17,995. (4) 15,805 special benefits were granted during 1973; some people may have been granted benefit more than once in the year. Aborigines: Power of Self Determination (Question No. 437) Mr Calder asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: (1) Does the Government propose self determination for the Aboriginal people. (2) If so, does this mean that (a) the Torres Strait Islands, or any single island, will not be transferred from the sovereignty of Australia without of the Islanders and (b) the inhabitants of reserves such as Arnhem Land may secede from Australia, if this is what they wish; if not, will the Minister phrase the proposals of the Government to avoid these expectations. (3) If self determination is proposed, how is it to be applied to Aboriginal communities in the capital cities and on Central Australian reserves.",80
95,Mr BRYANT,A A A A A A,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) In a statement on 6 April 1973 the Prime ister said that: 'The basic object of my Government's policy is to restore to the Aboriginal people of Australia their lost power of self determination in economic, social and political affairs.' He referred to the Government's intention duce legislation to enable Aboriginal groups and communities to incorporate for the conduct of their affairs and stated that the Government envisaged 'these corporated societies, set up for purposes chosen their Aboriginal members, determining their own Special Benefits decision-making processes, choosing their own leaders and executives in ways they will themselves decide as the primary instruments of Aboriginal authority at the and community level'. He referred also to the intention to establish an elected consultative body with which the Government will confer on matters affecting in receipt of special Aboriginals. (2) (a) There is no proposal to transfer the Torres Strait Islands, or any single island, from the sovereignty of Australia, with or without the consent of the Islanders. The Prime Minister stated on 17 January 1973 that the Australian Government would be most reluctant to be a party to any settlement of the border issue which was not accepted by the Islanders in the respects which affected them. (b) I am not aware of any wish to secede from Australia among the inhabitants of any reserve nor am I aware of any expectation that this might be possible. Government policies have not been phrased in terms which would suggest that secession was a possibility contemplated by the Government. (3) The Government will continue to give effect to its policies of encouraging and assisting Aboriginal groups and organisations in the metropolitan areas and groups and communities in the Central Australian and other reserves to develop their own programs and to manage their own affairs.

(2) If so, what were thefindingsof the inquiries. Mr Enderby-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourto introable member's question. The Commissioner of Trade Practices made inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the inclosure of the 'Independent Sun' newspaper in by Western Australia and he has given me a report on the matter. In view of the secrecy provisions of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act it would not be appropriate for me to disclose the contents of that report. I can say however that the Commissioner concluded that there was no further action that he could usefully take in the matter. Investigations under the proposed new Trade Practices legislation will not be shrouded by secrecy, of this kind. Independent Sun' Newspaper Mr Bennett asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) With reference to the Attorney-General's inquiries into the closure of the 'Independent Sun', Perth is it a fact that for several years the Mel-* bourne 'Age' has bought a Western Australian news service from the 'West Australian'. (2) Is it also a fact that there was no reciprocal service involved. (3) Has the Attorney-General's attention been drawn to a statement, alleged to have been made by Mr K. MACPherson, Managing Director of West Australian newspapers, and published in the 'West Australian' on 8 November 1973, to the effect that the 'Age' was supplying the 'Independent Sun' with a news service and that it was considered proper that the 'Sun' Should supply the 'Age' with a West Australian news service. (4) Did this proposition represent a major change in relations between the 'West Australian' and the 'Age'. (5) Would the Attorney-General inquire as to when Mr MACPherson conveyed this message to the 'Age'. (6) Would the Attorney-General also define whether this message represented a threat to the 'Age' news service from the 'West Australian'. Mr Enderby-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I refer the honourable member to my answer to question number 479. Newsagency Control Board of Western Mr Bennett asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Is the Attorney-General able to investigate the constitution, membership and operation of the Newsagency Control Board of Western Australia and the agreements that newsagents in Western Australia are required to sign with West Australian Newspapers .Ltd. (2) If so, is it a fact, for example, that clause 14 of that agreement states that the agent shall not distribute any other daily, newspaper without the consent in writing of the Company and shall use his best endeavours to promote the sale and increase the circulation of the Company's newspapers. (3) If so, does this and other aspects adversely affect the establishment of a second daily newspaper in Perth. Mr Enderby-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Restrictive Trade Practices Act provides for certain classes of agreements and practices to be examined by the Commissioner of Trade Practices and, if he thinks necessary, by the Trade Practices Tribunal, to determine whether those agreements and practices are contrary to the public interest. (Question No. 480) The matters raised by the honourable member have been referred to the Commissioner of Trade Practices for any action he may consider appropriate. (2) On the basis of information provided by the honourable member, I would say yes. (3) This part of the question seeks an expression of opinion which it would be inappropriate for me to provide.

Mr Enderby-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The control of newspapers in Australia is largely a matter for State law. (2) I understand that Newsagency Control Boards or similar bodies exist in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. 1 do not know of the position in Tasmania. (3) I understand that these bodies consist of repreAustralia sentatives of newspapers and, in some States, of (Question No. 481) representatives of newsagents associations also. I am not aware of any Government involvement in these bodies. (4) I understand that these bodies control such matters as the accreditation of newsagencies and the transfer of newsagencies. (5) and (6) This part of the question seeks an expression of opinion which it would be inappropriate for me to provide. Newspaper Advertising: Charges (Question No. 483) Mr Bennett asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Can the Attorney-General say if charges for newspaper advertising are affected by monopoly situations in Australia. (2) How do charges for advertising space in Australian newspapers compare with major overseas newspapers. Mr Enderby-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. I am not in a position to answer this question. Before doing so an inquiry would be necessary in which all relevant matters could be taken into account. In the course of performing its functions, the Trade Practices Commission provided for in the Trade Practices Bill 1973 could consider questions of this kind. (Question No. 484) Mr Bennett asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: Arising out of the Attorney-General's inquiries into the closure of the 'Independent Sun', Perth, will the Attorney-General examine the controls and restrictions on news services within Australia, particularly those concerning membership of Australian Associated Press and the availability of the Associations' service, with a view to ensuring that these conditions in no way restrict freedom of competition. Mr Enderby-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Restrictive Trade Practices Act provides for certain classes of agreements and practices to be examined by the Commissioner of Trade Practices and, if he thinks necessary, by the Trade Practices Tribunal, to determine whether those agreements and practices are contrary to the public interest. The matters raised by the honourable member have been referred to the Commissioner of Trade Pactices for any action he may consider appropriate.

(2) If so, will the Minister investigate the position with a view to implementing a system of checking and representation which will obviate the possibility of a re-occurrence of this type of incident.",80
96,Mr BRYANT,A A A A A A,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) My attention has been drawn to the case of Ezzard Glen Flowers, a 15-year-old Aborigine from Katanning, who appeared undefended before a Western Australian court on 13 charges including theft of a utility with violence and theft of 50 cents. I am informed that the maximum penalty under Western Australian law for any of the offences is 14 years. Mr Flowers received full legal counsel from a solicitor as soon as the Western Australian Aboriginal Legal Service learned of his situation. (2) Yes. I am in agreement with the resolution passed at the Aboriginal Legal Service Conference held on 3 and 4 December 1973, which requested that the Attorney-General approach appropriate State and Territorial authorities requesting that an officer of the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service be present throughout the entire interview during which any statement might be made by an Aborigine which could be used in evidence against him.

Cairns-The Minister for Customs and Excise has provided the following answer upon notice: to the honourable member's question: (1) There are very few complaints from passengers on this matter. Most passengers accept smuggling problem is serious and are prepared to accept some inconvenience to assist officers. (2) Implementation of Customs control of and baggage is by selective examination. It is acknowledged that some passengers are subjected to a measure of inconvenience and delay by this cess, but officers do try to encourage an understanding by passengers of the necessity for examination. I have personally inspected international airports recently, and as a result have raised certain matters with the Minister for Transport with a view to improving airport facilities. The Customs Department continuously reviews its passenger processing procedures in order to reconcile the discharge of its responsibilities with the need to clear large numbers of passengers with a minimum of delay.

(3) What progress has been made on the investigations. 4) Who is conducting the environmental factfinding study in the region, and what progress has been made on this study. (5) When is it expected that the investigations will be complete.",84
101,Dr PATTERSON,A A A A A A,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (D(a) The investigation and preliminary planning for the regional town centre are being arranged by the Cities Commission on behalf of the Department of the Northern Territory. A. A. Heath and Partners in conjunction with Willis, Heathwood and Partners both of Brisbane, have the responsibility of preparing a Town Planning Scheme. The Department of the Northern Territory is undertaking investigation into a water supply and the location and quantity of building materials. The Department of Housing and Construction is concerned with engineering investigation as it relates to the regional town centre. (b) Department of the Northern Territory. Department of Housing and Construction. Department of Northern Development. Department of the Environment and Conservation. Department of Aboriginal Affairs. Other Departments for site requirements, e.g. Health, P.M.G., Education, Civil Aviation, Attorney-Generals. (c) (i) Cameron, MCNamara and Partners and Heathwood, Willis and Partners, prepared in 1972 a feasibility study for the lishment of a regional centre. (ii) A. A. Heath and Partners in conjunction with Willis, Heathwood and Partners are currently preparing a town planning scheme. (iii) Mining companies have been consulted in regard to housing standards, supply of services and programming. (2) At this time the Government's decisions refer only to the authorisation of studies relating to the development of a regional centre. (3) Good progress has been made on the investigations into a possible water supply and the investigations will recommence in the coming dry season. The preliminary development plan has been prepared and has been studied by various departments. The structure plan including detailed design of the first (Question No. 278) SOO residential lots is expected to reach the Department of the Northern Territory this week. The town centre study will be commissioned shortly. (4) The Alligator Rivers Region Environmental Fact Finding Study-whic h has been jointly financed by the Australian Government and the mining industry-wa s conducted by a Committee chaired by the Secretary to the Department of the Northern Territory and including representatives of the mining industry, the Department of Northern Development, the CSIRO, and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The study report was made available in January this year and is now being examined. (5) The town centre study should be available by mid 1974. It is not possible to indicate at this stage when water supply, engineering and associated studies will be complete as on site investigations depend on accessibility following the wet season. Interdepartmental Committees (Question No. 281) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) What is the membership of the interdepartmental committee that has been established to examine the possibility of using the road which runs through the Woomera Range as a route between Port Augusta and Alice Springs. (2) What are the terms of reference and timetable of the committee. (3) Did the committee prepare, or is it intended that the committee will prepare, a report to the Government. (4) If a report has been submitted to the Government what are its recommendations and will he table it without undue delay. (5) - lf the report has not yet been submitted will he give an undertaking to table the report as soon as possible after its receipt. Mr Charles Jones-The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) No such interdepartmental committee has been established. There was an interdepartmental committee on land transport between Port Augusta and Alice Springs set up by the previestab- ous Government but that committee has not met since 1970. In May 1973, however, an ad hoc interdepartmental committee was convened to consider the use of the range road in the context of the National Highways Study which was then underway. The Departments represented at the meeting were Supply, Defence, Northern Development, Northern Territory, Services and Property, Tourism and Recreation, Transport and the Treasury. The meeting had no formal terms of reference or timetable, nor was it constituted as a committee with powers of recommendation. Representatives at the meeting were in agreement that while the present range road could not be incorporated as part of the Stuart Highway without major disruption of the range's function, it should be possible to establish an acceptable alignment across the Woomera prohibited area which would not interfere to an unacceptable extent with the operations of the range. This would require a detailed survey and feasibility study, and in the Bureau of Roads 'Report on Roads in Australia 1973', it is suggested that a corridor study of the Port Augusta-Alice Springs segment be undertaken. The results of any detailed study undertaken to establish the alignment of a possible National Highway section within the Woomera Prohibited Area will be considered for incorporation in published documents. Rural Reconstruction Scheme (Question No. 328) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) What are the figures for the various categories of farm build-up and debt adjustment under the Rural Reconstruction Scheme, up to 1 March 1974, in respect of (a) the number of successful and unsuccessful applicants for these categories and (b) the average amount paid or loaned to the successful applicants in each State and for each sector of primary industry. (2) What sum has been advanced to the Slates in each of the 6 month periods since the inception of the Scheme. (3) What rates of interest are currently being charged for loans provided under the Scheme.",85
102,Dr PATTERSON,A A A A A A,The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the (1) How many (a) successful and (b) unsuccessful applicants the Fruit-growing Reconstruction Scheme up to 1 March 1974.

(2) If it is simplistic, as suggested in the answer, what is a proper description of Tanzania's Parliamentary system. (3) What political parties exist in Tanzania other than the Tanganyika African National Union and the Afro Shirazi Party.

104,Mr WHITLAM,CLEAR FELL APPLICATIONS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The use of the term single party state is simplistic. Behind the question is the arrogant assumption that democracy is the preserve of the Westminister system and a lack of appreciation for the sophisticated party and parliamentary system which Tanzania has evolved to meet the particular needs of its people and to achieve in the words of President Nyerere ""development on the basis of human equality and human dignity"".

Under the Interim Constitution, legislative powers are exercised by the National Assembly comprising a majority of members elected on the basis of universal adult franchise. The President has no power to legislate without recourse to Parliament. (3) None. (4) In a one party state the question does not arise. (5) TANU and the Afro-Shirazi Party are both committed to socialist development. Had the honourable member heard President Nyerere's speech at the Parliamentary lunch given in President Nyerere's honour on 20 March he would appreciate the persuasive reasons for this commitment. (6) The Tanzanian Government has not practised religious iand racial discrimination. Numbers of Asian, African and European residents have departed from Tanzania, since that country's Independence. This has been largely a reaction to Tanzania's egalitarian policies applied without discrimination to African and non-African alike. Among the more notable of those Africans to leave Tanzania voluntarily was the former Foreign Minister, Mr Oscar Kambona, subsequently accused by the Tanzanian Government of receiving illegal payments from foreign governments and of embezzling public funds. Although the situation on Zanzibar has been less dear, the present leadership there, as President Nyerere indicated during his visit, is seeking to counter the worse effects of a violent revolution and reactions to years of abuse which stemmed from foreign domination including the slave traffic centred on the island of Zanzibar. (7) (a) It is estimated that about 5,000 persons died on Zanzibar during the revolution of January 1964, mounted by both Africans and Arabs against the Sultan's Government. It is not known how many left Zanzibar or were deported. As indicated at (6) the Zanzibar authorities are now seeking to stabilise their society on the basis of democratic government and due processes of law. Their efforts stand in contrast to the increasing extent to which Africans are being jailed and flogged by other authorities in Africa for which the honourable member has a profound sympathy. (b) and (c) The Government has no information on the exact number of Asians who were deported from Tanzania in 1967 and again in 1970-71. (d) No, property cannot be nationalised without legislative authority. (e) President Nyerere has said in respect of Tanzania that it would be necessary to nationalise major means of production to achieve the development objectives of his people. This was an important tenet of the Arusha Declaration of 1967, which was endorsed by the National Assembly. Fruit Fly Control (Question No. 500) Mr Bennett asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) What fruit fly control measures are taken in each of the States. (2) In which States are the home fruit growers compelled to be party to government or semigo""e-nment auihorities undertaking the spraying under threat of pena'ty. (3) What aie these penalties. (J) What a>e the costs to the home owner in each of ti e Slates. (5) Are any special provisions made for pensioners ic ny of the States; if so, what are the details. Dr Va^ tenon-The Minister for Primary Industrv has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) All States have legislation requiring control of pests and diseases in horticultural crops. Specific fruit fly control measures are imposed in Western Australia, parts of Victoria and New South Wales. The Western Australian Government has a 'Compulsory Baiting Scheme', which can be applied following a 60 per cent affirmative vote at a poll held in any district. In Victoria there are proclaimed quarantine areas. Fruit movements from and to these areas are restricted and eradication measures are taken. In some inland areas of. New South Wales a scheme of 'whole town treatment' may be imposed by local authorities following discovery The treatment involves the use of bait and sprays and restriction of fruit movement. (2) Western Australia and New South Wales. (3) ln Western Australia, penalties for non-compliance with fruit fly control can be up to $200 (minimum S10) under the Plant Diseases Acts and up to $50 under the Regulations. In New South Wales penalties of up to $100 can be incurred for failure to co-operate (4) Direct charges on the home owner are only imposed in Western Australia. Home gardeners pay once only, a 20 cents fee for vines or fruit trees of less than one acre, but when trees are planted on one acre or more and are four years old or more, a charge of 50 cents per year is made for each acre or part thereof. Under the 'Compulsory Baiting Scheme', charges are determined by the statutory committee formed subsequent to a poll. (5) No. Domiciliary Nuning Care Applications (Question No. 620) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) How many applications for domiciliary nursing care benefit were rejected between 1 November 1973 and 1 March 1974. (2) How many appeals were lodged against these rejections. (3) How many appeals were upheld.",87
105,Mr HAYDEN,CLEAR FELL APPLICATIONS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department rejected 625 applications for the domiciliary nursing care benefit between 1 November 1973 and 1 March 1974. (2) Approximately 7 per cent of persons whose applications were rejected lodged appeals with me against my Department's decision.. (3) Of the appeals lodged the benefit has been granted to approximately 14 per cent of the appellants. Letter from former Western Australian Minister for Comnmnity Welfare (Question No. 700) Mr Snedden asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) Did he receive a letter from Mr Thompson, former Minister for Community Welfare in Western Australia, requesting that a subsidy be paid to families based on the number of children. (2) If so, did Mr Thompson assert that this would overcome the fact that women with large families could receive more money if their husbands deserted of fruit fly. them or were unemployed. (3) What reply was given to Mr Thompson's request.",88
106,Mr HAYDEN,CLEAR FELL APPLICATIONS,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) I have no record of having received a letter from Mr Thompson, former Minister for Community Welfare in Western Australia, requesting that a subsidy be paid to families based on in any measures. the number of children.",88
