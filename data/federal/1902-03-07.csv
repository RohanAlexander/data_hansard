1,Mr KNOX,Unknown," I : intend: to support the amendment. My first objectin rising,, is to dissent from the views of those who do not feel themselves under considerable, obligations to the newspapers. It cannot for a moment be said that-' newspapers like the Australasian, the Leader, and others published .in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, do not disseminate an immense amount of. knowledge and information to persons residing in far distant parts of the Commonwealth, who otherwise, would not be able to. obtain it ; and on that ground alone. I think it would,bo inadvisable to impose a tax which would have the effect j f increasing, the cost-of their production. The Victorian Master Printers' Association have distributed amongst the' members of the. committee representations which, in my judgment, should, carryvery great, weight. They point out that the printing, industry will be seriously interfered.with if this duty, at'10.30 is imposed. Hitherto in Victoria there has been no such duty on printing paper, and. I have not heard reasons advanced' which TARIFF. justify its imposition now. It has been suggested that the paper used by country journals should be admitted free, and that the rolls of. paper which are used by . the metropolitan journals should be taxed. I have, however,- consistentlyopposed all / forms of class taxation. I have always, believed ' that - i tis right that-men-should contribute to the revenue in proportion to tlieirability to do so, but-to tax one class while another class is-permitted to go free seems to me' absolutely unjust: My feeling is that the proposed duty wilt not be agreed to, and I am disposed to. think, that - many per lb., honourable members would be much surprised ftiid concerned if it were agreed to.",14
2,Mr LE GROOM,Unknown,"Darling. Downs) I intend to vote againsttlie proposed duty. The-Treasurer has-referred to it as. a - revenueduty, but in:.my opiuion revenue duties. should' fall upon articles ofgeneral consumption, and.not upon articles by the use,of which certain classes.of persons earn their living. In opposing thetax. I-speak, riOt-so much on behalf of the large metropolitan newspapers; as on behalf of. the;provincial newspapers. 1', have received a circular, signed by no. fewerthan 40 - proprietors representing-, journals published - in-, the.northern ,, .central, and southern parts-of 1 Queensland, in which they protestagainst this-, .tax, upon ithe. ground that ir-will increase the cost of' publishing, their newspapers.. They - also point outthat it is in the. nature - of a. classtax. If the Government, to raise revenue, proposed by a separate Bill a tax upon newspapers at the rate of 10 per cent; upon all the printasserted ing paper they used, the proposal would strongly objected to by this House, and reference would be made to' the historical fights' for the liberty of the press that occurred in the old country. It is sugbecause gested that the proposed duty will taxproduce wealthy men- 'who can easily afford to it ; but it will fall heavily upon the many provincial newspaper proprietors, who have started as pioneers in the smaller townshhps. The honourable member for Bland appears not to regard a newspaper as a disseminator of knowledge. His definition of know the ledge may differ from - mine. While; no doubt, the newspapers take very strong party views at times of political crises, their raison d'Hlre is the disseminapurposes. tion of commercial intelligence; of political news, and of information generally. Although they do - not take theplace' of works on political economy,' science; literature; and art, they disseminate inforlearned mation which is of great value to 'the comyield munity, and it is unfortunate that, at a time when the proprietors are being put to-'a heavy extraexpense in obtaining and cirposing culating intelligence in regard to the doings of this - Parliament, the Government should propose to f urthjer increase their-expenditure by placing a duty upon printing paper.",14
3,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown," The honourable member f6r Werriwa,-in the-whole-' sale charges of inconsistency which he made against me last night, displayed all'' the attributes of youth except its befitting modesty. If'he knew even the ABC of' political economy, he would be aware that, instead - of my past advocacy of legitimate protective duties being a reason why I should support the duty' upon printing paper, it a reason why I should not support such a duty. The aim-of protection is to establish' valu-' able industries in our midst: The object this duty is revenue-- a very legitimate' 1 object I admit-and- , if it had no special features of-unfairness,-1 should vote for Every duty' that is not protective must necessarily add to the cost of''the commodity on which it is levied,' and this would; 1 fore, be-a tax upom the'raw'material of' an industry that is not protected, and is not likely to be; It 'would be> utterly inconsisthat the manufacturer of thetobacco or tent with the principles - of ' protection impose-this duty, but those-honourable'memit bers who support it from a revenue point areon much firmer ground. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa 30 0 2 that the duty would be - protective, be but he showedthe utterfallacy of - that proposition when he said that it would require a400 percent, duty have to encourage the local paper industry, it would cost four times as much to paper locally as to import it from pay abroad. The honourable and learned member should know that protectionists do not advocate the imposition of' duties which 1 w-ould have the effect of 'increasing the cost of a commodity by 400 per cent. Although protective duties may temporarily increase 1 cost,' their ultimate object is to reduce prices to the consumer. The honourable and learned' member urged very strong arguments in favour of this duty for revenueMr CONROY:- I temporarily' placed myself in the position of a protectionist, and argued from that stand-point. Mr A . M6LEAN - The honourable and member stated that the duty would three times-as much as the Treasurer estimated, but he opposed it on the ground that he desired to be consistent in opevery proposal of the Government. 1 Is that a legitimate reason ? Is the honourable and learned member justified in opposing a proposalj which he admits - to be fair, just, and. legitimate, because it is supported by a Government in which he does not believe ? If I adopted such an attitude I shbuld consider I was giving ample proof of my unfitness to act in a - representative capacity. The honourable member for Bland is generally very fair and reasonable, and 1 his arguments usually have a great deal of weight with me; but ' I do not think that he 1 - was quite as logical-as usual yesterday. When - is I pointed out that*the effect of imposing this duty would be totax theprinters, becausei t ' could not be passed' on to their of customers, the honourable member stated 1 that in that respect it was on all fours with most other taxes,- and he instanced his own it . case in regard' to whisky and tobacco The honourable member' is,' in that case, : the consumer; and would pay the tax, but I , thereopposed the duty' for the reason that the* printer could not pass the'tax on to'the consumer - If the honourable member - had shown 1 to whisky had to pay the tax,-and could not-pass on; he would have been on sound ground, standbut' wheir heshowed that the consumer paid it, he was proving my case up to the hilt.' This would be a class tax levied on a 1076S Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] few individuals. It might be a fair thing to tax the large newspaper proprietors, but there are many small newspaper proprietors who could not afford to pay. honourable member said that the duty would not amount to a tax of more than os. per week upon small newspaper proprietors; but even that would be a very serious burden in many cases. Therefore, whilst I admit that the Government had some justification for proposing the duty, I cannot support it.",15
4,Mr CONROY,Unknown," I was pointing out last evening that I was very much surprised at the attitude taken by certain protectionists in not supporting the duty on paper, and, arguing the matter from their stand-point, I urged that the duty ought to be largely increased. Possibly, if there had not been one or two big interests opposed to the duty, such as those of the newspapers in which honourable members professing protectionist principles believe, we should not have heard a word about the removal of the duty. If honourable members who are opposed to this duty will also vote for the free admission of all other classes of paper, some of my objections may possibly, fall to the ground; but honourable members are apparently singling out a special line of paper for exemption- a line which the Treasurer expects will bring in a revenue of £25,000.",16
5,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I have had a fresh calculation made, and I find that upon the basis of the'imports for 1900 the duty would yield a revenue of £44,000.",16
6,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The free-traders are perfectly consistent when they oppose a duty such as this, especially when they believe that it will fall more heavily upon ledge than upon anything else. We desire to promote the spread of knowledge, because we know that when the people become generally enlightened the death-knell what is .called protection will be sounded. The majority of the people will then underthat stand that what is called protection is really - the protection of a privileged class, that it does not advance the wages of the great industrial classes of the community one farthing. They will then see the fallacy of the argument that we should single the employers for special consideration. honourable member for Gippsland, and also the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, should be aware that pulp for the manufactwo ture of all classes of paper can be imported. Tariff. I find that pulp to the amount of 467,000cwt. was imported into England last year, and the raw material could also be introduced The here. If the protectionist argument is sound, why do not honourable members encourage the importation of wood pulp and the manufacture of the paper here 1 The honourable member for Gippsland says that the object of protection is to lower prices to the consumer. He has often complained that the moment the prices are lowered the wages are also reduced. The honourable member has never made the two statements together, but, if he believes in what he says, a good reason is afforded why he should go back upon all he has done, and vote against the . imposition of protective duties. If every newspaper were to attack me, it would not alter my opinion that paper should be admitted free of duty, and I trust that any honourable members who may have been angered by the attacks made upon them by certain newspapers will not on that account allow their votes to be influenced in favour of the duty. Tomymindthepublicinterestdemands , that there shall be no taxation of knowledge. The arguments advanced by the honourable member for Gippsland in favour of one of . the wealthiest industries in Victoria will . apply with greater force to the exemption from duty of school books and exercise books. If , as the protectionists urge, it is the foreigner who pays our customs taxation, why does the honourable member object to the proposed duty 1",16
7,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,No one asserts that . the foreigner pays revenue duties.,16
8,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"The argument of the honourable member is that if a tax representing 3s. or 4s. in the £ 1 is levied knowupon an article the foreigner does not pay it, but the moment that taxation is doubled the foreigner steps in and pays it. That is an absurd argument to submit to of an intelligent deliberative body. When other items are under discussion I trust the honourable member will adhere to the attitude which he has assumed upon the and presentoccasion. In this connection I would remind him that the operation of the . high duties which are proposed will lead to the formation of rings amongst the four or out five firms which are now engaged in this The industry. Indeed, the effect of the duty which formerly prevailed in Victoria was. the establishment of a trust between the mills which existed in this State. In I my opinion the Treasurer has very much underestimated the revenue which will be - derived from this particular item. I cannot conceive that the receipts under this heading will be less than £90,000 per annum.",16
9,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"The total net imports of printing paper are valued at £446,000 a year.",17
10,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Upon his own showing the Treasurer has underestimated the receipts from one line by £19,000. Upon - other lines he has still further underestimated the revenue. Indeed, his calculations can be based only on the supposition that the imposition of the high rates proposed will lead to a diminution of more than 60 per cent, in the imports. If a 10 per cent, duty were levied upon all the goods enumerated under this item it would yield - a revenue of more than £90,000, so that the Treasurer has underestimated his receipts by £50,000. I repeat that the proposed duty constitutes a special tax upon knowledge, and is therefore distasteful to the Libera] party. Protectionists naburalty desire that knowledge shall not increase. They belong to the party which passed the sumptuary laws, and placed men in parts of London to cut the ruffles from women's dresses when they exceeded a certain length, and which also regulated - the style of boots to be worn. I hold that if people cannot regulate these matters for themselves, no Parliament can do ib for them. In support of that proposition, I ask what manufacturer would be prepared to hand over the control of his business to House? What honourable member would be content to entrust the conduct of his - affairs to his 74 fellow members, even though he knows them so well ? Yet this commade ' mittee is endeavouring to regulate the affairs of people whom it does not know. I trust that the protectionists who support proposal to admit printing paper duty free will not insist upon levying heavy imposts upon other articles which are sumed by the great bulk of the people. The assertion of the honourable member Bland that we do not value or regard newspapers is incompatible with our ordinary understanding. I do not say that we pendent approve of all the strictures which are cast am 1 on us by the daily journals, but is there one amongst us who does not believe good, sound, wholesome press cannot say that I have been very highly - favoured by the newspapers on either side, but my feelings have nothing to do with the question, which is wholly concerned with the interests of the great bulk of the people. The great newspapers in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, and Brisbane will compare with the newspapers published in similar populations in any part of the world; we have nothing .to be ashamed of in our daily literature.",17
11,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I am very anxious, for several reasons, to finish, if possible, the remaining items of the Tariff early next week. It will take my colleague and myself some l it t l e. time to deal with further proposals we desire to place before the committee, and honourable members know that Easter is rapidly approaching. I do not want to curtail debate, but I ask honourable members to be as brief as possible.",17
12,Mr MAHON,Unknown," I intend to support this tax as a revenue duty, which I think will touch the class which can besb afford to make a substantial contribution to the public Treasury. Before going further, I would suggest to the Treasurer that in regard bo whibe printing paper, which is more immediabeiy under discussion, the size should be altered from nob less than 20 in. x 25 in. to not less than 17£ in. x 22£ in., the standard of this class of paper being demy.",17
13,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,The measurements given in the Tariff are those of experts.,17
14,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the right honourable this gentleman will look into the matter again he will see that what I have stated is correct. I am sorry I did not hear the honourable member for Gippsland, who, I believe, a very effective deliverance against this duty. I am rather interested in the - fact, because I expected the honourable memthe ber to take a different stand. However, as there is probably no other man in public life in Australia who so repeatedly finds conthe line of duty coinciding with the line of political self-interest, we ought not, for perhaps, to be very much surprised. ",17
15,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,Is that a fair statement 1 Is the honourable member as indeof the press in his political life as I,17
16,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am not at all depeni n dent on the press, from which I never criticism? I received any favours.",17
17,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"I happen to have lived all my life in my constituency, where I am known thoroughly well, with all my faults.",17
18,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It is remarkable that the honourable member for Gippsland should be found resisting a duty which, to a .great extent, will touch only the rich newspaper proprietors, in the various capitals.",18
19,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,Unknown,There are not many s.uch: newspaper proprietors.,18
20,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The fewer there are the more suspicious the incident becomes, when we remember the enormous influence which those paper proprietors wield in the community. The Treasurer estimates that this duty will realise about £25,000 ; but in my opinion the revenue will probably be at least £7,000 over that sum.",18
21,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I mentioned that on the figures of 1900, which might be a loading-up period, the revenue would be £44,000. .",18
22,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I will not go so far as to say that, but I think the duty will yield about £33,000 per annum.",18
23,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I should say, from £30,000 to £35,000.",18
24,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That would be a large sum to extract from poor provincial newspaper proprietors, if the latter were going to pay it . But I shall show that the purely provincial weekly newspapers-the type of journals with which honourable members representing country districts are most familiar-wil l pay something less than onetwentieth of-the whole revenue. Any appeal on behalf of' the country journals is unnecessary, and is, no doubt, intended to relieve the wealthy proprietors of metropolitan newspapers of their legitimate burden. No one has keener sympathy with country newspapers than I , for I have had experience, as a journalist, of the difficulty of making ends meet: in small country towns. I do not know of any other enterprise which yields such a paltry reward, considering the ability and capital expended. We voted down , any proposal to tax the type, machinery, and other appliances of the printer; and that was done, I presume, because it was desirable that the primary and permanent requirements of this class of enterprise should be free, seeing that the dearer we make such articles the more we foster monopoly. But this duty on printing paper stands on a totally different footing. It cannot result in fostering monopoly, because it does not unduly handicap persons possessing limited capital, every man contributing to the revenue on the basis of the output of his establishment. If the output is large , his profits, under normalconditions, are correspondingly large,, and. his, payments to the revenue - keep in exact; proportion. Assuming that any tax is necessary, there is nothing fairer than that the newspaper which has a wide and payable circulation should contribute more to the revenue than a.journal of inferior position. So when the newsreal-significance of this duty is understood, I do not think, there will be any protest from the country newspaper proprietors. Bulking the whole of the country journals together-dailies , bi-weeklies, and weeklies - their total contribution will be only about - one-seventh of the revenue. I have taken the trouble to go into the matter fairly fully, and have compiled from Messrs. Gordon and Gotch's list, a return of the daily, tri-weekly, bi-weekly, weekly, and fortnightly newspapers published in the Commonwealth. There are -.21 daily newspapers in the various capital cities ; 40 daily newspapers in the provincial cities; 38 tri-weekly, and 159 bi-weekly newspapers in the various States ; 98 weekly newspapers in .the metropolitan cities, and 384 in the provinces. Underi this Tariff the metropolitan daily newspapers will contribute £22,000 per year to the revenue, and the metropolitan weekly newspapers.£7,500, while the provincial daily newspapers will pay £2,000, and provincial newspapers - other than daily, £1,687.",18
25,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,All over the Commonwealth ?,18
26,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"My estimate is for the whole Commonwealth, and it shows that substantially an average of about 8d. per week will be contributed by each of the purely weekly newspapers in the country districts.",18
27,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,What does the revenue aggregate ?,18
28,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"It aggregates £33,1S7.",18
29,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,What about small jobbing printers ?,18
30,Mr MAHON,Unknown,We are not now dealing with job-printing paper.,18
31,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,-Do jobbing printers not use printing paper t,18
32,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The honourable member last night, I believe, made a statement to the House that this duty will be a tax on books printed in the Commonwealth. In that the honourable member is mistaken, because this paper is not used in the printing of books.",18
33,Mr A MCLEAN,Unknown,"I-kno w this paper is not used for the better classes of books, but it is used for a great many publications other than newspapers.",19
34,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I shall not go into that question now, but if ' the committee wish: to get out of the difficulty and save country newspaper proprietors from taxation, they can easily do so by inserting the words "" in reels or rolls"" after the word ""uncoated."" T shall take an opportunity of moving an amendment to that effect - printing",19
35,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"-It has been argued that this duty is a tax on knowledge, and I am disposed to regard it as-such. I do not agree with the honourable - member'for Gippsland that'the impost will be wholly borne by newspaper proprietors, because they as far as possible will pass the amount on to the general reading public j and anything in the direction of placing a limit.on the spread 6i knowledge is undesirable.",19
36,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,It depends on the kindof knowledge.,19
37,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"I admit that newspapers deal with econdmic subjects from particular stand-points, and are regarded as altogether right or altogether wrong, according to the views of the reader. One - of the greatest educational influences is the newspaper, and there-is more newspaper reading in the Commonwealth than in any other community. No man can be well informed who does not read the newspapers, and no man who has any brains at all can help being well informed if he regularly reads the newspapers. Arguments might be adduced in support of this duty as a revenue duty, but, to my mind, it is more important to have a well-informed community 'than to obtain revenue, and, as I desire to see our community as well informed 'as possible, I shall oppose the duty. I should like the Treasurer to consider what was said by the honourable member for New England in regard to the placing of a heavier impost upon tinted paper than upon white paper.",19
38,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,- I am - willing 'to admit tinted paper on the roll at 10 per cent.,19
39,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"Otherwis e printers who use tinted paper would be at a disadvantage compared with those who use white paper, because they would have to ;pay 15 per cent, upon it instead of 10 per cent. I trust that honourable members who are opposed to this tax will show equal consideration when we come to deal with - duties lower down in the division-as , for instance, those upon school exercise bookswhich will be passed on to' the consumers. Mr HUME COOK , (Bourke) - If the - duty upon white printing paper is not removed I intend, as I indicated last night to move an amendment which will exempt those kinds of printing papers which are used in the manufacture of books. I said then'that I thought that a certain amountof revenue should be obtained from ordinary paper, but that, in order to prevent the destruction of a large andpromising industry, the raw material of the book trade should'be exempt. I have since had thegood fortune to - get into communication with persons who thoroughly understand' the-paper trade, and the}' have supplied mewith the wording of an amendment which will effect the purpose I have in view - I have submitted that amendment to the Treasurer, and it is approved by his experts, and I , therefore, give notice now that, when we come to deal with the exemptions, I propose to add to them ""super-calendered - and* machine-finished white writing paper.""",19
40,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Robertson) The Treasurer has proposed a duty of 1.0' per cent, upon white-paper, and of 15 percent, upon tinted paper.",19
41,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I have promised toadrnit at the 10-'per cent, rate tinted printing paper brought in on'the roll.",19
42,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"'But the country newspaper proprietors cannot use paper brought in on the roll, because their machines are ;not suitable. Mr . HENRY WILLIS - In that case,, those who use tinted paper will have to pay a duty 50 per cent, higher than that paid by those - who use white printing paper. I do not think that the proposed duty, if it is intended - as - a revenue duty, should be tolerated for'a moment; but if'the'Government have proposed'it as a-protective duty,. I would point out that the manufacture of printing paper in Australia 'is next to impossible. Esparto .grass has never been - grown in Australia, and it has yet'to-be found 'that it can be - grown here in sufficiently large quantities to warrant'the 1 establishment of factories for its -'manufacture into paper ; - while the manufacture of paper here from imported wood-pulp would be quite out of the question. As-far'back as 40 years ago there were hundreds - men employed in the Commonwealth in the manufacture of the commoner kinds of .paper; arid if it had been possible to manufacture printing paper which could compete with the imported article, it would have - been manufactured long. ago. - sorry that the honourable member for Coolgardie was too unwell to continue *his speech, because he ha^ gone into this matter very thoroughly; but I am still more sorry that he has arrived at the conelusion that . a tax should be placed upon the printing press. The honourable member :.for Gippsland very properly stated that this ris a class tax, and that it cannot be passed - on ; but I was astonished to hear him make the admission that in most cases these duties are passed on. It is because duties are passed on that I am opposed to Customs taxation. The honourable member, however, was at one time a free-trader, and he cannot :geb rid of his free-trade opinions. While free-traders seldom go over to protection, it is a common thing for protectionists to - become free-traders. Gladstone, Sir Henry Parkes, and Sir Robert Peel were all protectionists who became free-traders, and, ""while Disraeli turned from free-trade to .protection, he never put his protectionist - principles into operation.",19
43,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member will not be in order in pursuing that line of argument.,20
44,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Gippsland says that /this is a class tax, and I quite agree with him. The successful newspaper proprietors are very few in number, whereas I could point to many instances in which - those who have embarked in newspaper - enterprises have been ruined, or have been - but poorly rewarded. The newspapers - throughout the country are performing a hmost useful service to the community in - disseminating knowledge, and if this duty is imposed a number of able and deserving - men will be subjected to a very heavy burden. We know very well that it is not out of the actual papers sold to the public that the newspaper proprietors make their profit. It is the enterprise which they show in carrying on their newspapers which enables them to reap large harvests from advertisers. The leading newspapers of Australia strongly advocated federation, although they knew that they would have .to incur heavy expense in maintaining - expensive staffs in Melbourne for the purpose of reporting the proceedings in the Federal Parliament. The general public are vastly indebted to the press in a variety of ways, and it would not be fair to impose a heavy tax upon their I am enterprise. No doubt such papers as the Melbourne Age have exercised a strong influence upon the political opinions of the great masses of the people. The South Australian Advertiser is another notable instance of the business enterprise of the journalist. That daily was raised from a comparatively unimportant position by the enlightened policy and business enterprise of Sir Langdon Bonython. It was the enterprise of the proprietor and the knowledge that he disseminated, and not the papers sold, that was the basis of success. If it had not been for the wide circulation of that journal, upon the reduction of its price to one penny, and its advocacy of liberalism, we should not have sq many able men in this Parliament from that State today. I do not object to any newspaper because of its political complexion, because I recognise that, apart from politics altogether, the newspapers are of inestimable value to the community, and are therefore deserving of support. For the reasons which I have stated, I am strongly opposed to the imposition of this duty, which has been properly described as a tax upon enterprise and a class tax, and as one which would press most heavily upon the country newspaper proprietors. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",20
45,Mr SAWERS,Unknown," I m o v e That the word "" white,"" line 7, be omitted. I understood the Treasurer to declare his willingness to agree to the admission of tinted paper at 10 per cent., if it is imported in rolls. If the proposed distinction be made, what is there to prevent paper from being imported in rolls and cut up here 1",20
46,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There are practical difficulties.,20
47,Mr SAWERS,Unknown,"I do not know what they are. The smaller provincial newspapers do not use paper imported in rolls, because they have not the machines suitable for the use of such paper.",20
48,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I trust that the committee will not agree to the amendment of the honourable member for New England. As has already been pointed out, coloured paper can be used for a variety of purposes other than that of printing. If newspapers, for reasons of their own, choose to use coloured paper, I do not see why they should not pay a duty upon it . So long as they can introduce it in such a ' form as will guarantee that it will not be used for other than newspaper purposes, I am willing to make the concession which I previously indicated. I am not prepared, however, to allow all paper to be admitted at 10 per cent. I do not see any great virtue in printing a newspaper upon tinted paper, but if certain publisher's choose to use such paper, I do not see why they should not pay duty upon it .",20
49,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,It is made of same material as is the white.,21
50,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"It is made of the same material, but the white paper is used almost exclusively for printing, whereas coloured paper is employed for other purposes, and will thus come into competition with the article made within the States. I hope that the committee will arrive 'at a speedy decision upon this item, or otherwise we shall have to sit longer hours and meet more frequently. We have all made up our minds how we shall act, and all the talk that may be indulged in will not alter a single vote. I hope that honourable members will allow us to come to a division, and expedite the transaction of public business.",21
51,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northerri Melbourne) I sincerely hope that our votes upon this particular matter will not be influenced by vindictive feelings against paper proprietors. I trust that our actions will not be swayed by any envy of the prosperity of newspaper proprietors, or by the fear that we may be accused of truckling to the press. I feel that it is our duty to act quasi judicially. I am rather surprised to find that after six months of debate some honourable members do not yet understand the arguments of their opponents. The honourable member for Gippsland has been attacked by the honourable member for Werriwa, who is opposed to the proposed' tax, for refusing to support it, and by the honourable member for Coolgardie, who is in favour of it . Neither of those honourable members really understands his arguments. The proposed tax is purely a revenue tax, which cannot Confer an)' earthly good upon any one, and it ought therefore to be satisfactory to the Opposition. If the Treasurer really wishes it to be carried he has taken the wrong Course. He should have exempted white paper, and then members of the Opposition would have intimated that they were in favour of a tax upon it . There is an old sayiug that if one wants a pig to go a certain way the best plan is to pull him the other way. Similarly, if the Treasurer had exempted white paper from duty, the Opposition would immediately have inquired, ""Oh, why did you not tax the wealthy newspapers?"" I-listened to this debate in the expectation of hearing the honourable member for Coolgardie. He is intimately acquainted with the newspaper business, and I am sure that the committee the exceedingly regret that his health has not enabled him to express himself as fully as we should have liked. I listened to what he said very attentively, and if the Treasurer desires to see the proposed tax carried he cannot do better than heed his remarks. We all know perfectly well that the big newspapers use paper in rolls, whilst the small journals generally use it in the flatBut in Geelong, one publication uses paper in the roll, whilst the other uses it in the flat. Similarly in Ballarat, the Courier uses roll paper, whilst the Star uses that article in the flat. Under the proposal of the Government, newspapers will be taxed indiscriminately. Unless we are absolutely driven to it, I do not believe in imposing any duty upon printing paper. At the same time it is absolutely absurd to call such an impost a tax upon knowledge. How can a duty news- upon a piece of blank paper be described as a tax upon knowledge ? If the Government desire to tax newspaper proprietors because they derive big incomes from their enterprises, let them do so by means of direct taxation. By charging a duty upon the raw material of newspapers we shall be practically assisting monopoly by preventing any, save the biggest capitalists, from starting newspapers. I do not believe in taxing half-a-dozen individuals in this way simply because they are wealthy. If we desire to tax the wealthy let us do so in a direct, and not in an indirect, way. The proposed duty is a revenue duty which cannot do good to any one, and I shall therefore oppose it.",21
52,Mr WILKS,Unknown," Honourable members have just heard two most peculiar utterances, one from the Treasurer and the other from the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. The Treasurer appealed to the committee to assist him to take a vote upon this question. But whilst he was making that appeal he introduced the novel proposal - of a tax upon fashion. He laid down the. proposition that because . a newspaper was printed upon certain coloured paper-yellow or pink for example - duty should be paid upon that article. In the twentieth century it is a novelty to find a Treasurer - seriously advocating a tax upon fashion. >In order to attract readers, newspapers throughout the Commonwealth adopt certain devices. of them affect fancy headings, others are printed upon coloured paper. We have heard the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne mend the Treasurer to accept proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie, although the honourable and learned member is wholly opposed to such a course ; and under such circumstances, is it surprising that our discussions are prolonged? It has been said by honourable members that they do not care for the press; and while I may make a similar assertion, I must say that I do care for those who read the press. Honourable members pay as much regard to newspaper reports as do any other section of the community; and in any stampede at a railway station for a bookstall, notice that the first there for a newspaper is generally some representative man. T deal with this proposed duty as I would with any other. We have to consider whether the Treasurer is in need of revenue; and we must assume from twelve or thirteen divisions, in which he has sacrificed revenue, that he is not. If that be so, why should we proceed to impose a tax on newspaper proprietors'? It has been said that the imposition of this tax will make a preserve for wealthy proprietors who, doubtless, have laid in large stocks of paper. Even if these proprietors have not large stocks of paper, they have capital and are strong enough to stand such an impost better than the proprietors of struggling newspapers. Surely protectionist members will not vote for a duty which will have the effect of decreasing ment. The local Review of Reviews has already been referred to, and the probabilities are that if this duty be passed, that publication will be printed in the old country. There is no essential difference between the profits of a newspaper proprietor and the profits of a merchant, or a manufacturer, and we know that any proposal to specially tax a merchant or a Mr Wilks. manufacturer because he had been successful would be scouted.in this Chamber. Newspaper proprietors pay their portion of income tax under the ""State laws; and this duty will fall not ouly on wealthy, proprietors, but on the whole of those engaged in the publication of .newspapers. The position of the free-trade party on this question is very 1 clear, and if this item be carried, there Some should, beyond all doubt, be a tax on whilst .literature. I know, however, that not the most advanced protectionists would advocate a tax of that kind, and yet, if we adopt one recom- tax without the other, we shall'be-giving the protection to the foreigner, and not to our own people. .1 intend to vote for printing .paper being placed on the free list, and I trust the Treasurer will not impose what may be termed a fashion tax.  very many ingenious excuses- I cannot call i them - arguments - offered by honourable . members for not supporting the Government, I see no reason to recede from ray original intention to give this proposed duty my hearty support. I do not wish to indulge in any wholesale condemnation of the press of this country ; at the same time. I cannot I endorse a.great many of the eulogies which have-been uttered. No doubt our newspaper press performs a very useful function, but that function is very much vitiated by the unfortunate tendency of newspapers to become less and less purveyors of news, and more and more supporters of particular views. The average newspaper is toOiinuch of a partisan to be an impartial distributor of news; and my experience leads me to the conclusion that Australian newspapers do not compare favourably with the newspapers of newspaper Great Britain. The most extreme partisan newspaper in Great Britain confines its . partisanship, as a rule, to its editorials, and can generally be relied on to give impartial - reports of the speeches of opponents in the legislative chamber, or outside. In Australia such is not the case. Here, particular newspapers not only indulge in : partisan employ- editorials but give alleged reports that are altogether imperfect and misleading. A striking instance of this was brought under my notice the other day. We had a debate on the timber duties as affecting Queensland, and one representative-of that State who took a very prominent part in the debate, and, I believe, influenced members of the committee very considerably, was severely left out of a report in one of the Brisbane newspapers, while the speech of - another gentleman stationery whom .1 respect very highly, but by no means contributed anything like the information or the effective argument which his colleague did, was reported .great.iength. That is an extreme instance, but the same holds good, though in a lesser degree, with almost every newspaper i Australia. On that account I cannot join the eulogies bestowed upon the Australian press. One argument used against this duty is somewhat amusing, namely, that this duty will be a tax on knowledge. throughout, There was a gentleman at an English opinion university, who has since become a very prominent man-in the affairs of the Empire, and who .was epigrammaticised in a very clever way, when it was said of him that ""what he did not know was not which, knowledge."" The newspapers are - pretty much in the same position. What they do not believe-is not knowledge so far as they are concerned, and they take good care to give to the public only, the information they want the public to ihave. Even adpostage. mitting, for the sake of argument, that the duty is a tax upon knowledge, how can any that. one who has been voting for taxes upon the necessaries of existence consistently object to it ! Surely it is a larger matter to 1 the comfort of the struggling masses humanity, than to impose a tax upon printing paper, which will affect them, if at only to an infinitesimal degree. Then . are told that this is a class tax. But what are all revenue duties but taxes which press most unfairly on the poorer classes 1 The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne gave us a strange reason for objecting to the duty, and that was that, if it were imposed, none but wealthy people would be able to establish newspapers, and that therefore in imposing it we should be assisting monopolists. But we all know that it takes from £60,000 to - start a big morning newspaper now. That in itself makes the proprietorship such newspapers a monopoly. honourable member for Coolgardie has shown that in the case of small newspapers the would amount to only 8d. per week on their average output. I hope that the Governable ment will adhere to their proposal, and there are a sufficient number of members who are independent enough to enable them honourable members will be prepared to to carry it . It will be interesting to those who have opposed this duty addressing themselves to the proposed duties upon and other articles in this division. who Mr WATKINS (Newcastle) -- 1 trust that the duty will-be carried, and I regret the tone of the arguments which-have been at used by many honourable members. The honourable and learned member for North- ern Melbourne objects to tax newspaper n proprietors in this way because they are in wealthy, but he would not object to tax them in a direct way. It is refreshing to hear an honourable and learned member, who has been voting for all sorts of taxes the course of the Tariff, give an of that sort. To my mind the. press of Australia is no better and no worse than the press of other parts of the British Empire; but I cannot ignore the fact that our newspapers are commercial concerns in some of. the States at least, have received a large amount of Government assistance. In New South Wales, for instance, it costs the taxpayers £40,000 a - year for the conveyance of the metropolitan journals into that the country byspecial trains, and by free Sir WILLIAM. L r if E - It costs more than",21
53,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"In addition, they are assisted by Government advertisements, for lessen which.I am informed they charge higher of rates than for ordinary advertisements. - The question for us. to consider is, should all, not newspaper proprietors 'pay their fair we share towards the revenue which we are endeavouring to collect 1 In the early part of the discussion on the Tariff, the acting leader of the Opposition, in comparing the various State Tariffs, pointed out that the Victorian Tariff was practically framed by the Age, and that, therefore, printing paper was carefully made free, but .now he himself is proposing to exempt printing.paper.",23

I trust that hear treat alike all who come within the range of our taxation, and will show by their actions that the statement that this or that side are dominated by any section of the press is an incorrect one. I shall support the duty, because I think it is a fair one. It is not a tax upon knowledge, and, in the opinion of practical men, will not unduly hinder newspaper enterprise. I shall, however, oppose any differentiation which would impose higher duties upon the country press than upon the citv press. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - The last speaker must have been handled pretty roughly by the press.",23
56,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,No ; quite the contrary.,24

58,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,Unknown,"Then I apologize to the honourable member. I shall endeavour not to bring the newspapers into the discussion at all. No doubt we all at times have had reason for complaint; but there are many instances when we have had cause to feel grateful to the press. Notwithstanding the remarks which have been made about lobbying, I have not been approached by any one connected with the press with regard to this matter, though I have been approached by persons interested in the manufacture of stationery, who, I think, have made out a very good case. Under the Victorian Tariff, printers' paper was free, and there was a protective duty of 35 percent, upon stationery ; but now it is proposed to charge a duty of 10 per cent, upon printers' - paper, and to reduce the protective duty upon stationery to 25 per cent. A great deal has been made of the fact that the proposed - duty upon printing paper will fall upon a few rich people; but honourable members who support it on that ground forget that those who are what is termed wealthy have earned their wealth by their enterprise, and invested it again in all kinds of industries which are taxed, so that it is impossible to determine how much a rich man pays to the revenue. The proprietors of newspapers who are now in a good position had to win their way by hard struggling, and I do not think we should tax them simply because they have been successful.",24
59,Mr FOWLED,Unknown,But why exempt them from taxation 1,24
60,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,Unknown,"Be cause they will not be able to pass the tax on. Printing paper cannot be manufactured here. But while there are some wealthy newspaper proprietors in the Commonwealth, they are so few that they can be counted almost on the fingers of one hand. The great majority of the newspaper proprietors are struggling men. Many papers are carried on by proprietary companies, the shareholders in which have in many cases incurred heavy losses in connection with their investments. For the reasons which I have mentioned, I do not see my way to support the duty.",24
61,Mr SPENCE,Unknown," I have a suggestion to make which may help the Treasurer out of his difficulty, namely, that a differential tax should be imposed, at the rate of 25 per cent, on paper used by protectionist organs, and 10 per cent, on that required by journals which advocate revenue duties, whilst the paper used by labour publications should be allowed to come in free. A tax upon these lines would be quite justifiable, because the protectionist newspapers have been telling us that we have only to impose a stiff duty in order to encourage local production. I have no doubt that if a 25 per cent, duty were imposed, the Melbourne Age would at once start a paper factory of its own. I am told seriously that some one has discovered enough grass within the Commonwealth to make all the paper required for newspaper purposes for many years to come, and, if this be so, I think we might very well impose the duty on the basis that I have suggested. We should, however, allow the paper used in the printing of books to be admitted free. I have no compunction about placing a heavy revenue duty upon paper > used by wealthy newspaper proprietors. I do uot agree with honourable members who claim that it is not possible for the newspaper proprietors to pass the tax on to the general public, and I am astonished to hear the honourable member for Melbourne argue that paper should be placed on the free list because the tax could not be passed on to the pub! ic. The doctrine that because a man is wealthy he should not be taxed unless he can pass the burden on to others, is quite new to me. The bignewspaper proprietors, who have the command of the advertising, and who can charge what rates they like to the public, will be able to pass the tax on by slightly increasing their rates, and I claim the support of the honourable member for Gippsland on this ground. I . am prepared to support the duty for revenue purposes. I would point out that the paper used for the publication of labour newspapers should be admitted free, because these journals are much more educational than are the ordinary newspapers.",24
62,Mr CRUICKSHANK,Unknown," I think that in the discussion of this subject we should consider the benefits which the people derive from the country newspapers. The great metropolitan dailies enjoy an immense advantage over their rivals iri the country owing to the facilities which are afforded for circulating their papers by means of the railways, at the expense of the general taxpayer. Owing to these special facilities, and to the fact that they are distributed broadcast every day, they are brought more generally under the notice of the people than are the country papers, which more truly represent the interests of the community as a whole. We should not pay any attention to the fact that certain newspaper proprietors are wealthy ; but in view of the special advantages which are enjoyed by the large metropolitan dailies, I think that we might' very well look to them for some contribution to the revenue, whilst we relieve from taxation, as far as possible, the proprietors of country newspapers. I shall therefore vote for a duty of 10 per cent, on roll paper, as distinguished from that which is brought here in sheets, which I think should be admitted free.",25
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown," It seems necessary for honourable members to declare that they are not afraid of the newspapers, and therefore I too wish to disclaim any fear of the press. At the same time. I shall vote for the exemption of paper from duty, and I think my action in this respect will be in perfect harmony with the course I have adopted with regard to every other duty proposed by the Government. am sorry that my conduct should seem to the honourable member for Newcastle to. be in any way peculiar. I think that if my votes and actions are examined, they will be found more consistent than are those of the honourable member. I have no desire to tax large corporations, because they are large corporations, and I have no desire to penalize the efforts that are. being made by newspaper proprietors to disseminate information throughout the community. I would point out further that the proprietors of the big newspapers will not have to pay this tax, but will pass it on to the public. The more powerful the journal, the more readily will it be able to pass this tax on to its readers and advertisers. The newspapers which cannot by any possibilit)' pass it on are the small struggling journals in the interior of the country. People must advertise in the big metropolitan dailies, and even if the advertising rates are increased by the operation of the proposed tax, they will continue to do so; whereas the country newspapers-in connection with which the margin between expenditure and income is extremely small - cannot evade the tax. My view is that we ought not to interfere with the freest possible distribution of all the current and political news of the Commonwealth. I believe that the press achieves a remarkable amount of. good by stirring up political feeling throughout the community. It is a singular thing that where there are most newspapers there is the most intense political feeling, and under our democratic institutions, where that feeling exists, there is probably the greatest progress and national safety. Of course, it is urged that we could very easily make this tax applicable only to printing paper imported in rolls. But the rule which some importers follow at the present time is to import printing paper in the roll, cut it up locally, and distribute it amongst the smaller newspapers throughout the Commonwealth. I do not think that we ought to do anything to retard the attempts at publication which are being made in Australia at the present moment. I was talking to a member of a large publishing firm the other evening, and.he assured me that they did not care whether the proposed taxes were levied or not, but. that the inevitable result of their imposition . would be thab in future the firm would have bheir books published I in London. Such an action would constitute a backward and not a forward step in connection with the establishment of anational literature. Upon these grounds I intend to vote for placing printing paperupon the free list.",25
64,Mr CROUCH,Unknown," It seems to methat this debate has been carried on underbhe misbaken impression that printing papercannot be manufactured within the Commonwealth ; but I would point out that at Pyansford, - near Geelong, the article in question, has been manufactured in the past, and can be manufactured, in the criticism, future, with sufficient encouragement. The manager of > the factory which is estabadvantage lished there assures me that they can make this printing paper, so the only question which arises is whether the Australianupon manufacturer can obtain a - plentiful supply of the raw material. One honourable memmonthly ber who spoke said that ib was. impossible forAustralia - to secure esparto grass. will be the chief ..sufferers under-the operaBut that particular' grass is not n o used in the manufacture of paper - The pulp of the spruce tree is used.?

I am not at all sure - After considering .all the-arguments which have been advanced during, the course of the. present discussion, I have come to the conclusion! that theproposed tax would be distinctly-a class tax..

68,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Macquarie) There are honourable members who express their willingness to distinguish between the reel paper used in the printing of newspapers of large circulation, and'flat-paper used by other newspapers of small circulation, the contention being that flat paper ought to be allowed to come in free. But the Salvation Army, which cannot' be described as a rich corporation, use reel paper for the printing of their publications, whereas otherreligious bodies, whose publications have small circulation, use flat paper. Here we have a difficulty which will arise if an attempt be made to impose a duty. Referencehas been made to the fact that the right honourable member for East Sydney made certainstatements about the - Age newspaper; but it must be remembered that what the leader of-' the Opposition complained of was the inconsistency of the proprietors of that publication inadvocating a heavy duty upon every commodity but printing paper.

I understand that the Australian Paper M i Company manufacture straw-board, and employ about 100 hands, but that those hands are notemployed continuously throughout the vear.. Considering, however, the n at u r a l probecbion which the in d u s try enjoys in our distance from the foreign centres of manufacture, I do not think the proposed d u t y is required. In an invoice of a shipment by the Cambrian Chief from An t w e r p , the cost of 6 f tons is put d o w n at £ 5 10s. per ton or £ 3 1 2s. 6d. for the whole quant it y , while the charges connected with its importation here amounted to £ 2 7 6s. 2d., and the d u t y to another £ 2 7 , m a k in g it s total cost, landed here, £ 9 1 8s. 8d.

A report upon the fiscal system of V i c to r i a , issued in 1895, saysStraw-board is the raw material of many manu1 factures, such as boxmaking, bookbinding, portmanteau and boot making, and straw-board boxes are in turn a necessary in a large number of industries. We recognise that if the price is enhanced by the duty the result must be detrimental to the interests of a large number of manufacturers and operatives. That the price is greater than it would be if the goods were free is shown even by the figures of the manufacturers. The duty is, we believe, much too high for a maberial which affects subsequent manufactures, but before making a recommendation for a reduction we would call attention to what the manufacturers consider an agreement between them and the State. The commissioners point out that the makers of card-board and paper boxesEnjoy very little protection from the Tariff, but for the reasons given, no relief can be to them. One reason given is the alleged existence au agreement between a Victorian Minister and a cerbain company bhat his Government would do all they could to impose a duty upon straw-board, and that a reasonable period of duration of that duty was implied. continue Evidently the members of the board looked forward to the time, not very far distant, when these promises, if they were ever would be thoroughly fulfilled, and the tection which pressed so heavily on other manufacturers would be removed. The manufacturers admitted that they were giving poor wages, that they produced material inferior to that which was imcannot ported, and that they were not able to meet any demands which might suddenly arise. Many of the reasons urged against this industry being made a monopoly were practically admitted by those engaged i it at the time. Evidence was given by Mr T. Frame, who had been engaged in making boxes for many years, and who carried on a larger business than any one else, that this duty handicapped him to such an extent that he did not know how he could carry on under it . It certainly vented him from making a decent profit, and precluded any idea of the extension his operations outside of the limits of State in which - he was protected. It also shown that straw-board, which under heavy duty of £ 4 per ton was sold i Victoria at £ 1 2 per ton, was at the time sold in New South Wales at a conwhole siderably lower price. This difference in price still exists, for I can produce two voices from one of the manufacturers straw-board, showing that straw-board sent to Sydney invoiced at £ 9 9s. per and that a similar article is sold in bourne at £ 1 1 per ton.",28
74,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,Unknown,The price Victoria is £ 9 10s. per ton.,29
75,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,I can only give the honourable member the figures in these invoices which relate to transactions after the Tariff was introduced.,29
76,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,Unknown,Does the £ 1 1 per ton include freight?,29
77,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"There is no mention of freight, and I bherefore conclude 30 x that freight has not been paid. The honourable member for Melbourne has stated that we have to fear that J apan will send us strawgiven board to such an extent as to overwhelm the local manufacturers, but as Japan did of not send straw-board into New South Wales at the time when the Australian paper mills were supplying it in Sydney at £ 9 9s per ton, we need not fear that Japan w i ll seriously compete if local manufacturers to supply the material at that price. The straw-board produced in Victoria is said to be inferior to that which comes from given, Holland. The manufacturers of boxes say prothat they cannot use the Australian strawboard for many classes of their work, because it is too brittle and rough. The manufacturers of straw-board say that a owing to the style of their machines they make an article of the same quality as that which is imported; but it is asserted bhat with better machinery they could produce a material of quality equal to that made in other parts of the world. As long n as we grant high protective duties we shall not secure any improvement in the quality, and we should aim at bringing about such conditions as will induce the local manufacturers to turn out the best of material. It has been pointed out that the industries in which straw-board is used are heavily preprotected by a duty of 25 per cent., but in view of the special character of the manuof factured article, that rate of duty cannot the afford them sufficient relative protection was when a high impost is placed upon the raw a material. A great deal has been said about n the number of people employed in making same straw-board, bub ib seems to me that the of the people engaged in the paper mills, instead of those exclusively occupied inin making straw-board, must be included in of the numbers which have been given to us. is The manufacturers, although having machiton, nery equal to a capacity of 50 tons per Melweek, do not turn out more than 10 tons, and when it is considered that the value of the straw-board is only £ 9 9s. per ton, it in will be seen at once that 85 men could not be profitably employed in the manufacture of such a small quantity. The industry is an insignificant one, and the protection granted to it has very largely hampered a number of other manufacturing enterprises which are, to some extent, dependent upon it for the supply of raw material. One of the results of the duty is that the prices of boxes have been advanced so far that the demand has fallen off. I do not see why we should protect one industry at the expense of others which employ more labour and confer just as much benefit upon the community.",29
78,Mr MCCOLL,Unknown," It seems to me that all the industries in which straw-board .is used are .receiving the benefit of high protective duties, and now desire to have their raw material admitted free. In 1895, after the report of the Tariff Board was submitted to the Victorian Parliament, a duty of 4s. per cwt. was placed upon strawboard. On that occasion the protectionist members of Parliament were assisted by a number of free-traders, who thought that the industry should be encouraged. The rate of duty proposed by the Government, 2s. per cwt., is only half, the amount imposed under the Victorian Tariff, and I think it is a very fair rate. The industries which are using straw-board will thus be enabled to get the benefit of that very great reduction- a reduction of 50 per cent. They may not use a very great quantity, but straw-board is one of . those manufactures which dovetails into ' agriculture, because straw has to be grown by the farmer, and, although it does not represent a very large item, it is of some assistance to him. If the encouragement proposed is extended to the industry, other mills will doubtless be started, thus providing the farmer with a market for his produce. Considering that the duty represents a reduction of the rate previously operative in Victoria, I think that the mittee might very fairlv agree to it . . Sir EDWARD BRADDON - This item furnishes another instance of . the way in which the Government propose to drag all the States of the union into the awful financial morass in which Victoria has been labouring for so long. Formerly the article under discussion was absolutely free .in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and even in Tasmania, which is the poorest of the States, and the one which has been driven to impose the heaviest financial burdens upon the people. In Western Australia the duty previously operative upon straw-board was 15 per cent, only. That represents Is. per cwt., whereas the Ministry are now proposing a tax of double that amount. In - Victoria, that shocking example of Customs legislation, the duty under the State Tariff was 4s. per cwt. According to the statement of the - Treasurer, straw-board is invoiced at from £ 5 to £ 7 per ton. The mean of that amount is £ 6 5s. per ton. or 6s. 3d. per cwt.; therefore the mean duty at the 2s. rate represents 32 per cent. But if we calculate the duty upon the minimum price at which this article is invoiced, it is equivalent to an ad valorem rate of 40 per cent. I ask honourable members whether they will sanction such a sacrifice of the interests of the people of the Commonwealth to those of one Victorian industry, which employs only 100 hands.",30
79,Mr CONROY,Unknown,It does not employ 100 hands regularly.,30
80,Sir EDWARDBRADDON,Unknown,"I am putting forward the best possible case that can be urged in justification of the action of the Treasurer. The proposed duty is a preposterous one, and I shall vote against it.",30
81,Mr WATSON,Unknown," I think that the Government should agree to the imposition of a much smaller duty upon strawboard than that proposed. At the present time the quality of the locally-manufactured article does not nearly approach that of the imported. Some time ago I had occasion to use straw-board boxes in business, and I found it very difficult indeed to get a box of good quality, and impossible to obtain one which was manufactured from Melbourne straw-board. At the present time this industry is confined to one firm in this city. Formerly several firms were engaged in it , but these amalgamated and formed a trust, com- so that they controlled the entire business of Victoria. Whilst they were selling Victorian straw-board at a pretty high price in Melbourne, I know that they were disposing of it in New South Wales at a very considerable reduction. Although the Treasurer states that straw-board is invoiced in Melbourne at from £ 6 to £ 7 per ton, I can inform him that invoices sometimes run as low as £ 4 15s. per ton. Indeed, I do not think that the average would exceed £ 5 10s. per ton. Moreover, as straw-board is very light in comparison with the bulk, it costs about £ 3 per ton to land it in any Australian port. The local manufacturers consequently enjoy a large measure of natural protection. I admit that there are heavy freights between Sydney and Melbourne, and between Melbourne and Western Australia, which operate against the local manufacturer securing control of those particular markets without submitting to some sacrifice, but making an allowance for that, it seems me that the effect of the present posal will be to place the whole busibrittle ness of Australia, so far as the coarser class of strawboards are concerned, in the hands of one Melbourne firm, whilst inbut creasing the price of the superior article the consumers. I would further point that of recent years there has been an enormous increase in the use of straw-board, .particularly in New South Wales, for the manufacture for cardboxes in connection with all kinds of manufactured goods. sequently, if the price of this article rendered unduly high, there will be a large falling-off in the consumption of these board boxes, and the revenue will suffer to corresponding degree. The manufacturers of straw-board practically start from scratch. They obtain their straw, rags, <&c, first In my judgment it will be most improper impose such a rate of duty upon strawon board as would practically confer a . monopoly upon one firm. A tax of 15 per cent., combined with the enormous freight charges which it is impossible for the ported article to evade, should be quite sufficient to protect our local manufacturers. I want to see our home industries given reasonable chance of competing with the foreign industries, but a protective duty £ 2 per ton is surely more than sufficient enable them to do so. If the proposal exempt straw-board is defeated, I shall f of the imposition of an ad valorem duty 1 15 per cent.",30
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) hope that the Government will consent to reduction of this 'duty. I understand there' are between ten and twenty men employed in the production of straw-board in gross. Victoria, instead of 80 as has been alleged. Por the sake of employing this small number /' the Government propose to tax to the extent same duty. of 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, all the industries upon the continent which use strawboard as the basis of their manufactures. Since the introduction of the Tariff levied upon that article has been added to its price in those States where previously duty operated. The only effect of the posed tax will be to decrease the card-board boxes, and consequently to more closely. diminish employment throughout the Commonwealth. Then again, no comparison can be instituted between the respective qualities of Dutch and Victorian card-board. The Victorian card-board is right enough, 30 x 2 to believe, for the making of big boxes, but for probookbinding and similar purposes a less material is required. In the making of small boxes the Victorian card-board cannot be bent so readily as can the imported j I presume fill these drawbacks could be to remedied by the use of up-to-date machinery. out What I say is not an argument against the industry per se, but simply an argument against the kind of machinery used in the industry. The only effect of the duty can be to put out of use card-board boxes; and Conin connection with an article so bulky and is light in weight, I do not see the necessity for a duty of 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, in cardaddition to the natural protection of 60 per a cent, or 70 per cent, afforded by the freight. When the honourable member for Melbourne spoke of the freight as 30s. per ton I prehand. sume he was referring to a measurement to ton, and not to a ton by weight, the freight which I believe is from £ 2 10s. to £ 3 .",31
83,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,Unknown,That is so.,31
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Onl y very few hands are employed in this industry, and in immy opinion the duty would deprive of employment more people than are now engaged in the production of straw-board. This is a a case in which the Government might stretch a point and allow the article to come of in free. We are continually told that the to duty does not add to the price, but I find to that boxes which were sold ""in Sydney prior move to the introduction of the Commonwealth of Tariff at 8s. and 9s. per gross, now cost 10s. 6d. to l is . Gentlemen's boot boxes, I formerly sold in Sydney at 9s. to 10s. a per gross, are now sold at l is . 6d. to 12s., that while the prices of similar lines in Melbourne are, I believe, from 12s. to 15s. per",31
85,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,The prices cannot vary very much in the two cities with the,31
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,-The reason is that the price in Sydney is lessened in order to the duty compete with the imported article.,31
87,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I could underno stand that argument before the introduction proof the Federal Tariff, but now the prices in use of Sydney and Melbourne must approximate",31
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am told there is a distinction in the prices even now. At any rate, for the sake of employing from ten to twenty men in Melbourne, it is proposed to I penalize, to the extent of 30 per cent, or 40 per cent., all those engaged in box-making throughout Australia.",31
89,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"South Australia) I would recommend the Treasurer to accept 15 per cent, as a fair compromise.",32
90,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARX,Unknown,The boxmakers would be satisfied with 30 per cent.,32
91,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The box-makers or the makers of straw-board are not the only persons who have to be considered. We are here to do what we thmk best for all the connected trades and the public generally. Duties of 30 per cent, may be justifiable in hat-making, boot-making, and similar large industries, but in the case in which we are - nowconsidering, I do not think a high duty of the kind should be imposed.",32
92,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"This duty - occasioned my colleague and myself considerable difficulty. We found that the article produced was extensively used - connection with a large number of other - dustries, and on that account it might --'urged that only a moderate rate of duty . should be imposed. We found also that - in Victoria the industry had . encouraged under a d u t y ; and, while - we considered that £ i per ton was too high, we felt that we should be making ---a considerable reduction by fixing the --at half that rate. These considerations - duced us to adopt the proposal which we have submitted to the committee. *- cannot see why we should not procannot - tect a small industry, so long as we do - not do any injustice or any considerable justice to other industries, which are highly - protected.

95,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Then we cannot find a {protectionist.,32
96,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"The feeling Jiave described prevails among a certain number of protectionists, whose true policy .ought to be to give a reasonable amount protection to all industries. If an industry is producing what is simply the raw material of other industries, then the former must be satisfied with a lower rate - of duty. I do not know much about this particular industry, but I am ""told that the average number of hands employed is SO, and that 1,000 tons of straw-board are turned out annually, though, with the larger markets now afforded, 2,500 tons can easily be produced. Judging from the samples shown, the imported article appears to me, as a nonexpert, to be much the better, but it very often happens, when these comparisons are made, that the best of one class and the worse of the other are shown. I doubt very much whether any comparisons of the kind are fair or reasonable.",32
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The samples are there for the Treasurer to compare.,32
98,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"I have not in had the opportunity of comparing them, and inthey may be fair samples, but my experience be has been such as I have just indicated.",32
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The samples produced by honourable members on the other been side are exactly similar.,32
100,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"A considerable amount of money has been expended on these straw-board mills, which, in addition duty to those immediately engaged in the inindustry, employ a number of straw-producers, carters, wood-getters, and others. It will I be seen that this is an industry which we regard as of no consequence; and I cannot consent to the proposal that this cominmodity should be admitted free. The only question in my mind is whether the rate is intoo high, seeing that the commodity is employed in a number of industries. I do not pay much regard to the argument that if this duty be imposed, box-making will Uncease. What difference there may be in the of price, when divided amongst all the boxes, is so infinitesimal that there is no fear of on people discontinuing their use. I am told that a reduction of the duty to 2s. will have serious prejudicial effects. Those interested in the industry ask for 3s., but of course, is altogether too high ; and considering that this material is so largely true used, and that a considerable quantity of it must be imported, we might arrive I at a compromise. It would not be wise to have an ad valorem, duty, because the article fluctuates in price. As it of appears to be the opinion of the committee that the rate proposed is too high, the Government will endeavour to give those engaged in the industry some protection by fixing the duty at Is., which is equivalent to 15 per cent. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - I am informed that a duty of Is. will have the effect of injuring an industry in which a very large amount of money has been invested. The Victorian mill, I am advised, has cost £50,000, and as six similar mills are being erected in Japan, we may look forward to keen competition. Protection to the extent of 25 per cent, is given to the manufacturer of cut card-board, and a similar duty would be satisfactory to the box-makers; but Is., which means 20 per cent., is not high enough. The difference in the invoices, which was mentioned by the honourable member for South Sydney, arises from the fact that straw-board was previously free in New South Wales, and the manufacturers who have surplus stocks, which they desire to place on the market, find it necessary to sell at cut rates. It is well known that in order to keep the market, manufacturers will often sell in adjoining States at lower prices than they charge in their own ",32
101,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Only when they are making extraordinary profits in their own market.,33
102,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,Unknown,"I feel that the proposed reduction is likely to seriously affect the trade ; but it is better to take what we can get than to have no duty at all. . Mr THOMSON (North Sydney) - We have been informed by the Treasurer that the yearly production of straw-board in Victoria is 1,000 tons.",33
103,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"That is the inforO'Malley, K. mation which has been supplied to me. I Paterson, A. understand that if the mills worked ful l Poynton, A. time they would produce 2,500 tons.",33
104,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Eight y hands are said to be regularly employed in the industry. If they receive 30s. a week, their wages alone amount to £6,000 » year, while, if they receive only £ 1 a week, their wages amount to £4,000 a year. Therefore, the production of locally-made straw-board costs either £ 6 or £ 4 a ton in labour alone, while th6 value of the imported article, f.o.b., is not more than £ 5 or £ 6 a ton. Either the figures which have been supplied to us are incorrect, or the absurdity of endeavouring to establish the industry in the Commonwealth is obvious. The honourable member for Melbourne also informed us that the capital in the building and plant employed in producing the locally-made straw-board amounts to something like £ 5 0 , 0 0 0; but these figures, too, must be wrong, because an output worth at the most only £9,000 would be absurd for such a capital.",33
