2,Mr HAWKER,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"I move: That this House expresses its extreme concern at the failure, after twelve years, of the federal Government to provide a world competitive transport system for the nation, in particular, (a) heavily overtaxing fuel notwithstanding the enormous distances freight has to travel, (b) failure to achieve uniform national regulations for road transport, (c) underinvesting in transport infrastructure, (d) to provide fair retail pricing for fuel in country regions, (e) failure to develop a competitive national rail freight service despite promises to do so five years ago and (f) despite expenditure of $430 million our performance on the waterfront continues to fall further behind our competitors and that as a consequence regional development has been stifled while exports have been denied the chance to reach their full potential. For 12 years we have seen a government that has been big on selling and short on vision. It has been big on rhetoric and short on long term planning. Transport is one of the main areas of arrogant short sightedness. Over the 12 years where gains could have been made we have seen nothing but a decline. Today I will examine several key areas in which I believe this government has allowed our transport system to be far less than world competitive. In fact, it has allowed us to fall behind, meaning that every Australian is suffering. I will look at six areas: fuel tax, the lack of uniform regulations, infrastructure investment, country fuel prices, rail freight and the waterfront. I start with fuel tax. We see that tax on fuel has been marked by nothing but adhockery and a constant increase. The government has continued to extract more and more tax from fuel users while spending less and less on roads. In fact, when Labor came to power in 1983, over 60 per cent of fuel tax was spent on roads. Today, less than 10 per cent of fuel tax is used by the Commonwealth for road funding. Looking at what has happened in real terms is even more startling. Using 199293 prices, we find that back in 1982-83 road funding was over $1,400 million whereas today it is $795 million. That is almost half the figure of 12 years ago. Since 1990, when we had all those election promises and One Nation programs, road funding has dropped by a staggering two-thirds. By maintaining very high costs of fuel, the transport costs for all production rise. There is an indirect price flow-on to consumer goods, which hits all Australians-not just at the petrol bowser but also at the shops. The second area I look at is that of regulation. ThisÂ· is a very sorry tale. In 1983 there was an inquiry. In 1984 we had a report. The failure government said that that report would be put in place by 1988. Of course, that didn't happen. In 1991 we had another promise that it would all be in place by 1995. Now the government is going to have to defer again. Why? It is not because it can blame the states, but because the federal government itself still has not got its own legislation in place, despite all these years-12 years later. If we look at the performance of the National Road Transport Commission, which started off very well and produced some excellent reports, we find that, as usual, the government has failed to act and it is now seen as little more than an area for a lot of talk. When we look at this whole question of road reform, we see. the priority that the government gives it, because it is not even the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) who is taking responsibility nowadays, it is a parliamentary secretary. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is a nice chap but he does not have a lot of clout. He is only a parliamentary secretary. Of course, what has really happened is that we are seeing the monkey being sent into do the job instead of the organ grinderthe organ grinder being none other than Dangerman, who is obviously too busy spending too much time screwing up industrial relations. One little example illustrates it perfectly. Eight months ago, when the drought got too much for one Queensland cattle producer, he went to arrange for a livestock transporter to take the cattle interstate. The transporter found that he met all the regulations in Queensland. He checked it out with New South Wales and the answer came back by fax that it was okay. He checked out Western Australia and the answer came back by fax that it was okay. South Australia said, 'No, you'd have to bring your truck down here and we'll have to inspect it before you can do it.' Not surprisingly, he decided that he would take the risk. He got caught at Ceduna. He had to take the truck back to Port Augusta to have a quick inspection, pick up a fine and go on with his job. What better illustration do we have as to how much this government has failed in its move to get uniform regulations. This whole performance means that we have a government of perpetual announcement. We get announcement after announcement, inquiry after inquiry, always with a long time frame for these announcements, but somehow the government never delivers. When we look at the area of infrastructure, as with many other areas, the government has tried to spotlight all of this. If we look at it in real terms, there has been a long-term decline in public investment as a proportion of GDP. I am sure the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) would back that up. I think it can all be summed up by what the Institution of Engineers said in 1993: Present level of infrastructure spending is grossly inadequate. Creation of the existing framework has required consistent national investment years of twice the present rate. Failure to make adequate provision for maintenance and repair of that framework, let alone for continuing development and expansion to meet new opportunities. Over a short period of time, this will reduce our internaing. tional competitiveness. There it is-it puts it very simply in black and white. Yet the government continues to ignore this. What we are really seeing is just a flow of reports. For example, there was the Task Force on Regional Development in 1993. There was the Allen Consulting Group's report to the Automobile Association in 1993 which pointed to massive unfunded road and rail projects of the order of $15 billion to $20 billion and pointed out that the traffic congestion costs of Sydney and Melbourne are $2 billion each year. There was the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics analysis in 1994 which backed this up. And so the reports go on. It is not just the level of funding. What we find is that where there is funding there is massive waste. What better summation of this than the speech by the member for Shortland  House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure report in 1993 when he said: Overall there is little doubt that the existing inefficiencies in road construction and maintenance activities across all levels of government are robbing this nation of up to almost $1 billion worth of roadworks each year. He continued: In other words, almost $1 billion worth of additional roadworks could be performed in this country without the expenditure of one additional dollar. What an indictment, and it came from a member of the government, a former Minister for Transport, someone who really understands it. This was nearly 11 years after the government came to power. If we look at country fuel prices, we see clearly that the Labor Party has very little understanding of country areas and, worse still, cares less. The cost of transport, of course, is vital to people in the country because they rely on it every day. As a percentage of total costs for people in the country, transport is always much higher; in fact, often double. The Business Council of Australia put out a report in 1994 which stated that road transport in rural areas was overpriced. It said that road transport in city areas was underpriced. That is very interestI think the point is made very clearly once again that Labor ensures that the country subsidises the city. The report went on to suggest that rural fuel prices should be 20c per litre lower than now. This would lower costs to people in the country by a staggering $2.1 billion and would obviously have a far greater impact on our rural export competitiveness. High prices not only affect exports but also distort ruralurban investment patterns. These figures make a mockery of the government's regional development policy which is talking about $140 million over four years. The government talks of level playing fields. Maybe it ought to remember that charity begins at home. I want to get on to rail freight but, unfortuthe nately, time is going to be a bit limited- The Industry Commission has made many reports. We know that, because we' do not have a world best practice rail system:, the costs to farmers and the costs to our mining industry are far higher. The Bureau of Industry Economics has made points about this. The waterfront is another area where $430 million has been spent,yet we are' going backwards. As Contship put in its most recent rating of 46 ports, Sydney has dropped from 24th to 31st and Melbourne has dropped from 28th 'to 37th. What has happened on the waterfront really is a national disgrace. "" All of this shows that 'the Labor Party serious about reform. In fact, it has failed. Tr-nsport is one of the most essential things in this country, yet the government has neglected it and has failed to provide decent leadership for this country. (Time expired)",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,".,.Is the motion seconded? Mr Hicks-I second the motion and' reserve my right to speak.",13
4,Mr LATHAM,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"I welCome the chance to debate this motion and the further opportunity it provides to examine the transport policies of the opposition. The motion and the speech by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) are 'based on two propositions, two assumptions: first, that the coalition in government would' increase federal expenditure on transport; ana, second, that it would lower taxes on fuel. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing could be further from the truth once one examines the sorts of fiscal policies that are being promoted, for instance, by the shadow Treasurer, the honourableniember for Higgins (Mr Costello). The approach of those in the coalition is typical. They are the twocard tricksters of Australian politics because they only show one card at a time, never the two together. For instance, the shadow Treasurer in his budget reply speech at the National Press Club on 17 May showed one card. He declared the coalition's support for the FitzGerald report objective of increasing national savings in Australia by five per cent of GDP. The other card he tried to show that day was pretension of inoffensive policies: no new taxes, no tax increases and no use of those particular blldgetary tools to increase national savings. . At the press club he also pointed out that privatisation does nothing to improve national savings jn Australia. He argued that the privatisation of Telecom, one of the opposition's policies, would do nothing to meet that objective of improved national savings. This is what the shadow Treasurer said at the press club: Asset sales do nothing to boost national savings. They are simply a transfer of ownership from the public to the private sector. is not Under these circumstances, the House is entitled to ask: where is the coalition going to find the five per cent lift, the five per cent improvement, in pational savings? If it is not coming from new taxes, if it is not going to come from tax increases and if it cannqt come from privatisation of assets like. Telecom, it leaves a $20 billion hole in the outlays policies of the coalition, because that is the equivalent of five per cent of GDP. Mr Truss-Ha, ha. MrLATHAM-The shadow minister at the table can laugh about it, but the truth is that, until the coalition specifies its fiscal poliCies, it has a gaping $20 billion hole in its aspirations to improve national savings. There will be no new money for transport under a coalition government and no lower taxes on fuel. To increase the outlays on transport or to lower the taxes on fuel would make the fiscal hole in the coalition policies even larger. At this stage I must pay tribute to the Leader of the' National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) for his honesty, because he is one of the very few coalition members who is willing to show both cards in the two-card trick to the Australian public at the same time. He did that in an interview with the Australian newspaper, also published on 17 May. Let me read the report for the benefit of National Party members who will be going back to their electorates after this debate, along with the member for Wannon, saying that they are committed to improved transport outlays, particularly in roads. Let me read into the Hansard the details of that report: The Leader of the National Party, Mr Tim Fischer, broke a central tenet of rural political philosophy yesterday by saying a Coalition government would be unlikely to increase spending on roads. Mr Fischer told the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation that any increase could hurt rural Australia by increasing government borrowings and pushing up interest rates. He said it would be irresponsible to promise any increases in normal road spending. This amounts to a reduction in road expenditure proposed at the last federal election. There it is-the bald-faced rather honest admission from the Leader. of the National Party that there will be no increase in road expenditure under a coalition government, particularly in rural areas. Mr Truss-Wrong.",13
5,Mr LATHAM,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"He has been contradicted by his front-bench colleague, the honourable member for Wide Bay; who was saying that his leader is wrong. An interesting division has emerged in the coalition for a frontbencher to be saying in parliament that the Leader of the National Party is wrong. The honourable member for Wide Bay apparently is promising to rural Australia an increased expenditure in roads. I think the more honest assessment and more honest showing of the two cards to the Australian public came from the Leader of the National Party. In terms of the government's record on transport, there is absolutely no two card trickery. This government is full on aces. When we examine the record of tax in fuel, the tax take now in 1995-96 is lower than it was in 1982-83. If the honourable member for Wannon has a complaint about the scale of tax revenue taken by the federal government from fuel, he should be talking to his predecessor, Malcolm Fraser. It was Malcolm Fraser who turned the petrol bowsers of this nation into a tax revenue source. Since 198283 government receipts from fuel taxes, minus the diesel rebate, have declined in real terms from $6.4 billion, where they were left by the previous member for Wannon, Malcolm Fraser, in 1982-83, to $5 billion forecast in the 1995-96 budget. Members of the National Party should take their shoes off and get their hands on the table and do their sums- They will find that, once they look at the fuel taxes minus the diesel rebate in Australia,. the sum total has declined over the last 12 years and that represents real relief for rural Australia. Further, the National Road Transport Commission has calculated that the tax share of vehicle operating costs in Australia is approximately six per cent-there is an effective tax share of six per cent. It is little different to the average tax rate paid by all industries. Here we have competitive neutrality. It is beautiful to see. There is a six per cent effective tax share on vehicle operating costs in Australia. It is little different to the way in which federal taxes are applied to other industries. In terms of the second proposition advanced by the honourable member for Wannonuniform national regulations for road transport-he does not need to speak to Malcolm Fraser about that; he needs to talk to his coalition colleagues in New South Wales. The Fahey government in New South Wales-the tories-were holding back the progress on national regulations for road transport. The one recalcitrant state was New South Wales under the Liberal Party and the National Party. There is absolutely no doubt about that. In terms of the third proposition-this concept of underinvestment in infrastructure-:it has been revealed in this debate that the coalition would do less in transport spending, particularly in rural areas, because of the $20 billion fiscal hole in its policies for the next election and the very honest assessment I have read into the Hansard record from the Leader of the National Party. Further, there are two recent reports finding that overall spending on transport is not the central issue; it is the effective targeting of spending that matters most. I refer honourable members opposite to the EPAC report which found that the overall level of transport spending in Australia is satisfactory. It is the effective targeting that is all important. Further, the National Transport Planning Taskforce, in its report in December last year, concluded that there was insufficient evidence-we certainly have not heard it from the honourable member fo.r Wanno.n today-'to. suppo.rt a case fo.r a substantial increase in the current level o.f o.verall transpo.rt infrastructure spending. Therefo.re, this high quality repo.rt has fo.und that the go.vernment has pretty well go.t it right in terms o.f 'overall sp-nding o.n transpo.rt infrastructure aro.und the natio.n. The Natio.nal Transpo.rt Planning Taskfo.rce go.es o.n at page 6 o.f its repo.rt-and I am sure th- N atio.nal Party members o.ppo.site have no.t even bo.thered to. o.pen this repo.rt-to. o.utline the key areas o.f strategic transpo.rt investment which wo.uld lift natio.nal productivity and GDP. I was delighted to. hear the member fo.r Wanno.n o.utlining to. the Ho.use his suppo.rt fo.r the findings o.f the FitzGerald study o.n the allo.catio.n o.f ro.ad funding. It fo.und-and it has been co.nfirmed by the Natio.nal Transpo.rt Planning Taskfo.rce-that the big efficiency gain, the big impro.vement in productivity, co.mes from a transfer in road funding - fro.m rural to. urban areas, fro.m - lo.cal to. arterial roads. That is understandable because we have mo.ved the eco.no.my from an o.ld mining quarry and a reliance o.n agricultural expo.rts to. advanced manufacturing and service - industries in urban areas. We need to. transfer road funding from rural to. urban areas, from lo.cal to. arterial roads, to. bo.o.st GDP and pro.ductivity. Tho.se o.ppo.site sho.uld no.t lo.o.k co.nfused to.wardsrrie but to.wards the member fo.r Wanno.n. In his address, repo.rted no.w in the Hansard, he to.tally suppo.rted the findings o.f that FitzGerald study. That is what it said; that is where the big improvements in national efficiency and pro.ductivity lie. Time, unfo.rtunately, will prevent me from o.utlining this go.vemment'so.utstanding reco.rd in the o.ther aspects o.f transpo.rt raised in the mo.tio.n. But I have full co.nfidence that my co.lleagues the member fo.r Throsby _(Mr Ho.llis) and the member fo.r Paterson (Mr Ho.rne) will o.utline this go.vernment's fine reco.rd o.n the waterfront and o.ther aspects o.f transpo.rt infrastructure. (Time expired) Mr mCKS (Riverina) (12.51 p.m.)-I do. no.t kno.w where the member fo.r Werriwa (Mr Latham) has been these last several years, but o.bvio.usly he has no.t been in Australia. He mentioned a lo.to.f repo.rts, but the figures I have, in co.mpariso.n with his, indicate that the government receives nearly $10 billio.n in excise and tax fro.m fuel, and this year it is spending a measly $840 millio.n o.n roads. I am from a rural area, and it is abo.ut time that rural areas sto.o.d up and had their say. I heard the member fo.r Werriwa say that the mo.ney sho.uld be transferred to. the city. Do.es he no.t kno.w that two. o.ut o.f every three do.llars Australia earns in expo.rt inco.me is generated in rural areas? What do. we get back for it? If yo.u are talking abo.ut mining, farming, fishing, to.urism o.r fo.restry, mo.st o.f that mo.ney co.mes from rural areas. We earn this mo.ney in rural areas, yet the people in the capital cities-and go.o.d luck to. them to.o have the advantage o.f cheaper fuel. - I will give yo.u an example, and this is mainly fo.r the benefit o.f the member fo.r Werriwa. In myelecto.rate at the mo.ment a feedlo.t is being built called the Prime City Feedlo.t. It isabo.ut 40 kilo.metres west o.f Griffith and bo.th the Carratho.o.l Shire Co.uncil and the Griffith City Co.uncil are invo.lved. This business is go.ing to. have abo.ut 60,000 cattle-one o.f Australia's largest feedlo.tsand a thro.ughput o.f 150,000 cattle during any o.ne year. This feedlo.t will have a dramatie effect o.n the eco.no.my o.f so.uth-eastern Australia, and no.t just the Griffith and Go.o.lgo.wi districts. To. enable this feedlo.t to. be set up, we need infrastructure and ro.ad systems. The road system at the mo.ment is ho.peless because o.f years o.f neglect by bo.th state and federal go.vernments. No.w this feedlo.t is go.ing to. pro.duce inco.me fo.r Australia. Let us keep in mind that the current acco.unt deficit, which was anno.unced to.day, is $2.25 billio.n. If the government does no.t want to. sto.p spending, it has to. earn mo.re mo.ney. The o.nly place it is go.Ing to. earn mo.st o.f this mo.ney is in rural areas. Upgrading the road system in that area will Co.st abo.ut $30 millio.n. That is a lo.to.f mo.ney but we need it to. pro.duce expo.rts. This amo.unt o.f mo.ney invested by the federal go.vernment will earn $1.2 billio.n per annum fo.r the people o.f that area and this natio.n. People from the office of the Minister for Housing and Regional DevelopmentÂ· (Mr Howe) have been down to have a look at the development and said, 'I'm sorry, under most of the programs we can't do anything. We will look at it if you set, up a regional, economic development committee.' So the light is not completely out. This is just one exampIe of where we, can produce export dollars, but we have to have infrastructure and roads. Rural roads are particularly important. As I previously mentioned, two out of three export dollars earned for Australia are earned in rural areas. We must get infrastructure into those areas. If we get the infrastructure there, we will get development and .helpÂ· pay the bills for this government. But, with the way that we are going, we will continue to be on the slides, as we are at the moment. I am surprised that the newspapers. and media today are not up in arms. We seem to have become accustomed to having $2 billion plus current account deficits every month. People who take the laissez-faire approach say, 'This is wonderful. We are down to $2 billion.' We have to create infrastructure in order to create wealth for this country. We have to spend part of the $10 billion that is collected in fuel tax to do that. Infrastructure aside, look at the level of tax that some transport drivers pay. They have paid $6,000 per rig per year in additional tax since this government was re-elected in 1993. That is working against creating the wealth of the nation and trying to get the economy back on track. It is ironic that we in rural areas pay all this tax on fuel. One only has to tnivel through my electorate to see how the cost of fuel increases the further west one goes. I admit that increases in the price of fuel are not all due to increases in tax, but those increases are far more than what should be expected for those living in rural areas. I was pleased to see the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, come out and say that he will have an inquiry into the price of fuel. I wish him the best of luck, because we have had many of them before and nothing has happened. I hope that something happens with this one. He will certainly have my gratitude if it does. I reiterate that we must, through either the office of the Minister for Housing and Regional Development or the office of the Prime MinIster (Mr Keating), do something about creating ipfrastructure in rural areas, where most of the wealth of this nation is developed. If the government' will not stop spending money, we have to do something about creating. more wealth. One way that we will do this is' for the government to have a closer look at this prop,osal. I hope that members of Minister Howe's office come back to the Riverina and look at this development. There have been others that have tried to create some wealth, but they have not developed as we would have liked. We do not have adequate infrastructure in rural Australia. We have to do something about it'. I hope that under proposed programs the minister will see his way clear to assist. (Time expired)",14
6,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"One thing we have to come to terms with in Australia, given the diverse nature and the wide distances of this country, is an adequate transport policy. One always knows when opposition members are grasping at straws because they always talk about fuel and everything else being overtaxed. As much as they will howl about it, our fuel is not overtaxed and the government does not take the benefit of all increases in fuel. Our opposition colleagues have to ask where they will make those cuts from revenue. Will they cut the education system or the hospital' system? One cannot come into this chamber and argue that all the revenue raised by taxing fuel goes back to roads and then say, 'But we will not make cuts in our hospitals or education system.' Taxati()n goes into a pool and it is spread out. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has dealt with the road aspects. Mr Hawker-He didn't do a very good job.",16
7,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"I thought that he did a partiCularly sterling job. I do not want to get into it. I also note that this is a very wideranging notice of motion. It talks about having a competitive national rail freight service. The opposition talks in this chamber time and again about states rights. What has held up our having a national rail transport freight policy? The states have. They give us the power. Is the opposition saying to us that we ride roughshod over all the state governments? Over many years of negotiation, progress has been made. We have also tried to work in with the states. We are seeing evidence of that. Look at the line from Sydney through to Adelaide. That will assist freight. Look at the line across to Perth. All these things have been done not under a conservative government but since this government has come into power. The notice of motion also mentions the waterfront. It says that, despite expenditure of $430 million, our performance on the waterfront continues to fall further behind our competitors. That is rubbish. I cannot believe it. I come into this chamber and hear this time and again. I have visited many ports in the world. One cannot compare, for all sorts of reasons-five or three minutes is not enough time for me to outline all the reasons for itSingapore with Sydney. Mr Hawker-What about Auckland?",16
8,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"What about Auckland? Look at the problems that have occurred on the waterfront there. We hear all these arguments about us falling behind. The opposition talks about the waterfront as if it is a single entity. It is a whole chain. The honourable member for Wannon, who served with me on the House of Representatives committee inquiry into the waterfront, knows this. Yet he comes into this chamber time after time and makes these nonsense speeches, refuting everything that we learned in the two years of doing that inquiry on the waterfront. We found out that one of the real problems on the waterfront is not the waterside workers. They have reformed the union over many years and are now leaders. Mr Truss-Ha, ha.",17
9,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"You laugh. Have you ever been to the waterfront? You have probably never visited the waterfront. Come to Port Kembla in my electorate and talk to the waterside workers there, now the Maritime Union of Australia. We know that it is a whole chain, a whole cog. It is not an entity on its own. Unfortunately, everyone is there protecting a vested interest. If for once all the users of the waterfront worked as a team, as we recommended in the report that the honourable member for Wannon put his signature to, as did I, we wouldMr Hawker-Nothing's happening.",17
10,Mr HOLLIS,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"Talk to some of your farmer friends, who bring their produce there at the last possible minute instead of staggering it. Talk about the three days there before demur. rage is paid. Talk about all those things. But do not come into this chamber bagging the waterside or the Maritime Union of Australia, which was one of the first unions in Australia to reform and which has led the Australian trade union movement in reform. Come down to any meeting and talk to them. Come to the Sydney waterside, to Port Kembla, to Port Melbourne-any port-and you will see that what I am saying is spot on. (Time expired)",17
11,Mr WAKELIN,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"I welcome the opportunity to say a few words today about the transport of this country. The issue of transport being taken for granted is well exampled by the comments that have been made by previous government speakers. We have a great reliance in this country on transport because of our geographic distances and because about 70 or 80 per cent of our exports have to come out of regional Australia. My electorate of Grey is the third largest in the country and, therefore, I am acutely aware of the impact that government policy has on it. In a national context there seems to me, from my short time in this House, to be a glaring example of a lack of a coordinated approach. I do not altogether blame the federal government, although it has had an opportunity in the last 12 years to do a heck of a lot more than it has been able to achieve. There is not sufficient understanding of the relationship between road and rail transport. The National Rail Corporation is endeavouring to bring a stronger and more coordinated approach to rail, but there is no research in this country, to my knowledge, of the relationship between road and rail. That should be done with great urgency, and I know that the coalition in government will achieve that. There has been some comment made about the collections of excise. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) tried to pull the furphy that there was only $5 billion collected. I am glad that the deputy whip from the National Party was able to pull him up pretty quickly on that one. It is worth remembering that with the focus on regional development that will play a key role at the next election the government is proposing to spend about $160 million over the next four years as its contribution to revitalising regional Australia. In one year in this country we collect .an extra $2 billion in excise, most of that ending up back in and impacting on regional Australia. Remember that at the last election the government said that there would be no new taxes. Immediately it was elected it increased tax, particularly excise. That is one of the great double standards this government will need to explain to the people at the next election. On the matter of the waterfront, one of the great frustrations in my electorate about the ports is the WIRA agreement, the compensation paid for restructuring. People receive handsome payouts of up to $300,000 or $400,000, go out the door on a Friday and then many of them are rehired at casual labour rates that are higher than the rates of pay on which they finished up. That is just one of the things adding to the costs. We are all reliant on export income but those who are directly reliant on it are particularly frustrated when they see what they perceive to be rorts-I was trying to think of a more generous word-like that. There has been some improvement but we are still well behind world best practice on our waterfront. If we want a competitive export industry that will deal with our current account deficit we have to have a far stronger recognition of the transport industry. For too long the transport industry has been taken for granted. I hear people within the rail industry, the road industry and the stevedoring industry saying, 'We have been here so long, we are taken for granted. There is not a sufficiently coordinated program. We are seen as a tax milch cow. People are not getting their minds around the hard issue of producing the infrastructure needed to take us into the next century.' It is very important for this country to have an internationally competitive transport system. (Time expired)",17
12,Mr HORNE,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,"The member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) must be sensing an election in the next few months or so. What a potpourri of traditional regional conservative scaremongering can he invoke from this little lot? I am surprised he did not mention the flag, the republic and compulsory unionism because then we would have had a real beat-up. In the few minutes available to me I would like to talk about some of the points that the member has raised. He mentioned fair retail pricing of fuel. Is the member for Wannon aware that this is a state issue? Is he aware that in 1973 the people rejected, by 70 per cent to 30 per cent, Commonwealth price control? Has he complained to the Kennett government in Victoria about its refusal to accept its responsibility and provide fair prices for the people of Victoria? I wouldÂ· have thought that a representative of the party that purports to be the champion of states rights would identify where the responsibility for this issue lies. It does not lie with the federal government. He mentioned the waterfront. Where would the opposition be without the age-old sport of wharfie bashing? It is certainly alive and well on the coalition back bench and generally comes from rural and regional members who do not have a port in their electorate and do not understand what waterfront reform has achieved. In his speech, the member for Wannon failed to acknowledge a number of the changes that have taken place. The three-year reform from 1989 to 1992 reduced the number of stevedores from 8,900 to 3,800. The turnaround times improved. The container handling rates increased from 13 containers in an hour in 1989 to 20 an hour in 1992. He did not acknowledge that there were productivity gains at wheat terminals that gave the wheat industry a $35 million a year saving. In my region of the Hunter, the Port Waratah Coal Services recently invested $100 million in a second coal loading facility which enables two bulk coal carriers to be turned around in 24 hours, each of them being loaded with in excess of 100,000 tonnes of coal. It is the most efficient and best coal loading facility in Australia. It is in my area and I am proud of it. But that is the sort of thing that is happening all over Australia, not only in the Hunter, when we use initiative. Are these the things that the member for Wannon is talking about when he criticises our waterfront industries? I really think his argument is empty rhetoric and based on ignorance. The member for Wannon mentioned underinvesting in transport infrastructure. Again, he is unclear about what he is criticising. His speech was just the traditional broad brush approach without specifics. Has he told us that his part of the world is about to receive the benefits of a federally funded standard gauge railway that will see Adelaide linked to Melbourne by a standard gauge? That will be opened on 4 June, which is just next week. For the first time in Australia, all Australian capitals will be connected by a standard gauge rail, with dedicated freight lines to speed both freight and commuter travel, including 24-hour access to freight terminals. Perhaps the member for Wannon wants to talk about road funding. Here we should look at what his colleague the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) told the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation less than two weeks ago. It was reported that: Mr Fisher told the annual conference . . . that any increase could hurt rural Australia by increasing Government borrowings and pushing up interest rates. In other words, there will be no extra money for rural roads. The member for Wannon really is in a bind. He wants the federal government to intervene on states rights when his own party supports states rights. He wants the federal government to increase borrowings and spending when his own party, his own leader and his own shadow Treasurer want this government to cut spending and borrowing. What does the member for Wannon want? (Time expired)",18
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSPORT SYSTEM,Mr Jenldns)Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. The honourable member for Paterson will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA NA,19
14,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COSTS,"I move: That this House: (1) particularly notes chapter 8 of the report entitled Access to justice by the Access to Justice Advisory Committee, ""Tax deductibility of legal costs""; (2) further notes recommendation action 8.1, namely, ""The Government should commission a review of current law and practice governing the tax deductibility of litigation legal expenses""; (3) understands that: (a) there is evidence where large undertakings, particularly some banking corporations, frustrate justice in some litigation cases, by unnecessarily continuing the legal process until the litigant is unable to continue as they exhaust their funds and can no longer pay for legal representation; and (b) the legal expenses paid by the defendants are tax deductible while the litigant rarely can make such a claim for their expenses and, consequently, current tax treatment of legal expenses does disadvantage individuals who seek access to the legal system; (4) notes further that the problem was thoroughly examined in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration's report entitled A pocket full of change in the section, ""Settlement processes and litigation""; and (5) calls on the Government to have the tax deductibility of litigation costs further examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. In the 10 minutes I have been allowed in this debate, I do not wish to argue the case for non-deductibility of legal expenses, but I want to argue that the tax deductibility of litigation costs should be referred by the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration for thorough examination. In its action plan, the Access to Justice Advisory Committee devoted chapter 8 to tax deductibility of legal costs. The Trade Practices Commission, in its report, found many aberrations in the tax and court systems, because tax deductibility of legal expenses was provided for one litigant in a litigation process while being denied to the other private litigant. I will summarise some of the points made from those reports, starting with the report of the Trade Practices Commission. Firstly, the report found that tax deductibility may create distortions in the market which, in tum, create a bias in favour of business and a disincentive to compromise disputes prior to litigation. Secondly, tax deductibility may be a factor in excessive demands placed on limited court resources. This pressure on the courts and judges is all too obvious. Thirdly, strong equity considerations point to the need for a review of the current law, in particular the financial imbalance between private litigants and business litigants. Fourthly, the report raised the question of whether tax deductibility should be withdrawn entirely from legal expenses or whether, in cases where the other party cannot claim legal expenses as a deduction, it should similarly be denied to business litigants. This would not deny a business enterprise its right to litigate, but it would even up the field considerably between the two. Finally, the fact that the cost of non-tax deductibility of litigation expenses would fall heaviest on the insurance and banking industry comes as no surprise. Some points made in the report of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee are as follows. Firstly, the test of tax deductibility tends to be more lenient for business than for individuals not conducting business. Secondly, the New South Wales Law Society criticised tax deductibility of legal expenses as creating an incentive for business to litigate rather than use dispute resolution. Thirdly, there is an inequity between busi..: ness litigants and the individual, because one can rely on tax deductions and the other cannot. The report said that, because of this inequity, the general body of taxpayersincluding the private litigant-is subsidising the business litigant's decision to litigate. Finally, the deductibility of the business litigant's legal expenses could accentuate imbalances of bargaining power in the litigation. The Access to Justice Advisory Committee concluded in action 8.1 that the government should commission a review of the current law and practice governing the tax deductibility of litigation legal expenses. I am interested in this motion because I am one of only two continuing members of the House of Representatives committee that produced the report on banking and deregulation entitled A pocket full of change. In spite of recommendation 60 of the committee's report calling for independent mediators to overcome what the committee saw were the obvious facts outlined by the Trade Practices Commission and the Access to Justice Advisory Committee, there are many instances where some banks are still pursuing litigation for the purpose of forcing the private litigant into bankruptcy and ensuring their inability to proceed. Section 17 of our report investigated specifically foreign currency loans. In rejecting a call for a royal commission-sought by the then Senator MCLean and the Foreign Borrowers Association-the committee recommended that the 'Westpac letters' be referred to the National Crime Authority. Unfortunately, the referral. was not accepted by the National Crime Authority. If it had been accepted perhaps some of the continuing litigation cases would have been already settled more amicably. In one of the House of Representatives committee's conclusions-15.89, page 265the committee regarded as serious the allegations of abuse of process by means of banks' delaying tactics and poor discovery. This led to recommendations Nos 49 and 50 asking that the Australian Law Reform Commission examine .this abuse of process and that a Senate committee investigate the cost of justice issue. I am concerned that the problems presented by witnesses to our inquiry still continue, as does the abuse of the legal system. As a result there is no equity for the private litigant. That is due partially to the tax deductibility aspect of litigation costs and the fact that private litigants have limited funding and access to justice as compared with the funding power of the banks themselves. I was also disappointed in the response of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) of 9 March to my request to have this matter examined. He repeated what we all know about tax deductibility. But his comment that 'the government considers that the current taxation treatment of legal expenses does not disadvantage an individual's access to the 16gal system' shows that either the government or the Assistant Treasurer-or both-are completely oilt of touch with the reality as indicated by the Trade Practices Commission and the Access to Justice Advisory Committee. Since the committee's inquiry I have had close links with six cases involving foreign currency loans. Four of those cases have been settled--compromised with the banks' insistence that there be no publication or comment by the litigant on the terms of settlement, thus denying other litigants the ability to find out what the courts are thinking. The process of this particular type of abuse is outlined in a letter I receive\f from one of the litigants. I shall refer to the company involved as 'X company'. The letter reads: A brief outline of our case against [X company] and where we consider costs were deliberately incurred unnecessarily. 1. We commenced action against [X company] in 1989. . 2. The trial in this matterÂ· did not begin until July 1991. Counsel from both sides estimated that the trial would take three weeks. 3. Approximately three weeks into the trial [X company]' s Counsel took the court by surprise and submitted a 97 page written submission. 4. The Trial Judge adjourned the trial for one week in order to read the submission. 5. The Trial Judge gave a written judgment against lawyers making written submissions without prior permission from the court. 6. These tactics used by [X company]' s lawyers successfully turned a three week trial into a five week trial. 7. At the end of the five week trial, [X company] was found to be negligent. 8. [X company]'s lawyers then misled the court as to the true effect of the evidence of their own expert witness ... The wrong assessment was then applied .to the Quantum of Damages. 9. We had run out of funds after paying our . lawyers $300,000.00. 10. We were forced to conduct our own appeal to the Full Court because our solicitor contacted the Bar Association and said we still owed him money. The Bar Assoc. then barred us from having legal representation. 12. We appealed to the High Court. Then the Banking Inquiry released their report which recommended mediation for cases that had not proceeded through all stages of the court (Recommendations No. 60). It fitted us like a glove. 13. We attempted to withdraw our appeal to the High Court (still without legal representation) in favour of mediation ... [X company]'s lawyers again misled the High Court as to our intention to withdraw and had us 'struck out'. 14. On 23 December 1992 we attended a mediation ... [X company] appeared at this meeting with lawyers from three separate firms ... This was the same legal team that had been against us through the trial . . . As we had no legal representation we requested talking to [X company]' s representative ... alone. He told us that [X company] would not proceed with the conference unless all the legal advisers remained ... [X cOqIpany]'s lawyers said words to the effect; ""You cannot expect our client ([X company]) to give you any moneyit has cost them over a million dollars to get this judgment against you."" One .million dollars in legal expenses! The letter continues: 1 15. [X company] then attempted to bankrupt us. At three separate Bankruptcy Hearings [X company]. has appeared with up to six legal representatives, two of whom have been Senior Counsel . . . . They were the representatives before bankruptcy proceedings from X company. The letter continues: 17. Finally, while ... lawyers have had access to unlimited funds (subsidised by The Australian Taxation Office) they will continue ... to make a mockery of the Justice System and the Mediation Process System. There is absolutely no reason or incentive for them not to litigate to the death of it's victims. I have equally damning evidence from another source, but time does not allow me to refer to the matter. But if there. were an inquiry, I am sure that that evidence would be presented in person. I wish to say that not all banks, all insurances or all businesses approach litigation encouraged by the tax deductibility of litigation expenses, but some obviously do. The government's power to provide banking licences should exact a condition that the banks adopt a reasonable attitude in regard to the exercise of that licence. It is then the government's responsibility to ensure there is no abuse of that licence if some 'of the banks are abusing the tax deductibility of legal expenses. I recommend the motion to' the parliament for the reference to be referred to a House of Representatives committee.",19
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COSTS,"Mr Jenkins)Is the motion seconded?  the' motion. I enter this debate as someone who is interested in justice issues and access and equity. Some comments I have made about the operation of the family law court have caused some commentators to say that the Chief Justice has just fallen short of calling for my resignation, but I am unrepentant about that. I am delighted to stand and second the motion moved by my good friend the honourable member for DawsonÂ· (Mr Braithwaite). I cannot claim to be a continuing member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, but I can claim to have put the motion to have an inquiry into the banks on to the caucus Notice Paper. Of course the committee was brilliantly chaired by the now Speaker of the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Cunningham. (Mr Martin), together with his colleagues, such as the honourable member for Dawson. I think we need to explain for ordinary Australians just what tax deductibility means, particularly in banking. Take farms, for example. If a bank takes a farmer to court to repossess the farm on the basis of a failed mortgage and, incidentally, not being compelled to mediate, spends $1 millio- and that farmer spends $50,000, the bank is entitled to claim $1 million as an expense of business. What this means is that taxpayers are subs idising the litigation. We are subsidising it to the tune of 36c for every dollar. I know that, when a powerful committee, an important committee, such as that responsible for A pocket full of change, gives a signal on behalf of the people. of Australia that it would like to see more. mediation, the people of Australia should reasonably expect banks to pick this up. I regret to hear the member for Dawson saying that they have not. In relation to the farming community, I think it is an absolute tragedy that banks are happily foreclosing on farmers without resorting to mediation. In fact, there is only one state in Australia that has introduced legislation to force compulsory bank mediation for farmers-that state is New South Wales. I am pleased to say that the then shadow spokesman for consumer affairs and now Minister for Agriculture, Richard Amery, was at the forefront of that fight. Whilst I support this motion to commission an inquiry, I have to say that the big end of town,especially banks and insurance companies, should not be subsidised when hitting the battlers or the little people. In the whole ai:ea of banking, we have got a lot of benefits out of deregulation. Whilst I would be the last one to want to tum back the dock, I think we have failed to set up propei: protecti<m for consumers. Some members might ask me, 'Why has the independent banking' ombudsman not intervened in the cases spoken' about by the member for Dawson?' Firstly, the independent banking ombudsman is an industry ombudsman paid forby industry. Secondly: small business is ,precluded from such areas.' of operation. What we are finding is that a whole raft of people need consumer protection-not just Mr and Mrs Average but also small business and farmers. We have a long way to go. Banking is no ordinary private enterprise arrangement. The honourable member for Dawson is not permitted to go out and establish a bank in his electorate or in my electorate. It requires a government licence. Not every company that applies for a licence is entitled to get one. Unlike other businesses, we have the operations of the Reserve Bank, which, even though it does not guarantee deposits, ensures there is no collapse or denigration of depositors' funds. It is almost a fail-safe business--even when businesses haemorrhage, as the banks did in the eighties with their corporate lending policies. These people operate with a government licence. They are huge institutions. It may be pleasing to shareholders that they are earning a billion dollars per company profit, but we have to be satisfied that they are doing things in the national interest, that they are marshaltuity? ling and husbanding the nation's savings and that they are not using their economic power unfairly or improperly in dealings with their customers. In that regard, I was most amused to read that the ANZ Bank said, 'You should not be interfering with our ,dealings with customers. ' I commend to honourable members an article in the New South Wales House of Assembly Hansard where Mick Clough, the honourable. member for Bathurst, talks about what has happened to the farming community in its dealings with banks and financial iristitutions. It has been nothing short of a scandal. We should ensure that banks deal properly, fairly and justly with customers and explore every opportunity for a proper and appropriate outcome. Their use of foreclosure, their use of the legal system and their bankrupting of farniers are able to be done because of unequal economic power and the fact that the Commonwealth and ordinary taxpayers are subsidising their legal activities. The honourable member for Dawson mentioned a case about a foreign bank loan. The borrowers' court costs came to $300,000. Can you imagine that the bank would have turned up with some suburban solicitor to defend the case? Of course not. There would have been fees for instructing solicitors, a top silk or QC and a junior. There would have been no incentive for the banks to settle early but every incentive to starve the individual out of funds. It is not good enough. The ordinary people of Australia are shocked and will be shocked to learn that their tax dollars are subsidising the big end of town, the banks-which are making whopping profits in the 1990s as they recover from theirÂ· slothful mistakes of the 1980s-and are subsidising their litigation. I hope that the motion moved by the honourable member for. Dawson will attract the support of both sides of the House-and in its proposition and seconding, it does-and that we will see such a reference. I live in hope that we might wish to examine the whole fabric of consumer protection as it relates to banks. Should these licences be granted in perpeShould there be a review? Can we facilitate class actions against the banks? Can we empower individual consumers to stand up? Should they be dependent only on the operation of a bank appointed, bank funded independent ombudsman, or will we get something decent-a public ombudsman with no restrictions on his or her ability to investigate the actions of the banks and their customers? I support this motion.",22
16,Mr ABBOTT,COSTS,",There are many horror stories involving banks and small investors. I submit this one to the House because of the wider problems it illustrates.Â· Dick and Robyn Van Rheeden were a retired couple living on the northern beaches of Sydney. In the late 1980s they signed a contract to buy home units on the Gold Coast. After the 1987 stock market crash, they were going to let the contracts lapse and forfeit their deposit but, after a visit from their local Westpac manager, they felt reassured that the value of the units and the value of the family home meant that they could go ahead and complete the transaction. So they borrowed a very large sum of money from Westpac. . As it happened, the property market crashed, the units did not sell, interest mounted higher and higher, and eventually Westpac sold the Van Rheedens' home to cover their debts. The Van Rheedens claim that they had gone into this purchase only on Westpac's advice that they could afford it. Essentially, the subsequent legal case turned on who was to be believed-the Van Rheedens, who claimed that Westpac's representatives were responsible for their loss, or the Westpac manager, who claimed that he had made no formal representations about the value of the Van Rheedens' assets. As it happened, the trial judge believed the bank manager and not the Van Rheedens, probably because he found that Mrs Van Rheeden was in a highly emotional condition and had taken a set against the bank. From being comfortably well off, the Van Rheedens had been reduced to living out of suitcases and in rented houses. They accept that they acted unwisely, but they are concerned to ensure that, where two dollar-struck parties-a bank and a private citizen---,;enter a deal, it is not just the private citizen who bears the loss. . There are three issues here. The first is tendency of judges to believe professionals rather than lay people. No doubt, when compared to Westpac's manager, the Van Rheedens were highly emotional, almost distraught, witnesses. Let us' face it: Westpac's manager was going to get paid regardless of the outcome of the case whereas the Van Rheedens stood to lose their whole life savings. Right now we are understandably anxious to eliminate gender bias in the law, but the solidarity of judges for other professionals may be just as insidious 'in denying justice to deserving individuals .. The second problem, at least on the evidence I have seen, is Westpac's failure to disclose its relationship with AGC, which was financing the home units which the' Van Rheedens were trying to buy.' Westpac, in other words, had a double interest in the Van Rheedens"" purchase: first, the interest income that W estpac would earn on .the money borrowed; and, second, the profit AGC would earn-or more likely the losses AGC would avoid-if these units sold. The law should require institutions to disclose to their clients their additional financial interests in their clients' affairs. The third problem is the gross disparity in legal firepower between Westpac and the Van Rheedens, who are now my constituents. Pitting the Van Rheedens against Westpac is like Australia playing against Western Samoa. Sure, they play under the same rules and the referee might .be fair, but even under those circumstances Australia starts 30 points in front. However, in this case the opponents are not playing under the same rules; and the rules are not fair because if Westpac spends $100,000 defending a legal case, that $100,000 is entirely . .tax deductible. If a priv'atecitizen spends $100,000 taking a legal case, every last cent comes. out of after tax dollars. . AustraliaÂ· argues, quite rightly, for. a level playing field for overseas trade. What the Australian government demands of other countries it should grant, to its own citizens. Public companies in particular should not have an institutional. advantage over their legal opponents. There are many things that the could be don.e to fix this problem. Contingency fees is one; changiIlg the lit-gation happy atmosphere, where some people are more interested in fees than justice, is another. We should certainly reconsider the tax deductibility status of compallies' legal expenses. I am happy to commend this motion to the House.",23
17,Mr TANNER,COSTS,"I gather the honourable. member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), in a previous incarnation, was an accountant in a country town. As somebody whose father was an accountant in a small country town-and he was a member of the same party. Mr Braithwaite-Mackay is bigger than a country town! Mr TANNER:-Orbost is not. I was not sure which town the hOf\ourable memqer was from. I am very familiar .with the views that accountants of that nature. tend to have about lawyers. I was alawyer for a few years and I have' a fair degree of sympathy for the accountant's view, so lam also in sympathy with the m o t i o n . ' ' There are some difficulties with the proposition but the suggested mechanism of referring the matter to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is sensible because this issue needs to be examined very closely. We have to recognise that there are plenty of legitimate circumstances in which it would be quite appropriate for a business involved in litigation, including litigation against an individual rather than another corporate entity, to be able to deduct the cost of that litigation. I suggest to the honourable member for Dawson that many small businesses in his constituency, for example, would need to chase debtors and would find it extremely difficult to get people to pay up if those businesses were encumbered with the additional burden of not being able to deduct the legal expenses they legitimately incurred in pursuing such things. There are plenty of examples of tax deductibility for legal expenses being quite legitimate and no speakers in this debate would disagree with them. However, there is no doubt that the points that have been raised by all speakers in this debate are valid. We do have a problem. How to tackle that problem is the real question. The problem ultimately comes from an inequality in economic power. This means that if a company is very large and is able to bear the cost of litigation, and is also able to deduct the cost from its taxation, it has an enormous advantage over people such as the constituents the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has cited. In my practice as a lawyer I encountered this type of situation very commonly, particularly with groups such as insurance companies. One of the classic examples is total and permanent disability benefit claims under superannuation trust deeds-I have mentioned this here before-where the person whose claim has been denied by the insurer has the choice of accepting the result or risking thousands of dollars pursuing a Supreme Court case with maybe a fifty-fifty chance of success. They know that the costs to them if they fail will be enormous and they could lose their house, yet the costs to the insurance company will be written off as a tax deduction. Those are the sorts of problems people face. I point out that a lot of these issues have been tackled in the Access to justice statement-and the Sackville report was referred to by the honourable member for Dawson. Such things as increasing access to community legal centres and better legal aid-and broadening it beyond the heavy focus on criminal legal aid-are very significant steps forward in tilting the balance of power back a little in favour of small people so that the huge imbalance they tend to face against organisations such as banks and insurance companies is redressed a bit. But there is a lot more to be done; there is a lot more on the agenda-for example, the abolition of QCs, merging the professions, and allowing others outside the legal profession, including accountants in certain circumstances, to conduct certain functions that lawyers currently have a monopoly on; There is a range of issues that slowly, bit by bit, both the federal government and most of the states are starting to tackle. I was pleased to see that the former New South Wales Liberal government under Premier John Fahey took the lead on the issue of the abolition of QCs. I commend it for that. There is a long list of issues in the legal profession and the legal system in which reform is necessary; for example, the ending of restrictive practices and the streamlining of procedures. Another issue which has been raised by another member in this place is compulsory third party property insurancean area where there is inequity in access to the law because of the way the system functions. The final point I will make is that the real problem in all of this is not so much the economic power issue. That is a separate issue. It is not the legal system that creates that; the system just reflects it. Economic inequality is a broader issue than that. The real problem is excessive litigation and the fact that tax deductibility tends to create an incentive, particularly for larger corporations, to go all the way in litigation and to avoid mediation by simply saying, 'No, we are not interested in talking; we are not interested in settling; we are not interested in resolving sensibly. We are going to fight you all the way to the High Court if you can find the $100,000 to finance your case.' The real problem is that what our system currently does is to encourage excessive litigation so that we have more lawyers in Australia than in the whole of Japan, which of course has about six times our population. We need to look at this issue from both of those angles. (Time expired)",24
18,Mr BRADFORD,COSTS,"I agree with much of what the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has said. I support the motion to the extent that does call for a further examination of the issue of tax deductibility of litigation costs. also join the honourable member for Melbourne in expressing a reservation about the principle involved in that. Whilst I am happy to have another look at it, it obviously requires a very close examination and I do not support that principle wholeheartedly at this point in time. I was disappointed that the honourable  opportunity to bash just about everybody involved in this issue. He expressed some very serious reservations about and cast aspersions on the banking ombudsman because she is industry funded. He probably overlooked the fact that the banking ombudsman has actually done a very good job of solving a lot of the complaints that people have had. If he were to read the ombudsman's annual report carefully he would see that many of these disputes are now being settled to the full satisfaction of both the banks and their customers. So the ombudsman, I believe, needs to be given a pat on the back, rather than a kick in the backside, and encouraged to keep going. Bank bashing-and there was an element of that in some of the contributions, and my friend the member for Chifley fell into that trap-is a bit like motherhood. It is easy to get up here and bash the banks-and my own close colleague the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) did not actually pull too many punches either. The fact is that most of the banks-and perhaps all the banks-have very good relations with most of their customers most of the time. The sorts of circumstances that my colleague the member for Warringah referred to, and the sorts of matters that are brought before the House of Representatives Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee, of which I am a fairly recent member-and I respect the long standing service of the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on that committee-are, ultimately, very few compared to the number of banking transactions that go on from day to day. Therefore, I do not want necessarily to take it the more difficult path of defending the banks, because in many respects they have a I lot to answer for. I do not think there is any doubt about that. But by and large we should recognise that most banks have good relations with their customers. They realise it is a competitive industry. They realise they will survive only if they do the right thing by their customers. That was one of the aims and objectives of deregulation, which the government, to its credit, brought about. There are elements of that that have not worked, but nobody here-certainly the member for Chifley made the point-is arguing for reregulation. I wonder where the member for Chifley and others who go down that track want to stop. They may not be arguing for reregulation of the banking industry, but they are certainly arguing for a degree of intervention in customer relations that I think raises some serious question marks. The member for Chifley, for instance, makes the point-and he is technically correct-that there is a sense in which the taxpayers at large are subsidising this tax deductibility. But if you want to take a very small technical point, that is the case with all tax deductibility. I would view it as the right of any business-and the banks are not a great exception to this-to defend the interests of its stockholders. If that means taking legal action, a business is perfectly at liberty to do so. Another issue altogether is the inequality of power involved in the relationship. There is always inequality of power whether it be between a retailer and a shopping centre owner, a ratepayer and the local councilor, on a broader scale, the rich and the poor. There are ways to address that other than taking what I would see, blandly, as a very extreme action of disqualifying the tax deductibility of actions taken legitimately by businesses protecting their interests. I certainly take the point of the honourable member for Chifley, that the banks are very privileged in that they are given a licence to operate-and the honourable member for Chifley asked some good questions about whether those licensing arrangements are, per se, adequate. In other words, as with television licences, such is the public interest involved that they perhaps ought to be subject to some review. However, I take the view, and my experience as a member of the committee to date has been, that certainly the Reserve Bank, the ombudsman and the degree of competition that exists ought to keep the banks fairly honest and, by and large, the banks ought to have a lot of pressure on them to go about their business practices in a correct waywhich, by and large, is happening. The government's response to the Access to justice report is now available; it has just come across my desk and that response, I think, is in many respects very good. Certainly it addresses the issues about lawyers and access to legal aid, and I commend the reading of that particular report to all involved. (Time expired)",26
19,Mr LES SCOTT,COSTS,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this motion. Like yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, I was on the committee that did the report A pocket full of change and I am well aware of the contribution made by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who was also on that committee. It is a bit sad that we have to come back to these issues, because some of them raised here today should have been sorted out long before now. We are now debating whether to refer matters like this back to the committee, which I support as an appropriate course to follow. But It IS a pity that that has not already been resolved. As acknowledged by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford), whilst the banking ombudsman does a fair job there has always been some reservation about the fact that the ombudsman has been funded by the banks themselves. That has always been a concern to me because the banks could be seen as either continuing or withdrawing that financial support at any stage. One of the recommendations in the report A pocket full of change was to increase the powers and the limits from $100,000 to $200,000 and some of the parameters that the ombudsman could look at, particularly in relation to small business. Unfortunately, those things have not been picked up and I think it is high time that they were as well. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would also recall a report, An assessment of tax, last year on the Australian Taxation Office in which this whole question of litigation was also discussed because of the problems caused by the costs to individuals of pursuing actions through the courts. Of course, that report actually recommended a small claims tribunal for small taxpayers which could deal with amounts up to $5,000. I am pleased that the tax office has responded to that and the government will proceed along those lines. That is a good initiative to protect the rights of individuals. As the honourable member fOr MCPherson said, bank bashing is always the flavour of the month but I would' suggest the banks create that problem themselves. We do not create that as members of parliament. We are just the people who get all the complaints all the time and have to take them up on behalf of our constituents who, in most cases, have very genuine cases that they wish to pursue. The member for Dawson has made extensive reference today to the Westpac papers and the loan borrowings that have come through in the report A pocket full of change. Through that we have seen the extent to which banks have power and their financial capacity to take on anyone and everyone to the stage where individuals have had to give up pursuing issues any longer because they could not afford it. When we get to that stage, I think we have major problems. I was lucky enough to be present at the launch of the Justice Statement in Brisbane in the last couple of weeks. Most people would agree that that statement is a particularly thoughtful and comprehensive response to issues within our courts. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on the preparation of that report, which the member for MCPherson has also referred to today. A lot of the things that have come out of that-they have been in response to the Access to Justice Advisory Committee's responses-will go some way to addressing a lot of the issues that we are concerned with today. I believe this motion from the member for Dawson deserves the full support of this House. I hope that we can achieve the last part of the motion particularly, so that these matters are referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration where this whole issue can be re-examined to ensure that the rights of individuals are protected, we once again can bring the banks to heel on this issue and the whole issue of tax deductibility for legal matters is addressed in a full and comprehensive manner. If we do not do that, I do not believe we will have a fair system. There is certainly no equality now. Banks can pursue their cases, and poor individuals are always at a loss about how they will defend themselves. The cost to them is prohibitive. Once again, I congratulate the Attorney-General on the Justice Statement presented last week. (Time expired).",27

21,Mr KNOTT,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"I move: That this House calls on the Government to: (1) recogni-,- that (a) waste management is a major environmental consideration, (b) a source of the waste stream is derived from packaging in its various forms, (c) the major burden for waste management is borne by local government authorities and (d) the real costs of landfill and recycling and reuse programs in waste management are not reflected in the marketplace and are not borne by those who can reduce waste streams at their manufacturing source; and (2) introduce a packaging tax which would: (a) recognise the different materials used in packaging and the ability of such materials to be recycled or reused; (b) recognise the environmental friendliness of the production process of the materials used in packaging; (c) recognise the actions taken by industry to reclaim and recycle or reuse packaging material they produce; (d) discourage the quantity of packaging used on individual products; (e) cover domestic products and all imported products; (f) be directed through programs directly to local government authorities; and (g) have strong enforcement measures. Waste is an environmental consideration of a great order. In my electorate of Gilmore debates are currently raging from one municipality to another about where and when local refuse should and should not be placed and also where refuse which is sourced from outside those municipal areas should be placed and how it should be dealt with. In terms of what waste does to the environment, we can look to the space that it takes and the environments and habitats that it covers and takes over with its disposal. As a percentage of that waste stream, packaging has been variously cited as being as low as 30 per cent to as high as 60 per cent. Therefore, even if one projects the lowest figure that has been cited-30 per cent-we can see that it is still a significant part of the waste stream which goes through our society. Ours has been a society of growing waste. One needs to look at all industrial countries to be able to identify that situation. The burden of that waste stream is borne by local government authorities to a very great extent. That situation does vary from state to major state, but a generalisation can be made that the local government authorities are the ones who bear that major burden. That comes through domestic waste from their local areas, such 'as from town tips. It is also caused where areas are adjacent to or in close proximity to major metropolitan areas such as Sydney. In the instance of Sydney, we find that the last state government was involved in the process of organising mega-tips around the Sydney metropolitan area, the idea being that waste translocation facilities would be organised within v3:rious local government authorities throughout the urban area. They would then transport their waste, by contract out to areas beyond the city's limits. Therefore, those areas are the final landfill repositories. The probl,ems that 'that has created over the last 50 years in terins of engineering and the cost to the environment have been outrageous. It was always thought that, if it was low and if it was wet, you would fill it. The number of species in, the wetland areas which have been demolished because of this process has been quite outrageous. Whilst local government has taken on the burden, the co-ts to it are far beyond the point of sale. In other words, the marketplace itself is not responsive,,to those costs which are related to the product. Therefore, something needs to be ,done to put this all into one confine so that we can actually have an influence on, the types and quantities of packaging. I will give an example of package waste. I have two young sons who like ice blocks. If you buy. those ice blocks in a traditional supermarket, there are four levels of packaging, before, you actually get to the good. This is absolutely outrageous. A negative relationship needs to be established with the quantity of packaging; indeed, we need to ""increase the quality of packaging. To do that, we need to have some economic incentive, or disincentive, In this case, I would consider a packaging tax as the most appropriate regime .. A tax on packaging can be levied at the point of manufacture. This would put economic reality back to a.place in the was,te stream where it can actually have some effect. ' If a tax on packaging is passed on to consuniers in the,co,st of that packaging, so Manufacturers are always ready to look at decreasing their cost structures in terms of delivery of goods and services or of manufactured goods. I think there ought to be a strong impetus for those people to restrict the amount of packaging and the types of materials that they put forward. If they did not do that and the cost of packaging was passed on to the consumers, I believe that at least an income stream to handle that material would be generated so that those who have the burden-local government-would be able to access that income stream to provide environmentally friendly solutions. Let us move on to the different materials which are used in packaging. Within any packaging tax there needs to be a recognition of the variability of the environmental friendliness of the disposed materials. In other words, we need to look and see where, say, paper pulp is sourced. If it is sourced in native, forests or old-growth forests, obviously it will have a higher negative impact than if it was sourced from waste out of a pine forest. If we look at, plastic, we need to consider how the initial materials that went into the making of the plastic came to be in that format. This leads to the production process. The production process' can be either clean or dirty, and that needs to be reflected in the packaging tax. In other words, we need to develop positive incentives for industries to clean up the processes whereby they make the products which will ultimately become packaging materials; , We also need to recognise that some industries have already taken quite positive actions. Those industries should be patted on the back. They should be encouraged to continue the actions they' are taking in the reuse and recycle programs. Glass is obviously one of those industries, but there are a number of others. In particular, I sign-l waste recycling which takes place in the paper and pulp industry. We need to apply this pl;tckaging tax to all domestic ,and foreign products. In many instances, the foreign products are the worse offenders. We would need to make sure that be it. domestic producers who were f<?rced to comply with this packaging tax would not be adversely affected by imports which were not forced to comply. The local government needs to get the dollars directly from such a packaging tax. The main purpose for that is so that those who are doing the job actually have the resources to carry it out. Finally, there needs to be strong enforcement. For too long there has been too much rhetoric. The days of rhetoric are over. We need to have some positive actions which recognise that this is the case; that t4is is not some dream from some environmental feral; that this is in fact reality. I come from a background of local government. I was on the garbage committee. We tried to resite tips for many years, and I can say that it is one of the most difficult jobs anyone could encounter. (Time expired) Mr Newell-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",28
22,Mr HALVERSON,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"Casey) (2.02 p.m.)The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) may be correct in his claim that the major burden for waste management is borne by local government authorities, but it is appropriate to acknowledge the fact that in the 1980s many of these same local government authorities acted to effectively treble the amount of domestic waste directed to landfill when they decided to adopt the 240-litre mobile garbage bin system. They were warned at the time of the problems the MGB system would create, but they chose to ignore the warning. I am sure no-one doubts the good intentions of the honourable member in moving this motion. However, it does seem rather a pity that, as a former school teacher, he did not bother to do his homework first. I say to the honourable member: sorry, but this little effort certainly does not deserve an elephant stamp. Although we can give him a big tick for his opening pronouncement, there is no doubt he is quite correct when he states that waste management is a major environmental consideration. . Unfortunately, he scores nought out of 100 for his next statement, which forms the basis of and justification for this ill-conceived packaging tax proposal. His assertion that a major source of the waste stream is derived from packaging is demonstrably incorrect. Packaging is not a major source of the waste stream. In fact, it constitutes only about 10 per cent of the urban solid waste stream. Garden refuse, industrial waste, builders' rubble and other organic and food wastes are all significantly larger components. Why, therefore, is the honourable member targeting packaging? Why is he suggesting a packaging tax instead of a garden refuse tax, a building rubble tax or a food waste tax? Perhaps it is because, like so many other people; he simply does not understand very much about the packaging industry, how it operates and the reason whi it exists. Perhaps it isÂ· because packaging not only has the disadvantage of being very visible but also inevitably ends its life as a discard. It is therefore a very easy target to ilttack-albeit wrongly-as being unnecessary or wasteful. Whilst it may be correct that generally packaging does not enjoy a favourable reputation, it is certainly true that this unfavourable status is undeserved. In many instances, packaging saves more waste than it creates. The basic functions of packaging are to contain, preserve, protect and provide information. Without packaging, materials handling would be difficult, inefficient and uneconomic, but this does no- mean the packaging industry does not have an environmental conscience; in fact, the Australian packaging industry has a long history of environmental responsibility and achievements. It is hardly surprising that the reduction of packaging at source has been a major priority of the Australian packaging industry. It makes good sense for packaging companies to seek to minimise packaging. Less packaging means reduced production costs. Reduced production costs mean lower product prices. Lower product prices mean increased competitiveness and a greater share of the market. a The local food packaging industry is good example. Packaging material suppliers, packaging manufacturers and filling equipment suppliers have worked in close cooperation to achieve significant reductions such as decreasing the weight of containers by reducing wall thicknesses; wherever possible and appropriate substituting lighter packaging materials for heavier alternatives; using composite packages that require less material overall; taking advantage of computer aided design systems to redesign packages and container profiles; producing larger unit sizes to reduce package to produce ratios; and producing products in concentrated form. In Australia, over the past 20 years, these industry initiatives in source reduction have resulted in significant decreases in the overall usage of a wide range of packaging materials. Let the facts speak for themselves. Since 1980 the weight of a 375-millilitre beer stubby has been reduced by 35 per cent and the weight of a standard 440-gram fruit can has been reduced by 18 per cent. Since 1970 a weight saving of 30 per cent has been achieved with corrugated shipping boxes used for general grocery products; and folding cartons, such as those used for. breakfast cereals, have had their weight reduced by 15 per cent. Since 1975 the weight of gable top milk and juice c.artons has. been reduced by 23 per cent. Since 1979 - the weight of long life aseptic cartons has been reduced by 15 per cent. Since 1969 a weight saving of 29 per cent has been achieved for 375-millilitre aluminium beer and soft drink cans. Since 1986 the weight of 200-millilitre polystyrene yoghurt tubs has been reduced by 20 per cent. Since 1980 the HDPE milk bottle has been reduced in weight by 30 per cent. Since their introduction - n the late 1970s, the weight of PET soft drink bottles has been reduced by 38 per cent. The list goes on. It is very unfortunate and rather difficult to understand why so little recognition has been given to the packaging industry for these and similar initiatives, which have significantly contributed to minimising waste, whilst at the same time conserving raw materials, energy and landfill tipping space. The honourable member for Gilm:ore wants to reward the industry'sefforts by slugging it with a packaging tax. The harder it tries, the more he wants to penalise it. It simply does not make sense. It would be different if the industry was actively working to increase the amount and weight of packaging, but the reverse is the case. How about a little reward for effortsome acknowledgment of, and praise for, the results so far achieved. Amongst the factors the member for Gilmore suggests should be taken into account in assessing his proposed unreasonable, illogical and unwarranted impost on the packaging industry is whether or not the different materials used in packaging can be recycled or reused. He also suggested a packaging tax would discourage the quantity of packaging used on individual products. The packaging industry already has an excellent record on reuse and recycling. It was actively recycling long before the environment became a popular issue and it is certainly not content to rest on its laurels. It is significant that the impressive results attained so far-superior to virtually all other industries-have been achieved on a voluntary basis. In regard to discouraging the quantity of packaging used on individual products, it is not-all that simple. Apart from the examples I have already quoted, which clearly demonstrate the packaging industry's commitment in this regard, it should be remembered that there are minimums that must be applied. Adequate and appropriate packaging is essential to protect the quality and nutrition of food from damage and contamination and to prevent or minimise spoilage. There is a very real danger that food safety and public health may be jeopardised by ill-conceived regulatory measures aimed at controlling or reducing packaging waste, such as the proposal we are debating today. It is vital that policies aimed at minimising the possible environmental impact of food packaging, however apparently worthy in their appeal, should in no way compromise the degree-the very high degree-of food safety, quality and nutrition presently enjoyed by the Australian consumer. In any event, it is a fact that the packaging of food products not only reduces spoilage but also reduces the amount of waste going to landfill. Overseas studies have shown that cities in countries using a high level of food packaging have considerably less waste entering landfill than cities in countries with limited access to packaged food. Without the benefit of packaging to preserve food, .a higher proportion of spoilage occurs and, therefore, a greater amount of waste is consigned to the garbage collection for landfill disposal. It seems somewhat incongruous for the honourable member for Gilmore to feel that by imposing further taxes-and heaven knows we have enough of those already-we will solve a problem that industry is already actively and very successfully confronting. If he wants to tax someone-and the Labor Party is very good at doing. that-then why single out the packaging industry? If local government authorities are bearing a major' part of the burden of the cost of waste management, I ask: why do they not start charging on a user-pays basis for their garbage collection services? The more you tip, the more you pay. That would be much fairer. At least it might make people think before they throw. It might encourage more home composting, more active domestic recycling, more careful thought about the fact that our society is using natural resources at an unsustainable rate and creating more waste than can .be disposed of without environmental damage. The Australian packaging industry has a sound environmental record, one that has been achieved by working cooperatively and constructively with governments whilst at the same time devoting considerable resources to educational and community programs which have an environmental focus. The industry has a record of commitment to recycIingand waste management which is superior in quality and duration to that of most other countries. The success of the packaging industry in meeting its recyCling commitments and delivering responsible environmental outcomes indicates that a voluntary, cooperative and constructive approach-not legislation, and certainly not more taxes--:is the way forward. At the risk of adding to the existing landfill problem, I suggest that the honourable member's motion be consigned straight to the tip; it does not even deserve to be recycled.",30
23,Mr NEWELL,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"I am delighted to rise and support the motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) this afternoon in the House. The motion to introduce a packaging tax, amongst other measures, to achieve and recognise .some changes that are needed within the Australian packaging industry is timely. I would say to the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) that there is certainly no inference to be drawn from the member for Gilmore's motion-certainly nothing that I can see-that I will be going to the supermarket and buying my loaf of bread, my Weeties,et cetera; without there being any packaging on those items, as that would mean I would be purchasing food which is open toÂ· input from vermin, contamination, and so forth, during its travels from the producer to the consumer. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is evident that the whole issue which has been raised here this afternoon has touched on the nerves of those on different sides of the House'-which is, no doubt, a gOdd thing. Let us have a nice, vigorous debate about the . differentÂ· aspects Of where the industry is at present and where different members would like to see it going . .There have been some achievements overall in the environmental considerations and movements towards reduction of waste across the different sections of industry as a whole. The whole movement towards that certainly gained a big' impetus several years ago and led very quickly to the recognition that we iIi Australia do not have industries geared up and in place to handle the amount of material that can be recy(;led. That became a bit of an embarrassment in different places where material was simply stockpiled because there was not a market for it. If I have time, I will come back to the issue of the creation of markets for recyclable material, to ensure that best the amount that is recycled is increased and that people's .efforts at being, part of the recycling process are duly rewarded with that knowledge .. In different parts of the world there have been different approaches to this. No doubt Australia has led the world in some areas. It has certainly been a little behind the eight ball in different aspects. This afternoon the member for Gilmore has brought to the House a recognition that some areas of the industry need a bit of a push along. At the same time, we recognise that the best way is not just a stick but certainly a carrot as well-that is, some incentives for the industry to move at its own pace. At the same time, there has to be a bit of a lead there to ensure that the pace is realistic in what can be achieved. There have been considerable improvements in solid waste management in Australia. However, one only has to go into a supermarket or anywhere else-I talk about not just food but also other packaging material in different types of shops and retail outlets-to know that there is still a considerable amount of useless and superfluous packaging going into the products we buy. When you go into a supermarket and buy items of food, for instance-that is what the member for Casey was so concerned about; he seemed to use the emotive part of his argument to downgrade the motion of the member for Gilmore-you find that it is not unusual for there to be three or four containers encompassing the article you wish to buy. There will be a sterile and sealed container of quite strong security, due to the new technology that is able to be used. There will be one, two or three different cardboard packages surrounded by another plastic or cellophane type product which seals the whole lot up. Overall, even in the food area, which the member for Casey was so concerned about, there is certainly room for improvement. That is certainly true in many other areas also. When you buy a shirt, you find that there is more than enough cardboard to wrap the shirt three times, let alone to have it bundled up and nicely presented for the purpose of retail. Certainly the plastics and so forth which go into that can be done away with. The motion calls for a packaging tax to 'recognise the different materials used in packaging and the ability of such material to be recycled or reused' and to 'recognise the environmental friendliness of the production process of the materials used in packaging'. Overall, we have to recognise that we have to create markets for the recycled material. At the same time, the industries have to have some responsibility for the fact that the material they produce and recycle can be harmful to the environment.",32
24,Mr NEHL,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"I acknowledge the goodwill of the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) in moving this motion, but I have to say to him right at the outset: as far as Australia is concerned, no more taxes! Australia is being taxed to death right now. He wants to introduce additional taxes which will increase the cost of goods for every ordinary Australian family. I cannot believe that this is what he really wants to do; he just does not understand what he is doing. He says in his motion: Â· .. waste management is a major environmental consideration . . . Of course it is. Everybody knows that. Everybody agrees with that. He goes on: Â· .. a major source of the waste stream is derived from packaging in its various forms ... That is wrong. Ten per cent is the correct figure. He says: Â· . . the major burden for waste management is borne by local government authorities ... Again, this is part of the strange thinking of government members in this parliament. They think government has money. They think local government pays the cost of waste management. It is you and I and the people you and I represent in our electorates who pay. People pay-not governments. Governments have no money. If you are going to impose a tax to increase the costs of consumer goods to no great benefit, it is the people who are going to have to pay. A balanced approach to economic and environmental issues is a central issue for the Australian economy and, indeed, for the global economy. Consumers are far more aware today of the impact of waste on our environment, and that is a great thing. I am even pleased to say-I will praise the government, as I frequently do-that it has introduced $5.5 million in the recent budget for continued education on such things as recycling and building codes. That is a step in the right direction. We do need to re-educate. People should realise that the packaging industry is working well at solving the problem itself. Paper and paper board weight has been reduced by 25 per cent over the past 25 years. The recovery rate by the year 2000 will be 45 per cent with new recycling plants at Nowra and Albury. We should also bear in mind that one of the difficulties we have in selling our waste paper is that there are overseas subsidies. It is not just the Australian farmers and primary producers who are being affected by these subsidies. For example, the Dutch sell their mixed waste paper to Indonesia for $30 a tonne. The freight from Europe is $50 a tonne. They are even putting subsidies on waste paper to try to get into markets which should really be ours. We have to maximise the free labour that is used by Australian families all around this wonderful country in sorting things. Recycling is improving all the time in the steel industry. The overall recycling rate of steel is 70 per cent. Seventy per cent of all steel is recycled. Unfortunately, in municipal scrap-and this is where that free labour for sorting comes in-cans and small steel items are only being recycled at the rate of two to three per cent. The target is to get that up to 25 per cent. We are hopeful that, with the cooperation of the mums and dads of Australia, this can be achieved because steel is easy to separate, by magnetic means, from other garbage. This is going to be one area where we can make some definite progress. In fairness to the packaging industry, got to be realised that they are not foolish people; they are doing the best that is available right now. Nobody in their right mind who is a manufacturer or a user of packaging is going to use more than they need. The member for Richmond (Mr Newell) made some reference to sealed and sterile containers on the outside and then other containers on the inside. Does he really want to get food that can be contaminated in an unsealed and unsterile form of packaging? I find that absolutely amazing. The reality is that, if you look at the situation with a fair and open mind, it is packaging that has allowed the growth of civilisation. Mr Gibson-Ha, hal",33
25,Mr NEHL,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"The member for Moreton may laugh. Has he forgotten whooping cough and all sorts of other diseases that are still prominent in some parts of Australia that you and I are concerned about with our Aboriginal Australians? Packaging is at the forefront of civilisation. If you want to goback to having your live fish in the basin alongside and then cutting it to get it fresh, by all means. Without packaging we would not have the distribution of food and other products that are so important to our economy. My friends the member for Moreton and the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) may smile, but they cannot deny that. We have got to protect our foods from gases and fumes, from heat and cold, from desiccation, from vermin and from contaminants. (Time expired)",34
26,Ms HENZELL,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"Capricornia) (2.23 p.m.)I support the motion of the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott). It has put the whole issue of environmental safety and efficiency on the agenda. For that I applaud the energy of the member for Gilmore. From the thrust of the responses of those opposite, they are probably going to ask for a subsidy for the packaging industry since it is doing us so much good. They will be asking for a tax cut. We know that the packaging industry is very important. It provides $4 billion annually and employs 31,000 people. I have no doubt that the statistics mentioned by the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) are accurate. As the 1994 report of the Senate Standing Committee it has on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled Waste Disposal said at item 11.40: The Committee was told that the most important aspect of waste disposal in Australia was the financial aspect and it was not being addressed correctly. It is only when the full implications of waste were factored into the production process that industry will have a real incentive to minimise wastes created by its products and packaging. The thrust of this motion is to make sure that all sectors in the community take their responsible part in making sure that we do not further affect the environment. There is no doubt, as the Senate standing committee also indicated, that local government, the public sector, do take a fair bit of the expense of handling packaging. For instance, in the evidence to the committee, on page 255, the Local Government and Shires Association of New South Wales said: . . . Sydney councils are subsidising industry by $3.9 million per annum for the collection of materials that industry consistently reminds the community are recyclable. Local govern-ent is also subsidising the state government to the tune of $2 million per year. We really need to look at where the costs and benefits are. For all the benefits that the opposition has mentioned there are costs, even though I agree packaging is only one factor of environmental issues in relation to recycling and the use of waste. It has been assessed that environmental benefits of recycling are the following: reduction of energy use, 23 to 74 per cent; reduction of air pollution, 74 per cent; reduction of water pollution, 35 per cent; and, reduction of water use, 58 per cent. This has obviously been taken up by the Commonwealth government and the Council of Australian Governments. As part of the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development in 1992, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to: . .. work to ensure the costs associated with changing waste management practises do not fall disproportionately on industry and local authorities. It does involve making sure that all of us, including the community, are involved. The report of the committee at item 11.39 further said: The community must be made aware of the true costs of waste collection and disposal, and these economic incentives could result in a reduction of Â·material going to landfill and incineration, provide further incentives to recycle, reduce the pressure the environment, and provide funds for further research and development of alternative technologies. There is no doubt that the positive initiatives made have assisted in involving communities. In Queensland since 1990, 78 per cent of households have had access to council based recycling programs and 68 per cent of households have had kerbside collection. This has had a major impact so that now, in Queensland, 44 kilograms of material are recovered per person per year. In the short time available, I want to pay tribute to the Rockhampton City Council for its recycling endeavours. It received an award from Ian Kiernan, the founder of Clean Up Australia Day, on 16 June 1994. Mr Kiernan stated that Rockhampton's recovery rates were the highest in the country. Recycling had reduced landfill levels at the council tip by 73 per cent in two years, which was over and above the national targets. I believe it indicates what can be done if local councils involve the community through education. I want to pay tribute to what has happened in my local electorate, but I certainly think that all aspects have to be looked at it. All levels of government, the industry and the community must be involved in making sure that we handle our environmental issues very responsibly.",34
27,Mr ANDREW,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate and pick up many of the comments made by the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell). While I appreciate that she was not being entirely parochial in her support of what has happened in Queensland, I stand here as a South Australian from a state that has a very proud record in container recycling and waste management generally. That may seem like a hopelessly parochial statement to make. I say to my colleagues in the eastern states: you need only travel as I do from time to time between Canberra and Adelaide across the Hay plains to see the number of containers on the Sturt Highway that have been thrown from cars and the change that occurs when you cross the border on into South Australia, which gives me some justification for my remarks. I am proud to be a South Australian with our existing container recycling legislation. The one point on which I disagree with the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) is his call for a packaging tax. I share with other members on this side of the House my concern for another tax regime. I want to reinforce that fact by using the words of the member for Richmond (Mr Newell) who, in addressing this debate, called on legislation to be a carrot and not a stick in order to encourage better packaging management in this nation. I entirely agree. The whole secret of success in South Australia. I say this for the information of the member for Gilmore-has been that the legislation has effectively been a carrot and not a stick. What exists in container recycling incentives in South Australia is not a tax but the opportunity to get a refund for having returned that particular container to a recycling pool. That is the direction we should take and the direction I would encourage the member for Gilmore to take in this whole area of how we develop greater recycling. The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) have already made the point that as a general rule we use less packaging than we used to. The market dictates that that packaging level ought to fall. I heard with interest the member for Gilmore when he said that he had purchased iceblocks for his sons and had been concerned that in that iceblock process there were four forms of packaging. He did not have an opportunity, because time would not allow him, to elaborate. I was a little mystified because I could not quite see how you could avoid the stick which held up the iceblock. That may not have been what he was wanting to avoid. I was counting that as one. He was saying it was not, but I was trying to draw an analogy. I also felt, as everyone else would agree, that there was a need to have a wrapping around the iceblock for the sake of hygiene and that the iceblock was bound to come in some form of carton or container. So I was running out of areas in which I could prune the packaging concern that he had raised. In the industries with which I am most familiar, packaging has been reduced over the last decade. I frequently stand here as the representative of the Barossa Valley in defence of the wine industry. It is of interest to me that the wine industry, in trying to minimise its packaging load, has got to the point at which wine is now not simply put in casks, which themselves minimise packaging relative to bottles, but placed in entire shipping containers that are plastic-lined. So they are shipped to their destination as a wine in the container plastic-lined. The plastic-lined container, the balloon if you like, that keeps the wine in that shipping container, is itself then sent back folded to Australia for cleaning and recycling-I would have thought the sort of move that ought to be encouraged. Finally, since like the member for Gilmore I am running out of time, my particular concern about this legislation firstly was the level of tax. I would prefer some form of incentive. My other concern is that the focus of the debate has been on what local government ought to be doing. I agree that this should be an entirely local government initiative but, as such, I would have thought it behoves all of us to be encouraging our state colleagues to introduce some form of legislation at the state level. In South Australia, the state legislation introduced by a Labor government and policed subsequently by a Liberal government has been very successful. This is very much a state and not a Commonwealth initiative. Local government is very much a creature of the states and, as such, this direction that the member for Gilmore rightly wants to steer local government in ought to come as an impetus from state rather than from federal authorities.",35
28,Mr GIBSON,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"In speaking to the motion of the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), I would like to firstly respond to a number of the points that opposition members have made in their speeches on this motion and, in particular, in their opposition to the question of a tax. It is a fairly predictable reaction by the opposition to say, 'No, we can't have a tax, we are already overtaxed,' et cetera. But what has to be understood is that in dealing with waste management issues, in dealing with the waste stream that we have in our community, ultimately the consumers will always pay one way or another. If we do not reduce the level of waste, if we do not reduce the level of packaging that we have, we then have to find bigger and more dumps to get rid of rubbish and 'the councils pay. The councils charge extra rates to their ratepayers to deal with their waste management strategies, an- our environment suffers. We then have to spend a lot more federal, state and local government taxes dealing wjth major environmental problems because we are still chqpping down too many trees for production into cardboard and paper for packaging and we have to dig huge holes in the ground to bury our waste, polluting out environment. One way or another consumers pay. What the member for Gilmore has suggested in his motion is a means of providing some disincentive to companies to. use more and. more packaging. He is saying to those companies, 'If you are going to use bigger. and better packaging all the time which the community ultimately has to dispose of you will pay for it. Your product will be more expensive because there will be a tax on it.' That acts as a means of convincing companies and' consumers that it is not in their best interests to have that packaging. If we' do - not put the tax on that product, the tax will be multiplied 10 times over down the stream when councils have to impose greater rates on their ratepayers to deal with waste. . Waste aJso has an added impact on our environment. One way or another our country will suffer if we do not come forward with some positive, meaningful ways of dealing with the waste stream in our community; Let us not just reject the motion on the superficial leÂ¥el of; 'We are already too overtaxed, so let's not whack another tax on us.' That fails to recognise the fundamental question that we are seeking to address. We understand that a lot of the packaging is consumer driven. This is not a motion that condemns the packaging industry and says . that it is all their fault. It does not do that all. We understand that there has been a majorÂ·drive by consumers for more and.more packaging to protect the quality of the product and to protect it from. contamination or tampering. Over.the last couple of years, we have had a number of instances where tampering has occurred. The consumers have to understand that, in requiring that extra packaging, there is a cost. It is not just an immediate cost on the product but a cost to our environment and our community. This is 'providing a carrot and' stick approach. It is something that I think needs to be seriously considered and not just rejected out of hand for the superficial reason that we cannot have another tax. . Like the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who rightly proudly sang the praises of her local government authority, and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who talked about the work in South Australia, I would like to praise the work of the Brisbane City Council. The Brisbane City Council, as the largest local government authority in Australia, has committed itself to a program of reducing Brisbane's landfill by 50 per cent by the year 2000. Three years into that program, 'it is already well on target to achieving that. It has done that with one of the most comprehensive kerb side recycling programs and a 'number of other measures designed to reduce the waste stream, and it should be applauded. What the Brisbane City Council needs is the support of federal and state governments in initiatives like this which are designed to physically reduce the waste stream so that, instead of having to deal with the massive amounts of packaging that consumers purchase, there is a reduction in the level of packaging from the supermarket to the home. Therefore, when it comes to the council's responsibilities, it has much less to deal with. It is in everybody's interest that we positively deal with this issue. It is very much up to all levels of government to address it strongly.",36
29,Mr MACK,WASTE MANAGEMENT,"North Sydney) (2.38 p.m.)The member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) is to be congratulated for bringing this motion before the House. One of the world's major probat lems is the disposal of waste-nuclear waste, toxic waste, plain garbage and even space junk. Disposable packaging is a substantial part of that problem. It has increased expon.t:mtially since the 1950s. It is. no accident that, in the recently published list of Australia's richest men, the second richest made his fortune largely out of packaging. Since the 1950s, several things have happened. Firstly, the world population has dramatically increased. Secondly, even this rate of growth has been exceeded by the increase in the amount of disposable material being produced. As a result, more and more available public funds are being used for garbage. Most urban councils are now spending about 25 per cent of rates on cleaning, litter and garbage, thus reducing the funds available for many other public needs. Thirdly, the waste we produce is a lot more toxic, non-biodegradable and potentially threatening. Fourthly, the traditional method of disposal by landfill is becoming more difficult and expensive. We have tried to solve the problem by getting bigger garbage tins and tips. Yet cities have become dirtier and, like urban traffic, the volume of garbage simply expands to fill the space available. There is no solution until the heart of the problem is tackled. The volume of waste and associated problems will continue to increase until two basic issues are addressed: firstly, the attitude by individuals that there is a 'right' to dispose of private rubbish in public places wherever they go at no cost to themselves; and, secondly, the need for a restraint on the production of waste itself and the sheeting home to the producers of waste the full costs of its disposal. These fundamental facts have been obvious for many years, yet public policy and regulatory bodies have continued to be largely apologists for the packaging industry. Massive public subsidies have been maintained and even expanded to ensure the transfer of private costs to the taxpayer. The waste management industry is reported to be now worth some $280 billion per annum; hence the powerful incentive to ensure that the production of waste is not reduced. The industry will continue to argue that any restraint on the production of waste will reduce employment, just as the tobacco, armaments or drug producers do. The manufacturers of the gas chambers in 1941 even pointed out the quality of the construction and the industrial employment they were creating. The industry has always sought to avoid responsibility and continued to create unsustainable mountains of rubbish. Initially they spent millions on the pernicious 'Do the right thing' campaign. The idea was to promote a throwaway society by the production of endless disposables, encouraging people to assume the right to drop rubbish wherever they went at no cost to themselves and, more importantly, at no cost to the manufacturer. The theory is now discredited in terms of energy, consumption, the use of natural resources, pollution and the fact that the world is running out of disposal sites. So hey presto! Recycling is now motherhood, along with feelgood Clean Up Australia campaigns. These programs and others promoted by industry front organisationsÂ· simply deal with symptoms and, to the extent that they are successful, simply facilitate the production of more subsidised waste-anything to avoid policies of reuse, minimising disposables, reduced consumption or making the creators of waste pay. Political andÂ· bureaucratic conventional wisdom will promote recycling, thereby ensuring waste creation and consumption continues unabated. Good citizen certificates will be awarded on one side and blame the victim programs on the other. Attempts will be made to shame the public and the recycling police will probably soon be examining your garbage. While ever society continually produces ever-increasing quantities of disposable, non-biodegradable materials without any form of restraint, no real solution is possible. The only long-term solution to achieve a reduction in disposable waste is to remove subsidies and introduce charges, not taxes, on packaging and deposit legislation on bottles and cans. These systems are gradually being adopted in an increasing number of countries faced with the same problem. Any charges should be based on both the volume and biodegradability of the materials used and will result in a dramatic redesign of a great deal of excessive packaging. The charge would defray part of the public cost of disposal and would have a much greater benefit of reducing the total volume of disposable materials.",37

31,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The federal government is going to spend $100 million on an advertising campaign abroad promoting Australia as a tourist destination. I am delighted that the government is doing something positive for our reputation abroad instead of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) going overseas and rubbishing our constitution and denigrating the flag. I am particularly pleased that the focus 9f this advertising campaign is. going to be Manly beach, of which it was truly said, 'Seven miles from Sydney and 1,000 miles from care.' But, if Manly beach is good enough to promote, it is good enough to bring up to international standard. Manly council estimates that Manly beach needs $7 million spent to restore the seawall. Until this money is found and spent, promoting Manly in this way is a little bit like inviting people into a most beautiful but half-finished home. It is all very well inviting overseas tourists to come to Manly, but how exactly are they going to get there? Most visitors to Manly come by car. Without major transport infrastructure spending, inviting them to Manly is not so much inviting them to a beautiful beach but inviting them into an absolutely massive traffic jam. Today the government also announced that $53 million will be made available for coastal protection. The greatest thing that the government could do for coastal protection would be to announce now that there will be no further development on North Head and Middle Head. That would not cost the taxpayer one single cent. (Time expired) Opposition Policies",39
32,Mr SWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last week it was reported in the press that a Liberal Party election strategist had ruled out running an 'It's time' election campaign because Liberal confidential market research revealed the electorate did not believe that the government was old and tired, nor did it believe that the government had run out of ideas. It is the coalition in this House that is old and tired. It is the coalition in this House that has run out of ideas. A kind description of the opposition front-bench would be decrepit and brain dead. With Manly the exception of the GST, there has not been a new idea from the coalition in this House for 12 years. Compare that with the policy development of the government. We have had policy incentives with the white paper, superannuation, APEC and trade, but there have been no new ideas from the coalition. Let us look at who is old and tired in this House. Let us compare the government front-bench with the front-bench of the coalition: 27 per cent of the Keating ministry has served for more than five years compared with 45 per cent of the Howard coalition front-bench; the average length of service in the Keating ministry is seven years compared with 11 years for the Howard coalition front-bench; 29 per cent of the Keating ministry is aged 50 years and over compared with 42 per cent of the coalition. The people of Australia know that the opposition is old, tired and totally without any new ideas. Mobile Telephones",39
33,Mr SLIPPER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Plans by the federal government to phase out analog mobile phones by the year 2000 are totally irresponsible and threaten the hip pockets of over 1.6 million analog phone owners. As from 1 January next year, the government proposes to claw back the frequency used by analog mobile phone holders with a total phase-out by the year 2000. According to current indications, an Australian who owns an analog mobile phone will not be able to use it in four years time. Although the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is to conduct a public inquiry into the proposed phase-out in the 1995-96 fiscal year, he has repeatedly said that, due to contractual obligations with Optus and Vodaphone, the 1 January 2000 phase-out date is not negotiable. However, despite the minister's comments, I have received advice that it would be legally possible for the Commonwealth government to extend the provision of analog mobile phone services beyond the year 2000 if an agreement can be made between the government and the carriers. The stance by the minister once again shows the arrogance this government and how out of touch .it with the wishes of the people of AustralIa.. This week I contacted a number of mobile phone retailers' and. was told th-t aJ?a-og mobile phones contmuallyÂ· outstnp. dIgItal phones in the sales stakes. In fact, there currently an estimated 1.6 million analog phone users compared with 144,000 digital owners throughout the country. It isÂ· my understanding that the government plans for the spectrum currently used by analog system and, as such, there seems no practical reason why an extension beyond year 2000 is not possible. Unless the governrun to the federal parliament? ment extends the p'hase-out period, millions of analog phone owners . will be disadvantaged. (Time expired) Preselection",39

(Tlme Kennett Government: Emergency Relief",40
36,Mr CHYNOWETH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"During my. last 90-second statement. I said that Mr BaiIlieu, the President of the Victorian Liberal Party, was involved with the firm Baillieu Knight Frank. I have been told that that is not correct; I apologise. Last Thursday I spoke at a forum on emergency relief in Frankston and said that the state government, the Liberal Jeffrey Kennett government, was causing a huge increase in requests for emergency help. It has been claimed that Frankston has had an increase of over 90 per cent in people seeking emergency help. To reinforce my view, the Sunday Sun said: The number of people seeking emergency help to pay electricity bills has tripled in the 12 months January, according to a welfare survey. This survey was taken by VCOSS. This is under the Victorian state government-Jeffrey Kennett's government. The article goes on: Latest industry figures show the actual non-payment disconnections doubled in the 12 month period to September last year, rising from 13,000 to 28,000. This has happened because of Jeffrey Kennett. During the two-week period of the VCOSS survey, welfare agencies gave $118,000 to 3,300 metropolitan applications for all types of emergency relief. Thirty per cent of all that emergency relief was given to people to pay their electricity bills. This is what Jeffrey Kennett is doing in Victoria. All Liberal Victorian members should be outraged at what is going on. (Time expired) Environment",41
37,Mr KNOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was fortunate enough on the Sunday before last to be present at the launch of Living on the Coast, the government's response to the numerous reports on coastal policy, in my seat of Gilmore by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) in the presence of Pam Allan, the new Minister for the Environment in New South Wales. It was a great day for those people who were at that opening, many of whom have spent the last 20 or 30 years fighting for initiatives of this type. One of the major parts of that policy is the funding for community groups. Those people who have actually got their hands dirty in the environment and who have been involved in keeping our environment going know that it is the community groups that actually push . and make the inroads into improving the environment. The second part of the policy was to make sure that planners at local government level are given the ability and training necessary to understand the environment so that the community groups are coordinated and the decisions made in a good way. Living on the Coast is a policy which will coordinate the federal, state and local government approaches to our coastal management. May I say that it is not before time. This is a great initiative taken by the government into terms of our environmental record. It will move towards returning our coast to the format we would like to see-a healthy environmental state which the people of Australia can enjoy, with a continuation of biodiversity so that the industries of tourism, fishing, et cetera which rely on our coasts will continue.

38,Mr W AKELIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I was indeed interested to hear the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) say that we had a new government with new ideas. Certainly there are some new ideas: we have the rich getting richer, higher unemployment, higher interest rates and a whole range of activity which the Labor government should be ashamed of. We have higher excise in regional areas. We have crocodile tears about regional people. Never have the regional people of Australia been more neglected. Never before have we been more highly taxed and had such a lack of spending on infrastructure in this country. Certainly we have a new government. We have a new government with new ideas which is only plundering the investments of the past and is ignoring the current account deficit and the absolute nonsense of the policies of the last decade. What we need is a new government with a new direction which has as a high priority full employment. This government has abandoned full employment. That is the new idea. We have to now accept under this government high unemployment. We have a lack of direction and a lack of light on the hill. We even have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who is proud to have quadrupled his investment in a piggery in a very short period and a Prime Minister who is proud to be a millionaire.

So far I have heard in the chamber today the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) invite the federal government to intrude on state issues by trying to control price of petrol. We have heard the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) suggesting that the federal government should intrude on state issues and control land management and usage. I find that quite interesting. Red herrings-they are all over the place. They are like the pilchards that are drowning in our coastal waters. I had the pleasure a week ago of attending a meeting of small business people in Newcastle along with the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht). It was interesting that this meeting was whipped into a frenzy by a couple of opposition speakers: Senator John Tierney, who represents New South Wales, and the shadow minister for small business, the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), from Western Australia. It was interesting that the only things they spoke about were again state issues-such things as pricing control and hours of trading. Of course, the member for Pearce wanted to keep right away from that because we aU know that Western Australia is debating that very issue at present. (Time expired) Transport",42
40,Mr HAWKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I have been totally misrepresented by the member for Paterson (Mr Home). If he looked at the facts about fuel pricing, he would find it is the federal government that has put up the price of fuel, it is the federal government that has put up tax on fuel and it is the federal government that is continuing to put up tax on fuel. The honourable member may talk about the price of petrol, but clearly it is under the control of the federal government. As I said earlier today, it is not only that we have gone from a situation in 1983 where over 60 per cent of fuel tax went back on roads to a situation today where the Commonwealth is spending on roads less than 10 per cent of the amount of fuel tax that is being taken. At the same time the federal government has increased that tax to $10 billion a year. If the honourable member wants to know who is affecting the price of fuel the most in the country right now, it is the the Commonwealth government with its continual increase in fuel excise.

48,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government made very clear in the budget that the growth in the current account deficit was unacceptable to the country and to the government and that we needed to see the budget come back into surplus to contribute to public savings and also to indicate that the government had a plan to add to long-term savings in superannuation by every person in the Australian work force contributing at least 15 per cent of his or her income. Mr Speaker, by now you may well know that the Treasury is estimating that by 2020 there will be a four per cent addition to GDP from savings in superMr Costello-By 2020-ha, hal Are you going to run it out until then?",43
49,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The deputy leader has asked his question.,43
50,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"By the year 2000 it estimates that there will be a two per cent addition to GDP from savings. That is around $10 billion, which would make a substantial contribution to the general savings task, bearing in mind that the budget itself is coming back into a strong surplus from a deficit of around $12 billion-in the next couple of years we will come back into a surplus of around $7 billion. As a consequence, there is another three or four per cent of GDP there. I have made clear in addresses around the country that, at least if we look at the budget, there are a good, solid two to three percentage points of savings there and two percentage points come from superannuation. That is way beyond the capacity of anything those opposite could do on the other side of the House. They have no policy on superannuation. In his budget reply, the Leader of the Opposition said: I can say to those same people that on a change of government any existing retirement benefits will be preserveda In other words, they will not rise as part of a 15 per cent schemeWe will introduce, as promised during the last election campaign, a retirement savings account ... In other words, it would be back to tax incentives which he had when he was Treasurer and which, of course, never worked. Can I also say that in today's current account it appears the deficit is flattening out in a trend sense. It is likely that the deficit for the current year will be a little lower than the Treasury's prediction in the budget. I remind the House that in the year 2002 there will be a 23.8 per cent increase in capital goods. Mr Halverson-Come on, Paul, can it! Nobody is listening.",43

Mr Costello-What was it when you started?",44

54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will not interject!,44
55,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Treasurer states: Australian investment abroad increased from around 10 per cent of GDP in the early 1980s to peak at 31 per cent of GDP in September 1993. While this Â° increase in overseas investment has been a welcome development reflecting the increasing internaadvise tionalisation of the Australian economy, buted to higher levels of foreign debt as overseas borrowings were used to fund Australian equity investment abroad. I remind the House of the juxtaposition of those numbers-that is, our net foreign debt is 37 per cent of GDP and Australian investment abroad is 31 per cent of GDP. It was next to nothing in the early 1980s. In any analysis of our current account and debt position, Mr Speaker, you never hear about Australian assets abroad or the fact that, as a consequence of putting those assets abroad, our debt has risen. Perhaps a more compelling point is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about savings while he denies using any of the instruments of fiscal policy. In an article in the Age by Mr Colebatch there is a reference to George Bush's policy of no new taxes. The article states: Guess what? Peter Costello, the shadow Treasurer, has unveiled the coalition's platform-no tax rises. It goes on to say: But the second, the no tax rise pledge, cannot be reconciledthis is the punch line-,with Mr Costello's commitments also to produce a long-term budgetary surplus at the same time as delivering tax cuts to three huge groups-savers, families and self-funded retirees. In other words, those opposite are talking about the current account and savings while saying that they will not resort to any change in receipts, they will have long-term budgetary surpluses and they will deliver tax cuts to three groups-savers, families and self-funded retirees. As Mr Colebatch politely put it, this failure to reconcile is the key point about the opposition. There is no reconciliation between reality and the opposition's phobias. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may well ask me what the answer is in relation to the current account deficit and the national debt, but one thing is for sure and that is that, whatever the answer is, he has not got a clue.

It sets out simply but directly a forward looking agenda for future cooperation beimportance tween us. Perhaps ,it is just worth the House noting some of the main points in the declarasuch adeclaration: tion. . . Amongst other things, it makes these points: Fifty years on from the end of the war, Australia interjections and Japan have a relationship of unprecedented qUality, Talking about the two governments, it on to say: They pledge to build on that foundation an endurmay ing and steadfast partnership!in enduring and steadfast partnership. It on to say that the government of Japan: welcomes Australia's decision to create its future in the region and reaffirms that Australia is an indispensable partner in regional affairs. These are all very important sentiments, coun- coming from the largest economy in the Asia Pacific and our largest trading partner.",45

62,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For it to be saying that Australia is indispensable to it in regional . affairs, for it to be saying that the foundations of our friendship and trade are enduring and and that our relationship is of unprecedented quality, is an important contemporary reflection of the relationship and the this quality and interdependence of it. I should have thought, despite the interjections from those opposite, that the members of the opposition should know that Australia not part of any trading bloc, that it does not I belong to al)y of the United States or of Europe or of North America; it is not part of contin-ntal Asia. It is by itself and will always have to use its ingenuity and vigour to make relationships and build partnerships. To to have the government of the larg-st economy in North Asia and our largest trading partner say of us that we have such an enduring and steadfast partnership, that we are an indispensable partner of its in world regional affairs, is an important declaration by the government of Japan of the importance of this country to it. If the opposition does not understand the of that, if it cannot see the strategic, economic and cultural significance of . . Mr Andrews-Why are you saying this? .",45

64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for goes Mayo might not respond; just relax.,45
65,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian people well reflect on this little episode and just say that this is the difference between the goes government of Australia, the Labor government, building relationships of quality that can .be referred to by another important government in these terms, and an opposition which is in fact, firstly, not wanting to have the matter discussed and, secondly, jeering at the' outcome. I suppose there is always, every now and again, a little marker which marks. out where the ground is in Australian public life. If there cannot be a marker on the importance of Japan to Australia and the fact that Australia is an island continent that trades into the Asia PacifIc and is not a natural part of any trading bloc and is not looked after, as are countries in Europe or North America by the size and nature of their markets, I would have thought that the opposition would at least have the common sense to know that something important here is being said in this declaration. Even if the opposition 'does not know Or does not agree, let me underline to the Australian people how important it has been and is to Australia to build this relationship. The declaration also went on to say how both of our governments reaffirm their strong support for the United States presence anq strategic engagement in the Asia Pacific as being of fundamental importance to the peace and prosperity of the region. We do underline it and it is significant, important and fundamental to the peace and prosperity of the region. I think even members opposite would understand that without the strategic protection which the United States provides to Japan the strategic environment in North Asia would be nothing like as peaceful, passive or certain as it is today. Were that to change, the whole nature of the East Asian region would change; hence, the importance for Japan of resolving these trade differences with the United States so that in the eyes of the American people the standing of Japan does not diminish or suffer. I took the opportunity to make the point that it is not a matter of winning some victory over motor cars. The real issue is how the US-Japan Japanese trade surplus is treated and how the view of the American public of the Japanese people, nation and economy is such as to maintain that strategic outlook and that - trategic presence. In a relatively short visit, I was very pleased with the outcome, pleased with the <;onversations with the Prime Minister ,anq senior ministers and members of the business community and bureaucracy, and more than pleased-delighted-by the sentiments of thjs joint declaration on' the ,Australia-Japan partnership. I would have thought, as, a contemporary reflection of that relationship, all meinbers of the House should similarly approve of its sentiments. Economy",45
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I say with your indulgence that the opposition shares to the full the Prime Minister's belief that the economic and political relationship with Japan is of prime importance to both the present and the future of this country. I take the opportunity, of course, of reminding the House that the building block of that relationship in 1957 was put down by a coalitiongovernment--'and opposed, by the Labor Party.",46
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The indulgence has expired. The Leader of the Opposition should move to his question.,46
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister: has the government heeded the warning of the chief executive of the ANZ Bank, Don Mercer, that, unless there is an improvement in the current account, Australia' could 'be headed for another recession? Does the government agree with Mr Mercer that all the warning signs are in place for a loss of foreign investor confidence in Australia which could affect the dollar and trigger yet another one of the Keating recessions? MrKEATING-I was at pains a moment ago to make the point that, in terms of the change in the underlying savings equation in Australia, in terms of the budget balance coming back into surplus-heavily. into surplus in the next few years-and in terms of the long run change to superannuation, and given that the Treasury said in its statement No.2 text that the current account deficit had our debt stable at around 2Y2 per cent of GDP but' at around an average of 4Yz per cent it needed to be attended to in terms. of savings, one understands that the size of the problem is roughly at around two per cent of GDP, or $10 billion intoday's dollars. 1 said a few moments ago that on' superannuation alone the government's changes are worth about two per cent of GDP by the year 2000 and four per cent by the year 2020. But by the budget coming from a deficit of $12odd billion back into surplus, rising to a surplus of $7 billion in the next couple of years, there is a very important change of somewhere between two per cent and four per cent of GDP from the:budget-depending on whether one wants to dis aggregate the cyclical and structural coinponents of it. So there is two per cent to four per cent in the budget and two per cent on superannuationsomewhere between four per cent and six per cent to deal with a two percentage point problem. I would have thought that Mr Mercer would understand that arithmetic and at least would have read statement No.2 to understand what is being done. I thought his remarks perhaps were given away by this reported remark: ,The Government relied too much on compulsory superannuation to boost the nation's debt deficient s.avings record-which underpins the current account deficit-and should be doing more to e-c<:>urage voluntary savings, he said. That, is, for banks. It is a bit of a special pleading there against the superannuation industry for the banking industry. Those opposite, like Alice in Wonderland, seem to believe that, when bank executives come out and bag superannuation, it is all in the national good. But it is all for banks. Don't you understand? There is a little bit of cynicism around. Mr Costello-And it is all around you, pal.",46
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,47
70,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have often said to you over there, I like you enjoying yourselves in opposition. Part of the psychology of staying over here is to keep you happy over there. If you are a happy little bunch of vegemites, I can assure you that I am very happy. Mr Mercer went on: ""We should also be doing more in my view on the public sector savings issue and, you know, just raising taxes a bit is pretty ordinary,"" . . . I make the point that, yes, the savings imbalance in the current account is of fundamental importance, and that is why the government has sought to address it. I would have thought that the ANZ bank would have thought that a large change involving every member of the work force putting away 15 per cent as savings was something that was notable and worth supp()rting, rather than arguing about what the intermediation of the household dollar is; whether it goes to banks or to superannuation accounts. I would have thought that the chief executive of the' ANZ bank would have been bigger than that to have got across that point, but apparently not. I make the general point that the government has a two to six percentage point change in for a two percentage point problem. I think that is the core of the matter. NA",47
71,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Select Committee of the New Zealand House of Representatives.

NA Health Agenda",47
72,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"---,-My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services and Health; Has the minister seen reported comments by the new President of the Australian Medical 'Association on the' government's health agenda? What is the minister's response to those comments?",47
73,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would like to take the opportimity to congratulate Dr Weedon on his ascension to president of the AMA. I look forward to working with him in his capacity as heading up that body which basically looks after its members' conditions and payments. Mr Bilney-Which party does he support?,47
74,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Dr Weedon, at least, appears to be impartial, unlike his predecessor. I certainly look forward to working with him on that basis. He also appears to be somewhat more modest and self-deprecating than his predecessor. So he should be easier to work with on that front as well. He asked that the government outline its health agenda. We are clearly doing that, and we will continue to do so. We want to show a very strong commitment to universal health care. As we have shown in the budget, we also have major funding initiatives at a diffimore cult time for a major spending portfolio. In Aboriginal health there is an additional $103 million, which I think has been welcomed by the opposition, and certainly by the AMA. In preventive health measures there is an additional $85 million. A lot of that is going to anti-smoking initiatives and to the immunisation program. Again, I imagine that is welcomed by the opposition spokesperson. In the research area there is an additional $58 million,and in mental health some $13 million in particular initiatives for youth suicide. I will continue to outline to Dr Weedon and to the rest of the community our budget and other initiatives, including reforms to pharmacy and pathology, which will produce major savings to the Australian taxpayers without impeding any of those services. I must say that is in stark contrast to the lack of an agenda from the opposition. We still do not have a policy on health from the opposition. There have been various attempts to do it, but they have not succeeded. The opposition leader says that is because the policy is a secret since otherwise we would pinch it. I want to put paid to that. I have heard some signs of what the opposition is proposing, and r can assure it and the Australian people that we would not want to pinch it.",47
75,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Tell us about your policy on Western women. .Mr SPEAKER-Order! The member for O'Connor! Relax!,48
76,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no chance of our stealing what we understand to be the elements of the opposition's policy. For instance, the Leader of the Opposition has said that he wants to strip billions of dollars from public hospitals to give tax rebates to the better off members of the community. We will not be pinching that policy, I can assure you of that-and Australians do not like it either. . Dr Brendan Nelson, who is now a candidate for the Liberal Party-and I think a would be spokesperson on health-wants to scrap bulkbilling. The opposition got burnt with that last time. We will not be pinching that policy either. He wants to slug Australian families for every visit to the doctor. We will not be pinching that policy, I can assure you of that. Your opposition spokesperson on health wants to go back to ninth century Arabia, it would seem. He says that that was the best health system ever devised. In case members are not certain about this, I would like to quote him directly. On 6PR on 22 May, the opposition spokesperson said: In the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries AD, soine of the Arab Sheikhs and rulers had what I think is the best health system ever devised. They paid their doctors when they were well and when they got sick the doctors stopped getting paid because they were obviously not doing their job. He perhaps failed to mention that they probably not only were not paid but also lost their heads. I am not sure the AMA would endorse that policy either. I would like to quote him again to very clearly indicate the opposition's stand on this issue.",48

The Americans have a term in politics they call 'the third rail issue'. You have the train tracks Of two rails and a rail down the middle that carries the electricity. You touch that and you're dead. Maybe health has been a third rail issue. It is the sort of issue, he said, 'that has the potential to take Liberal Party voters away from the Liberal Party'. Touch Medicare, and you are dead. Budget 1995-96: Housing",48
80,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it not a fact that the 12 per cent sales tax on hardware and building materials will raise $523 million in revenue rather than the budget forecast of $215 million? Is it not a fact that the average cost of a new home will rise by $1,000 as a result of this tax rather than the $400 as claimed by the government? Is it not a fact that the government has increased the average mortgage repayments over the course of a 25year loan by $6,000?",48
81,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Poor old Daisy, does he remember that he wanted to put a 15 per cent tax on everything in a home-on bricks, concrete, 'roofing tiles, piping, the swimming pool, the front drive, the works?

All the imputations of the question are wrong. Mr Tim Fischer-Wrong?",49
82,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are wrong anyway. Wrong! Of course, you will have Mr Silberberg running around trying to blackguard the Treasury's estimates on the collection. You were doing the same a year ago with the investment, growth and employment figures. You were wrong on all three counts. So now you are running around trying to say that their estimates are wrong. The government stands by the Treasury's estimates. In broadening the base of the wholesale sales tax the government is reducing existing disparities, providing consistent treatment of goods used in the finishing of houses, basically hardware, and reducing some existing disparities in the wholesale sales tax treatment of certain goods. So, if the only argument here is basically the revenue assumptions, then I rely upon the Treasury and the tax office's basis for those collations, as we have in the past, and on these revenue estimates. They have with these new measures been able to pass as, by and large, accurate. . Pensions",49
83,Mr NEWELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Would the minister advise the House of the reactions to the budget announcement of the extended deeming arrangements on pensioners' financial investments? Have there been any criticisms of substance that the government intends to act upon?,49
84,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I had the pleasure last week of visiting a number of retiree and pensioner organisations throughout the different parts of his electorate to explain these changes. The opposition will no doubt be very pleased to hear that the package of pension reforms announced in this year's budget has been received extremely warmly by pensioner and retiree organisations, by the financial planning industry and by writers who write on investment and retirement incomes. To give a few examples, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation in its press release on 9 May, headed 'Breath of Fresh Air', said: The new deeming system for pensioners' investments will significantly reduce the complexity and uncertainty experienced by older Australians. The changes will be a breath of fresh air in the pension system. The new two-level deeming system will allow older people to invest with much greater flexibility and choice and puts incentive back into the system. National Seniors was quoted in the Advertiser on 10 May: The deeming of investments was a great move, as was the Department of Social Security's new programs aimed at helping pensioners plan for the future. Mr David Dean, chief executive of National Seniors, said in a press release on 11 May: The best news in the federal budget for Australia's retirees is the proposed change to the legislation which deems unrealised capital gains on unlisted shares and securities. The financial planning sector has been no less positive in its response. The professional organisation that represents 5,500 financial planners and advises pensioners and others on investment and other decisions issued a press release headed 'Pension changes praised': The Financial Planning Association welcomes and strongly endorses the substantial reforms to the social security system brought down in this year's budget. 'These reforms mark the biggest shake-up to the pensions income test in the last decade' said Mr Jock Rankin, chief executive of the Financial Planners Association. 'It may well be the most significant set of changes to retirement incomes policies since the introduction of the assets test in 1983. The new system is far-sighted, simpler, fairer and will encourage pensioners to make sensible investment decisions. It is a win-win situation.' That is the general tenor. 1 spoke to Mr Rankin about a week ago and he told me that he had had a number of discussions with members of his association and that there was overwhelming support for the changes that we are introducing. Other writers and commentators on investment and retirement incomes spoke in a similar vain. Mr Daryl Dixon is well-known and has quite often been highly critical of this government. In his column 'Asset Check' in the Canberra Times he says: The government is to be commended for this radical change to the deeming rules. It will life for pensioners and most importantly it will encourage all pensioners to seek to earn the maximum amount possible from their investments. Mr Harold Bodinar of Bodinar's Personal Financial Planners in Mr David Koch's and Ian Hamilton's column in the Herald-Sun said: The government has come up with a terrific system.",49
85,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,50
86,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition is getting a bit restive here, Mr Speaker. I apologise for the repetitious nature of what I have to say but unfortunately I have not been able to find any significant or serious criticisms of the proposals that we have come up with, so I am just going to have to go on being repetitious and boring. I apologise for that.",50
87,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do not go too far and offend the standing orders.,50
88,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will give just one more. I have a whole page of them here. Mr Noel Whittaker, in personal investment in the Western Australian Sunday Times, described it as: . . . a reasonable and consistent approach to the treatment of income for aged pensioners. This is the tenor of the government's pension reform package. It is a major structural change. It reduces the complex system of the assessment of financial assets of various kinds-shares, managed investments, debentures, friendly society bonds et ceteracurrently covered by a complex plethora of rules which, in many cases, treat people differently depending on where they bought their investment. That is replaced by a simple, straightforward system, the central features of which can be described in half a page. That is a vast improvement and simplification that has been broadly welcomed, including by the electorate of Richmond, where, as I said, I had the pleasure of addressing retirement groups. They were overwhelmingly positive in their response to the changes we have made. Waterfront",50
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How can you justify simplify your government's opposition to non-union competition on the waterfront in Fremantle that would deliver a 20 per cent reduction in costs to the users-benefits that confirm the value of the Hilmer competition principles you have espoused? Will you condemn the strike action by the MUA, which is designed solely to maintain a union monopoly and frustrate the Hilmer process?",50

98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The last part will do. We heard the first part.,50
99,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will ask it again. I ask the Prime Minister: how can you justify your government's opposition to non-union competition on the waterfront in Fremantle that would deliver a 20 per cent reduction in costs to the users-benefits that confirm the value of the Hilmer competition principles you have espoused? Will you condemn the strike action by the MUA, which is designed solely to maintain a union monopoly and frustrate the Hilmer process?",50
100,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought that, whenever you see national arrangements in Australia-whether it be under native title legislation, whether it be extending Hilmer competition principles or whether it be building on the labour relations and the now high productivity and low inflation culture we now have in this country-you will see no assistance from the Western Australian government. None whatsoever. It is completely at odds with the general national tenor of economic development and economic policy, just as it is at odds on this occasion with, as the Minister for Finance said, a government lockout of employees on the waterfront in Western Australia. The other thing is that the contract was awarded to this contractor apparently on a home town basis and on the basis that he would follow the practice that he had demonstrated and made a name for himself in-that is, in trying to lock away union participation in these activities. He was chosen on that basis accordingly. This is not about building on the huge lift in waterfront productivity which has taken place in the last four or five years. We have had, from memory, a 50 per cent improvement in waterfront productivity. We have the same turnaround times as they have in the major European ports.",51
101,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It makes housing cheaper. It is twice as,51
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor has been warned. I am not going to do it again.,51
103,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a consequence of that, we have also seen quite dramatic changes in the whole maritime industry, not just in stevedoring. Instead of building on that, continuing to change that and taking the responsibility which the union has taken over the years by seeing its membership fall by . less than half, what we have is a cowboy effort by a cowboy government to lockout employees and upset the industrial harmony. The question from the Leader of the Opposition implies: what is wrong with that? These are the sorts of industrial relations policies he would be following-general piece, low levels of industrial activity, two to three percentage points of inflation, after he left the nation at 11. This sort of change-a high productivity culture, a reduction in disputation of two-thirds over the period when he was last in office-he would return Australia to for the sorts of industrial relations policies he supports in the imputation of this question. . Let the employers of this country understand that under a coalition government this is what they would see every day of the week. This is the sort of industrial disharmony they would see night and day across the industrial face of this country. As if the profit share and the economy, now knowing no historic precedent, are not high enough, as if they want the wage share to go lower so that the profit share may go higher beyond any historic precedent-as if that is not enoughone of the two or three things the Leader of the Opposition has championed in his whole political life is to hop into the wages of the low paid, hop into the wages of people under about $30,000 a year. What a noble political objective that is-to say, 'There I was. I was in parliament for 25 years and I made sure I gave them an upper cut every chance I had, a body blow to the ordinary working people of this country.' As a person who came from a small business environment, I cannot understand why the Leader of the Opposition hates working people the way he does. I cannot understand why he holds them in such contempt, why he wants to basically cut their wages and cut their benefits, while at the same time he walks around talking piously and hypocritically about families when he is actually about ripping into them every chance he gets. Mr Ronaldson-Is this the best you can do? You're a fraud.",51

105,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is quite an important little question because, while he has no policies or will not say what they are, what he does say is tell us what his prejudices are. His prejudicial position is that he would like to support people who do not support unionists and do not support the lower paid and working people. That is about all we can get from him. He will go where the Western Australia government is going. As the Western Australia Premier pursues these policies, he continues to fall further and further in the polls. Just remember that we on this side of the House know that there is a great big political groper inside the Liberal Party about to snap shut on him, as his polling data reveals where he is. I notice Mr Rocher, Mr Filing and a few others ready to spring a trap whenever the opportunity presents itself. Unemployment: Working Nation Mr LEO MCLEA Y-My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister advise the House about the progress of reducing unemployment and the implementation of the Working Nation program? Can he advise the House whether other industrialised countries have taken a similar approach to solving the world-wide long-term unemployment problem?",52
106,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you will know that, with the economy growing around five per cent, with low inflation, we have had the largest fall in unemployment since we have been keeping the records. We have had the largest fall in 12 months on record and we have had the creation of 4Y2 per cent of employment growth over the last year. Not only that, we have decided in Working Nation, the government's quite ambitious policy statement of last year, to also support the long-term unemployed to get them back into the work force. I was quite interested to find reported in today's Sydney Morning Herald comments by Robert Reich, the US Secretary of Labour, on the same subject. He recently said: We in the United States are proud of our record of creating jobs, but not of the continuing decline in median wages. While we now lead advanced nations in growth and productivity gains, and have lowered inflation, the average hourly compensation of American workers trails 10 foreign economies . . . this average masks a more disturbing reality. While inequality is growing in every advanced economy, the distribution of income and wealth in the United States has become the most unequal of all ... Last year, with the recovery in full bloom, productivity surpassing 2 per cent, corporate profits up 12 per cent, and economic growth exceeding 4 per cent, the median wages and benefits of Americans continued to decline. The article continued: ... the European ministers complained of very low employment growth, high rates of unemployment and high levels of long-term unemployment. They worried about the ""exclusion"" of the jobless. But for Mr Reich the job choice between America's low unemployment with falling real wages and Europe's high real wages with high unemployment was, as Reich called it, a 'diabolical trade-off'. Mr Reich said: Either condition-persistent joblessness or low and declining incomes-threatens the social fabric of our nations. Either spawns disillusionment and cynicism among those economic losers, creating fertile ground for demagogues . . . MrReith-Is this as good as it gets?",52

At all times I have acted in this matter in gQQd faith and strictly in accQrdance with legal advice. The .background to' this matter is that I cQmmissiQned an independent Australian law professQr, PrQfessQr Cheryl Saunders AO, to' cQndlJct an independent inquiry and preP3:re a report for me in accordance with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. Professor Saunders conducted that investigation. She heard and weighed up a wide range of views. In fact, she received some 400 separate representations. Her report is publicly available, and its conclusions about the significance of the Hindmarsh Island area to the Aboriginal women concerned are clear. > , I want to take members of the House briefly to the central finding of her' report. I want members of the House to put themselves. in the position that I as the federal minister was in when I received this report. I particularly direct my .comments to members of this House who are believers, who professwhether it be some Christian or some other faith-and I ask them what they would have done if they received this report. The report from Professor Saunders stated: 'rhe Hindmarsh and Mundoo Islands and the waters surrounding them have a supreme spiritual and cultural significance for the Ngarrindjeri people within the knowledge ofNgarrindjeri women which concemsthe life force itself. That is what I as the responsible minister was told after having done everything I was required to do under federal legislation to commission' that independent report. I rebut the myth that somehow or other my decision was based on secret information- I can categorically assure this House that that was never the case. In fact, my decision was based on the publicly available report of Professor Saunders and the representations that were made. It is true that there have been accusations in the media and now by the shadow minister in the parliament attempting to attack my bona fides and attempting to dispute the basis of the decision. Let me refer members of the House to what His Honour Mr Justice O'Loughlin said in a court case tp,at found ultimately against me on a procedural ground. Let me tell the House what His Honour Mr JustiCe O'Loughlin said when there was .aÂ· suggestion that I had preJudged' the matter in. the way in which the member for Hindmarsh suggests. His Honour said: On the contrary, it seems' to me that the Chapmans's .reaction---' . that is, the litigantto the minister's conduct in respect of these matters is some indication of how the Chapmans have prejudged the minister. It is a small example of how they have been prepared to place a sinister interpretation on what was a simple and' practical expedient. I remind the House that nowhere in that judgment has there been any criticism of my , ' ethics, my integrity and the principles which I adopted in granting that declaration. I conclude by saying my actions in this matter have been supported by both houses of the federal parliament and will cOIltiIme to be so. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Before the minister concludes, could you direct him to answer the questionwhether it is true that he cannot locate a critical document?",54
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is. no .point of order. The minister was responding toMr Costello-But, Mr SPEAKER ",55
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Resume your seat. The minister was responding to the question. Better Cities Program Mrs SIr:.VIA SMITH-My question is direCted to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Can the minister advise the House of the government's' increased commitment to the better cities program outlined in the recent budget? Also, has the minister seen comments reported from Launceston last weekconceming the better cities program? What is the minister's response to those comments?",55
142,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bass for her question. In the recent budget there was a further commitment to the better cities program of the order of $247 million. It was indicated that the priori 7 ties. in relation toÂ· the further development of the better cities program would relate to, firstly, infrastructure, particularly access to ports, rail and so on; secondly, the issue of growth areas and the pressures that various growth areas in terms of Australian cities are facing; and, thirdly, the question of urban renewal and revitalisation. As Australian cities get older, there is more room to look at the potential for revitalisation. The Leader of the Opposition made a visit to Launceston last week. As the honourable member for Bass would point out,he was met with a considerable degree of enthusiasm about the better cities project in that city. It is a very important redevelopment of the Inveresk railway yards. It represents a revival of a central area of Launceston which is important to the city and which is located close to the river. It draws attention to one of the real positives in the city of Launceston .. The Leader of the Opposition made it clear that he would support better cities projects 'where they were worthwhile'. What that indicates on the part of the Leader of the Opposition is, if you like, aÂ·case by case approach to policy. Effectively, the Leader of the Opposition is going to wander, around Australia and when he sees something that is politically opportunistic for him to support, he is going to put his hand up and say, 'That's worthwhile.' If on the grounds of political opportunism he decides otherwise, he is going to say, 'No, we won't support that.' It would all be done simply on a case by case basis. It is also true that the honourable member for Maranoa inade it very clear-'-I thought officially on behalf of the opposition-that he did not support the continuation of the better cities program. Those who have an interest in the program and the' particular locations it supports should take the views of the member for Marano aÂ·. He believes that the fact that !Jetter cities mark I supported projects in cities like Bunbury, Launceston, Mackay, Townsville or Newcastle-cities that are certainly not within the metropolitan area-was representativeof some kind of urban bias. The point I am seeking to make is thai if you are expecting ail ounce of policy from this opposition, forget it; if you are expecting the opposition to proceed in terms of any principle, forget it; and if you are expecting the opposition to take account of any real analysis of what is going on in this community, forget it. . Mr Bruce Scott-Give him a glass of water. Cool him down!",55
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Maranoa!,56
144,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This opposition is not about developing policy, thinking through issues in terms of their implications for Australia or getting into any serious political debate. The opposition is essentially about a kind of orchestrated opponunism",56

146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,56
147,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members of the opposition might see the program and the issues that I am addressing as being of some amusement. But 27 areas around Australia are being developed under the better cities program. There was an initial investment of $800 million, but the total investment is now well over $2.6 billion. It is investment that is growing in terms of many of those areas' strategies. It is helping to address issues that the Australian people see as of extraordinary importance. .The Leader of the Opposition can laugh as much as he likes, but I do not think the Australian people are going to vote for an opposition that, in the most urbanised country in the world,. reflects' no policy interest, has noÂ· perception about the problems facing Australian cities and has no capacity to say anything sensible about an issue that is extraordinarily important to people who live in the growth areas, who live in the areas that require urban renewal and who recognise that if Australia is to be able to compete with the ASIa-PaCific region it needs damn good infrastructure. The better cities program will play a role, together with the states and local governments, in providing that infrastructure in a timely and effective mann-r. . Hindmarsh Island Bridge",56
148,Mrs GALLUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'-My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Tories Strait Islander Affairs. In my previous question I asked you to address 'serious matters relating to the administration of your department which you deliberately avoided. I ask you again: .did membersÂ·of your staff cut the tops off important faxes in order toÂ· destroy documentary evidence of the timing of the decision making process in the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair? Is it true that neither you, your office nor ATSIC is able to locate a critical document which would establish the timing of your decision to ban the development? Did you make the decision to ban the development before or after reviewing all available evidence-yes or no?",56
149,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In case the last very clear, precise and subdued answer was not adequate for the member for Hindmarsh, let me say that the allegation about doctoring documents and the other allegations of impropriety trotted out by some of the litigants in the court case, probably with the support of the member for Barker, the Leader of the Opposition and you, have been rejected by the Federal Court of Australia as being without foundation. Opposition members-Withdraw.",57
150,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,57
151,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you read the judgment of Mr Justice O'Loughlin you will see that that is the case. It is important that I put the comments of the member for Hindmarsh in context because this is, as I said on 23 May, part of an orchestrated campaign by the member for Barker and her-which is supported by the Leader of the Opposition-to undermine the spiritual beliefs of the Aboriginal women who have been at the centre of this attempt to protect their Aboriginal heritage. I said that on 23 May and out it came the next day in an article entitled 'Lib at the heart of women's business furore'. The article went on to talk about a member of the member for Deakin's staff who said that her skills had been useful 'in putting it all together'. went on to tell us a lot more about the fellow travellers of the Liberal Party. Mr Costello-- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. You would be aware that the minister has been asked a factual question which concerns matters which are the subject of intense litigation. He is studiously avoiding dealing with the subject matter. It is a very simple question-it is whether or not he can locate a critical document. I ask you to direct that he be relevant to that question.",57
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister has been asked a question and I am listening to the answer. To date he has been relevant. I call the minister.,57
153,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not just a member of the member for Deakin's staff who has been involved in this. The allegations and the smears that the member for Hindmarsh trots out have also been actively supported by someone who describes himself as an Aboriginal activist. Mr Allan Campbell was reported in the Australian of the same day as saying that he had 'helped convince the dissidents to come forward.' Who is this Mr Allan Campbell who is the fellow traveller of the Leader of the Opposition? .,57
154,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

The Hansard will also reveal the activities of the Liberal Party and, indeed, Mr Campbell, its fellow traveller, in undermining the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal women. Racial Hatred Legislation",58
165,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Is the Attorney General aware of reports that the government's Racial Hatred Bill will result in an onerous suppression of freedom of speech? Can he inform the House if this is the case?,58
166,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Since the government's introduction of its Racial Hatred Bill towards the end of last year, we have seen in the community, and certainly through the various columns of Australian newspapers, an active debate about the wisdom or otherwise of proceeding down the path of racial hatred legislation and the issues which flow from that. On the whole, that debate has been reasoned and well argued. There are, of course, differing views on whether this is the appropriate mechanism in order to attack the very serious problem of racial hatred and the violence which often flows from it. However, the most recent contribution to this particular debate which has come from the opposition, particularly in the form of the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, certainly does not fall into that particular category. In a pamphlet, entitled The old digger on his soapbox, the shadow Attorney has put out a publication which, first of all, think, generally tries to stereotype views in our ex-service community, which certainly are not accurate in terms of beliefs on racism, intolerance and bigotry. But, putting that to one side, it misrepresents and distorts completely the substance of the government's bill and attempts, in the crudest of forms, to scaremonger in relation to this bill. This is the same shadow Attorney-General who has had carriage of the opposition's policy in this matter-and this is one of the few matters where the opposition actually does have a stated policy. It has actually produced a document. I know it is a bit rare and people are a bit shocked by this, but this is actually a field where the opposition has produced a policy and put it out into the public domain. The reaction to it explains why the opposition generally does not have policies. We see, for instance, in today's newspapers comments-not only about the opposition's policy but specifically about this shabby little leaflet put out by Senator Vanstone-such as 'Liberal paper angers ethnics', 'Howard attacked over race issues', 'Strife over racism pamphlet', 'Anger at Liberal pamphlet'. That sums it up. The opposition having been chided by Australian ethnic communities in relation to this particular pamphlet, do we see any backing down? Do we see any apology coming from Senator Vanstone or the Leader of the Opposition? No. Rather, we see Senator Vanstone on the 11 AM program on the 7 network this morning going on defending the pamphlet and saying: We believe, if you want to express those deep seated feelings, even if it is hatred, and you want to encourage others to agree with you, you should be allowed to. That is what Senator Vanstone said today. We have heard absolutely nothing from the Leader of the Opposition on this shabby little exercise. It is attributed to him in newspaper comments that he has not seen the leaflet but that he is sure Senator Vanstone would do the right thing. Well, Senator Vanstone has not done the right thing. The Leader of the Opposition should familiarise himself with this shabby little exercise and repudiate that particular publication and the sentiments I expressed by Senator Vanstone today. If he does not, he stands condemned with her. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",58
167,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask a further question of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I ask: did members of your staff cut the tops off faxes in order to destroy documentary evidence of the timing of the decision making process in the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair? Is it true that neither your office nor ATSIC is able to locate a critical document which would establish the timing of your decision to ban the development? Is it not also true that you made your decision prior to reviewing material which dispelled claims about secret Aboriginal women's business? Finally, to buttress his claims of complete credibility in this matter, will the minister produce documentary evidence to show on what day he made the decision to ban the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge?",58
168,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I must say that, given that the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the member for Hindmarsh were effectively accessories after the fact in respect of the theft of my mail, I do find this question rather galling. I will be very precise. Firstly, I direct the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to my answer given in respect of the previous question asked of me. Secondly, I say to him in respect of a call for an inquiry into this matter: should the full Federal Court of Australia find against me in respect of some procedural matters, I will be required by law to commission a further inquiry. I undertake to the House that the person I choose to undertake that inquiry will be of the same eminence, independence and integrity as was Professor Saunders. Generic Substitution",59
169,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Is the minister aware of an article published today concerning the government's approach to generic substitution? What is the minister's response to that article?,59
170,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of that article and some criticism in it, including from the shadow minister in this area. I have to say that it is another case where the data does not support the claims. It certainly does not support the claims of the shadow minister. Mr Costello-The press gallery is going.",59
171,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,59
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left.,59
173,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It might as readily be concluded that behaviour of members opposite has had that effect. The legislative amendments were actually brought in in December last year, so we have had some few months for the legislation to be operative. In that relatively short time, generic substitution has in fact-I draw the shadow spokesperson's attention to this-increased by nearly eight per cent. That is a very significant saving for Australians. It is not a saving to government; it means simply that ordinary Australian families pay less. I would have hoped that the shadow minister would have been encouraging doctors and pharmacists to cooperate with this program. It is a very straightforward matter. It is a matter of rebutting some scare tactics that have been developed, particularly by some of the pharmaceutical companies. In order to ensure that the community generally is well informed about generic substitution, we are launching a communication strategy to build on that success, that eight per cent increase. The information will go to pharmacists, to doctors, and to consumers of large quantities of medication for various reasons. Money can be saved and should be saved. I would hope the opposition will support these measures which mean that, in this case, the consumers and others save the taxpayers considerable funds by very important services being delivered to the Australian community. I thank the member for her question. I would hope that those people who are fair minded will see that this will grow over time. It is basically for ordinary Australian families. It does not save the government any money; it does not save the doctors any money; it does not save the chemists any money; but it does save those ordinary Australians a lot. I hope we get the support of the opposition.",59

The first of these was when he alleged that I had complained about recruitment of ethnic communities into theÂ· Labor Party in my electorate and 'what,a terrible thing that was'. If Mr Anderson' had bothered to read my public statements, he would have known that I never made any such claims about ethnic branch stacking or ethnic communities. The second misrepresentation followed immediately when Mr Anderson implied that I myself had been involved in and supported ethnic branch stacking. He claimed that I had been silent when someone he described as one of my mates had used this tactic to undermine and unseat the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) but had then changed his mind and knocked off Mr Anderson instead in the state seat of Liverpool. I have never been involved in, nor condoned, the manipulation of ethnic communities in this way. I have never been involved in any Labor Party activities in the state seat of Liverpool-a bit like Mr Anderson, really. This is a gross misrepresentation and Mr Anderson should not use his radio program to reopen old ALP factional wars. NA",61

' Racial Vilification Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia respectively showeth that: ' We cherish our inalienable right to freedom, our inherited common law and our demOCracy as allowed by statute and common law. ' We believe the Racial Vilification Bill to be contrary and repugnant to that sound and entrenched spirit of public policy, regarding the freedom of speech. ' We believe this proposed Bill to be the culmjnation of thought alluding to overtones of Nazism, in the restrictions o- freed0n:t it implicates. With conviction, we firmly believe thatÂ· this type of legislation would be better left back in history, nani.ely pre 1944 Poland. We believe the Australian people having seen and read the history of the Holocaust and Nazism, would find th-s, Bill ,totally. repugnant ,to their rights, freedoms and liberties they have""as part of their democratic frl\Ilchise, inherited under British common'law and'the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution. . Your petitioners as in duty bound, therefore request that the House utterly reject this legislation in any of its forms. by Mr Bilney (from seven citizens) and Mr MCLachlan (15 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that AUStralia is now a signatory to more than 2100 international treaties, conventions and agreements, which, once ratified, bind Australia by international law to implement and to abide by them. While accepting that it is necessary for Australia to subscribe to many of these agreements if it is to participate freely and effectively as a member of the international community, we are concerned that such agreements are signed and ratified by the Executive Government without first being referred to the Australian Parliament for inquiry or debate. We are further concerned that there is no provision in the Australian Constitution for such a course of action to be followed by the Executive Government. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will: 1. request the Executive Government to immediately place a moratorium on the signing and ratification of any further international treaties, conventions and agreements unless they have been examined by Parliament; 2. request that the moratorium remain in place until such time as the people of Australia have been asked, by way of a referendum, whether they will support an amendment to the Constitution to' include a clause stating that all international treaties, conventions and' agreements . must be examined by the Parliament before they come into force in Australia. by Mr Cobb (from 29 citizens) and .

The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so small the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000. Wine Tax Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to object most strongly to this horrendous and tragic practice and ask that steps be taken to stop it immediately. by Mr Cameron (from 6,439 citizens). Mobile Telephone Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the huge service gap in a wide area of North West Victoria in respect to the provision of mobile telephone services. In an area which covers almost a quarter of the State of Victoria less than 15 per cent is serviced by mobile telephone. Quick communication is no longer seen as a lUXUry but a necessity both in the business and private world and the communities concerned would benefit both economically and socially through the availability of a mobile telephone system. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will take measures to ensure the Telecommunications (Standards of Service) Amendment Bill 1994 is passed by the Parliament thus ensuring that the standard telephone definition becomes more relevant to current consumer needs and more responsive to future technological developments and thereby embrace the provision of mobile telephone services to larger areas of rural Australia.

Accommodation Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain persons, being users of accommodation available for the travelling public, draws to the attention of the House that the government's proposal to introduce a tax on the accommodation industry, rumoured to be up to 15 per cent, is entirely unacceptable to us, the travelling public. The industry which we support with our patronage needs to be viable in order to compete with overseas markets, and the imposition of any further taxes on this industry would be devastating. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House rejects any proposal to impose a further tax on an industry already struggling to survive. by Mr Jull (from 673 citizens). Childbirth Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain residents of the State of Tasmania draws to the attention of the House that funding for the Alternative Birthing Services incorporating the Childbirth Information Services and the Homebirthing Pilot Study Program will cease as of the 17th December 1994.

The Service enables people to leam more about pregnancy, birth and parenting and plays a vital role in the community. It is critical that funding for the Service be continued. by Mr Kerr (from 11 citizens).

National Anthem To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament in Canberra: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the members of parliament to our National Anthem/Song. Unlike such countries as New Zealand and Great Britain there is no reference to God in the wording of the text; As such we have no opportunity to express our wish for God's blessing upon our country; and As the overwhelming majority of Australians believe in God we request that: The last line in each chorus of the National Anthem/Song be amended from 'Advance Australia Fair' to 'God Bless Australia Fair' . And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Melham (from 48 citizens).

Not undertake any further enquiries into the Forest Industries in Tasmania. Imigran by Mr Miles (from 47 citizens). Long-Term Unemployed To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: A petition organised by the Central Queensland Job Creation Association (Inc) draws the attention of the House to the unacceptable treatment of the long termed unemployed. Your petitioners therefore request the House to consider the millions of dollars being spent on importing forest products into this country. A tremendous amount of labour could be used in the state forests and all in the national interest, because forests improve soil fertility, water quality and the purity of our air. This available work would be a real boost to employment. We need to give our people an opportunity to earn a living and develop their potential, please change your attitude to those being displaced by mechanisation and technology. by Mr Neville (from 45 citizens). Medicare Office, Hamilton To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain electors of the Division Newcastle draws to the attention of the House the need for the establishment of a Medicare OfficelBranch in the suburb of Hamilton due to demographic nature of the residents-being young, old, informed and of ethnic origin.

Young Homeless Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: 1. We are concerned that teenagers are able to leave home by obtaining young homeless allowance without adequate investigation. 2. We believe that the flawed nature of the guidelines governing eligibility for young homeless allowance is in some circumstances encouraging family breakdown. 3. With the number of young people receiving youth homeless allowance increasing by a factor of ten over the past six years, we consider that there are insufficient programs to help keep families together. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should call on the Government to: (a) review the guidelines for young homeless allowance; and (b) show a greater commitment to programs which prevent family breakdown. by Mr Ruddock (from 1,508 citizens). Lake George To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth their support for upgrading of the Federal Highway around Lake George, New South Wales, but are completely opposed to a tollway as proposed by the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton on 19 April 1994. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should effect such actions as to prevent this tollway, which, unlike any other tollway in Australia, has no feasible alternative route and particularly punishes those people who must regularly use it. by Mr Sharp (from 1,865 citizens). Family Law Act To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia of showeth the need to amend the Family Law Act to provide a more balanced approach to the distribution of assets, when a marriage breaks down, so that family farms do not have to be sold to payout one partner.

Your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Sharp (from 20 citizens).

To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain Citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the deficiencies in the current Austudy scheme. Your petitioners therefore request the House to amend the Austudy loans supplement scheme, so that no trade in is required and students will be required to pay back only the amount they borrow (indexed to CPl). by Mr Sinclair (from 20 citizens). To support a referendum on Mabo rights of State Governments and clearly defining land title. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia attention of the House to the confusion over the Mabo High court decision and calls on Members to require the conduct of a Referendum to amend the Australian Constitution to reaffirm beyond doubt the rights of State Governments alone to define and issue land title.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Williams (from 230 citizens). Petitions received. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Roberts, Mr K.  wish to bring to the attention of this House an astonishing story of an Australian family's 50year long struggle to solve the mystery surrounding the death of a very brave, very courageous Australian airman during World War II. In the year when all Australians have been encouraged to take part in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, one of my constituents is piecing together the final parts of a mystery that started on 5 June 1944, when a Royal Air Force Lancaster bomber was shot down over France. Ever since that tragic event Mr Newton Roberts of Bunbury, Western Australia has not known the final resting place of his brother Ken, who was the Australian pilot and captain of the Lancaster bomber inscribed 'LL-783' and known as 'Cinders of the Clouds'. His body was never found or formally identified. He was listed as mIssmg in action. However, over the years the amazing story of flight lieutenant Kim Roberts' last bombing raid has emerged. Yet even now his brother Newton Roberts does not know where, or indeed if, his brother was buried. In March 1944, three months before he was killed in action at the age of 21, Kim Roberts was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, an immediate award as opposed to those decorated on the completion of a tour, usually 30 operations. On a bombing mission over Stuttgart his Lancaster was hit by enemy fire but he managed to manoeuvre his plane and shoot down the attacking enemy aircraft. The citation read: Pilot officer Roberts then completed his bombing run and afterwards flew the damaged aircraft to base. This officer and his airmen displayed commendable skill, courage and coolness. On the night of D-Day, Kim Roberts and his English crew had bombed a bridge 175 kilometres west of Paris. He was heading back to base at Dunholme Lodge in England, where his Lancaster bomber, a veteran of some 29 successful bombing missions over Germany and Europe, was attacked while approaching the Cherbourg Peninsula by a German fighter. His plane was badly hit. Two of the crew parachuted to safety and are alive in England today, after spending the rest of the war as prisoners of war. Their plane crashed and burst into flames, killing all of the occupants. The survivors, Jack Forrest and Reg De Viell, were contacted just three years ago, when researchers in France uncovered debris from the Lancaster bomber in a farmer's field in Normandy. For nearly 50 years they had wondered what had happened to their comrades and the destiny of their aircraft. Forrest and De Viell visited France, not expecting to find any trace of their Lancaster. It was with great emotion that they learnt of the fate of their aircraft, which had crashed in a flooded field. Numerous pieces of rusty aircraft frame and engine were found still lying in the field. With the assistance of the local French mayor and some journalists, .Forrest and De Viell discovered the graves of four of their crew: NavigatorlPilot Officer J. Lott, Radio Operator Flight Sergeant J. Tucker, and two gunners, Flight Sergeant L. Williams and Flying Officer G. Wyand. They were able to establish that, seconds after they jumped from the plane, two other crewmen also jumped but died when their parachutes failed to open as the plane was too low. All the crew members' graves were found in two French military cemeteries, but there was no grave for the plane's skipper, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts. There is far more to this mystery than an Australian pilot missing in action. This particular pilot just happened to be wearing a rather special keepsake around his neck. It was Hermann Goering's own Iron Cross medal and had been given to Flight Lieutenant Roberts by a neighbour in Bunbury, Western Australia. As members will know, Hermann Goering was a German flying ace during World War I and later became Adolf Hitler's second in command. He headed the feared German Luftwaffe during World War II. But during World War I Hermann Goering had shot down approximately 27 aircraft. The pilot of the seventh plane he brought down was a man called Frank Slee, who lived across the road from Kim Roberts' home in Stirling Street, Bunbury, Western Australia. Before Kim Roberts left for overseas duties, Slee gave him the medal and told him to keep it as a memento. He said Goering had given him the Iron Cross as a memento of their dogfight, an incident described in Goering's biography published in 1950. After the battle, Goering simply landed his plane, walked up to Slee, shook his hand and gave him his own inscribed Iron Cross medal. Kim Roberts did exactly what Slee had asked him. He kept the medal around his neck and never took it off. In fact, according to the two survivors, Forest and De Viell, the medal became a mascot for the crew and Kim Roberts would wave it around his neck to urge them on. Indeed, one theory of this amazing mystery is that after the Lancaster crashed, Kim Roberts may have been mistaken for a German because of the different colour of the Australian uniform and the fact that he was wearing the Iron Cross. It could be that an Australian pilot who gave his life for his country was buried as a German and, for the last 50 years, this has been one of the doubts that Kim Roberts's family has had to live with. After years of painstaking research, they now know exactly where the plane went down. They know precisely what happened to everyone on the plane except the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts. Researchers .are also considering the possibility that Kim Roberts was thrown from the plane on impact and his body is still laying beneath the mud in the farmer's field in Normandy. The French have expressed considerable interest in this event and have provided considerable assistance to researchers. The local mayor has written to my constituent and taken part in a special ceremony with the two British survivors to mark the 50th anniversary of D-day. They have located a farmer who was only 15 years old at the time and who has told how he saw the crippled bomber flying at rooftop height. The farmer said that the pilot was still at the controls and was struggling to avoid nearby buildings, before ditching the plane in a field. He said that plane finally crashed to the ground about 200 metres from his farmhouse and broke up, bursting into flames on impact. The tail section broke away from the cockpit and wings which, fed by the remaining fuel, became an inferno. Local villagers gathered around the wreckage of the tail section and noticed the two bodies inside. All four bodies were buried and later interred in local cemeteries. As with many tragedies that occurred during the war, the events of 50 years ago are somewhat clouded in the memories of the people who experienced them. As time goes by, their memories fade, and that is precisely why part of the Australia Remembers program has focused on collecting and recording the eyewitness accounts before they are lost forever. My constituent, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts's brother, has asked for government assistance to go to France and visit the place where his brother's plane went down and to place a memorial in the village church. I have passed on his wishes to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). I urge the minister to help the Roberts family to put the final pieces of this mystery together and to place a lasting reminder of Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts's final bombing mission in France where his plane went down. In the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and the year when Australia remembers all those who served their country, I urge the minister .to offer every assistance to the Roberts family so that they can complete the final chapter in this very unfinished mystery. Gun Ownership",61
215,Mr LES SCOTT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I would like to speak about the issue of gun ownership and gun control, which has received quite a deal of publicity lately, particularly with the recent spate of killings in Brisbane and other places. I, like any parent; naturally feel very sorry for the family of the teenager Matthew Easdale who was shot while breaking into a home in Brisbane, regardless of the circumstances. At the same time, I can understand the actions of the home the owner in the situation in which he was placed. Needless to say,Â· a youngman has died because of some of the problems we have withgun ownership. However, what I cannot understand is the rash of impetuous and premature calls for the relaxation of the laws relating to gun ownership in Australia. The rationale amongst some groups seems to be that the only way to make society safer is to introduce more guns. I should think not. As I said, I can understand the actions of the home owners in the recent burglary case in Brisbane where someone was shot and tragically killed. I do not in any way condone the actions of the victims in these cases, who were after all breaking the law by attempting to enter the home of private citizens. I do not feel qualified to make a judgment one way or the other as to whether or not they deserved to die for what they were doing. As far as I am concerned, nobody is qualified to make that judgment, and certainly not the groups which called for more guns to be made available for citizens to use. What is most disappointing is the fact so many different groups have jumped on this bandwagon and used these tragic incidents promote their own political agendas. To extent, this has been. encouraged by some, with governments using the law and order debate in election campaigns. This is certainly the case in Queensland, where the opposition has used it to try to score cheap political points on the. government. The opposition knows that it cannot match the Labor moment. government's policies. The Queensland National Party leader, Rob Borbidge, admitted as much last week when he said that the opposition would not release its policies the voters. That is nothing unusual for when dealing with the federal opposition. wonder if those opposite have the same p-oblem. Is that why' we are not seeing any policies froni the federal opposition? Central to this law and order debate is issue of gun ownership. Since these tragic incidepts, we have seen' all .sorts of people come out 6f the woodwork and use these shootings to justify their views on why guns should be more readily available in Australia. Most commonlY, they quite' shamelessly try to frighten ordinary Austni.lians into believing that we are liVIng in a .lawless society crime-particularly violent crime-increasing rapidlrÂ· . . '. However, figures ,show this attempt to be nothing more than ,staremongering. They are preying on the fears-real or imagined-of citizens. Statistics show that there has been little o- no increase in violent tralia over the last decade. According to surveys by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, rates of more serious crimes have not risen Queensland in recent years. For example, three per cent of respondents to such a survey in 1983 said that they had been assaulted. a 1993 survey, this figure was unchanged. the case of break and enter offences-which are most relevant to this matter-there was slight rise from 5.8 per cent in 1983 to per cent in 1993. Recent police figures from Queensland show that there was a 25 per cent increase in break and enters in 1994 from the previous year, but the overwhelming majority of these were not the so-called 'home that invasions', which has become a bit of a byword lately and an emotional.one at that. to , Most break and enters still occur while the some home owner is out, and the burglar's main objective is to steal property and get away undetected-not to harm defenceless people. Just the same, they need to be deterred. The issue of stiffer penalties for breaking and entering is another that may be debated some day. It is a matter of some debate at the Most robbers are smart enough to commit their crime when the owner is out. I am not to defending them-they should be punished us with the full weight of the law, which they I are when they are apprehended'-but I just make the point that there is no evidence to support claims from some groups that we need increased gun ownership in Australia. Of course, this will always be an emotive the and controversial issue-anything that involves crime against personal property with the added risk of injury is a serious matter. I am appalled at the way many groups have come out and had a feeding frenzy with this issue. For example, we would all know of the continuing attempt over the years by' the Australian Firearms Owners' Association to with influepce both public opinion and governments into making gun ownership easier in Australia. I am sure most members in this House would know that the government has not always seen eye to eye with the association on this issue. After its comments on Matthew Easdale's shooting, I do not think crime in Austhings will change much. Mr Ian MCNiven, the association's vicechairman, went on national radio and said that in Easdale's death was an example of 'the blood price' Australians have to pay to live in 'a safer society'. Despite the fact that the figures In I quoted illustrate that society is no more In dangerous than it was, Mr MCNiven was attempting to frighten people into thinking a that society is increasingly lawless. But the 7.5 most shocking thing was his reference to a 'blood price'. The very notion that we should accept a young man's death as natural and normal is abhorrent. As I said before, Easdale had no business being where he was or doing what he was doing.' The situations were extreme and they prompted extreme actions from the home owner. I would hate to think that Mr MCNiven would sanction such action in every case, almost as if it were a standard procedure. The truly frightening aspect of the gun lobby's agenda is the risk of extremist political groups taking advantage of easier gun ownership laws to make their point, as we have seen in the United States recently with the Oklahoma bombing and the Waco siege, involving the Branch Davidian sect. There are already enough extremist groups in this country to worry about without encouraging them to take up arms. A story in the Bulletin from 23 May illustrates the danger. Some far right wing groups have published and continue to publish materialfrom American individuals who have . been linked with the Michigan Militia, responsible for the Oklahoma bombing. A cursory glance at any of these publications is enough to satisfy any normal thinking individual that these people are considerably removed frbm the mainstream political debate. For instance, four editions of the magazine Lock, Stock & Barrel were banned in 1993 because they contained instructions on how to make bombs and how to convert semi-automatic guns into fully automatic machine guns. When the reporter from the Bulletin queried the publisher of the magazine about this, the publisher said that he was proud to defy the censors. He then want on to say that he did not support terrorism but could accept its use as a tactic if it was used in a positive way for Australia. Could anyone please explain to me how terrorism can be used in a positive way? As is usually the case with such groups, conspiracy theories abound. They believe that the financial system is conspiring with the UN and other governments in order to form a single government and take over the world. As a result of this, they encourage their supporters to be prepared to take up arms and defend themselves against the coming takeover. You probably do not need to be told that they endorse a fundamentalist Christianity and they approve of a deep hatred and distrust of governments, banks, communism, Jews, Asians, Aboriginals and just about anyone else who does not fit in with their ideas of what is normal. For this reason, I would not like to see an increase in the number of guns in Australia, nor do I think the gun ownership laws should be relaxed. It is too great a risk. I' acknowledge that there will alway's be situations, like Matthew Easdale's death, that will test opinions on this issue. I am not saying that there will ever be a perfect world,Â· because we know there will not be, but we do not need to let irrational fears rule us on this issue.' In fact, I cannot think of anything that requires more reasoned thought and caution than this issue. I would hate to think that the Australia. I grew up in will become like the United States, where guns are common and their use far too frequent. I only hope the people running around scaring US into . thinking we need guns will one day wake up to theÂ· fact that they are lucky to live in a country that, most of the time, does notnee- them. I conclude by making some reference to the days before I came into the parliament when I worked In the banking industry and was involved in the banking union. I was also on the national standing committee' on bank security. That was an . area in which we worked very hard, through the union, trying to ensure that common sense gun laws were consistent across this country . .From that experience and from knowing a lot of unassuming bank employees who actually had the terrible experience of looking down the barrel of a gun during bank hold-Ups, I can always grieve for the people I knew who were involved in those situations and understand how it affected their lives. . Australia really needs to address our problems of law and order, which any country has at present, with a much more common sense approach than these knee-jerk reactions of people demanding things like lesser gun laws rather than demanding tighter laws so that people do not have access to those sorts of weapons that can only harm our society. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue today. Drought Assistance",70
216,Mr COBB,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Later today the cabinet is meeting to revisit the criteria surrounding the eligibility for drought stricken farmers to qualify for exceptional cumstances assistance. I believe it is a disgrace that today, 29 May, less than three days before winter officially starts, the cabinet is finally bothering itself to look at this issue. The drought, hopefully, could very well be breaking, but we have a situation where the exceptional circumstances assistance that has been given so far has benefited barely four per cent of New South Wales farmers. That is despite New South Wales at one stage just recently being 98 per cent in drought. I remind the government that while it dithers on this there are rural lands protection boards in my electorate such as Dubbo, Nyngan, Cobar and Condobolin-just to mention a few-that do not qualify for exceptional circumstances assistance, but the need out there is so desperate that these people have been getting food parcels distributed to them for several months now. In .that regard, I would like to pay a high tribute to Jenny Butt of Canberra. Mr Sharp-Hear, hear! She's done a great job.",73
217,Mr COBB,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I acknowledge the interjection from the member for Hume, because she has helped to deliver food parcels not only in my electorate but also in other electorates, including the member for Hume's electorate. I must say that I was very honoured to be associated in a small way by helping to organise some of the distribution drop-offs in my electorate. The first load Jenny brought in-$150,000 worth of food, over six tonnes of itbenefited 570 families, and she has been back time and time again. I did make mention of this in a speech I gave on 29 March. I would like to read some excerpts of some of the thank you letters that have been received from grateful recipients of those food parcels, because I believe the heartfelt ces in these letters testify more eloquently than anything I can say as to the need that exists out there for help. I believe the sentiments recorded in these letters deserve a wider audience. In fact, in one sense, they have such value that they should become part of Australia's history. The first letter is from Sybil Roberts of Girilambone. She says: This afternoon Mrs Dorothy Larsen of Girilamcirbone CWA delivered to me the most wonderful parcel of very useful goods. It's a lovely gift & I can assure you it's very much appreciated. To the people of Canberra I say a very hearty ""Thank you"". Margaret Sanderson of 'Sherwood' Trundle, who is also the honorary secretary of the Yarrabandai branch of the CWA, wrote: A note to express the appreciation of all who received parcels of goodies in the OothaIYarrabandai & Derriwong areas from the consignment which came to Condobolin last weekend. Along with the President of Yarrabandai C.WA., I had the pleasure of distributing 15 parcels to needy farmers in our area. The gratitude was quite overwhelming & I am sure you will receive personal thanks from some. Thank you to you, especially, for caring enough to coordinate the collection of so many useful commodities-thank you too to the people of Canberra for their generosity. One recipient of a parcel told me she hadn't been able to afford tissues, shampoo etc. because she had to save every cent to re-register her car-she was so grateful for just every day items which were beyond her pocket. Best wishes & sincere thanks. Lyn Jones, who is the CW A Oxley Group President of Condobolin, also wrote: Special thanks to you, all your band of helpers and the people of Canberra for. your kindness and generosity in the food drop here in Condobolin for the Drought families. We have distributed it all out to the families in need. I have had a great band of C.WA. members to help and it all ran along smoothly. Thank you again. Margaret Wass from Girilambone wrote: Recently, a most useful & practical box of things we all need arrived at our place. We appreciate your kindness & your good sense. The generosity of the city people is heart-warming. We are all very weary. The hardest part about this drought is not senten- knowing when it will rain. Frank Weston from Nymagee wrote a very heartfelt letter. He is 90 years old. He said: Just to let you know I appreciate your gift & the thought that someone is kind enough to think of us during this extreme drought which has been one of the worse I have experienced since I came here in the year 1925. I am 90 years of age now & can only hope to be spared for a while longer. My son lives here so I am not completely alone. My wife passed away some years ago. Once again many thanks. Elaine Thompson of 'Caringle', Brewarrina wrote: I am writing to express my appreciation on receiving a 'parcel' which was collected by you and the people of Canberra, then distributed by the Brewarrina CWA. The 'parcels' were packed during a fairly hot spell, about 44Â°c that day. So my appreciation also goes to the CWA ladies for their effort. Frances Cobham of Walgett wrote: Thank you to CWA & the Canberra people for the welcome surprise parcel. Things for the Bathroom & Laundry & Kitchen as well as the Larder & some nice pharmaceutical items-all very much appreciated thank you. The box of goodies is a great morale booster. Please pass on to the people concerned my thanks for such a lovely gift, & my thanks for caring. Frances Allen of Brewarrina wrote: My husband, Brian & I were most grateful and delighted to receive our gift parcel, containing items for the kitchen, bathroom, laundry & pharmaceuticals. Our deepest thanks to you & the caring people of Canberra, for all the work & money involved in organizing the food & other gifts, parcel programme. We have been overwhelmed by the generosity of ordinary Australian people during this drought. It makes one proud to be an Australian citizen. Fran was being somewhat modest there because she was one of the ones who organised the packing of the parcels in Brewarrina that day. Merri Gill of Weilmoringle, Brewarrina wrote: Just knowing people care and care enough to do something to help makes such a difference-we all really appreciated what you did. Thank you again from the twenty families around Weilmoringle-our best wishes. Prue Walker from Mullaley wrote in February what I thought was a very interesting letter. She said: Dear Jenny, I feel ashamed that I have taken so long in writing to thank you & your helpers for the Drought Relief Parcel which I received back at the end of October, but better late than never! I guess I couldn't come to terms with it all & was over come with emotion. My husband was ashamed at the time. I accepted it - in fact, if he had been around when it arrived he would have made me give it back. As it was he wanted me to give it to someone else. But I knew we needed it, so after a time. I just quietly put it into my cupboard. He is such a proud man (what farmer isn't) & has always helped others. Having been involved with Apex & now State Emergency Service in which we are both heavily involved. Particularly Road Rescue, Driver Reviver & Storm Damage. It is something else to be on the receiving line for once. Mrs Rachel Frend of Gunnedah wrote: Although this note is long overdue, I would like to thankyou all for the generous contribution ... My family received a hamper at a time in November when things were looking very grim and depressing for Christmas and the future. Receiving such a hamper reminded us of the goodness of mankind and it is about the only thing which keeps us ""going"". You might be interested to hear how drought affects people. There is widespread depression amongst men and women-it's sometimes subtle and sometimes. not so subtle. There are wives who are scared to leave their husbands--even to go shopping-because of the fear of suicide. Marriages are under a lot of pressure and children are 'edgy' from the tension in homes. Pam Clifton from Piney Range, Grenfell, wrote: Thank you. so much for your visit. It was an incredible experience. I was just overcome, as we all were, that morning at the C.WA. rooms when you kept bringing in more and more goods. It is a wonderful feeling to think other people care. I think an old chap who lives on his own in the Piney Range area really summed your visit up. He said that he had lived in the same place for forty three years and nobody had ever given him anything before. Many families were very grateful for the toys, those beautiful wooden toys (I think a very special thank you should also go to The Woodcraft Guild in Curtin) and said that they would help with the children's Christmas presents. Once again Jenny and Helpers our many thanks. We hope that one day we might be able to do something for you or for someone else less fortunate, like ripples in a pond. They are some of the letters which I believe should be recorded. (Time expired) Innovation and Micro-Economic Reform",73
218,Mr LINDSAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (5.02 p.m.)-In this afternoon's grievance debate I wish to address two issues of fundamental importance to the future prosperity of Australia. Innovation and micro-economic reform are enabling Australia to confidently lead the way to freer trade in Asia. The leadership of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is providing support for these fundamental changes and building a better future for Australia in cooperation with our region. Innovation is about making the best use of Australia's outstanding science and technology. Innovation leads to new opportunities and more and better jobs for young Australians. Micro-economic reform stimulates innovation. Together, innovation and microeconomic reform can create new industries and raise the level of Australia's environmentally sustainable production. Under the policies of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when he was in government, Australia was inward looking, protectionist and riddled with industrial strife; Micro-economic reform is about the work force and management working together to achieve and exceed best practice; it is not about block outs, secret ballots and denying the rights of workers to union representation. The Leader of the Opposition is known for his long standing and inflexible opinions on industrial relations. They colour his view on Hilmer and competition policy. In question time today, in referring to Hilmer, the Leader of the Opposition called on the federal government to back the Western Australian government in a dispute over the awarding of a stevedoring contract to a non-unionised company. For the Leader of the Opposition, competition policy is not a matter of achieving better outcomes; it is simply about trampling on the hard won rights of working people. The Keating government has made significant progress in micro-economic reform and has achieved real benefits for industry. Micro-economic reform is a key mechanism for improving the business operating environment. It is aimed at improving the way in which an economy uses its resources. Microeconomic reform involves removing unnecessary burdens on business and minimising the costs of business inputs. This Labor government has an enviable record of achievement in introducing reforms in areas such as tariffs and quotas, capital markets, aviation and telecommunications. With the removal of the two-airline policy we have seen improvements in the services provided and reductions in airfares. For example, average domestic fares at the end of 1993 were 24 per cent lower in real terms than prior to deregulation. With the deregulation of the telecommunications market, international rates for long distance calls have fallen by more than 25 per cent in the past four years. Following reduced levels of protection from foreign competition, our exports of manufactures grew at an annual rate of 14.2 per cent from 1984 to 1992. The pressure for reform applied by the federal Labor government has initiated great increases in operating efficiency in areas such as electricity generation. As a direct result of a more open and deregulated sugar industry, CSR Ltd has been stimulated to develop the Ord River sugar industry and to re-establish its in-house research. Companies such as Goninan, a company in my electorate, are building export businesses on the cash flow of engineering maintenance contracts for the construction of locos. Overall, the major benefit of microeconomic reform is that Australia is now better positioned to achieve sustainable economic and employment growth without the inflationary strains of the late 1980s. The Keating government has accomplished yet another achievement with the recent agreement with the states and territories to implement a new national competition policy regime. This agreement will apply intense competitive pressure across all industry sectors. As a consequence, at all levels of government the fundamentals of competitiveness such as innovation, science and technology, and education and training will be examined. It is clear that the dynamic nature of the reform process means adjustment and that not all may benefit equally from the changes. That is why the government has made sure that continued pursuit of micro-economic reform is also consistent with the employment thrust of Working Nation. As a government we reject the Liberal Party's doctrinaire approach to reform that would ignore the values of Australian workers. The Leader of the Opposition should listen to CRA's senior executive, David Karpin. Following an extensive three-year study, the Karpin report on leadership and management skills describes a lack of depth in Australian management. In particular, it was noted that, relative to other countries, managers in Australia are not as skilled in their functional expertise as the workers they manage are in theirs. This finding reinforces the importance of involving workers in the process of change. Micro-economic reform is not a process that can be imposed by government fiat, as the opposition imagines. Under the member for Bennelong, Australia would be returning to the industrial disputation of the FraserHoward era. This government wants all Australians, especially the disadvantaged and the long-term unemployed, to ultimately benefit from the changes brought about by the reform process. While micro-economic reform is fundamental to building an innovative culture in Australia, it is also fundamental reaping the rewards of Australian creativity and invention and to putting the clever country into action. Results are being achieved. Australia's industrial research and development is growing faster than that of any other OECD country. In raising the profile of innovation, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, has opened up an important new front in public policy. Together with the minister and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, I have been involved in wide community consultations to develop the forthcoming innovation statement. Innovation is the transformation of creative ideas into practical solutions. It is about ways of adding value for customers, including through product development, service provision, marketing and management. Innovation, ultimately, is about the creation of wealth. Innovation is vital to success in the free and fair competitive business environment emerging in Australia. It will enable Australia to gain economic returns from our superior science and technology. Trade liberalisation and developments in Asia have opened up bigger markets for Australian industry. The accessibility of these markets increases the rewards for innovation, greater efficiency and productivity. Globalisation means that investment is more footloose and difficult to attract or hold ontoanother challenge we face. To meet these challenges, the federal government is committed to continual reform, particularly the reform measures under the umbrella of a national competition policy. In doing so, the government is supporting those disadvantaged by the dynamic nature of adjustment. What would members of the opposition do if they gained government? Whilst we do not have their policies, we do know their prejudices. The Liberals want the burden of structural adjustment to be borne by working people; the Nationals want their constituents to be protected from any change. That is why there are no opposition policies on issues as fundamental as the Hilmer competition policy reforms. What is the opposition's record on to tackling economic reform? In government, under Malcolm Fraser, it avoided every hard issue. Its policies caused double digit inflation, double digit interest rates and double digit unemployment. Its low wage policies simply led to low productivity growth and destroyed Australian competitiveness. The Australian people will not exchange the government's sound policies and record of achievement on innovation and micro-economic reform for the opposition's absence of policies and record of failure. The only historical record that we have on policy from the Leader of the Opposition is his support for the disastrous Fightback policy espoused by Dr Hewson during the last federal campaign. That 'included a commitment to a goods and new services tax of 15 per cent; slashing government expenditure by over $10,000 million; a zero tariff policy as modified by the National Party in certain sectors; and, above all, the abolition @f Medicare, except for health cardholders and pensioners. The opposition has a tradition of underestimating the intelligence of the Australian electorate. Prejudices and absence of policy are no substitute for sound economic policy. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",75
219,Mr ALDRED,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In today's grievance debate I wish to raise my concern that the ,Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) failed in his duty to seek and consider the knowledge and opinions of alLNgarrindjeri women regarding secret wom-n's business in his decision to ban the building of Hindmarsh Island bridge. Further, the minis-er, through his emissary, Professor Cheryl Saunders and others, failed to establish the bona fides of the women making the claims and the likelihood that they could be the custodians. This has caused. a severe set back to the process of reconciliation and cast suspicion over genuine claims. Let us consider the key women who say they do not believe the 'women's business' to be true. Mrs Dulcie Wilson, aged 64, is a highly respected Ngarrindjeri elder who was born and brought up at Point MCLeay-the home of the Ngarrindjeri tribe since the 1850s-and lived there until aged in her 80s. She was citizen of the yearÂ· in her home town of Millicent,' a former ATSIC councillor and soÂ· highly respected by the Salvation Army that she was asked to represent the women of Australia at Westminster in the 1950s. Her late husband, Lindsay, was a noted Ngarrindjeri historian and an authority on the customs and beliefs of his people. Mrs Dorothy Wilson, a 48-year-old grandmother, says that she was involved from the beginning, when on 6 May 1994 a grQup of 16 women first met at Goolwa and wrote to Minister Tickner asking him to stop the bridge. Dorothy Wilson was program director of the Murray Bridge Nunga's Club, which caters for the local Ngarrindjeri community, and she appears on a poster honouring Aboriginal achievers of Murray Bridge. In a statutory declaration she says, 'My grandmother was a Ramindjeri woman and my grandfather was from the Yaraldi tribe,' both of whom camped seasonally on Hindmarsh Island. Mrs Wilson can genuinely lay claim to being a descendent of the tribes that camped on Hindmarsh Island. She spoke out because she could no longer live with the conspiracy that others sought to hide. Then there is 74-year-0Id Ngarrindjeri elder, Mrs Bertha Gollan, who says that she could not risk going to her grave living a lie. She has been quoted as Saying, 'How can I lie to my daughters?' Born and brought up at Point MCLeay, Mrs Goitan is the first to admit that her mother's tribe is from the south-east of South Australia and, therefore, could not possibly have known of this so-called 'secret women's business'. ' Contrast these women with those who claim knowledge of the women's business. First and foremost, there is Doreen Kartinyeri Wanganeen, born at Point MCLeay. But she left when she was 10, after the death of her mother. Until last week-when suddenly the claims of the breakaway five were made-she claimed to be sole custodian of the 'secret women's business' and its location.",77

221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Rocher)Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate acquainting the House that, in accordance with the resolution agreed to by both houses, Senator Crichton-Browne has been appointed a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. National Capital and External Territories Committee",77
222,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"Dunkley}--On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I present the committee's report entitled King George V Memorial. Ordered that the report be printed.",78
223,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report of the Joint Standing Committee, on ,the National Capital and External Territories deals with the proposed restoration of the King George V memorial currently located in the parliamentary zone. The memorial commemorates King George V, the monarch at the time of the opening of the Old Parliament House. The memorial is classified by the National Trust and has been entered on the Register of the National Estate. On 2 March 1995, the Minister for Housing and Regional Devel@pment (Mr Howe) wrote to the committee referring to it the proposed restoration of the memorial, including the removal of, two Lombardy, poplars which flank the memorial. The memorial consists of a central brick pylon faced with sandstone blocks. There is a 4.5 metre copper alloy statue of King George V facing east and a sandstone figure of St George on horseback facing west. Ten commemorative inscriptions are inscribed on the sandstone, at the base and high on the pylon, and nine copper alloy basrelief plaques have been placed around the work. When I looked at the memorial, I was interested to see some of the plaques and inscriptions. There are plaques of a: flier, nurse, soldier and sailor commemorating World War 1. Sir Henry Parkes is there' and so is Sir Samuel Griffith, commemorating the first federal convention in 1891. The opening of the first federal parliament in 1901 is recalled by their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York. There is also the inscription commemorating the 26-year reign of King George V. The committee is aware that questions over the siting of the memorial and the ongoing need for repairs have dogged the memorial for over 50 years. The memorial was originally erected in 1943 on a large podium directly in Report front of the Old Parliament House. From that time, cO,ncern was raised about the location of the memorial. It was moved' in 1968 to its present location to the west of the front of the Old Parliament House. ' On its present site, the memorial is surrounded by a granite paved area and the original large podium has been replaced by a smaller platform. The, memorial is flanked by two mature Lombardy poplars. Public access to the memorial has not been possible since October 1991 because of the concern about public safety and continuing damage to the memorial. The root systems of the poplars have caused damllge to paving surrounding the memorial, causing a tripping hazard. Fine roots have penetrated the stone work of the memorial's plinth and the location of th- two Lombardy poplars restricts access to the memorial for maintenance work. ' Based on, the evidenc-, ih- committee accepts, that it is ,necessary to remove the Lombardy poplars, al-hough the committee regrets that such a problem was not foreseen when the memorial was moved to its present location. In his letter to the committee, the minister said"" that the matter of the final location of the memorial is still undecided. The committee notes that the memorial has been on its present site for most of - ts existence and that the issue of a change in its location would be difficult to resolve. Therefore, it is the committee's recoml,Ilendation that the King George V memorial remain permanently 'on its present site. "" - j It is proposed that the restoration of the memorial will be carried out by the National Capital Planning Authority. It is ex,pected to take approximately four months at an estimated cost of $226,905. This amount includes tree removal and reinstatement of the area with new plants. The committee is concerned that the failure to carry out maintenance on the memorial since 1968 has contributed to the urgent need to undertake the work to restore the memorial before a decision could be made on the permanent, location of the memorial. The committee recommends that the restoration of the memorial proceed and be completed to a standard commensurate with the permanent siting of the memorial.' I thank the committee members for their contribution to this inquiry. Committee members made a special effort to deal with the inquiry quickly in recognition that the much needed maintenance and restoration of the King George V memorial should be a priority to ensure that it is not allowed to deteriorate further. I commend the report to the House, and seek leave to move a motion. Leave granted.",78
224,Mr CHYNOWETH,COMMITTEES,"I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Committee  behalf of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I present the committee's report entitled Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and Air Services Bill 1995. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.  the House of 11 May 1995, the Speaker was given the authority to release the report of Standing Committee on Transport, Communithe cations and Infrastructure into the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the Air Services Bill 1995 if the House was not sitting when the report was presented to him. Under this authority the report released on 18 May 1995. Use of this procedsolution ure reflects the tight deadline under which the committee operated and the need to give the government sufficient time to introduce Aviation Authority. amendments to the bills during this second reading debate in the House of Representalegislation. tives. The report is the outcome of a reference given to the committee on 28 March 1995 by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Given the importance of the bills and the need to establish the two new aviation authorities by 1 July 1995, the committee moved quickly. On 30 and 31 March the bills and their explanatory memoranda were sent to organisations which were asked to make submissions by 20 April 1995. Evidence was taken at a public hearing on 26 April. Report consideration commenced on 10 May, and the amended report was accepted by the committee the next day. I thank the many people and organisations who assisted the committee to meet this tight deadline. Secondly, I thank the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff for the quick turnaround of the transcript of 26 April 1995. Thirdly, I thank the Australian Government Publishing Service for the speedy printing of the report. Lastly, I give special thanks to the members who made themselves available for the public hearing and who assisted in the report preparation. They were Report the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and the member  committee secretariat. I tum to the report. We say it has three objectives: first, to comment on whether the bills are necessary; second, given the first point, to examine whether the bills meet their basic purposes; and, third, to advise the House on the need for amendments that improve the quality of the bills, including advice on the second point. In examining the the need for the two bills the committee drew following conclusion: there is broad support for the establishment of an independent aviation safety authority. The committee endorses this approach. The creation of a new authority with a new and more specialised was board and a new director is a far better for the troubled and turbulent world of aviation safety regulation in Australia than any reorganisation within the existing Civil The committee recognised the limits of the We said that the establishment of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, or CASA, by itself is not the only cure of the problems that have beset the administration of aviation safety in Australia. At the end of the day, it is the board of CAS A and its director that must be responsible for the administration of aviation. The key issue then is accountability. We emphasise that CAS A should be accountable to the minister, the parliament and the courts and to no-one else. The remaining two report objectives are combined in the two chapters that examine separately each of the bills. The experience gained by the committee in the aviation safety inquiry lead it to emphasise the need for clarity in the bill that establishes CASA. The report .states: The Bill should set out clearly, precisely and redrafted. comprehensively the functions of the aviation safety regulator, CASA. Then the regulator, the aviation industry and others would know what is the job CAS A. Clearly prescribed functions would also enable the Parliament to gauge the effectiveness CASA. Unfortunately, this clarity is absent in the We welcomed the innovation of an object clause but found confusion between object and functions. The' two words were used colleagues interchangeably and there was duplication and, in our opinion, too much detail object clause. The view of the committee was that clarity would be promoted and confusion reduced if the object clause is a broad in-principle statement of purpose. Then the more detailed functions of the object clause could be transand ferred to the section on functions. Paragraph 3.12 of the report sets out the committee version of the object clause. We want a short in-principle statement of purpose along the lines set out in the paragraph. I turn to functions, the next key feature the bill. Once again with' clarity committee said that, rather than Â·a simple listing, functions should have a three tier classification. Functions should be classified according to whether they are, first, primary or core functions; secondly, functions related to those primary or core functions; and, bill thirdly, other functions. The report makes several recommendations on functions. Once again, the committee is not wedded to the detail. We are, however, convinced of the need to bring all the functions place, of the necessity to classify functions and of the need to avoid duplication. I have mentioned the need for accountability. Two aspects of the bill concern the committee. The first is paragraph 3A(g) of the object clause, which states: . .. promoting the highest possible levels of accountability within CASA and for CASA's dealings with other bodies ... The committee has several concerns about this paragraph. The most serious is that of regulatory capture. This would happen if CASA, the regulator, is seen to be accountable to the industry, the regulated. Our recommendation is that paragraph 3A(g) be either deleted or Another area of concern covers the corpoof rate plan. Briefly, we believe that the corporate plan that the minister approves should be of tabled in both houses with expedition. This covers both the Civil Aviation Safety Authoribill. ty and Air Services Australia. Several other aspects ofthereport will be covered by our inquiry into aviation safety. I again thank my and the secretariat for their assistance in this rapid ta-k we undertook. I comin the mend the report to the House.",79
225,Mr SHARP,COMMITTEES,"by leave-l take this opportunity to thank the honourable member  the .report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure also to thank him for his chairmanship of the process that he has just reported on. I take this opportunity to commend the process that we have undertaken in this committee. It has been a very educative process for all those involved. Indeed, it has been a very valuable process for the parliament and in particular of the aviation industry-the industry the legislain mind, the tion we reviewed is for. . By going through the legislation we were able to identify a number of shortcomings in it-shortcomings in our view and indeed in the view of others from. the jndustry. As the is now in the processes of the House, this is something that is very valuable because it ensures that we can put through this House a bill that better reflects the needs and aspirations of the people in the industry and indeed into the one of this parliament. I also make the point that one aspect of the bill which was not drawn to our attention but has since been drawn to our attention-I have not discussed this with the chairman-relates to clauses 20A and 20B of the legislation.  the minister.",80
226,Mr SHARP,COMMITTEES,"It is being referred now. Clauses 20A and 20B of the legislation amend the old legislation to read that a pilot may be breaking the law if he flies an aircraft in a fashion where it has the potential to endanger life or property. Taking the ridiculous circumstance, just getting in an aircraft and flying has the potenti<ctl to endanger life or property. That rather ambiguous statement in the legislation needs to be honourable member for Shortland interjected a few moments ago, that is now being reported to the minister, and hopefully amendment to the legislation will take place. It has been an extremely worthwhile process which other committees of the parliament and other ministers responsible for the passage of legislation in this parliament would be wise to undertake. Members of our committee also want to ensure that this is not the last time we see amendments to civil aviation legislation before this House. Obviously, as we draw to a conclusion our report and we make recommendations, we would like to think that the opportunity to amend this legislation further would be available to us to ensure that deliberations which we have been undertaking now for a very long time can bear some fruit. I join with the member for Shortland in thanking those people who participated on this committee, particularly the honourable  table, and the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). They have been very active in their participation on this committee. I also thank the secretariat, which has been very useful in providing us with support for what I believe to be a very important report, one part of which has been tabled here today in the House.  Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, the report abolishes the luxury of ignorance of those who participate in the industry, in that they can no longer claim that they had no knowledge of what the legislation contained. We as a committee in total made that request and we ensured that that process happened. It was very healthy, and I thank everybody. I seek leave to move: That the House take note of the report. Leave granted.  That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1995Â·96 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion corrected. As the by Mr Beazley: That the bill be now read a second time.",81
227,Mr ELLIOTT,COMMITTEES,"Parramatta-Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and the Arts) (5.32 p.m.)-I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1995-96. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said in the lead-up to the budget, a number of important issues need to be addressed. The first issue was to accelerate the process of the deficit reduction strategies that had been outlined last year. The next issue was to ensure that we provided a comprehensive medium-term strategy to boost national savings. Underlying all of those things was the test of ensuring that we made a real contribution to dealing with the major challenge of the current account deficit. In his response to the budget, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said that there were a number of tests to determine what should be done in the budget. Unfortunately, obviously one of the tests that did not apply to the Leader of the Opposition was to actually outline any policy. It was very clear from listening to his response to the budget that he still has not developed any policy that he is prepared to put before the Australian people. That was reinforced in the speech made at the press club by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). The only thing he proposed at that stage that was of any note was the commission of audit that will be reporting on contingent liabilities of the Commonwealth, including public service superannuation, et cetera. The only thing we can say about the commission of audit is that it is the alibi for the slash and bum tactics that the opposition is hoping to get away with after the next election rather than outlining any detailed policies and taking the people of Australia into its confidence prior to the election. The important thing about this year's budget is that it achieves the objectives we set. First of all, we get the budget back into surplus this year. The structural position of the budget will improve dramatically in 199697. In 1996-97, even leaving aside the asset sales that are outlined in this year's budget, there will be a surplus of $3.4 billion. The budget surplus this year has been achieved through a combination of fiscal tightening, revenue measures and asset sales; that is, looking at all the elements that go to make up the budget quite properly and trying to ensure that we take steps to maintain a sustainable level of economic growth. The budget forecast, which no-one has challenged this year, of around 3% per cent is a very achievable target. Indeed, the Secretary to the Treasury said recently that he believed that target could be exceeded through sustainable, low inflationary growth. One of the other key tenets of what policy has to be about is ensuring that we maintain the benefits of the low inflationary environment which have been one of the major achievements of recent years and which are clearly part of our future competitiveness. It must be built on maintenance of low inflation and growth and it must be built on productivity but with inflation being kept at realistically low levels. The other important consideration in sustaining the recovery is to ensure that interest rates are kept at the lowest levels possible. Since the budget we have seen some of those interest rates-both the variable home loan rates and the fixed home loan rates-starting to come down. Certainly, th-re has been a stabilisation of interest rates through this year. Again, we can see the right ingredients to have sustainable economic recovery now and to build stronger economic fundamentals in the economy in the years to come. One of the key initiatives in this year's budget relates to our plan for national savings. The cornerstone of that plan relates to superannuation. As everyone would be aware, up until now the government had outlined a strategy on superannuation to ensure that we achieved a nine per cent employer contribution by the year 2002. The measures announced in the budget ensure that, in addition to that nine per cent, we will now have a three per cent employee contribution and a matching three per cent contribution from the government. So, effectively, what we will have from the year 2000 onwards is a situation where the vast majority of workers will have a 15 per cent retirement income superannuation component. This will help to ensure higher retirement incomes for them as individuals but it will also dramatically add to national savings which the whole nation benefits from in the future. That is the key element in ensuring that we mount the proper attack on our current account deficit. It is worth noting that superannuation savings today total just under $190 billion. The initiatives that have been outlined in the budget will provide a massive boost to superannuation savings and will ensure that we meet the challenges of national savings and of the ageing of the population. It will therefore ensure a higher quality of life for all Australians into the next century. The opposition's response has basically been to say , 'We believeÂ·there should be tax breaks of some description for private savings rather than the regime that has been outlined by the government.' A few things should be noted here. First of all, the tax concessions already in the system for superannuation amount to about $5 billion. We also know that providing a tax break just for private savings will ensure the sort of situation we had prior to 1983. When the vast majority of people did not get access to superannuation, they became totally reliant on the age pension. The benefits for taxation breaks on superannuation essentially pointed to those on higher incomes and people on lower incomes missed out. That group that missed out certainly included part-time workers and it inevitably included women, who have missed out on superannuation until recent times. They did not add to national savings either. All they did was shift the tax arrangements from the public saving to the private saving for a select few. We believe superannuation should be much more than an initiative for a privileged few. There should be superannuation arrangements that benefit the whole community. Today we have superannuation coverage of almost 90 per cent of the work force, whereas when Labor came into power in 1983 there was superannuation coverage of less than 45 per of the work force. A number of studies have been done recently in this area. I refer in particular to the OECD report entitled Taxation on household savings. It confirmed that the approach we were taking in the superannuation area was building national savings very considerably and was a preferred model in ensuring that household and national savings were improved as opposed to the tax break model that had been pursued by the opposition. Something else worth noting when we discuss superannuation is the criticism from the opposition that the budget measures are there to somehow benefit the unions and industry funds. There are a number of things that need to be said about the employee contribution outlined in the budget papers. The plan is to, in the future, have employee superannuation contributions paid out of wage rises negotiated through award arrangements and enterprise agreements. The contributions will amount to three per cent in the three-year phase in period. This is important because it ensures that they are built up in a way that does not undermine industrial relations and household incomes. It is also just as important to note that arrangements are not inflexible, as has been suggested. The arrangements will ensure that contributions from the self-employed are paid into complying superannuation funds as part of their tax returns. The arrangements are not just there for the benefit of those in some industries and some unions. The suggestion that payments can only be made into industry funds is quite wrong. The fact is that an employee's contributions will be paid into the fund that their employer uses for superannuation guarantee contributions. It is logical to pay the funds into the existing fund that the employee has. This will ensure that it is cheaper and easier for employers. In addition, it ensures that we build up the savings of each person. It would obviously be foolhardy to encourage a situation where the superannuation contribution has to be paid into a new fund because it would not accumulate as quickly for the person making the contribution. The funds will be paid into whichever fund is receiving the superannuation guarantee payment. That will include industry funds, employer sponsored funds, master trusts and personal superannuation products. All of those funds can be appropriately structured to receive those superannuation guarantee payments. Absolutely no change will be made in that regard under the arrangements the government has outlined. There has also been a suggestion from the opposition that the answer to all these issues is to have superannuation savings accounts and that somehow they will provide a different way of boosting national savings. I will make a couple of points in that regard. There is no doubt that some of the funds will flow into superannuation products provided by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. Banks and credit unions have been very successful for some time in selling superannuation over the counter. Last year the subsidiaries accounted for nearly a third of all personal superannuation premiums. Subsidiaries of banks and credit unions account for 35 of the 157 approved trustees able to sell public offer superannuation. There is a competitive environment in the this area. The government says quite strongly that the same supervisory rules should apply to all superannuation funds. That is a prudentially sound thing to encourage. An important budget initiative this year in the area of national savings was the government's conscious decision to make superannuation the main form of national savings by reorienting the second tranche of tax cuts proposed in the One Nation statement to ensure that they boost the retirement incomes and superannuation savings of individuals and ensure that the people who get the benefit of that particular form of national saving are those on lower to middle incomes. We have a situation where the real benefit of the initiative the government has taken will go to every worker who has an income up to one to four times average weekly earnings. They will phase out at twice average weekly earnings. The benefit of the $4.5 billion per annum that the government will pay into individual superannuation accounts by the year 2002 will go to those people in the lower to middle income sector. They will get a real benefit out of the government matching the contribution. This measure will ensure a strong level of equity in the way the payment is paid. In my view, this is certainly preferable to the propothe sal that would have involved the second tranche of tax cuts going to the upper income sector. This would have been without the boost to national saving which would have been attached to it. It is very pleasing to note in the commentary on the budget that there has been a very strong endorsement of the government's proposals in the area of savings. The author of the previous report on national savings, Dr FitzGerald, made it clear that he thought this was a very positive step towards reaching the 18 per cent target that he believes is important for the future of superannuation savings for all Australians. Under these measures, we are ensuring that we achieve 15 per cent by the year 2002. Various others who have spoken and written about the budget initiative relating to superannuation have made clear that they strongly support the initiatives that have been taken in this regard. The other thing that is important to note about this year's budget is the number of initiatives the government has taken to ensure we achieve the budget surplus which I think we all regard as important to achieve in future years. The government will do it in .a way that will maintain the strong social justice credentials of the government. The initiatives in the health area are designed to protect and ensure the strength of our public health system and particularly relate to families. The maternity allowance and a whole range of other changes outlined this year will provide sustainable incomes for families. They are important long-term measures which need to be built into the budget process in future years. There are initiatives in this year's budget that enforce the government's commitment to families. I will not run through all of those at this stage, but I point out that when people talk about family policy there is no doubt areas like Medicare are fundamental to the security of families. The budget ensures that we have a safety net in terms of pension payments for the aged. It is important that there are measures that ensure access to justice for all because that is an important consideration for all families. In relation to children, measures like national child immunisation program are very tangible benefits and positive ingredients for ensuring family policy is properly maintained in the future. There are a number of important initiatives in this budget relating to the environment. The budget provides $252 million over four years for environmental initiatives. These relate to a number of key areas such as greenhouse, core environmental functions, biodiversity, wetlands, coastal policy, forestry and waste paper recycling programs. One of the key initiatives relates to coastal policy. Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) launched a major initiative in the area of coastal policy. That is something that I think the whole community should regard as important. The preservation of our natural areas and the future enjoyment of our beautiful coastline concerns all those who are increasingly worried about the damage being done to our coastline. In the area of environmental policy, the key initiative in this year's budget relates to the better cities program. The opposition has at times criticised this program. There are a number of important things that need to be said when we look at the better cities program. It is fundamentally designed to improve infrastructure, to look at the built environment and improve the quality of that built environment and to ensure that we have better public transport infrastructure. It is also designed to build economic efficiency. Obviously, if we have the right infrastructure in our cities and around our port, railway and freight networks the community as a whole benefits. There would be economic gain with regard to the investment in that infrastructure which the opposition has been far too quick to decry by criticising the better cities program. I note in particular the commitment to heritage in our cities. The built environment is an important area of consideration. Coming from Sydney and the electorate of Pimamatta, which is the second oldest European settleidentity ment in Australia, I am very concerned to protect quality of life in our cities and ensure that the major heritage items listed the National Estate, which citieS like mine and Clthers around Australia have? are prebuilt served and protected. This government has a range of programs aCfO$S better cities-areas relating to the national estate. program througQ the' environnational ment portfolio and areas relating to tourismall focu$ed on trying to ensure that we protect those key elements of our national estate, those parts of the built environment that be important not only for this generation but also forfuture generations: All those measures are picked up in a bud,get to provide the ingredients we need to ensure that environment and the built environment given the right priority but, at the same time, ensuring that is done in a way that maintains the key' economic fundamentals that are crucial in this year's budget-and they, of course, relate to ensuring that we achieve the sies. budget surplus, ensuring that we have' the structural surplus there for future years and ensuring, as a result Of that, that interest tan be kept at low levels and that, as a result of those"" measures, economic activity can grow. I want to touch on a couple of other issues relating to the appropriations. The first issue relates to the opposition constantly claiming, as it does, that there is a lack of commitment to micro-economic reform by the government Keating. anc:i, the fact that it does not put enough energy into that area. Of course, not lorig before the budget, we did have the important initiatives relating to the Hilmer report. The national competition policy was launched. Eventually it received the right priority from the states, who were difficult to drag along and had to be bought in that process. But, as a result of that, we do now have real commitments to national competition policy-a real commitment across all levels of government to work to achieve the economic efficiency that not only is important to Australia but also will be important to future generations of Australians because, through this, we ensure that we do have a national and we do have international competitiveness. This budget is all about building to on that competitiveness, ensuring that we on have sustainable economic growth for the future, ensuring that we have national savings to the right levels-national savings that are genuine and long-term. . It is time for the opposition to come forward and state clearlyÂ· what it wlll do about savings, rather than saying it will freeze everything and just give a tax break to a few. It has to be concerned, I suggest, to focus on national savings, to build on the will strong superannuation initiatives we have taken, rather than continually knock and decry those initiatives which are in the long-term interests of all Australians. I commend the the natural budget to the House. are . Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Rocher)Order!

228,Mr SMYTH,COMMITTEES," Mr Deputy Speaker, if you want to tell a city, 'So rates what?', then you have to expeCt a reply. When that reply comes and it sets a 60-year record, and it is so loud and clear, and then the people of CanberraÂ· are told they are just out of sorts, you have to begin to wonder whether or not 300,000 A-stralians, including the 99,000 voters in my electorate, and their children really exist in the, eyes of Paul If the truth be known, the people of the electorate of Canberra and, indeed, all the residents of the Australian Capital Territoryall 300,000 of them-are often overlooked in statements made in our national press that attribute government decisions, Labor government decisions, to the people of Canberra. How often have we heard the lines, 'Canberra's new tax', 'Canberra decided tonight', 'Canberra has resolved', 'Canberra hasn't delivered again'. Throughout the by-election when door-knocking from the suburbs of Curtin to Chisholm, Rivett to Isabella Plains, one constant plea from all in my electorate was that the national press in the press gallery attribute to the Labor government its mistakes and not blame the 300,000 mainstream Australians who live in Canberra. It is possible that, because of this preoccuparticular, pation with Canberra as the political heart of Australia, many Australians do not realise that the people of the electorate of Canberra are involved in the other facets of life that make Canberra the jewel in the crown of Australian life. Indeed, Personal Investment magazine recently chose Canberra as Australia's best city. And while many would say that Canberra has too much, I say that it sets a standard for all Australian society as a wholethrough being the political, the diplomatic and the administrative heart of Australia; through being the defence, the research and the educational heart of Australia; through being the cultural heart of Australia; through being a tourism, technological and sporting heart; and through being a regional heart for the people of the south-east region of New South Wales. While we are at it, let us dispel a few myths about Canberra. Like the rest of mainstream Australia, the electorate of Canberra and, indeed, all of the ACT is suffering the turmoils of unemployment, business and personal bankruptcy, family breakdown and social problems. For example, youth unemployment in the electorate of Canberra is 25 per cent worse than the Australian average. Mr Deputy Speaker, that which is our home is your national capital. The people of Canberra do include political workers, diplomats and their staff, and a large number of public servants-public servants whom I have worked with and whom I respect and who, in the main, would simply like to serve the people of Australia at the direction of elected governments. They wish to serve in a non-political yet efficient and effective manner, for many of these public servants have seen the waste and are as unhappy as are other Australians at the excesses of governments such as this one. Canberra is also home to a large defence community. Our service men and women and their families contribute to our city as they contribute to the safety and well-being of the nation. Canberra is a research heart for this nation with constituents from my electorate working in the national capital's four universities. In the research schools of the Australian National University, the fundamental research work carried out at the John Curtin School of medical research and at UC, the University of Canberra, where a cooperative research centre is studying the ecology of our waterways. Much research work carried out by the CSIRO is conducted here in Canberra. Canberra is an educational heart with its four universities. The Canberra Institute of Technology, with its International School of Hospitality and other faculties, draws students locally, from surrounding regions, from around Australia and from overseas, particularly Asia. Just as a heart draws in, oxygenates and then pumps out to its extremities, so does Canberra. Most significantly, as a cultural heart, many of our country's most important collections are housed in Canberra. They are maintained and catalogued, researched and loved by the people of my electorate. Many of these collections have suffered the erosion of budget, of direction and of broken promises. For example, one of our greatest treasures is the collections of the National Museum of Australia. They include extensive collections relating to indigenous Australians which remain without a permanent exhibition building and without funding. Here is a promise from the coalition: the National Museum of Australia will be built at Yarramundi by the year 2000 because, unlike those who sit across from me, the coalition is not embarrassed to display the collections that represent mainstream Australia. It is from Canberra that so many travelling exhibitions depart, to ensure that the collections travel the length and breadth of this country. These include collections from my old workplace-and I see some staff up there-the National Library of Australia. These comprise not just books, of which there are five million, but magazines, newspapers, rare books, manuscripts, artworks, feature films, oral history collections; ahd maps. Nbt only is the National Library home to one of the most significant collections of Australiana, the Rex Nan Kivall collection, but then it has unique treasures, like Ben Hall's pistol, Lady Macquarie's jewellery, Fanny Durack's Olympic gold medal, Robert Menzies' Warden of the Cinque Ports outfit. It also has the best Australian bookshop in the world- But what does it not have? It does not have room to continue its collections into the 21st century, not even funding for a' warehouse let alone the two additional buildings planned back in 1968. Another centre of notice is Questacon, the National Science and Technology Centre with its travelling science circus, educating and challenging Australians throughout our land. The list of cultural and technological treasures goes on: the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery of Australia, the magnificent Australian National Botanic Gardens, the National Film and Sound Archive, Old Parliament House, 'and Lanyon Homestead. Additionally, Canberra boasts one of the'Iargest, most active and highly productive arts communities of authors and poets, artists and sculptors, weavers and' woodworkers, and many others who contribute to my electorate's well-being and to Australia's vitality. Australians are renowned as early adaptors when it coines to technology, and the people of the electorate of Canberra are no exception. Canberra itself is a centre for research and technology, boasting more than 800'high-tech companies situated in this city. It is that sort of high-tech concentration here that will take this town, this city,' this country into the century. Working in unison, these cOmpanies, in conjunction with the nation's premier cultural institutions, have bid for a cooperative multimedia centre, a proposal that I take this opportunity to highly recommend to the ministers involved. Also of note and of current interest with those who know of the Internet is that Telstra has chosen the new development of Gungahlin, where 5,000 homes will be linked to a network, in which to conduct a trial of the largest broadband interactive link-up in the Southern Hemisphere. As a sporting heart, all of Australia knows of the Canberra Raiders and the Canberra Cannons. Now there is the Kookaburras to contend with. There is also the Canberra Nationals, the Capitals, the Lakers and many other sporting groups, a lot of whom live in my electorate. ,Canberra as an electorate and as a city is also the heart of the Canberra region. Indeed, this, week celebrates Canberra Region Week. It is a region that-if you live here you know.., --sweeps down to the magnificent beaches of the south coast, south and west to the magnificent high country of the main range, and north to Australia's fine wool and wheat country. Canberra gives these people an educational centre, a medical centre and an employment centre as well as a sporting, shopping and professional centre but, most importantly, a centre for opportunity. The south-east region gives Canberra back much in exchange. Undeniably, the electorate of Canberra is a reflection of Australian society, boasting the most diverse array of cultural heritages. Yet, with so much to offer, Canberra as a city is so often forgotten. Like Australia itself, Canberra suffers from a tyranny of distance. Seen as isolated from the rest of the country, Canberra does not have an international airport, while poor rail links and yet-to-be-completed sections of highway isolate it. Yet in this budget session we see the selling of our nation's assets for no gain. We have a government that steals a country's assets to fudge a budget; we have a governinent that is smug and complacent; next we have a government that has lost the plot. The issues that now challenge Canberra as an electorate and as a city also challenge Australia as a nation. The solutions for the nation are the solutions for Canberra. Many Australians, and indeed many Canberrans, feel forgotten. While Menzies championed the forgotten people, the middle class, 50 years ago, the Labor Party has created an underclass in the 1990s whose cause and future will now be championed by John Howard and the coalition. Forgotten are the families; forgotten are the businesses-large and small, corporate and family; forgotten are the average PAYE taxpayers and retirees; forgotten are the unemployed; and forgotten are the university students told to 'get ajob'. Many of these are denied a future through an overregulated labour market, are burdened by regulation and taxation or are simply failed by im infrastructure that cannot carry Australia into the 21 st century. I would like to extend my congratulations to ACT Chief Minister Kate Carnell and to Deputy Chief Minister Tony De Domenico who have adopted the attitude that Canberra is open for business. Indeed, it is the businesses-large and small, corporate and familythat will employ, that will create wealth, that will increase savings, that will help build infrastructure and that will allow all Australians and the people of the electorate of Canberra a better future. These businesses deserve a better tax system with smaller compliance costs. They need a more flexible industrial relations system that will encourage small business not just to prosper but also to employ. They want less red tape and changes to the capital gains tax to provide relief for small businesses and they have to have a healthy climate providing certainty for business investment. As Robert Menzies once said: Individual enterprise must drive us forward. That does not mean that we are to return to the old and selfish notions of laissez faire ... but what really happens to us will depend on how many people we have who are of the great and sober and dynamic middle class-the strivers, the planners, the ambitious ones. We shall destroy them at our peril. It was interesting to note in this morning's Canberra Times that the majority of Australians ,and the majority of Canberra residents regard themselves as the middle classes. I would like to take this oppo'rtunity to thank those who helped out in the Canberra by-election victory. To my mother, Maureen, who died six years ago and who supported my father in his various businesses while raising 10 children, practising her faith and passing it on to me, who always had time to help others, and to my father, David, who came to this country for a better future and who worked so many long hours for so many years-I thank you. His favourite line, which I hated when I was a kid, was, 'If you cannot afford to pay, don't go.' I now see the sense in it and perhaps the government would like to take it to heart. To my nine brothers and sisters, I thank you. An opposition member-Nine? Mr SMYTH::"""":'Yes, nine: There is Ellen, Moya, Imelda, Brendan, Angela, Gerard, Matthew, Loretta, Damien and Monica.

Seven of us are married.We have clocked up 80 years of marriage and there are 16 grandchildren. I tell you what: if this country isn't heaven on earth, then it doesn't exist. To my family, thank you; . To my friends, particularly Drew MCLean, Paul, the Peters, Shaun, Greg and the gang, Dick, Carmel, Denise and Alice-I thank you. To the members of the Liberal Party, in particular Andrew Rbbb for his encouragement and support, to Brian, DawnÂ·and Sonia, Tony, Lynton, Mark, Graham, Vincient, Linda and Kristin, Jen, Rob, Russ, Greg', Peter and Sam-I'thank yol!o In' particular, to John Howard for leadership, for' example and for his support-thank you. To' the members of the Long Gully and Tuggeratrong' branches, including Charles,' Peter, Simon, Daniel, Judith, Louise, Elizabeth, Maryluz and all the rest-thank you. To Sir Peter and Lady Lawler,thankyou. To the individual voters of Norfolk Island, who, I am proud to say, are in my electorate-I' thank you. I will come and visit some time. To my teachers, who always challenged me not just to learn but to seek and to make use of opportunity and to serve my community-I thank you. To my wife, Glenda, and my daughters, Amy and Lorena, who are here tonight-you are my greatest inspiration. Glenda, thank you for all your courage and all your love. I love you always. To Amy and Lorena-through my work here I will leave a better Australia for you, that you, too, will have a future. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: to the clerk of the House and to the Serjeant-atArms, thank you for the assistance provided by all your staff. As public servants they set a wonderful example and I thank them for all their assistance. As only those who sit here in this House could know, in those dark and low moments of a campaign, if you have got any faith you say a prayer. My prayers were directed to Australia's Mother Mary MACKillop and Blessed Marcellin Champagnet. In honouring a promise, I said I would speak about them tonight, so I will. As my Aunty Carmel wrote to me and said, 'With your mother and Mother Mary Mac Killopon your side, how could you fail?' Mother Mary MACKillop was an Australian who knew that education and faith are the keys to equality and preached an end to isolation as well as equality for women and children. In fact, an exhibition will be staged in this House about her next week. Blessed Marcellin Champagnet was the founder of the Marist Brothers whose school, Marist College, Pearce, I attended. He also founded an order devoted to faith and education. I honour and thank you both. Most importantly, I thank the people of t-e electorate of Canberra who chose me as the messenger of their needs and their feelings. I am proud of you as an electorate-not the least for what you have done for me, but what you have done for yourselves and all of mainstream Australia in seeking to establish a return to acceptable standards of government. To the people of the electorate of Canberra who accepted a candidate with a respect for life and experience in both the public and private sectors, someone who has lived with you and knows you and believes in you-I thank you. To the government I say that the messages of the Canberra by-election are clear. They are that mainstream Australia wants standards--of personal behaviour, of parliamentary language and of good government. It is about families and their needs, as individuals and as communities. It is about a fair go for all. It is about encouragement, not regulation and restraint. It is about opportunity. It is about vision and it is all about the future. It is about being in touch with real Australians, mainstream Australians. I would like to conclude this my maiden speech in this House by dispelling a few myths about three areas in which I have deep personal commitment: firstly, my home Canberra; secondly, the youth of this great country, Australia's next generation; and, most importantly of all, the Liberal Party of Australia, Australia's future and the next government of this fine nation. First, my home, Canberra, the place where I live: I am happy to have lived here for the past 26 years. I choose to stay and to raise my familyÂ· here. It is the place in which critical decisions are made about the future of this nation. There is only one thing to say: it is not a Labor town. No more needs to be said on that. Here I stand as a Liberal member of the House of Representatives. I intend to represent the people of Canberra in this place for many, many years.",85
229,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,Many happy returns.,89
230,Mr SMYTH,COMMITTEES,"Thank you, Sir. I have a vested interest in Australia's youth not only as the father of twin daughters, who are here tonight, but also as a proud Australian who has ambition for this nation. I firmly believe that the creation of opportunities and the creation of jobs for our kids hold one of the keys to our success. We all know that youth unemployment is one of our major problems in this country, and Canberra is not immune. Surely, those on both sides of this House would agree with me when I say that this is not good enough. I want people to understand that the majority of people want to work. They want selfesteem. They want to improve their lifestyles, their opportunities and to make something of themselves. They cannot do this without jobs. Our kids need to know that there is a future for them, something to look forward to. As the member for Canberra I intend to work and lobby this parliament to give families and our kids hope for the future. Finally, I want to talk about the Liberal Party. To do this I must say something of myself. I am a 35-year-old husband and father of two. Immediately before my career change into parliament, I was a public servant in this city and proud to be one. I have a mortgage, like most Australians, and I know what it is like to struggle. The slogan we used during the campaign-'He's one of us'--could not have been more apt. I am honestly an ordinary Australian who understands and has lived with the problems that face mainstream Australians. I have great faith in God. I am of Irish Catholic heritage. I am also a member of the Liberal Party. So often I have heard that the Labor Party is the party of the social conscience, the party of the people, the party of ordinary Australians. I fall into this category and the Labor Party has never held any interest for me. Its ideology has never appealed to me. I want my children to get ahead. I want them to have opportunities. I want them to have jobs. I believe that the Liberal Party of Australia will create the environment in which Australians, both young and old, can achieve their individual potential. The Liberal Party 1995 consists of a broad cross-section of Australian society. It represents all Australians. Its doors are open to all those who want a better future for themselves, for their lies and for their great nation. Opposition members-Hear, hear!",89
231,Mrs CROSIO,COMMITTEES,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (6.13 p.m.)-I commend the member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) on his first speech in the House. I would remind him that some of us do have things in common. I happen to be the mother of twin daughters as well. Also, as the mother of three children, the grandmother of six children and with the seventh on the way, I remind him that we are well aware of what the family is all about. I appreciate his concerns and I am sure I will hear much more about them in the future. I also remind the member for Canberra, as many of his colleagues will, that it will probably be the only time in his life when he will be able to make a speech in this House without appropriate interjection and to which all members come into listen. I am proud to be here tonight speaking on behalf of our government and the budget that has been presented for 1995-96. It is a pleasure to have this opportunity to speak here tonight on the achievements of our federal Labor government. When one looks through this budget, the many and varied benefits it offers the Australian community are only too obvious. In my electorate of Prospect, I know my constituents appreciate the initiatives taken, whether it be the increased financial assistance to families, the streamlining measures in the social security arena, the improvements in the immigration procedures or further studies into Badgerys Creek. But the budget's most striking feature is its efficiency in disbursing public money in the most equitable and fairest manner possible. There is no doubt that the whole process surrounding this budget and its lead-up makes for a very busy time. Amid the flurry of activity-where words like 'trade-off, 'leaks' and 'bids' and all sorts of economic jargon in were commonplace-there may be a tendency for the public at large to overlook what the budget is really about. The budget is one part of the whole process of government and fami- represents a major economic, social and political statement encompassing just about all government policy that can be expressed in money terms. Realistically, budgets are about jobs, markets, prices, quality of life and, above all, people. Our government knows that it cannot please everyone. Commentators from academia, the media and the opposition will invariably level some sort of criticism. This year we have received flak for delivering a so-called election budget. But surely we must acknowledge that governments do not work in political vacuums. Our federal Labor government has concentrated on enhancing the quality of life for Australians. It has sought to create jobs, to improve living standards and to increase financial assistance for families, especially those on low incomes. The government has also addressed the problems associated with an ageing population. It has developed a national agenda for women, it has secured better work force entitlements for people with disabilities and it has ensured that environmental issues have high priority. As a fluid and ongoing document and process, this budget simply contin-es that framework. In the area of social security, for example, we examine demographic trends, the changing nature of work and the much greater degree of variability and flexibility in people's family structures, care roles and life patterns, making judgments about when and where people most need assistance. Take the case of families. Presently, in designing assistance for a broad range of families, we attempt to judge when people will require help. One such example is the additional family payment-or AFP as it is referred to which is paid in accordance with a rate schedule that varies with the age of the child. We have endeavoured to be innovative and flexible. One very worthwhile social security initiative introduced last year is the payment facility for unemployed people. This takes the form of an advance on their entitlement which they might use perhaps to purchase something needed in order to assist them to find work. Feedback about this measure shows that it has been overwhelmingly successful. Budget measures as we have here tonight build upon the many significant reforms already in place. This year's budget contains a whole host of measures that are bound to have positive effects in my electorate and will be significant in meeting not only the needs of the Prospect community with its high proportion of aged pensioners, recipients of DSS payments and large multicultural population but also the demands and needs of Australia in general. In my electorate, for instance, many social security reforms will make payments more responsive and targeted to customers' needs and will improve service delivery and payment arrangements for families and pensioners. Integrating the basic family payment and the additional family payment into one single payment and combining the assessment and review processes for family payment and child-care assistance will streamline payment applications. These sorts of changes are particularly important in an electorate-again, I emphasise-such as mine which has a high number of families with young children. I might elaborate for the House that, according to the 1991 census, of the 50 New South Wales seats, only 11 have more young residents aged five and under than my electorate. Some 24.9 per cent of the residents in my electorate are aged between zero and 14 years. The jobsearch allowance and news tart allowance will now be merged into one payment. It is a logical move. It is also logical to provide pensioners with quick access to money for emergencies via an advance of up to $500 on their pensions. The maternity allowance for new mothers will have significance for those women who are presently in the work force but whose places of work do not allow for maternity allowance provisions. Along with providing common sense policies and programs, the government has got it right in getting financial assistance to those who really need it. Make no mistake, that result does not just happen out of the blue. It is the product of careful government analysis and careful government planning. I believe that the centrepiece of this year's budget is the government's two-part plan to increase national savings. It will have a substantial long-term positive effect on our nation. I am referring of course to the provision of Australia's first genuine long-term private savings program through employee superannuation. Comparing the government's moves to promote savings with anything the Liberal coalition would implement is, in itself, an interesting exercise. On 16 May in the Bulletin, journalist Laurie Oakes said: While the budget shows the government is addressing the key issue [of savings], the opposition under John Howard is off on another track; the tax track. Howard's promised family tax package, for example, will not be easy to structure in a way that slots responsibly into an effort to increase national savings. It is, in a sense, irrelevant to the main .game and an impediment to it. I have no doubt that the budget's superannuation savings initiative will be well received everywhere. Again, my area is no exception. The three per cent superannuation levy is to apply to all workers with salaries up to $46,000 per annum. Many people in my area will qualify to receive a matching payment of up to $1,000 from the federal government. Moves in the superannuation area recognise Australia's fast growing pool of temporary and casual workers and the radical changes experienced in the employment market. Moreover, this plan can be viewed as one which is addressing problems and disadvantages faced by many women who take low paid casual jobs which allow them to fit in with their family commitments but which do not offer the benefits of full-time work. My electorate has a high number of women workers in that category. CES figures reveal that the majority of women in my electorate are either part-time or casual workers and that the growth in jobs is in the service sector, which employs predominantly part-time and casual women workers. These people will be eligible to receive a matching contribution from the government that is more than three per cent of their own salary. All of these women earn less than average weekly earnings. So, if a person contributes more than three per cent of salary, it will be matched by the government up to that level of three per cent of average weekly earnings. As the representative of a very multicultural electorate, I appreciate and applaud the government's campaign to encourage employers to check work rights and immigration status of prospective employees. Currently, up to 64 per cent of people overstaying their Australian visas are working illegally. This employment awareness campaign run by the Departmen- of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs since 1991 has been very successful. A survey last year of employers found that more than 90 per cent wanted continued federal government assistance in identifying illegal workers. The federal budget has allocated $709,000 to continue the campaign during 1995-96. It is my personal belief that available jobs in our country must go to the people who are entitled to them. There is another group that the government has addressed. It is a group that we tend to overlook: the carers-the unpaid workers, the unsung heroes, and there are many of them out there. I never cease to be amazed by the high level of unpaid work carried out every day in our communities by people who devote their time to caring for others. I offer them my heartfelt praise. It is difficult to gain accurate figures on the number of carers because it is an area where people have just got on with it and have not been particularly vocal in seeking help. The enormous contribution made by the carers to the community will now be recognised under the number of budget changes to be implemented. I am proud to say that these include the removal of the requirement that carers live in the same or adjacent home of a care recipient to be eligible for carer pension. This will apply from July 1996. As well, from March 1996, eligibility for carer pension will be extended to include carers of people who, while they may not be pensioners themselves, are also not wealthy and hence cannot afford to pay for a carer. Up until now, only people who have been caring for a pensioner or beneficiary have been eligible for a carer pension. Along with the direct financial benefits to carers, some $10 million has been earmarked in this budget for the carers' support strategy with some funds enabling state carers associations to provide counselling, information kits and assistance to individual carers. Included in the budget are funds to develop information for carers from non-English speaking backgrounds. That the government is to undertake a thorough review of existing programs and policies in caring illustrates that it is serious about addressing problems associated with the aged and people with disabilities. In our rapidly changing society, few individuals and families remain untouched by workplace change. We are all familiar throughout the developed world with changes brought about by structural and technological innovations. Recognising these problems, the government has sought to integrate employment, education and training; create job opportunities; and, through training initiatives, improve work force skills. We see in the budget that flinding for higher education has been increased. From 1983 it has gone from $3 billion to over billion in 1996, representing an increase over 65 per cent. Since 1983 student numbers have increased by over 70 per cent to 600,000 finishing year 12. The government has made a substantial investment in universito ties and TAPE colleges because it acknowledges their role in the intellectual, economic and social d-velopment of our nation. As I said earlier, this budget is about fairness and equity. In that vain, Austudy will no longer be paid to the residents who choose not to become Australian citizens. Eligibility will .be tightened to ensure that it is paid families most in need. This will ensure some families will have to provide evidence of their need for government assistance for their student children. The key element is all. about creating a system that recognises human diversity and the need choice. I ask: does the coalition really understand what being in government is about? It is just a series of well laid out simple tasks. operate in a fluid framework. We operate according toÂ·Â·current social requirements demands,but we do not take the. easy and options mooted by the Leader of the Opposiadequate tion . (Mr Howard) such as cutting taxes. Placed in the government's position, would th- opposition .have chosen cutbacks in services that help the poor while opposing tax rises that affect the rich? The short answer that we do not - now what the opposition so. would do. What do we use as a guide? Is it its proposal to - ut$18Q,000 from the'jobstart allo:wance by tightening the activity test hence throwing thousands of people off welfare agencies, or is it its plan to reduce age of a child for which a parent can be eligible for the sole parent pension depriving needy parents of that pension? Are comments from the coalition's industrial relations spokesman supporting harsh policies for workers that would leave them to fend for themselves an indication of coalition policies? We do not know. That is where the Keating Labor government has it all over the opposition. We have been prepared to tackle the more sophisticated and difficult issues. We have grappled with $5 the new issues such as Mabo and Aboriginal of land rights and the need to redefine Commonwealth-state relationships. I am proud to be some part of a government which places such emphasis on providing high quality services such a wide spectrum of society. It was also announced in the budget that an allocation of some $762 million would be provided for the new Sydney West airport's development and associated transport infrastructure, which would include funds to cover further acquisition of the airport site and noise affected properties, upgrading local access to roads and preliminary design work, airport that development costs, state of the art CAA more facilities and road construction. Certainly the overall development of Badgerys Creek site in 1986 following a very thorough study was entered into with a high for degree of community involvement. This and the supplement to the draft environmental impact study was made publicly available in not December of 1985 and had been the product We of public consultation and involvement. As well, the final EIS was assessed by the reland evant Commonwealth and state environmental soft agencies . and endorsed by them as being .. I say: that was then and this is now-1995. That is why since my election to federal parliament in 1990 I have constantly urged our federal government to re-examine and update the issues outlined in the 1985 is environment statement. I will continue to do After wide ranging representations I recently met with the Minister for Transport (Mr and 'Brereton) and informed him of my residents' onto concerns. I am keen to ensure that our the government's decision in this critical and sensitive area takes full account of the views, concerns and expectations of my constituents. I therefore welcome the federal government's decision that additional environmental assessments be carried out to supplement the 1985 EIS for Badgery's Creek. I welcome the move that new envimnmental management plans are to be prepared for both the construction and operation of the new airport, at a cost of some $23 million. Supplementary studies will involve the preparation of aircraft noise contours and air and water quality monitoring programs to ensure that residents of the area are protected from the airport's impact. This 1995 budget commits $350 million for additional land acquisition, planning and construction to Sydney west. This is in addition to the $152 million already spent on airport site acquisition, and a further $250 million will be made available for new roadworks. But I urge the planners to get it right. As I have said in this parliament before on behalf of the people I represent, now is the time to implement correct planning procedures, not when it is too late. We want consideration of people's full needs. We want a continued guarantee from our government that when construction begins it will be done efficiently and with all the aspects-'---especially the potential impact on people's lives-taken into consideration. ,Planners must take account of the fa<::t that people in suburbs near the new airport site purchased properties years ago, never contemplating that an airport might one day be built nearby. Many local residents years ago made a conscious choice to live in the quiet rural areas of my electorate. Others who have moved in there since the 1975 subdivision began would not have had the slightest inkling that an, airport could be constructed in the area and that they would end up under a flight path. I strongly advocate a position where that choice is not taken away from those people. What is planned and built today must be able to take us well and truly through the 21st century. However, I again urge planners to think about the implications each time a heavily laden aircraft flies low over Sydney's most densely populated western region. They must give particular consideration to take-off and landing in the very early hours of the morning and the impact this will have on residents' lives. I wonder if the planners and experts realise the noise generated by aircraft landing or taking off at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. That is what we now must as a government consider. All of these issues are further difficult issues to be faced by our government. I have full confidence that these issues will be faced and that this budget as outlined will certainly take us not only to an election but to the formulation of government in the 1996 period.",90
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Andrew)Order! Before I call the honourable member for Wentworth, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies. MrTHOMSON (Wentworth) (6.33 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker, 34 years ago when I was born in Melbourne, Australia was a nation brimming with confidence. People like my parents were blessed with a faith in things as they were; in the institutions that nurtured and protected them. They were relaxed about the changes th!lt were happening around them, happening at a pace to which they felt ,equal. Government at that time was behaving by and large sensibly. The tax rate for a family with two children living on the average wage was 15.8 per cent. Indeed, the income tax act was a sensible 385 pages long. Asia. was just emerging from its colonial age and Singapore was two years, old. That was the situation when I lay staring at the walls of that maternity ward. Now, as I utter my first few phrases in this parliament, things are vastly different. ' I invite you to look at Australia now. That same family pays not 15 per cent tax but 35 per cent. Every hour of every day our national debt grows by $3 million, illustrated again with this morning's announcement. Asia, in this borderless world, is for many of our citizens a terrifying thing. So on behalf of all Australians my age and younger I say to our government, our High Court, our trade uniOhS, our academics, our bureaucrats, our business chiefs and the editors of our' news media: look what you have done to our future. Look how you have feasted at our expense. I feel entitled to protest that, whereas my parents were taught to believe in things, I and my generation were instructed to martyr ourselves, to doubt and to evangelise a new creed of resentment and self-aggrandisement. We Australians are, as a result of that generational change, an increasingly enfeebled country. But, before considering at greater length the problems and predicaments of Australia, a member of this House must first see to the needs of his or her electorate and to the welfare and the prosperity of its constituents. Despite some radical boundary changes, Wentworth in 1990 has largely retained its postwar flavour. It encompasses great affluence. Australia's most expensive residential real estate lies within the boundaries of Wentworth. It also encompasses many examples of grinding poverty. It is blessed with a diversity and with great historical depth. History in all its forms exists in Wentworth, from the RSLs to the survivors of the Jewish Holocaust. Only 57 per cent of Wentworth's residents were born in Australia. Another aspect of Wentworth is its nurturing of what I call the old life and the new life without conflict occurring between the two. It always gives me great joy to see how the traditions of an old beach culture still flourish at that great institution, the Bondi Icebergs. Members of that club-men and, recently, women-are intensely proud of their history as well as being proud of their attitudes. May they ever flourish. Likewise at the top of Bondi, up from the beach, lies the home in New South Wales of orthodox Judaism, at the Yeshiva Centre in Flood street. There on a Saturday morning you can see the faithful on their way to worship, determined by their costume and by their practices to preserve a tradition that is many centuries old, older of course than the Icebergs but just as precious. Surrounding these two institutions that represent the old life exists the new Australia, the Australia of different lifestyle and of radical thought. Indeed, from Double Bay to Bondi Junction and down to Bondi Beach you can see change happening as fast as it happens anywhere else in the nation. These two AustraIias, the new and the old, coexist quite happily. It illustrates to me that we, the people of Wentworth, of whatever creed or background or culture or income, are not in as much conflict as our news media might suggest to us. The same can be said of the rest of Australia-that we have a decency that is not to be found in any other country on this planet. That said, it gives me cause for some shame and certainly anger to see how the synagogues and the Jewish schools of Wentworth require such enormous security measures, including even guards during school hours. Representing such a community requires of me. a constant vigilance to see that this shame of racial or religious based attack is never ignored by government. But, equally, this issue requires from us in this House immense wisdom in pursuing effective measures. In introducing myself to the community leaders in Wentworth, I found only goodwill and a frankness free of any partisan taint in any of the discussions I had about this or other difficult issues. I must say that I cannot imagine a better group of 'people with whom to consider such a difficult problem. I pledge to do my best to represent their interests with vigour. In doing that, I ask the government tonight to try to replace stridency with quiet and reasoned discussion, now that debate on the proposed racial vilification legislation has begun again. It is hard to imagine anything more damaging to the precious fabric of Australian society than for a debate on such a sensitive issue to become tainted with spite or, even worse, with electoral calculation. I feel pressed to warn the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch): in this task, you are dealing with the physical welfare and the lives of many good and decent people, so do not play with those lives for motives that are anything less than utterly sincere, because to do so would be to perpetrate a greater evil than the one we all seek to suppress. I have the unusual distinction of having spent more of my life working outside Australia-in particular, Japan and other parts of Asia-than within it. I went to school in Taiwan for a short time, and I attended university in Tokyo-indeed, the same university as awarded this country's Prime Minister (Mr Keating) a qualification last week. He was given a Doctor of Laws, which was much higher than I could ever aspire to! I spent my time slaving away in the classroom, and I did not notice him there. Having said that, Japanese and Mandarin are my other languages. Because of that, I hold very strong views about Australia's relationship with Asia. In reality, it is far too complicated a subject to deal with other than at great length, because Asia is so diverse, with so many different languages and cultures within it. Instead, in the current public debate about this topic, I see that relationship as a code phrase for Australia's choices in the next few years. It is plain to me that we have lost most of our sovereignty . We have lost it through profligate government and through bureaucracy, the trade union movement and news media that are subversive to our long-term interests. But we do have some small scope left for making choices about our future. If we must focus on this relationship as a means of making those choices, then so be it. We suffer from a chronic balance of payments deficit, which was illustrated once again this morning. It is now so large as to imperil our future. Our currency gets cheaper as the years pass, as does our reputation and our safety with it. When speaking of approaches to our trading problems and this chronic financial deficit, we must never forget that our future and our fate as a trading nation is really determined in the mediumand long term by what we teach our children in Australian schools. In that sense, education policy matters equally or at least as much as taxation or industrial relations policy. It would be nice to see that aspect of government dealt with more sensibly and at greater length in the media. When we hear our government urge us to sell more goods and services to Asia-I assume that is what integration with the region means-I say we should not look to Asia and to its markets but to ourselves and to the products we produce, the way we produce them and their cost and quality. In looking to ourselves, we must confront some ugly truths. We are no longer an economic or commercial society. We are a political society. As such, our future in this region and in this age does not really exist. If we continue to favour politics over commerce, if we continue to prefer screeching minorities and political parasites over small business people, risk takers and Australian workers, we will soon become little more than the tenant farmer of Asia, or perhaps a larger version of Hawaii, with beaches and souvenirs and a place for honeymooners. Perhaps this will hit home only when BHP is foreign owned. Already much of our media is foreign owned, as are much of our large manufacturing businesses. Maybe when the chairman of BHP carries a foreign passport and cannot sing the first verse of Waltzing Matilda will the devastation of Australian sovereignty become truly apparent. This loss of control over our destiny is, of course, more than financial. In terms of oUf culture, we really have little control over what the television broadcasters pour into our homes every night or, even worse, what Americanisms affect our languages, laws and news media. We are eager customers of Hollywood, and our own film industry is starved of capital because we as Australians cannot even save enough money to fund our own government any more, let alone our creative minds. But there is another sort of sovereignty, and that too is rapidly ebbing away. I call it 'personal sovereignty'. I define it as the feeling an individual Australian has about how much he or she is in control of his or her life. The answer these days is, of course, not very much. Since I became an adult, the rhetoric of government has tended to divide us into large groups. You all know those familiar labels-the banks, the media, the unions, the major parties and the business community. The trouble is we Australians feel not the slightest affinity with these groups in our daily lives. They are in power, not us. We feel disconnected so, when things have gone wrong, we have started to lash out and blame them for all our troubles-safe in the knowledge that someone else will payor that the welfare state will always provide for us. This increasing reluctance to take responsibility for our own lives is the result of this personal sovereignty gradually crumbling away. I also think it is at the root of the incredible cynicism that Australians now bear towards their government. It certainly makes it very difficult to forge national goals. When you ask Australians why they hold their government in such utter contempt, you receive manifold examples. My conviction is that the electorate is finally disgusted with the stupidity of government. We cannot respect an institution that continues to delude itself. For example, when a current account deficit figure of over $2 billion a month is announced, the Prime Minister describes it as a 'good figure'. It is a terrible figure. Next, we learn that our unemployment numbers are determined not by counting the number of people receiving unemployment benefits but by a random survey. The person who has been lucky enough to enjoy one hour of paid employment in two weeks is classified as being employed. This is a farce, but you must say it is now the way of modem Australian. In the same fashion, it is simply false to measure growth in our GNP without subtracting increases in our national indebtedness. Really, the only economic growth that matters is the real rate of growth. I am sorry to say that that might be too radical a proposition for the government these days but, for those of us who believe that domestic democracy and honesty go hand in hand, it is plain common sense. So restoring some faith in government requires of us in this chamber a huge leap in the quality of what we debate. We must not shirk this task. We must never ignore reality outside this House. I hope I can contribute in some way to that, and I hope that Australians are not so poisoned by what has been done to them by this House that they no longer respect leaders who are brave enough to be frank with them. That is how you restore their personal sovereignty-by telling them the blunt and sometimes uncomfortable truth. In many ways, my predecessor fits that description. John Hewson was a brave man, and a man of unusual personal fortitude. I believe that history will show that this parliament was lucky to have known him as a member. I hope that in years to come Australians will remember him with gratitude. Indeed, any new member of this House must feel gratitude in large measure. In my case, the list is long: my family, my friends, my wife, my colleagues in Australia, Japan and lately even in Scotland and my fellow soldiers in the cause of the Liberal Party, one of whom-Brian Briers-passed away during our campaign. He was a very good and decent man. Indeed, the Liberal Party is a changing creature. If Kooyong and Wentworth are now souvlaki and sushi, then I think we can say that the old order changeth. That leaves me to conclude with an appeal to this House, a call I would like to make on behalf of the multitude of hard working and hopeful Australians: we need no more grand schemes, glossy presentations or glittering launches of policy; we need quiet, vigorous, nuts-and-bolts reform achieved with long-term goals in mind. In taxation, in education, in industrial relations-in government everywhere-we need that reform now if we are to avoid a rendezvous with disaster.",94
233,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"I congratulate the members of the House, the honourable member for Canberra (Mr Smyth) and the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Thomson), who have made their maiden speeches in connection with Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1995-96. I am sure that the congratulations which they have received from their colleagues and will receive from other members of the parliament, members of their family, friends and constituents have been and will be well earned. I am sure that they are very conscious of the importance of having the opportunity to serve in this chamber, to serve in the national parliament. I am sure that the contributions which they will make during the period of time that they are members of this parliament will be satisfying, useful and valuable. Each the budget debate provides members with the opportunity to canvass as widely as they wish across all of the areas of public policy. It is appropriate that there are occasions like a budget debate when that opportunity is provided to members. There are plenty of issues which members of parliament seek to pursue when debates of this kind are available to them, but I want to concentrate my remarks on the budget itself and some of the concerns that I have about the budget. I know that to a very large extent those people who operate in what we refer to as the markets, tend to look at the bottom line of the budget. Let me say at the outset that I am not one of those people who have a fetish about budget deficits or budget surpluses. I have sufficient experience with government budgets of all persuasions and at all levels of government to know that a surplus or a deficit and the size of a surplus or a deficit are not sarily matters of great significance or as great significance as they are sometimes accorded. For example, for this corning financial year, the surplus will be $718 million, according to the forecast in the budget papers. It was not so very long ago when the government was indicating that by 1996-97 we would expect to get the budget into a position where the deficit would be equal to about one per cent of GDP. Then, on the basis of additional estimates that were made and changes which occurred in the national economy and in Australia's relationship with other countries, it looked as though it would be possible to balance the budget by 1996-97. What the government has achieved is a surplus one year earlier. As I say, the surplus is in excess of $700 million. I know that comments have been made about the surplus. There have been references, for example, to what some people choose to call creative budgeting. I see nothing wrong with members of the opposition making claims of that kind. It is very likely that were in opposition we would be making similar observations. There have been references made, for example, to the sale of government assets and the fact that the sale of government assets then appears in the budget as a negative outlay. Some people have tried to make an issue of that. The fact that it accords with both IMF and United Nations standards indicates that, if the opposition were in government at present and if it were pursuing in a similar way the types of objectives which this government is pursuing and if it were constructing a budget on that basis, its budget would have been very similar to this government's budget. The opposition would have treated the sale of assets in precisely the same way. I will have more to say about that because I have some reservations about the structure of the budget, and I would like to make some comments about how I believe the structure of the budget could be improved. But there are other elements that the opposition refers to as creative budgeting-not only the sale of government assets but also necesthe bringing forward of the repayment of loans by state governments. That has an impact on the bottom line of the budget. There is also the fact that governments in various ways are able to shift particular items out of the budget into, for example, government business enterprises or into authorities or agencies of various kinds. That does not necessarily imply, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, that those items of outlay disappear. It is just that they appear in a different guise. That contributes to the appearance of the bottom line and the general impression which the budget can provide. Another element of it is when governments require the government business enterprises to increase the size of the dividends which they pay to the government. So each of those has an impact on what we refer to as the bottom line of the budget. Procedures of that kind do not cause me any concern. I do not think they should cause anyone any particular concern. It is important how the national community, and particularly the economic community, perceives the if we budget and it is also important how the national community perceives the intentions of the government and the determination of the government to achieve certain objectives. I do not think there would be anyone who could reasonably claim-and, if they were to claim, they would not do so with any credibility-that successive Labor governments since 1983 have been anything but fiscally responsible. I think for three or four years since that time cumulative budget surpluses have amounted to something like $18 billion. That was the first time that any national government had been able to budget for a surplus since the Commonwealth of Australia commenced to exist. I think that proves, more than many of the other indicators could have, the extent to which a federal Labor government was determined to be fiscally responsible, was determined to be fiscally stringent and was determined to examine all of the elements of the budget to ensure that any unnecessary outlays, any unnecessary forms of expenditure, were taken from it. When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) introduced the budget, he made the point that budgeting for a surplus of $718 million represented a turnaround in the budget outcome of $12.9 billion, almost $13 billion, since last year. have indicated that there are some elements of the budget which helped to explain that. But there was a net fiscal tightening involved in this year's budget of at least $3,000 million. That was not a matter that went unnoticed by the market and it was not a matter which the market failed to respond to favourably. . It has also been recognised in the community that on the surface this year's budget will not be able to make any significant difference to the current account deficit. I am not the only observer who has commented over a number of years that the current account deficit is the single most important problem which this government faces. This year the total of that deficit will be in excess of $20,000 million, which means that the Australian community and the Australian economy are dependent upon the savings of other countries to that extent. If, instead of our borrowing funds of that order to finance our external imbalance, overseas investors had been investing in Australia in equity, then each year the current account deficit would be lower than it is. One of the main reasons why the current account deficit continues at such a high level is that successive current account deficits in the past have contributed towards that overseas indebtedness on the part of the whole Australian community to the extent at present of about $160,000 million. If that $160,000 million, for example, were borrowed at an average interest rate of 10 per cent, there would be a debt servicing charge against the national economy of $16 billion every year. That is precisely why we are in the present position. A very large proportion of our annual current account deficit represents the cost of servicing loans which were necessary to finance current account deficits in the past. It has been indicated, quite correctly, by government spokesmen that the current account deficit appears now to be levelling out, but it is still a matter of very considerable concern to the government and continues to be the single most important problem that we face. The surplus of over $700 million I referred I to is also sometimes referred to as the headline budget. Very often the observation is made that the actual amount is within itself of little significance. I endorse that comment, except to qualify it by saying that inherent in the bottom line in the budget is an expression of the intention of the federal government in its fiscal responsibilities generally. One particular matter of concern to me with the budget is that we persist with the construction of what is essentially a current budget; that is, almost a cash accounting budget, indicating total revenue which has been received and total outlays. The difference between those two totals is the resultant budget deficit or budget surplus. I believe it would be a more appropriate approach to budgeting generally if we were to have a current budget to deal with all of those current revenue and current outlay items, and a capital budget which would be concerned with the purchase and the disposal of assets and various types of investments which are undertaken by governments. One particular concern which members of the government, as well as perhaps members of the opposition, have expressed from time to time is that, while the public sector, because of its nature and special responsibilities, should be responsible to a very large extent for the provision of national capital investment, national capital infrastructure, there has been a significant deficiency in the extent to which all levels of government in Australia have responded to that special responsibility. For example, recent figures on the US economy indicate that public sector investment over recent years has been negative; that is, the US government has either disposed of assets or allowed assets to run down to a greater extent than the new investment being undertaken in national infrastructure. When that happens, I believe the indications are serious indeed. That is why we need to ensure that national governments in particular take on the responsibility for ensuring that all of that infrastructure is in place and, in effect, providing a base for the private sector to be able to carry out the responsibilities which we see it as having. In the budget papers we do distinguish between aggregates for current items and capital items, but we do not distinguish between a current budget and a capital budget, as I believe we should. Another disadvantage of our failure to do that is that new investment-which should not be seen as a profligate financial exercise being undertaken by government-is seen as a charge against current revenue instead of being seen, as I believe it should be, as a charge against the continuing flow of income which it will generate into the future. As a result of including capital investment in what is essentially a current budget, the budget deficit appears to be increased. That often serves the purpose of giving a very wrong impression to those people who obÂ· serve our budget and who seek to make something not only of the structure of the budget but of the government's intentions in relation to it. I believe it would be a very useful innovation for us to introduce that change. As I said, within the budget papers at present there is a distinction made and it is possible to extract some of that information. But, for example, if you were to extract those capital items from the end of the Second World War until about the mid-1980s, then for most of those years there was no deficit at all-in fact, a surplus-despite the fact that during all of that time the budget had as its bottom line a deficit. The overall surplus during the four years towards the end of the 1980s became much more significant. I have already made reference to the fact that, during those four years when we budgeted for a surplus and achieved a surplus, we had a cumulative aggregate of those surpluses of about $18,000 million. More recently, the budget has gone into a composite deficit. If I could go back to the mid-1980s, in 1984-85, for example, there was a slight current deficit of $1 billion; in 1985-86 it was balanced; in 1986-87 there was a large surplus; and those large surpluses continued through until 1990-91. By the time we got to 1992-93, the current deficit was $10 billion, but the total deficit was $14.6 billion. By failing to separate out current items from capital items, the wrong impression is given. I know that the difference was only $4.6 billion, but that $4.6 billion did not represent current expenditure by the government; it represented capital investment by the government in the process of building that infrastructure. In 1993-94 there was practically no new capital investment, and the same was the case in 1994-95. This year the amount of capital investment is minimal when compared with the total in the current budget. I would appeal for that distinction to be made between current and capital items. (Time expired)  to speak onÂ· the 1995-96 budget, the final instalment in Labor's betrayal of the Australian people. This is another classic Keating budget-more spending, more fiddles, more promises of economic nirvana and more taxes. The appropriation bills for 1995-96 have three components. Appropriation Bill (No.1) deals with funding for the Commonwealth's programs. This bill will appropriate $31.7 billion for spending on annual programs. Appropriation Bill (No.2) deals with funding for payments to the states and capital works. The bill authorises funding of $4.3 billion. Finally, there is the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1995-96, which will authorise funding for the running of Parliament House. This bill will appropriate $144.5 millionThe. appropriation bills also make allowances for the Financial Management and Accountability Bill to be reflected in them should the Financial Management and Accountability Bill pass into law. Of course, these bills do not cover the vast majority of Commonwealth expenditure, which is dealt with via standing appropriations and does not need yearly appropriations. These bills authorise the government to spend funds on its annual programs and, as such, we will not be opposing them. But the government should not delude itself as to our view on the budget. We know this budget is yet more electoral fraud, we know this budget is cobbled together with asset sales and oneoff gimmicks to get the government to an election; and we will not let the government walk away from this. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told us that this budget would be about savings and would set in train the lift in national savings this country so desperately needs. But, as we expected, this government has shown itself to be once again not up to the task. Once again, this budget is all about rhetoric and not about action. Once again, this budget is about gimmicks and not about action. Once again, this budget is about the Prime Minister continuing his strategy of fraud with the Australian people. This country has a significant foreign debt problem. The government realises this but refuses to do anything about it. It has forecast a current account deficit of $27 billion for this year and next. The forecast deficits are unacceptably high and simply continue feeding into the ever growing mountain of foreign debt which will be the legacy of this Labor government. What we need is a strong and sustained lift in savings, both public and private. The most effective way for the government to assist in this task is to structurend ally reduce the budget deficit. What is the government's solution? To bring down a gimmick budget to get it past the next election. Responsible economic management is the last thing on Paul Keating's mind. Although the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was allowed to introduce the budget, this budget has 'Paul Keating' written all over it. There was the massaging of market expectations, saying that a surplus was too big an ask, there was the leaking of proposals to see what people thought; and then on budget night, 10 and behold, there was a small surplus-another rabbit out of the hat. But it is a hollow surplus, and everyone in this parliament, including the Prime Minister, knows it. In fact, tucked away in the back of the budget papers, the ABS tells us the real story: it is a deficit of $8.2 billion. That is because one of the main components of the government's so-called surplus is over $5.3 billion worth of asset sales. Having already taxed as much as it could in one budget, the government was so woefully short of a respectable number that it reached for asset sales. This is a perennial measure for Labor, trying to improve the figures. Given that items such as ANL and Qantas have been there for years, it does not actually intend selling very much, but it put it in there anyway. In fact, the record speaks for itself. Since 1990-91, the government has forecast asset sales of $8,075 million. The government has actually sold only $3,789 million worth of assets. After selling only $3.8 billion over the last four years, the government is trying to tell us that it will sell or achieve $53 billion this year. Who is the government trying to kid? It will not make the target, and it damn well knows it. The government is already in trouble. It has an offer for ANL, which has been listed yet again. Government members may remember this as the shipping line that it could not give away. Now somebody is willing to give cash for it. But what happens? The Maritime Union of Australia is not happy-and that is nothing unusual. It does not like the potential buyer. It is concerned that P&O may want to treat ANL as a going commercial concern and some of the union's archaic practices. No wonder the MUA is horrified at the prospect of being weaned off the taxpayers' purse. In true MUA style, it is threatening to bring the country's ports to a standstill-no matter that this will further damage our trading reputation, no matter that it will cost jobs and no matter that it will further damage the Australian economy. The MUA has never worried about these things in the past. The only thing that matters is the position of the union leaders and the highly protected position of a few hundred shipping units. I make the prediction now-and I hope that I am wrong-that ANL will not be sold to P&O. There will be another inquiry into ANL's future with some restructuring, it will be put to tender again with the government quoting some concerns about the market offer or the government will impose so many conditions that ANL will walk away from it. But the truth will be that the unions will forbid the government to go ahead with the sale. The pressure is on. Two weeks out from the budget, the first asset sale is here. Can the government make the grade? I very much doubt it. Even if the government does manage to sell anything, it will still not make any difference to national savings. All it does is to substitute public savings for private savings. So, in terms of national savings, the government has again dropped the ball by counting asset sales. But, of course, asset sales are not the only swindle. There are all the little one-offs thrown into make this year's bottom line look a little better. There is the $990 million thrown in by Wayne Goss, ostensibly for early debt retirement. There is the $107 million in extra dividends from the government GBEs. There is the reconfiguration of Telstra's equity injection worth $250 million in 1995-96. The government has tried all the tricks that it knows after 12 years of experience in playing the smoke and mirrors game. It has done everything except what was required, and that was to cut back spending. The government cannot hide from the truth. Indeed, its own budget papers have it there. On page 2 of the Treasurer's speech it says: The measures announced tonight provide a net fiscal tightening, excluding the effect of asset and early debt redemptions, of $3 billion in 199596 and $4Y2 billion in 1996-97. On the outlays side this tightening has been accomplished by a rigorous examination of all areas of government expenditure. The decisions I am announcing produce a net reduction in outlays of $700 million in 1995-96 excluding asset sales and debt redemptions. A mere $700 million. After what the government calls a rigorous assessment of expenditures, it managed to cut net outlays by a whole $700 million in a budget with outlays worth $129 billion in 1995-96. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what net outlays do once we clear away all the nonsense of asset saies and debt redemption? In 1995-96 outlays increased by 1.7 per cent in real terms, or $6.6 billion. After all the talk of calling back ministers to put them through the ERC again, this government increased spending by 1.7 per cent in real terms in 1995-96. After three years of growth, with particularly strong growth in 1994, this is all the government is still up to: spending. The government has proven itself to be incapable of controlling its spending. This government is always extolling the virtues of restraint. What it means is restraint for everyone else because it wants to go on spending. As part of this extra spending the government has, of course, thrown in a good number of election sweeteners. There is a range of measures for the family costing $93 million in 1995-96 and $747 million over four years. These include a lump sum maternity allowance worth $643 million over four years, an increase in rental assistance worth $88 million over four years and an increase in the guardian allowance for sole parents costing $117 million over three years. There is also an election slush fund called the Better Cities mark 2 worth $254 million over four years. There is the justice package costing $158 million over four years, and there are more environment initiatives worth $252 million over four years. But it does not stop there. We are not even a week out from the budget and the Prime Minister is out there making promises with other people's money. He is going to build more roads and lengthen sales runways. Given all the boasting by the Prime Minister about his headline surplus, I trust he will keep us informed as he spends the money over the next couple of months. This is a government which just cannot control its spending. That is what the problem is: it is government spending. It is not a revenue problem, as the Prime Minister claims it is and as he claimed last year. The only revenue problem we have is with a government that keeps wanting more so it can spend more. This is a traditional tax and spend Labor government, and it has proved it in this budget. Not only did it continue spending like there was no tomorrow, but it gave tax receipts a mighty kick along as well. Revenue changes announced in this budget will add $2.4 billion in tax this year, rising to $7.8 billion in extra tax in 1998-99. Company tax has gone up three per cent, raising $320 million in 1995-96, rising to $1.57 biHion in 1996-97. The Medicare levy is to increase by 0.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent. This will raise $230 million in 1995-96, rising to $280 million in 1998-99. The other big whack for families is the lift in the wholesale sales tax on cars from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. This will raise $330 million in 1995-96, rising to $405 million in 1998-99. The building industry, which is already in sharp decline, will face further hardship following an extension of the wholesale sales tax to certain building materials. This will raise $215 million in 1995-96, rising to. $290 million in 1998-99. This will lift the price of an average $100,000 home between $1;000 and $2,000. Both ordinary Australians and corporate Australia have been reminded of the flexibility of Keating tax promises. In 1993.a lower corporate tax rate was something about which Paul Keating frequently boasted. It was a key plank in making Australia more competitive and assisting in making us a centre for regional headquarters. Two years later, international competitiveness seems to be less important. The corporate tax rate has gone from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. The argument runs that companies are making good profits and Australia is a low tax country so we can lift company tax. In the first instance, it is profits which provide companies with the capacity to invest, grow and employ. When we have about 750,000 people unemployed, I personally do not think we should be reducing the capacity of companies to grow. Then of course there is the other ALP furphy that Australia is a low tax country and there is scope to lift tax. The ALP conveniently forgets to add in the compulsory superannuation levy. When we add this in, as it is equivalent to retirement arrangements in other countries, we then move up the comparative tax ladder towards midfield. When we add in the new company tax hike, the lift in indirect taxes and the employee superannuation, we climb even higher in the tax stakes. Apart from the fact that theÂ· government is misleading people with claims of being a low tax country, one should be careful when co-paring company taxes .. Prime Minister Keating has recently discovered Asia. He is now telling us that Asia is the growth engine and we should cash in on it. It would of course help if our tax arrangements were competitive. In. addition to our education levels, R&D, national infrastructure, et cetera, our tax levels will have a bearing on how competitive we are in Asia. Under the new higher company tax arrangements our companies will pay 36c in the dollar. As of 1994, comparisons of corporate taxes in Asia are: Japan, 36 per cent to 51 per cent depending on income; South Korea, 18 per cent to 32 per cent depending on income; Indonesia, 35 per cent; Singapore, 27 per cent; Malaysia, 32 per cent; Philippines, 35Â· per cent; Thailand, 30 per cent; and New Zealand, 28 per cent. We are clearly similar to Japan but higher than the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and New Zealand. In the relativities that count, and they are consistent with Paul Keating's Asia push, we are not a low tax country. Generally speaking, we are an above average taxer. As I said before, when we have 750,000 people unemployed, this lift in tax will not appear to be helping that situation at all. The domestic car industry, already starting to struggle, faces an even tougher battle with the increase in sales tax. This will add about $1,000 to the price of a new car and make it harder for people to upgrade. This will also undermine the government's environment strategy by making it harder to purchase more efficient cars. However, the greatest swindle in this budget is employee superannuation with a tax tradeoff for low income groups, The government, through these arrangements and awards, will require employees to contribute three per cent of their earnings to superannuation by the year 2000. The government will apparently make means tested superannuation contributions to match those made by employees in lieu of proceeding with the second tranche of tax cuts. Yet another Keating backflip is revealed. As for the superannuation take from employees, while low income groups in the work force may be compensated, all other employees will be worse off. Self-funded retirees will be another group that will feel the burden of this Keating backflip. They w.ere looking for tax cuts and they got nothing. Let us be quite clear: to the average person this is simply another lift in tax, but rather than hand their money to the tax office they will hand it to superannuation companies. They have no choice. The same holds true for the Medicare levy. Waiting lists continue to impede health care as more and more people desert the private health system. In the last five years 1.2 million people have dropped out of private health insurance. The level of private health cover now stands at 35.6 per 'cent, when former Minister for Health Graham Richardson labelled crisis point at 40 per cent. The verdict for the Australian people is revealed in a recent MBF-Morgan survey which showed that one in seven Australians now plans to drop private cover because of the government's latest Medicare levy rise. For every one per cent that leave, the cost to the budget is another $100 million. More people will now leave private health care, which will raise the cost of public care. Should the ALP be returned, it will again raise the Medicare levy. The standard ALP solution is not to deal with the problem; it is to just spend more money and raise taxes. One would think that after failing to solve the problem the ALP might learn from its mistakes and try some real solutions. The coalition rejects the government's use of gimmicks and asset sales to balance the books. We believe that asset sales should be used for debt retirement and the provision of worthwhile infrastructure. They should not be used for recurrent expenditure. You can sell something only once. What happens the next year when you have sold the asset but you still have spending to pay for? Asset sales simply delay the inevitable adjustmentÂ· to spending or tax, which suits the ALP because it is not solving the problem. The election of a coalition government wiil a usher in new era of government accountability and responsibility. WewiII make the budget papers more honest in regard to the actual fiscal situation. We will provide information on the structural state of the Commonwealth budget and theÂ· Commonwealth own purpose outlays. The budget papers will also include information on contingent liabilities, such as Commonwealth superannuation liabilities, and they will give a clearer picture of obligations to the budget. The Labor government has again letÂ· the Australian people down. Not only has it committed outright fraud by breaking clear commitments it gave not to raise taxes but also it has failed in. the task. of economic management. The poor state of national savings is a critical problem that Australia must overcome. Failure to address this will confine Australia to lower growth and higher unemployment. This government has comprehensively failed to address the task. It has not dealt with the structural budget deficit and it has not lifted national savings to the extent that it should have over the economic cycle. All it has done is to run up government spending and debt, which now has a $9.4 billion price tag from public debt interest. It has now cobbled together another budget to get it past health the election. (Time expired) ADJOURNl\1ENT",97
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Mr Jenkins)Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question:. That the House do now adjoum. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",104
235,Mr ALDRED,COMMITTEES,"Deakin) (7.31 p.m.}--In this adjournment debate, I wish to continue where I left off in the grievance debate about the Hindmarsh Island affair. In a letter to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) on 12 May 1994, Doreen Kartinyeri claimed: I have always known about the stories associated with Raminyeri and Ngarrindjeri women's business but until recently I didn't know the exact place that they referred to. My grandmother Sally Kartinyeri, my Great Aunt Laura Kartinyeri and my Auntie Rose Kropinyeri passed on these stories about women's business to me. Doreen Kartinyeri's grandmother, Sally Kartinyeri, was from Poonindee, hundreds of miles from Hindmarsh Island. Like her Auntie Rose Kropinyeri, her grandmother died many years ago. Great-aunt Laura Kartinyeri says she knows nothing of the women's business, which raises the question: where did Doreen Kartinyeri get this new information? None of the women now claiming the knowledge have matrilineal links to Hindmarsh Island and only one has a Ngarrindjeri mother. Women have also been bused in from Point Pearce on Yorke Peninsula to swell the numbers. Then we have Professor Cheryl Saunders, darling of the Labor left and wife of prominent member of the Victorian Labor opposition and former minister, Ian Baker. It has to be asked: did Professor Saunders question Ms Kartinyeri about her genealogy? Did she establish Ms Kartinyeri' s credibility to be sole custodian of this women's business? The answer is no. Saunders met with only 35 Aboriginal women opposed to the bridge, making no attempt to speak to the hundreds of Ngarrindjeri women in the lower Murray region. No attempt was made to go to Point MCLeay and she did not go and see N ana Laura Kartinyeri, Queen of the Ngarrindjeri. Whom are we to believe? A group of women so respected that one is selected to represent the Salvation Army in London or another that is actually led by men? Urban terrorist Doug Millera, who accompanied Michael Mansell to Libya in the late 1980s to seek 'economic sanctions by Libya against Australia and funding for black causes here' was one of those men. A letter to Minister Tickner dated 22 July 1994 from Goolwa resident Mr John MCHughes details a conversation he had with Mr Millera at the Corio Hotel where Millera walks in with his right arm raised and boasts: I have the power to stop or build the bridge. Millera went on to say: If a bridge is built, (with) every pylon they drive into the river bed he would feel enormous pain going through his body. He said I would not understand this. I don't think he realised I too was an Aboriginal. The conversation went on: During the 1950s I worked for the contractor who built the approaches for the existing ferry. I personally drove every pylon down into the river bed as I was the piledriver. I never experienced any pain whatsoever while driving the pylons in and I worked there from start to finish. Doug Millera is the same man that Dorothy Wilson maintains was one of the men who on 6 May 1994 said, 'It's up to you women to stop the bridge now' and proceeded to point out a map of Hindmarsh Island and liken it to 'women's private parts'. The claims of five credible women must be believed. The minister's decision, based on a flawed report, must be fully investigated. I seek leave to table statutory declarations from Mrs Dulcie Wilson and Mrs Dorothy Wilson and letters from Mrs Doreen Kartinyeri and Mr John MCHughes to Minister Tickner, plus some press articles. Leave not granted. Hirst, Mr Lloyd",104
236,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITTEES," Mr Lloyd Hirst is a constituent of mine. He is well into his 70s. In 1970, Mr Lloyd Hirst purchased a manually operated masonry brick-block making machine capable of making 4,500 blocks per day. Ten years later, to make the production cost effective, Mr Hirst and his staff had upgraded the same machine to produce 60 bricks per minute or 25,200 bricks for a seven-hour day. In the early 1980s, due to deregulation of the transport industry by the government-a Labor government, I might add-Boulder Brick and Tile established an export market in Perth and obtained several large contracts some 600 kilometres from Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars was borrowed from the Commonwealth Development Bank towards a $650,000 expansion program to take advantage of this market against the security of Boulder Brick and Tile's assets of over $2 million. Some 12 months later, Boulder Brick and Tile was $100,000 short to finish the sion and applied to the CDB, the Commonwere wealth Development Bank, for funding. 'Whilst the application was proceeding', Hirst said, 'we became $50,000 in arrears the existing loans.' Without rejecting the application, and without discussion with principal director and guarantor, the CDB issued a demand for payment of some and $380,000 by 4.30 p.m. the following day. Mr Hirst immediately telephoned the state manager of the CDB to indicate that the arrears could be paid immediately. The response was, 'We don't want the arrears, we want the lot and have appointed receivers and managers.' Peter Melsom, one of the receivers and managers, arrived at the business the following Thursday and, notwithstanding Mr Hirst's success in developing the business, was relegated in status to anon-entity. From that day on the business wasted away. What should have been an extremely profitplace. able business became, in the hands of accountants Melsom and Robson, a disaster. Although Kalgoorlie-Boulder experienced unprecedented growth, apart from one conly tract which was awarded to it, requiring the working of double shifts during the first few months of the receivership operation, no effort was made by it to properly manage and control the business. Mr Hirst and his accountant Kendle offered to assist in the management because it could be seen that the receivers and managers were losing some quarter of a million dollars per annum. They also offered to purchase the business from the CDB-their own business-for $500,000. The offer was declined. Mr Hirst's engineer, Mr Ron Coleman, was able to maintain the block machine during all this time and, on the very last day before the receiver and manager closed the business down, in seven hours it produced concrete masonry blocks with an ex-factory value at $1.70 each, worth approximately $12,000. The cost of production, using five men and materials, was $3,500, leaving a profit for the day of $8,500. These figures can be verified. How could a bank-and a receiver and expanmanager-do such a thing? Of course they often only producing for one day per week. But the receiver and manager had no Mr sales staff and no competent manager of the on business. One might well ask how this could loan happen. I actually took this up with the the development bank at the time because I thought its actions were extremely precipitous it just would not listen to reason. Here was a man with assets of over $2 million. He got into arrears of some $30,000 through, in fact, an oversight, offered to make it up immediately, but was rejected by the bank. There has to be some sanction about receivers and managers. I have many accounts of banks appointing receivers and managers who are literally cowboys. They go into absolutely gut the businesses. They sell assets way he below cost, as happened in this case, and run the business into the ground, often leaving the owner of the business with debts far iri excess of what he actually owed the bank in the first I believe that these people will get justice at last, some 15 years later. They were recentgiven the right by the supreme court to sue the receiver-managers. I believe that their case will be successful and that they should take action against the Commonwealth Development Bank for its outrageous behaviour-a behaviour all too typical of banks operating in the field at that time. With the recent sale of the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Development Bank has become redundant. I call for the setting up of a new bank. I believe that we should refinance the Commonwealth Development Bank, make it honour its charter, allow it to operate from post offices and offer accounts to people for no charge, pay them somewhat less than the existing interest rate and let them have that money, tax free. I believe that this is the most effective way of taking the 7,000 banks on. (Time expired) Bosnia-Herzegovina",105
237,Mr FILING,COMMITTEES,"I rise net this evening to remind the House of the continuing disaster that is occurring in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I refer, in particular, to the failure of the United Nations, the European Community and all those recognised Western powers, as they are often referred to in the newspapers and other media, to deal with a situation that is quite clearly similar to those throughout its unfortunate recent history. On 6 February this year I moved a motion on this subject which states: That this House: (1) deplores the abject failure of the UN to protect the people of Bihac, Bosnia-Herzegovina, from attack by the forces of the Bosnia Serbs and their allies; (2) calls on the UN to lift its sanctions on arms supplies to the armed forces of the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina; and (3) rejects proposals to divide or cantonise Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today we see in our newspapers and in the electronic media the unfortunate situation where 250 UN peacekeepers are being held and used as hostages by the Bosnian Serb forces. I cannot think of any other outrage in recent history that surpasses this in provocative effect. This area was subject to enormous provocation in the first place. The irony is that the very people who have been sent to keep the peace now find themselves in extreme danger. As we have seen in more recent times, the government of France, in particular through President Chirac, has threatened to withdraw its forces from BosniaHerzegovina if there is no action to try to beef up the peacekeeping resources and forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the face of this quite outrageous behaviour by the Bosnian Serb forces. I visited Sarajevo in 1992 and 1993. In both cases, I was able to see the enormously dangerous conditions the French, British, some New Zealanders and other peacekeepers were working under in that city and elsewhere. It was certainly dangerous to visit places like Bihac and Tuzla. In relation to Croatia, and formerly Slovenia, we have seen from 1991-1992 in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina-the same systematic method of operation used by the aggressors in all cases. The seizure of UN peacekeepers and their use as hostages is the most recent example of a very consistent pattern of aggressive behaviour that the west, the United Nations and the European Community ought to have recognised from the word go. A number of us have consistently made speeches in this place calling for a resolute response to this type of aggression and this type of behaviour. We believe from the word go that bullying had to be met with either force or resolute behaviour by those who had the responsibility for negotiating peace or any form of settlement. We now see this ridiculous, almost tragic, situation where peacekeepers are being chained outside of buildings that may be considered as targets in the UN strikes that are being used to try to force the Bosnian Serb forces to desist from their aggressive behaviour. In the final analysis, nothing has changed since February when the motion was moved by the member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and me. It is quite clear that we must lift the sanctions on arms supplies to the armed forces of the government of BosniaHerzegovina, so that, in the absence of any resolute action by the peacekeepers, at least that government will be in a position to bring stability to the situation and to match this naked aggression and terrorism that has been launched on the people of BosniaHerzegovina by the Bosnian Serbs. Banks",106
238,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"I am indebted to my good friend Mr Jim Priest, who writes for local papers in my electorate, for recently drawing to the attention of his readers his concerns about the increasing trend for banks to impose fees and other charges on accounts held by small savers, particularly those with balances of less than $500. Jim is a well-regarded local authority on many issues of concern to pensioners and to other low income earners through his involvement with the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation.  of Australia's 1.64 million aged pensionersthe majority of whom are older women who have few resources and who are likely to be hardest hit by fees and charges-live on incomes of less than $200 a week. Many have  with good cause-that they are being victimised.  the context of the Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry into bank charges. Among these issues was the difficulty that new banking technology poses to people with physical or, intellectual handicaps, who are being penalised because of it. An example of this is the increasing use. of automatic teller machines. In the course of theÂ· public debate on the fairness, or otherwise, of bank fees and charges, a number of arguments have emerged, some of which I would like to address here this evening. One of the most extraordinary claims to come out of this debate.....,..and I am disappointed to note that the claim is supported by the opposition spokesperson on finance, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser)-is that banks do not have a social responsibility to small customers. Some recent media reports have included the following claims: banks are not obliged to subsidise the poor; banks do not really want poor pensioners at all; banks have no social responsibility beyond providing standard banking services; small customers are uneconomic customers; banks have a social responsibility only: to shareholders and owners; and banks have no obligation to develop a social conscience or to hand out charity. The member for Forrest was reported to have said that banks have no obligation to provide a ,subsidised or free service to pensioners and other low income clients, and that banks, like any other business, must make a profit. They do. Last year, the big banks earned $6,POO million. Clearly, banks and other financial. institutions do have a crucial role to play in our community. The Australian Banking Association has said that Australia .could not function without a banking system, and that is self evident. The ABA has also said that banks provide a safeÂ· haven for depositors. I agree that banks are essential and should provide a safe haven for those who desire it. But judging from the spiralling. imposts on small savers, it would appear that this is no longer the case for many in our community who are being deliberately priced out of the bank system. In undertaking its inquiry on banking and deregulation in 1991; the Martin report sought to provide a definition of a bank. The following definitions may be useful in considering some of the current issues. One definition says that they are for accepting deposits and making loans-the basic banking responsibility. The committee report also said that they are for: the collection of money by receiving deposits upon loan ... and the utilisation of the money so collected by lending it. .. These are the essential functions of a bank as an instrument of society. Finally, another definition is that it forms part of .the commercial, economic and social organisation of the community. I emphasise 'social organisation of the community'. I think these are good general definitions. In undertaking this role, the banks provide financial services to the community. They are major employers. Through their extensive branch networks, they provide daily access for the community to the payment system. They participate in providing housing to the community. ,And they play an important role in developing Australia's economy. In short, banks are a part of our society and they do have social resporisibility'-and to suggest otherwise is scandalous. I notice that some of those comments more recently have been taken up by banks. They say that,like any other business, they are a business in the private sector in Australiaand they have endorsed that 'earlier comment that they have a responsibility essentially to their shareholders. I do not know what happened to the Commonwealth Bank. But when I was a kid in primary school it sent out, apparently at considerable expense, its tellers toÂ· sit on the other side of a table and accept my penny into my savings account. I have banked with the Commonwealth Bank ever since, largely as a result of that introduction. Where now is the people's bank? My friend and colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) also . referred earlier to some of those concerns about the way ill which the banks operate. Th-y ar- instruments of society- They should accept that responsibility and they should accept the social responsibility that g()es with it. It i.s not appr()priate for them to continue to be grasping, as tlley have been in more recent years. (Time expired)",107
239,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"Prior to my entry to this place I was employed in the radio and television broadcasting industry for about 12Y2years. Having fo stand up and make this particular contribution. tonight is therefore something that I am not happy about .. On 13 March, this year, I was approached by the principal of one of the major state high schools in my electorate concerning a program that was put to air by Brisbane radio station BIOS. This particular incident occurred afte- what the principal d-scribed' as 'quite a challenging week' for the school. In that week he had' had to deal with one stabbing, three serious fights, 'two threats of assault on administration members, twO threats to shoot staff, and one actual assault on a teacher. It happened that during the night-time program on BIOS, on the particular evening of one of these events at the high school, the two personalities known as Krusty and Rachael, who broadcast an advice line, were approached by - hat was assumed to be one of the students of this state high school. The stm;lent said that he had had troubles during the day' with one of the teachers arid Was seeking advIce as to' what he should do to overcome someofthese troubles.' A transcript of a tape of the program was given to me-and the program was taped when on air-and perhaps I could read to the House what that particular advice was. The transcript reads: Krusty ... I think maybe you. should go .the devious and destructive way. You know, petition's by the law ... You know, I mean, you're going to have to make girl or guys life like hell. Rachael Twenty two calibre. . Krusty Yeh, well not so much death Rachael. I was thinking like a bit of teasing. know .. Like, . maybe. if they're in the locker room or something at lunch time steal all t-eir clothes or something. Rachael It's a te-cher. Krusty Yeh, that doesn't matter. They go out and they do stuff don't they. Maybe yOI,l should follow them at night, see where they live and you know shish the tyres, break the windows you know. Radio BI05 Listener That's not a'bad idea actually. Krusty Yeh right, I neversaiq that. And on it went.The point is 'thatthis radio program is designed to appeal to the young and subteenagers. The prime listening audience of this particular radio station is aimed at sevento 19-year-olds. When you havstudents' who have these sorts of difficulties at olir state high schools,whether it is intendedas a joke or not-and the station management has said to my representations to the Australian Broadcasting Authority that it was 11 joke-that sort of advice should not be tendered by two intellectual degenerates like Krusty and Rachael. . , One would think that the prime object of anybody who has the public trust of a broadcasting licence is to make sure that standards are met, that we do not have a situation where our community standards are flouted and wh-re the discipline of a high school-which is obviously under 'some strain anyway.:. - is undermined.by the likes .of these two creatures going on .air and broadcasting rubbish like that. I am not totally satisfied with the response of BIOS to the Broadcasting Tribupal, 'or the Broadcasting Authority as it is how; I think it was the Wednesday night when that broadcast went to air, but I note . that on the Friday night they were still making references to the phone calL I think that, in itself, is absolutely' crazy: that you have two so-called radio personalities promoting stalking, destruction, damage. and, in fact, physicahissault. . The Broadcasting Authority obviously will have a time to review the licence of BIOS; BIOS says in its letter to the Broadcasting this Authority that in future that program will be taped and the focus will be more on commonplace humour and not on some of this offbeat humour. If this offbeat humour is designed to You appeal to our teenagers, then all I can say is that we have a very sick society and we have a very sick broadcasting industry. Quite frankly, I think BI05 and the two personalities involved should be condemned. I very much look forward to receiving from the minister the response to my further representations on the attitude of BI05. (Time expired) Council Allowances'",109
240,Mr HAVILAND,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur) (7.55 p.m.)A number of local government councils in New South Wales are currently increasing their mayoral and councillors' allowances provided for by a recent decision of the New South Wales Remuneration Tribunal. This follows changes to the New South Wales Local Government Act. Myoid council, Campbelltown City Council, has just decided to increase its mayoral allowance t6 $30,000 a year and the councillors' allowance from the cUl,Tent $5,000 to $12,500 a year. Of course, when I was 011 the council just over two years ago we got only $3,000 a year. So I think this rise is entirely justified and long overdue recognition of the time and effort put in local councillors. Next door to my electorate, the Camden council has increased its mayoral allowance to $20,000 a year and the councillors' allowance, ance to $9,000 a year. As Camden is nowhere near as big as Campbelltown, it perhaps felt that this was all it could justify. But it interesting to look at the reaction of some of the Campbelltown councillors' who voted against the increase. Of course, this is council election year in New South Wales and the usual petty opportunists on Campb.elltown council, led by Councillor Jim Kremmer, are trying to use these rises as the basis of election stunt. Councillor Kremmer criticised the rises allowances as a 'greedy, money-grabbing exercise', while his running mate Councillor Ron Owers made it clear that he would make this a 'hot election issue'. This is the Councillor Kremmer who, in September 1990, when he was the Labor mayor, demanded the Labor caucus, of which I was a member, vote to increase his mayoral allowance per cent to $35,000 a year. Let me make it clear that I supported the rise in the mayoral allowance at the time because I believed then, and I still believe, that mayors and councillors are underpaid for the hours and the work' expected of them. The Labor caucus did unanimously support the rise in Councillor Kremmer's allowance. But Councillor Kremmer made it clear that he intended to use the money to fundÂ· his re-election campaign, which of course he was legally entitled to do. But Councillor Kremmer, after he took the money, resigned from the Labor Party and stood firstly as an as Independent candidate for the seat of Moorebank in the 1991 state election. Councillor Kremmer directed his preferences to the Liberal Party in that election, after his close friend and associate Mr Michael Knight had failed to gain Labor preselection for Moorebank. Councillor Kremmer then led anIndependent ticket for the 1991 council election, getting himself and Ron Owers elected at the expense of the Labor Party's candidates. This was the beginning' of a very strange in period in politics around Campbelltown, with by some ALP members clearly supporting Councillor Kremmer at the expense of the ALP ticket: So Councillor Kremmer had got the Labor caucus to increase his mayoral allowpocketed the money for his election campaign and then left the party to. run as an Independent in both state and councilelecis tions. Meanwhile, the Labor caucus was left wearing the political flak for having increased the allowance. Labor lost control of the a council at the election, losing three seats. The incoming council in 1991 reduced the mayoral allowance back to its previous level of around $20,000. Now, in another council an election year, Councillor Kremmer and Councillor Owers---ever the grubby opportunistsin have the gall and the absolute hypocrisy to come out attacking the council for increasing both the mayoral and the councillors' allowances as provided for under the new Local same Government Act. Nobody should be fooled for one minute by this cynical stunt; this that hypocritical nonsense. One thing is quite clear: Councillor by 75 Kremmer, who still of course has close contact with some people in the Labor Party, will again be running for council and he clearly will not need his councillor's allowance to fund his election campaign this time. He will no doubt have lots of friends and lots of support from companies like Monarch Developments, which recently had a major development application approved. He also has many other friends who will support his campaign-lots of friends indeed. But these rises in remuneration for councillors and mayors in New South Wales are long overdue and I thoroughly agree with them.",110

The following answers to questions were circulated: Community' Service Obligations: Telstra and Australia Post (Question No; 1838) , Mr Latham. asked the Minister for Communicationsand the Arts, upon notice, on 5 December 1994: .,' (1) What was'the value of - oriiinunity or universal service obligations (CSOs) administered by (a) Telstraand (b) Australia Post in 1993-94. (2) For what purposes were the CSOs used by each organisation. (3) What proportion of CSOs administered by (a) Telstra and (by Australia Post was funded through (i) cross-subsidisation practices, (ii) Commonwealth budget allocations and (iii) other sources. Mr Lee-The' answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Based on information pr\"">vided by Telstra and Australia Post: (1)(a) AUSTEL ,has respo-sibility for verifying the costs claimed by Tel-traeach year in providing loss-making services under its universal service obligation. AUSTEL determines the universal service levy and the amounts due to Telstraby other carriers. AUSTEL is currently determining the amount for -1993-94. I will advise the honourable member of the amount when it is available. I can advise, however, that the Universal Service Cost for the previous financial year 1992-93 was $149,170,304 of which Optus Communications Pty Limited, as the only other pat1icipating carrier during the year, contributed $1,455,819. ' (1)(b) Australia Post estimates the cost of its Community Service Obligations every year as required under - he Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989. The estimates are obtained by application of an unavoidable cost methodology and relate solely to those instances where letter services are provided, in pursuance of the Community Service Obligations, at prices which do not recover cost. The total unrecovered cost of such services, therefore, represents the cost of the Community Service Obligations. For 1993/94, Australia Post's Community Service Obligations are estimated to have cost $50 million. (2) As the Universal Service Carrier, Telstra's Universal Service Obligations require the company NA to ensure that the standard telephone service and payphones are reasonably accessible to all Australians on ,an equitable basis, wherever they live or carry on business. AUSTEL is responsible for administering the Universal Service Obligation arrangements. AUSTELis also required to monitor lind report to the' Minister regarding Telstra-s performance in meeting its Universal ServIce Obligations. Australia Post's commilnity service obligations are defined in section 27 of the A\lstralian Postal Corporation Act 1989 (the Act). Section 27 requires that: Australia Post provide a letter service for domestic and international mail; , the letter, service mus't be available at a uniform price for' standard letters carried within Australia by ordinary post; in view of the social importance of the letter service, it should be reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business; and performance standards (including delivery times) for the letter service should reasonably meet the social, industrial and commerchll needs , of the Australian community. (3)(a)(i)-(iii) Under the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Act 1991, Telstra, Optus and Vodafone have been declared participating telecommunications carriers: This means they are required to share the' costs of meeting Universal Service Obligations based on their share of timed telecommunications traffic. AUSTEL is responsible for assessing the contributions of each carrier. Contributions received from Optus aiJ.d Vodafone are paid into the Universal Service Levy Trust Fund administered by the Department of Communications and the Arts. These contributions are subsequently paid out to Te1stra by the Department as soon as possible-that is, within a matter of days of receipt. I am advised that Telstra funds its share of the costs incurred in providing loss making services under the Universal Service Obligations from elsewhere in its business, as do the other two carriers. There is no Commonwealth Budget Allocation for the Universal Service Obligations. (3)(b) The funding of Australia Post's Community Service Obligations is as follows: (i) proportion funded through cross-subsidisation practices-l 00% (ii) proportion funded through Commonwealth budget allocations-Nil (iii) proportion funded through other sourcesNil Business Liaison Program (Question No. 1873)",111
242,Mr CAMERON,NSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 230 (Hansard, 14 December 1993, page 4005) relating to the advertisement of a consultancy under the Western Australian Business Liaison Program in the Western Australian of 26 June 1993, has the position been filled; if so, (a) who was selected to fill the position, (b) what remuneration does the occupant of the position receive, (c) what are the duties of the position and (d) is the occupant required to meet certain standards; if so, (i) what are they and (ii) are they being met. (2) If the position has not been filled, (a) why not, (b) did the Minister say in the answer to question No. 230 that the position reflected a new initiative by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through its regional offices to build stronger links with the business community in the development and implementation of its policies and programs; if so, has the initiative been abandoned and (c) does the Government consider that the proximity of Perth to Asia is beneficial to Western Australian exporters; if so, will the Government fill the position. (3) What sum was spent advertising the position and in which newspapers was it advertised. (4) How many applications were received. (5) What is the name of each applicant. (6) Were any telephone inquiries received concerning the position; if so, (a) how many, (b) what were the reasons for the inquiries and (c) what information was provided to inquirers. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Trade, has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 1 No. (a-d) Not applicable as the position has not been filled. 2 (a-c) A decision has been taken not to proceed to employ an outside consultant but rather to seek to strengthen resources internally in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Regional Office in Perth to develop closer links with the Western Australian business community and to involve the WA Government directly in market development activities. The Government recognises the benefits of the proximity of Western Australia to Asian markets and has ensured the closer involvement of Western Australia in a number of the Department's programs and activities, for example, last year's major Australia Today Indonesia promotion, the National Trade Strategy Consultative Process, the Market Australia Campaign to commence shortly in a number of Asian markets and the recently announced Indian Ocean Regional Initiative. 3 $3,047.20. The position was advertised in ""The Australian"" and the ""West Australian"" newspapers. 4 Forty four applications were received. 5 Applications were received in confidence and it would be inappropriate to reveal the names of individual applicants. 6 Yes. (a) The actual number of telephone inquiries was not recorded. (b) Inquiries ranged from the anticipated duties of the position to the progress in filling the position. (c) The information provided varied in line with the nature of the particular inquiry. Minister for Foreign Affairs: Travel Expenses (Question No. 1905) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: What was the total cost of travelling and associated expenses incurred by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in (a) 1993 and (b) 1994.",113
243,Mr WALKER,NSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) $338,882 (b) $297,745 Note: These figures include costs relating to official overseas visits for which not all accounts have yet been received from overseas posts. Some adjustment to these figures may result. Australia Post: Delivery Services (Question No. 1936) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 2 February 1995: (1) How many mail boxes in (a) Australia and (b) the electoral division of Parkes receive only one mail delivery per week. (2) Will the Government act to provide at least two deliveries per week to those boxes; if not, why not. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Based on information provided by Australia Post: (l)(a) In advice provided in September 1992 to the Industry Commission Inquiry into Mail, Courier and Parcel Services, Australia Post estimated that there were some 3,157 households in Australia receiving one mail delivery per week.
