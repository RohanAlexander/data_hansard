When the subject of a question is of 'such urgency that obviously it would be detrimental to the welfare of any considerable body of citizens to delay the asking of it, it is proper to ask it without notice; but, as honourable members know well, it is not usually under such circumstances that questions are asked without notice.

24,Mr STEWART,TAXATION OF FARMERS AN D,"for Mr GREGORY) asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Whether he will favourably consider an amendment of the Income-Tax Assessment Act this year with a view to assessing the incomes of farmers and graziers on the average of their incomes for five years? 2. Is it a fact that in Great Britain all incomes other than fanning, grazing, and mining are. based on a three years' average, and the three industries before mentioned on a five years' average?",51
25,Mr WATT,TAXATION OF FARMERS AN D,"The answers to the h o n orable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. This matter will be considered by the Royal Commission, which it is proposed to appoint to inquire into and report on the whole incidence of Commonwealth taxation. 2. No. A somewhat complicated system of assessment prevails in.Great BritainSome assessments arc based upon averages such as the honourable member refers to. grazier may elect whether he pays income tax based upon the annual value of his property or upon his average income of the preceding three years. Of course, conditions in Australia arc not the same as in Britain. For the information of the honourable member, I may say that recent press cable advice from London indicates that the Royal Commis[4]-2 sion sitting in London to inquire into the incidence of British Income Tax intends to recommend the abolition of assessment on the average income of three years, and to substitute assessment on the income of the preceding year.",51
26,Mr STEWART,TAXATION OF FARMERS AN D,"for Mr GREGORY) asked the Treasurer, upon noticethe Will lie favourably consider a retrospective amendment of the War-time Profits Tax Act which will afford relief in cases where it is stated the Act has been found to operate very harshly on pastoralists and graziers, who, prior to the war, had made no profits, and in many instances had shown heavy losses, and who now are being heavily taxed on book profits (increases of stock) which, it is alleged, may never be realized?",51
27,Mr WATT,TAXATION OF FARMERS AN D,"The points raised by this question were very fully considered by the Parliament when the amendment of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Act 1918 was under consideration, and it was considered that very full provision was made for relief to pastoralists, especially those operating in districts liable to severe drought, in which the capital of the business was liable to be lost or reduced owing to drought. It is probable that pastoralists have not made themselves acquainted with these provisions of the law. This matter will doubtless be considered by the proposed Royal Commission on the incidence of Commonwealth direct taxation. THE WAR. DATE OF TERMINATION-TRIA L OF WAR CRIMINALS.",51

Is it a fact that the victualling allowance for the lower deck of the Australian Navy was, in 1914, Is. 8d. per diem? 2. Is it a fact that the victualling allowance today is still the same, viz., Is. 8d. ? 3. Is it a fact that if all the men have to 'remain aboard when their ship is in harbour this allowance would not be sufficient; and when the men go ashore on night leave they to pay the greatly increased price without any additional allowance? 4. Does he think, viewing the tremendous increases in all prices, the victualling allowance information required is sufficient? 5. In view of the greatly increased price of "" slops,"" in some cases more than 100 per cent., l l he have inquiries made with a view to the allowance for "" slops "" being increased ? 6. Is it a fact that the rates of pay for the lower deck of the Australian Navy are conlower than those of the Royal Navy; and, if so, will he take steps to have them of the brought up to those of the Royal Navy? 7. Is it a fact t h at the opportunities of proGovernment's motion from the lower deck are not so great anas in the Royal Navy, and will he have inquiries made with a view to the Australian Navy being brought into 'line with the Royal Navy, ' particularly respecting the "" mate"" system?",52
40,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TAXATION OF FARMERS AN D,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as 1.

42,Mr ATKINSON,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Wilmot ) [11.22] I move That the honourable member for Riverina (the Hon. John Moore Chanter) be appointed Chairman of Committees of this House. It is unnecessary for me to make a lengthy statement in submitting this motion, since the honourable member for Riverina is well known to the majority of honourable members, and has previously filled with distinction and credit to himself the position of Chairman of Committees. I can say with confidence to new members that in the honourable member, if he be elected, we shall have a fearless and impartial Chairman. The honourable member held this office during the whole of ihe last Parliament, as well as on .previous occasions, and I hope that my motion will meet with the concurrence of the House.",53
43,Mr BAMFORD,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Herbert) [11.25] It is with sincere pleasure that I second the motion. As the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Atkinson) has said, the rehonorable member for Riverina (Mr . Chanter) is well known to the House, and during his occupancy of the chair on previous occasions gave satisfaction' to at almost every one. He had occasionally to play the part yesterday described by War the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) as that of a flagelator, but it appeared to me the that on some occasions at least the punishnecesment meted"" out by him, if not merited, was, at all events, welcomed and rather The honourable member never used the whip u n t i l he had resorted to a good deal of suasion, and had asked for some consideration for the delinquent. The honourable member for Riverina is not exactly the father of the House-that aware. is a position to which I aspire-bu the has been in politics much longer than I have, having had considerable experience in the State Parliament of New South Wales, as well as in the National Parliament. His decisions as Chairman of Committees have met with the approval of the great majority of honourable memin bers, and I am sure they w i ll never be They will be followed, I the am confident, by any honourable member who is privileged in the future to occupy other the position, for they displayed such a and soundness of judgment that no one could cavil at them.",53
44,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Y a r r a ) [11.27] - It is with reluctance that I rise to take the action that I am now about to do, but there are certain matters which I desire to bring before the House. Those who were in the last Parliament will remember that the Electoral Bill was before the House in November, 191S. The sitting, which opened on the 7th November, extended throughout the night, and after a brief adjournment was resumed at 11 o'clock on the morning of the Sth November. Shortly afterwards I rose to exercise my undoubted right to speak to a certain clause in reply to the present Treasurer (Mr W at t ) , who was then Acting Prime Minister, but the honourable member for Riverina, who was then Chairman of Committees, ruled that I had already spoken twice to the clause, and was, therefore, not entitled to speak again. I was positive, and I think most of those present shared my view, that I had spoken only once, and I told the Chairman so. Has Ireply was that I must sit down, and I had to do so because I knew if I failed to obey his direction I would be suspended.",53
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,The member knew that from previous experience.,54
46,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Yes , but I have never been suspended.",54
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,I have.,54
48,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I am aware of that, and I think the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) must have had the honourable gentleman in mind when he said that on some occasions he thought those who had been punished by the Chairman were looking for punishment, and rather welcomed it . I make this statement because my experience on the occasion referred to may be that of any honourable member at some"" future date. The Hansard report of the proceedings is as follows:",54
49,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Yarra) [12.10] - I admit that if I were in the Minister's position I would do exactly as lie is doing. Naturally, Ministers want their Bill, but",54
50,The CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,Order ! I find the honourable member has already spoken twiee on this clause.,54
51,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I spoke only once, Mr Chairman.",54
52,The CHAIBMAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I find, on reference to the records, that the honourable member has spoken twice.",54
53,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Not on this clause. I spoke on clause 123, and before I rose I spoke to the Clerk on the subject. That was to verify my own belief that I had spoken only once on the clause.",54
54,The CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"It is the duty of the Chairman to be accurate in checking the mem-' bers' times. The honourable member first spoke on this clause at 11.25 a.m., and again at 1.1.52 a.m. He now proposes to speak again, t but he has' exhausted his time.",54
55,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I am sure I did not. I say deliberately I do not think I.did, and I do not think any other member believes I have spoken twice on it.",54
56,The CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,I ask the honourable member to withdraw that statement.,54
57,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,I will withdraw it. You are not going to put me out.,54
58,Mr FINLAYSON,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,You try it on.,54
59,The CHAIRMAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I did expect that the Leader of the Opposition would endeavour to support the Chair. When I was on my feet for the first time, the present Treasurer (Mr W at t ) , who was then Acting Prime Minister, had sent to me an intimation that he wished to see me on important business. I am sure that the honourable gentleman will that not mind my saying that he had then received a cable, stating that the armistice would probably take effect on the following Monday; and I was with him at the honourable time the Chairman said I had spoken for the second time. Had the Chairman of Committees admitted he had made a mistake-and every man is prone to make mistakes- I should not have called attention to the subject.",54
60,Mr WATT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,It was the case of the record of the Clerk against your recollection.,54
61,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"It was the Chairman's own record, and not the Clerk's. The Chairman stated that I had spoken at 11.52, whereas it was the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) who rose at that time. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) spoke at 11.53, the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) at 11.55, the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr . Atkinson) at 12 o'clock, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t) at 12.7, and I followed. I did not get a complete Hansard record of the proceedings until November 19th.  after 12 o'clock is excusable.",54
62,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"It was 12 o'clock noon, not midnight. We assembled at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 19th, and then I made the following personal - explanation : On Friday week, when I rose to speak on clause 125 of the Electoral Bill, the Chairman of Committees told me that I had exhausted my right to speak on the clause, having already twice done so. I denied at the time the accuracy of his statement, and was threatened with expulsion; but the proof of the Hansard report furnished to me next day showed that I had spoken on the clause only once. As there was a possibility of a galley slip not having been delivered to me, I waited until the publication of the complete record, and from that it is evident that I spoke only once, beginning my speech at 11.24 a.m. At 11.52 the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Austin Chapman) spoke. That was the time at which, according to the Chairman of Committees, I had spoken. His speech lasted for two or three minutes. At that time, I was absent from the Chamber interviewing the Acting Prime Minister. Our rights here are little enough, and they should not be reduced 50 per cent. I think I have a right to place on record the treatment meted out to me by the nominee of the Government. I have admitted that every man can make mistakes - the man who says he does not make mistakes makes the biggest mistake of all. It is true that this was after an all-night sitting, but I should be failing in my duty as a member of this House if I ' allowed my rights to be curtailed without protest.",54
63,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,Did the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Chanter) ever apologise ?,55
64,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"He never said a word about the matter, I had to withdraw the remark that I "" t h o u g h t "" I had only spokeu once- I was not allowed to think. In view of that action of the late Chairman of Committees, I am reluctantly compelled to protest against his appointment). If any other honourable member is nominated for the position I shall vote for him.",55
65,Mr WA TT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Balaclava-Treasurer [11.35] - I distinctly remember the i cident referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor). I remember the feeling of surprise I experienced hearing that the honourable gentleman had spoken twice, my recollection being that he had only spokein once. However, it was not my province to interfere the Chairman of Committees, although I was in charge of the Committee at the time; I trusted that the records of the Chairman, or of the Clerk, were more reliable than the faulty recollections of liamentarians like the honourable man and myself. We had had an all-night sitting, dealing with that troublesome man! Electoral Bill , and honourable members were very strained. We were trying hasten the close of the Friday sitting in man."" order that honourable members might catch their Inter-State trains. Surely honourable member does not mean to sugthat, gest that because the late Chairman Committees made a mistake",55
66,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,Ha d he risen and adTudor mitted his mistake I should never have raised the question again.,55
67,Mr WATT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Surely the honourable member does not suggest that the fact that the late Chairman made a mistake a reason why he should not be re-elected is to the position, whether he acknowledged the mistake or not? The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) admits that we are all prone to make mistakes.",55
68,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Hear , hear!",55

Possibly the profession of the law allows a man to become a sophist. I am sorry to say that the Treasurer is a. sophist; h© would argue either way. This election is just another phase of the division of the spoils of office. The Ministerial candidate is one of the six survivors of the noble fourteen who left a certain room when the present Prime Minister Hughes), after holding the position of chairman of the party for two days and one night, was afraid to put to the meeting a motion concerning his leadership. The chairmanship is one of the paid positions of the House. With new recruits, the National Labour party number - nine, and they have already more than their fair proportion of offices. I accuse the honourable member for Riverina Chanter) of having been absolutely unjust while he occupied the position of Chairman. Following the occasion on which I was ordered out of the House the first time in a parliamentary of thirty years-the Chairman left the chair, walked on to the floor of the House, and, by his remarks, rubbed the salt into the open wound. I placed the incident on record! in Hansard form of a sworn declaration. sequent date the Labour Whip told me that my declaration was being discussed in the House. I came into the House, and the Minister for the Navy appealed to me to agree to expunge the declaration from the records of the House. stated that the declaration had been read when the House was in Committee, and' was, therefore, out of order. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Chanter), as Chairman of Committees, should have known whether the reading of the document was in accordance Standing Orders. However, in a good humour when the for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) appealed to me, and, after first requesting that a member from each side of the House should be chosen to investigate the matter, and decide whether the Chairman or I was in the wrong, I agreed to leave the matter in his hands. Ultimately honourable member for Riverina would not endorse his statement. All that. I desired him to do was to admit that he had made a mistake. I did not want an apology from a man older in years than I am. He would not acknowledge he was wrong. The sworn was expunged' from the records. Minister for the Navy kept his contract. I remember him saying to the Chairman, Dr Maloney. "" If I were you, sir, I would withdraw and apologize, and so have done with the matter."" I told the honourable member for Riverina that if he swore a declaration that my statement was wrong, I upstairs would prosecute him for perjury. I could (Mr do nothing more. He accused me of going into his district on one occasion to speak against his re-election. The only time. I went into his electorate during elections was when I went, at my own expense, to urge the Labour branches of the district to adopt him as their candidate. His own common sense ought to have told him that my constituents required my presence in Melbourne during (Mr an election at which I was opposed. Even now, if the honourable gentleman will say that he regretted that he made a mistake, I will accept his word willingly. I come now to a humorous incident. Did not he, when Chairman, call me to order, career and ask me to sit down, when I was singing God Save the King^ And did I not tell him and the Ministry that I would see them damned first? Whenever I am singing God Save the K in g , or whatever in the is the national song of the British race, I On a sub- shall sing it standing. If the discussion today does nothing else, it w i ll at least prove to the honourable member for Riverina that he, like others, is fallible. It would have been better if he, acting on the advice of the Minister for the He Navy, had acknowledged that he had made a mistake, instead of compelling me to take the advantage of an opportunity, which occurs only once in three years, to register my protest. Let any honourable member read the declaration, and ask himself if any man could do more to with the prove that he had all the evidence on his I was side. Minister",55

Concerning the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) I am able to state' that everything he said regarding what happened upon the occasion in questhat tion is absolutely accurate. I can, from declaration my own recollection, confirm his account. The But, with regard to the implication that the Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament (the Hon. J . M . Chanter) - was deliberately and intentionally unfair, I think it only righ t that one who was present and had personal knowledge of the whole incident should protest. There is not the slightest doubt regarding what occurred. There had been an all-night sitting. I understand that there are some twenty new members in this chamber. Most, if not all of them, are unfamiliar with all-night sittings. Possibly they will have become painfull y familiar with such occurrences before long.",56

83,Mr JOWETT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"That is not the point now, : Honourable members had gone very good party. through an all-night sitting of the House and we were resuming next day. The Chairman of Committees (Mr Chanter) obviously referred to and relied upon his notes. It is equally obvious that notes on that occasion were inaccurate. There is not an honourable member of a this House who fails to realise that the Chairman honestly believed that the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) had spoken twice.",57
84,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,Why has he not said so?,57
85,Mr JOWETT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I cannot say. These situations are, after all, more the out the come of habit than anything else. Some people readily admit their mistakes, others do not; I have been accused by my friends of being one who is always too ready to apologize, and who withdraws what may be deemed to be an objectiontions able statement far too soon. It may be that there are honourable members opposite who are tardy in making for hasty and unjust statements with respect to honourable members upon this side.",57

87,Mr JOWETT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I am glad to hear that,' and I believe it is true also. I object to this whole subject being raised now, and to the stressing of the implication that Mr Chanter was, upon the occasion in question, deliberately unfair. I ant satisfied that he was not, but that he made a purely accidental mistake, and that he honestly believed that honourable member for Yarra had spoken twice.",57

89,Mr JOWETT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I deprecate the fact that recriminations to which, unfortunately, we have become accustomed in the past should so soon be launched in this new Parliament. It was once said of a great house, whose scions came to their doom in consequence of such principles, that of the past they forget nothing and from it they learn nothing. I trust that those remarks will never be said of the Opposition in thischamber. r all Mr TUDOR - What we want to know here is, are you a Government supporter?",57

Had it been raised in a party spirit, such as the honourable member*, for Darling (Mr Blakeley) has implied, the procedure would be a degradation to this House and to those honourable members responsible. I plead that, in this new Parliament, which"" consists of at least one-third new members, and includes the cream of intellect of the country, as typified by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls), who has just interjected, we should endeavour to forget all those bitter memories of the past, all those personal, and almost vindictive, recollec",57

It is unnecessary for me to add that honourable members on this side of the chamber believe that Mr Mahony would carry out his duties equally as well as, if not better than, the honourable member who was Chairman of Committees during the last Parliament. I believe, at any rate, - that no such quarrelling and fault-finding would have to be recorded, after three years' occupancy of the chair in Committee by the honourable member for Dalley as during the regime of ' the honourable member for Riverina.",58
98,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Maribyrnong) [12.0] I second the amendment. reason why these positions should not be contested. From whatever side of the House a member is chosen to occupy the position of a presiding officer, we have a light to look to him to deal out evenhanded justice. I know that there have been times when we have had an all-night sitting, after a long day in Committee, and without any sleep, when we say and do things which we afterwards regret. We usually find that if a man has made a mistake he has been ready to make amends. In the first words which I spoke here I said that it was likely that I would say and do things on the spur of the moment which I might afterwards have cause to regret, but that if I did I hoped that I would always be found sufficiently manly to admit my mistake and own up, whether that involved a public apology or not.",58
99,Mr BRENNAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,The Chairman of Committees should set lau example in such matters.,58
100,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I agree that our presiding officers, in matters pertaining to the observance of the Standing Orders and decorum, should present a pattern and example which we should all be delighted to follow. The evidence which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has presented this morning shows conI clusively that the gentleman who occupied the position of Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament made a mistake, and failed to admit it . I think that he ought now, even at the eleventh hour, to admit the mistake he made. A man who shows himself reluctant to admit that he made a mistake is likely, in the position of Chairman of Committees, to commit grievous errors in the future. I feel sure that if it had been the Prime Minister who suffered as the result of the mistake made by the honourable member for Riverina as Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament, he would have been only too ready to admit his mistake, but because it was the Leader of the Opposition who suffered as the result of his mistake, he is not prepared to admit it , even at the eleventh hour.",58
101,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,That is a very grave charge to make.,58
102,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Then why has the honourable member for Riverina not admitted his mistake before? We should not forget that his denial of the right I see no of the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr . Tudor) to speak a second time upon a clause of a Bill in Committee was accompanied by a threat which meant expulsion from the Chamber if the order of the Chair was not obeyed. It should be remembered, also, that the honourable member for Yarra deports himself in thi* Chamber in a way which honourable members generally might well follow. He is amongst the least offensive members of the House, and is prompt in obeying the demands of the 'Chair. I have pleasure in seconding the amendment moved by the honourable member for Darling (Mr . Blakeley), in order that honourable members may be given an opportunity to show that they do not approve of some of the actions of the Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament, and may be able to record their votes against his election on this occasion. There seems to be a happy combination between the so-called Nationalist party and the so-called Country party. have had an impassioned address by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr . Jowett), who urged the House to be unanimous in. placing the honourable member for Riverina in the chair as Chairman of Committees of this Parliament. It is significant that this appeal should have come from the Deputy Chairman of the Country party. It gives colour-to the rumour daily gaining currency that, after all, the so-called Country party is merely an unimportant wing of the National party.",58

105,Mr JOWETT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Of course, this is a party question, according to the honourable member.",59
106,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"It seems to me that the honourable member for Grampians is today just as responsive to the crack of the Ministerial whip as 'he was in the last Parliament. I should .prefer to see some evidence of heart and fight in the Country party, even upon a comparatively unimportant question.",59
107,Sir JOSEPH COOK,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"That is the honourable member's trouble, is it not?",59
108,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,We shall yet have plenty of trouble. It is sometimes desirable to gird a little at a certain section in this House when we find its members so amenable to the demands of the party in a majority. I shall content myself by saying that I will support the amendment in 'the hope that a majority of the members of this House will see their way to make a change in the occupant of the position of Chairman of Committees.,59
109,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Maranoa) [12.6]. - I have nothing to say against the honourable member for Riverina as Chairman of Committees. I suppose that, like every other Chairman, he always looks after his pals. The only fair man I ever struck was Mr Alex. Poynton, the honourable member for Grey. He made me go down on my knees, and apologize to him, when he was acting as Chairman of Committees, although he was a member of our party at the time. There was not much favouritism about that. hate has shown that, the Country party, ""We notwithstanding all the protestations wo have heard that it is separate and alone, has an honourable understanding with the Government. That has been made plain by the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett).",59
110,Mr BAYLEY,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,There will be another honourable member for Maranoa in three years' time.,59
111,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,The party to which the honourable member belongs has been trying for the last eight Parliaments to secure another member f o i Maranoa. If he will be my opponent 1 can tell him that I will go next time,59

115,Mr JAMESPAGE,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I have told the honourable member for Oxley and his friends in Brisbane that they will not get me out as member for Maranoa unless they cut the Barcoo out of my electorate. I am satisfied that the Country party is just as conservative^ as the other crowd opposite, and is only a Country party in name.",59
116,Mr STEWART,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,The Country party seems to be worrying the honourable member.,59
117,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Order ! The honourable member will resume his seat. There seems to be some misapprehension on the part of certain honourable members as to the question before the Chair. The question is the election of a Chairman of Committees, and not the views of parties in this House.",59
118,Mr JAMESPAGE,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I do not know the name of the gentleman who interrupted me, or where he comes from , but after he has been here a little while he will understand that I shall not worry very much about himself or his party. The honourable member for Grampians has given the show away. I remember that, in connection with a Wheat Commission which was inquiring in Adelaide, a statement was made to the effect that there was no combination and no Trust, but there was an honourable understanding, and it appears to me that the Prime MinThe de- ister and his party have an honourable understanding, if not with the Country party, them with the officials of that party, including the honourable member for Grampians. It is idle for us to nominate a candidate from this side. This is supposed to be an election by the House, but we know that it has been fixed up. Directly I came to Melbourne a member of the Farmers' party told me that the honourable member for Lang (Mr Johnson) was going to be Speaker, and the honourable member for Riverina. (Mr. Chanter) was going to be Chairman of Committees. That is a peculiar thing, but he was a good tipster, if he was nothing else. If the officials of the party had not been discussing this particular matter, the individual members had evidently been discussing it among themselves. To debate the election of Chairman of Committees is beating the air, because it is a foregone conclusion that the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Chanter) is to be the man. I would point out to him that it is a hard thing for any man, when he does another a wrong, to own up to it publicly.",59
119,Mr MATHEWS,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,I do not see that it should be.,60
120,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Well , it is a hard thing. The honourable member for Riverina accused another honourable member of doing something that he did not do, and then had the power of expelling him, when that man was leader of our party. If I had been in the position of our leader I should simply have sat down and said, "" I am sticking for the truth, not for parliamentary procedure. Put me out."" If he had been put out then for telling the truth, he would have had the sympathy, not only of the House, but of every man outside who believes that truth and justice should .prevail above all things.",60
121,Mr MATHEWS,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,The honourable member for Riverina had one of our members put out contrary to the Standing Orders.,60
122,Mr JAMES PAGE,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews) has escaped being put out many a time when he should have been. If he was put out on one occasion when he should not have been, it was only one instance the other way. I feel that the honourable member for Riverina, when elected, will be as fair as he possibly can be. He may make errors, but every man makes errors. If our protest does no harm or no good, it will at least let him know the feelings of us who are in opposition. I would remind the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) that ever since he has been in Parliament he has had the pleasure of sitting behind the Government. When he has a taste of sitting in Opposition, with a brutal majority against him on that side, such as we have against us now, I wonder whether he will put up as good a fight as we have done. During his first session, he was always looking for an all-night sitting. He would come up here wrapped up in an overcoat weighing about 56 lbs., and with aswag on his back like a black gin's benjamin, which had been carried about .the bush for twelve months, and with a billy-can and a water-bag in hishand, looking for it. No wonder the honourable member talks about all-night sittings.",60
123,Mr NICHOLLS,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Macquarie) [12.14]. - I support the nomination of the-honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). I well remember the incident referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor). Honourable members should, perhaps, sympathize with the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Chanter) instead of criticising him so severely. He has had considerable experience in the chair, but he has reached such a stage that he can no longer be relied upon. He has fallen into a condition of senile decay, and perhaps on that account it might be wise to relieve him of such an important position. Question-That the words "" Riverina (the Hon.

If these AYES. Standing Orders are thought to be inadequate, it is within the power of honourable members to alter them. It is the duty - the imperative duty-of the presiding officers to interpret them to the best of their ability, and in an impartial manner. I may also be permitted to remind honourable members that the dignity and decorum of this House cannot be maintained by presiding officers without the assistance of honourable members themselves. They must have that support. If Mr Speaker or I , when acting in our respective capacities, make mistakes, we are immediately open to challenge.

As to my honourable friend, the Chairman of Committees, I hope he will have good health and strength for the performance of his arduous duties, for, indeed, they are arduous i u these days. Sometimes, I think we do not make enough allowance for Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees. We are prone to forget that they are human beings and, like ourselves, subject to all the disabilities of human nature. If we can only think of them just as men like ourselves, serving in their high offices to the best of thedr ability, I think we would then make more allowances and have more consideration for them. Notwithstanding the criticism that has been offered today, I feel that I can assure Mr Chanter of the warm support of honourable members in the discharge of his duties.",62

139,Mr WATT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,We cannot tell the honourable member u n t i l we get into Committee.,63
140,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I think we ought to have that information before, because when the House goes into Committee we shall have virtually agreed to some amount.",63
141,Mr WATT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,Some amount.,63
142,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I do not know how much. Unless there is some urgent reason, such as facilitating the payments of civil servants, I shall certainly object. Although the Government have been returned by a large majority, we do not know what support they are likely to receive from the House, because we have not had an opportunity of testing their strength. We do not know whether the party which calls itself the Country party is going to support or oppose the Government. SUPPL Y. Mr JOWETT - Why does the honourable ^member say "" the party which calls itself the Country party ' ' ?",63
143,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"I say it advisedly, and not offensively. But that is the view I hold regarding it . Before I agree to the motion to go into Committee of Supply I wish to hear from the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, or from one of the Ministers, something in regard' to what I consider has been extravagant and reckless expenditure on the part of the Government. Honourable members. may smile, but I am sure that the majority of the people of Australia is anxious to have some particulars in regard, to this matter. It is strange, indeed, that the Auditor General's report, which was issued about eight months ago, was laid on the table of this House only yesterday. I have not had an opportunity of perusing it , and to - I do not believe it has been printed or made available, to honourable members. I notice, however, from the press that there are certain items of expenditure and certain losses on which some informaI tion should be given. I refer to a statement in the daily press of today, headed "" Shipping Losses,"" which readsDetails are furnished of the loss entailed upon the Commonwealth in connection with, shipbuilding in America. An agreement was made with the Patterson, MCDonald Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, to construct ten wooden cargo-carrying steamers at a cost of 5,300,000 dollars. Subsequently the contract was so amended that the cost would have been 8,900,000 dollars. Advice had, Mr Israel added, been received that eight of the ships had been sold at a loss of £326,000. In view of the enormous increase in cost compared with the original contract, a very fortunate sale would appear to have been made. I wish to know what the Government have to say in regard to that. The paper from which this statement is taken supports the Government- I do not know upon what grounds-and the statemeut concludes, "" a very fortunate sale would appear to have been made."" The people of this country, as well as the members of this House, should have some explanation, and I am sure the primary producers in particular will want to know more about it .",63
144,Mr WATT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,Is the honourable member quoting from the Argus?,63
145,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,I am.,63
146,Mr WATT,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,You do not always quote the Argus.,63
147,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Perhaps not. I am quoting fro m the Auditor-General's report, as published in the Argus, which shows that an alteration was made in the contract involving an increased cost of some hundreds of thousands of dollars, and that on the sale of these ships there was a loss of £326,000.",64
148,Mr TUDOR,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Did he say anything about the Sydney contract? M i '. RYAN - I intend to refer to that. The Auditor-General's report continues- An expensive experiment was the establishment of a Directorate of War Propaganda. It had a very brief existence, and cost £2,266; I want to know all about that, and the reason for its discontinuance. It may be that Ministers are able to give some satisfactory explanation, and, if so, well and good. The report also refers to the cancellation of a contract with the Wallace Power Boat Company Limited, in the following terms:Cancellation of a contract with the Wallace Power Boat Company Limited, of New South Wales, for the construction of six wooden barquentines cost, including progress payments, £51,839, while the cancellation of another contract with Hughes, Martin, and Washington Limited, New South Wales, cost £72,500. Why was it necessary to cancel those contracts, 'and why was such a loss incurred ?  given to the House last year.",64
149,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"If a satisfactory explanation can be given, I shall have nothing further to say; but on the face of the Auditor-General's report, it does not appear that any great business capacity was shown by the Government in making contracts which were subsequently cancelled, and at a loss to the taxpayers of such a large amount of money. If they can give an explanation, let them give it . I am also anxious to know before the .House resolves itself into a Committee of Supply, who bore the expense in connection with the hold-up of shipping, arising out of the dispute with the In -, statute of Marine Engineers. I want to know whether a large proportion of that expense of holding up ships which do not belong to the Commonwealth, was borne by th© Commonwealth Government. It is a most - important matter, in which a very large majority of the people of Australia are interested, and if that expense was borne by the Government, we should have a full statement of the reasons why. I cannot go categorically into all the matters I wish to refer to,' upon which the Government could be criticised at this moment, but there are some things on which it is appropriate a pronouncement should be made at the earliest possible moment, because they are of vital importance, affecting as they do the in terests of the whole of the people. We all know that, since the election's of the 13th December last, there has been a sharp rise in the cost of living.",64
150,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,That was only natural.,64
151,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Yes . It was pointed out by candidates who faced the electors that it would come about'. I do not quarrel with the decision of the people of Australia, but I feel it is m y duty in the interests of the electors of West Sydney to have, something to say on this matter, because, although we have not succeeded in preventing a Government getting into power that is, in my opinion, backed by the profiteering interests of the country, we may still foe able to do something in order to prevent that profiteering pressing too heavily on the people.",64
152,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,The honourable member advised the people to vote against giving the Commonwealth Government the necessary powers to deal with profiteering.,64
153,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"The H i gh Court has not yet decided that the Commonwealth Government have not the power to deal with profiteering. Imagine an interjection of that sort coming from, an honourable member supporting the Government when he knows that, at the very height of their power, under the W a r Precautions Act , they repealed all regulations having anything to do with the controlling of profiteering !",64
154,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,It was done at the instigation of Opposition members.,64
155,Mr RYAN,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Not at all. There is no better evidence of what the Government believed to be their power under the W a r Precautions Act than the drastic regulation proclaimed the other day dealing with the Institute of Marine Engineers, the most undemocratic regulation ever issued by a British Government.' That proclamation, which prevented a body of men Irom making use of their own funds for the maintenance of their wives and families without the consent of the At torney-General, was ample evidence of the view which the Attorney-General (Mr Hughes) holds of the powers th© Government possess under the War Precautions Act. Otherwise it was a gigantic piece of bluff on the'part of the Government in order to achieve the result they desired. As I was saying, the Government, at the height of their power, when there could be no dispute as to their having complete authority under the War Precautions Act, repealed all regulations which had any bearing upon a reductioni n the cost of living in Australia. I ask leave to continue my remarks on a future occasion. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. LUNCHEON TO SIR ROSS SMITH .",64
156,Mr HUGHES,COMMITTEES OF SUPPLYAND,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [12.55] - I move That the House do now adjourn. As honourable members know, there is to be a luncheonto Sir Ross Smith and his companions, and seeing that the House usually adjourns on Friday at 4 o'clock, if honourable members have no objection, it would perhaps be ae well to adjourn now. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 12.56 p.m.",65
