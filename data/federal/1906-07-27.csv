0,NA,Unknown,"Wouzr of Ixrpvrsrntatiurs. Friday, 27 July, IQ06. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at i 1.30 and read prayers. THE REV. MR. WORRALL. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I should like to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether, in view of the extraordinary occurrences which have taken place, a military escort from Bendigo to the State Parliament House, Melbourne, will be furnished to the Rev. Mr WorraH on Tuesday next ? PRINTING COMMITTEE: SENATE PRINTING.",13
1,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [11.30] On behalf of the Frinting Committee, I desire to make a personal explanation in reference to a resolution passed yesterday by the Senate. On 2'8th June, 1906, I , as Chairman of the Committee, sent the following letter to the Prime Minister: Sir,I have the honour to inform you that at a meeting of the Frinting Committee of the House of Kepresentatives, held on the 15th inst., 1 wasrequested to call your attention to the unnecessary printing and extra expense incurred by the Senate in printing regulations under the Fost and Telegraph Act 1901, as set out in the journalsforwarded herewith. As I pointed out in my letter of 14th July, 1904, regulations of thischaracter are published under the Rules Publication Act 1903, and presented to Parliament in the usual printed form of such rules. The resolution passed hy the Printing Committee was as follows :That the attention of the honourable the Prime Minister be again called to the fact that these regulations (see page 11 of Journals of the Senate) are published underUie Rules Publication Act, and that there is no necessity for their being printed asparliamentary papers. The Printing Committee, in forwarding, that letter, had no desire to question the right of the Senate to order the printing of any document, nor to assail the discretion of the Frinting Committee of that Chamber. We, in no way, criticise or' challenge the exercise of its prerogatives by the Senate. But, in the performance of the duties for which we were appointed by this House, we think that we have a perfect right to draw, the attention of the Government to what we consider-extravagance in the matter of printing. The letter was merely a continuation' of correspondence which has been conducted by me on behalf of the Printing Committee during a period of some years. The first letter on .the subject was sent to the Right Honourable Sir Edmund Barton, then Prime Minister, and' a.m., he concurred in its recommendations. We sent a second letter to the honourable member for Bland, when he was at the head of affairs, and he, too, thoroughly agreed with the Committee's suggestions. This is the third letter on the subject. Our object is to draw the attention of the Government to the facts, so that the. Prime Minister may place himself in communication with his colleague, the leader of the Senate, and informhim that certain documents are printed, published, and circulated by authority of anAct of Parliament, so that he may not inadvertently move for their printing a second time, and thus cause unnecessary expense.",13
2,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,"Ballarat -'Minister of External Affairs) [11.36] - I do not think that either Chamber would dispute the need for economy in the printing of documents. Had I been aware that the letter-was intended merely as an expression of opinion by the Printing Committee in reference to the - ordering of certain printing, I should have asked the Chairman-as I do now-to place ""himself in direct communication with the Printing Committee of the Senate.",14
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Has the Prime Minister the right to speak at this stage?,14
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I understand that he ""is making a personal explanation as to the reasons why the letter of the Printing Committee was sent on to the Senate.",14
5,Mr DEAKIX,Unknown,There has been some misunderstanding. Yesterday my honourable colleague put before the Senate the very case which has just been stated by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo.,14
6,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The Printing Committee of this House has communicated with the Printing Committee of the Senate time and again, but can get no satisfaction. That 'body seems to be purelv honorary, and does nothing.",14
7,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,It never meets.,14
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I suggest a personal - conference.,14
9,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,We have had that.,14
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I understand from the leader of the Senate that such a conference might lead to the settlement of this and any other differences.,14
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In my opinion, the proper course in matters such as this, is for the Printing Committee to report to the House, and should its report be adopted, it can be forwarded by message to the Senate. . That procedure would meet the constitutional requirements of the case. I do not think it desirable that anv Committee should communicate by letter, or in any other fashion, with a Committee of another House, unless expressly authorized so to do ""by this House. PERSONAL EXPLANATION.",14
12,Mr R EDWARDS,Unknown,"Oxley) [11.39] While speaking last night on the amendment of the honourable member for Kooyong. I said, feeling strongly that Queensland will not obtain the advantages to which she is entitled under the mail contract, because Brisbane has not beer, made a port of call for the steamers, that I condemned the Government for ignoring the interests of the State, and that it seems useless to appeal to them for justice. Apparently I was understood to say, or may unwittingly have said, that it seems useless to appeal to this House. I had no intention of using those words, because, of course, many honourable members are favourably disposed to 1 the State of which I am a representative, and, if I have accidentally hurt their feelings, I am sorry, and apologize for my mistake. BRANDING OF BUTTER.",14
13,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Are Government officers to examine, test, and brand butter under Part III . , clause 8, section 3, sub-section a of the Regulations under the Commerce (Trades Description) Act 1905? 2. If not, is the branding to be done by the factory manager or the exporter? 3. If by the factory manager or exporter, will that branding be accepted or will Government officers subsequentlv examine and test the butter to prove the accuracy of the branding? 4. Will the examination and testing, if performed by Government officers, be done on the wharf or in the store or factory, and at whose cost?",14
14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In reply to the honourable and learned member's questions I desire to say1. Exporters can either(a) Give a certificate containing the particulars prescribed in the sub-scction quoted ; or (4) Have the article tested, & c , and stamped by an officer. The accuracy of the exporter's certificate may be tested by the officers, as may also any other statement the description may include. 2. This branding or marking is to be done by the Customs only, but it is optional to factory managers or exporters to show on the coverings of butter any particulars in addition to the prescribed description. 3. See last paragraph, reply No. 1. 4. Examination and testing of butter will probably be made at appointed freezing works, or the factory, as may be decided. The exporters must supply all assistance for opening packages, handling goods, &c. NA OFFICES.",14
15,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I promised, on the 18th July, to furnish the honourable member for Grey with replies to four questions which he asked on that date relating to the closing on Saturdays of telegraph offices in the State of South tralia. The replies are as follow :1. The inconvenience naturally caused by the public being unable to send telegrams on days during the hours at which telegraph offices are open for business on otbjer week days. 2. I am not aware that the inconvenience would be affected by the nuestion of the Department was under State or Federal trol. 3. In no State do telegraph offices close at the early hour at which they were closed in Australia on Saturdays. 4. The question of uniformity with regard the hours of closing telegr:iph offices throughout the Commonwealth is under consideration. COUNTR Y POST OFFICES .",14
16,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Yesterday the honourable member for Echuca gave notice of his intention to ask the following questions:1. What conditions are required in order have a post office established in a country district ? 2. Is there any scale of business required ? 3. If so, what is the business required office ancl for a daily or bi-weekly or tri-weekly mail ? 4. When was the scale of business (if adopted ? r I was not able then to give the tion desired, but am now furnished with the following replies :1. The condition required in order to have a post office established in a country district is that the amount of correspondence and the requirements must warrant greater facilities are provided by a receiving office or loose which is usually the first form of postal facility granted. The matter is decided upon the report thing to drift of the District Inspector and the Deputy master-General of the State in each case. 2, 3, and 4. At present no uniform scale of business is laid down. The question of arrangin ing such a scale throughout the Commonwealth is under consideration, the principal difficulty the way so far having been the varying tions in the different States. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S RESIDENCES BILL . Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. BOUNTIES BILL. SECOND READING.",15
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Hume-Ministe of Trade and Customs) [11.43] - I move That the"" Bill be now read a second time. This is a measure of importance, especiweaving ally to those who are making their living upon the land, and I hope that very few honourable members will object to the course which the Government propose to take. Our proposals are by no means new. Prior Austo Federation, Victoria had inaugurated a very - extensive system of bounties.",15
18,Mr LONSDALE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The Bounties CommisSatursion has told us all about their results.,15
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I ask honourable members not to interrupt, because I whether have a great deal of interesting matconter to put before the House, and do not wish to unduly prolong my remarks. South One of the objects of this measure is to offer inducements to a large number of to our people to leave the cities and go upon the land. There is a tendency on the part of the population in Australia, as in other parts of the world, to gravitate to the large centres, and we hope that we shall be able to encourage the owners of land, either to make use of it themselves, or to afford others an opportunity of doing so. The present population of the Commonwealth is lo 4,052.000, the number resident in the capital cities being 1,435.000, whilst our urban population is 1,944,000. Therefore, in our for an capitals there are nearly as many people as are resident in the country districts. If any) we can do anything to bring about a change in this respect we shall confer great benefit informaupon the whole community.",15
20,Mr JOHNSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Are we ever going to get rid of this practice of State coddling?,15
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"It will always local be necessary for the State to help its peothan ple. The honourable member, and those who bag, are associated with him, would allow every- They would allow blackPostfellows to come here, and would do nothing to help our people. If the honourable member will look at past legislation other countries as well as in the Comin monwealth, he will see that it is necessary condifor us to encourage primary production. I regret very much that we have not been able to apply the principle of bounties to the development of our iron industry. If the majority of the people had been of the same way of thinking as myself, we should now be producing our own iron, instead of importing it. All over the world the system of assisting industry by the payment of bounties is adopted. In the Argentine Rer public exporters of sterilized milk are allowed a refund of duty on cases, packing paper, and tins. For cotton an exemption, from duty is allowed"" oh machinery, accessories, and materials necessary for the installation and working of the factory for a period of ten years. Thisis to be suspended if , within three years of installation, native-grown cotton is not whollv employed in the factory. The factory, its capital, and its products are exempted from national taxation for ten years. In Hungary the bounty system is confined to preferential railway rates on certain agricultural products. In Brazil the same procedure obtains. In Bulgaria the manufacture of yarn, and certain other articles, is encouraged by the factories being exempted for fifteen years from licensing, land, and stamp taxation, by reduced railway rates, and by a proviso thatThe produce of these factories is lo be preferred lo foreign goods in all Stales and municipal contracts, even though it be 15 psr cent, dearer than the latter, including the Customs duties paid by them. In Chili bounties are allowed on the exportation of wines and spirits, and the manufacture of beet sugar and sulphuric acid. In France, i i i order to encourage the cultivation of hemp and flax, a law, dated the 8th April, 1898, provides that for a period of six years an annual expenditure of £100,00 0 shall be allowed for bounties to growers of hemp and flax. No bounty is paid unless the surface cultivated is more than, 956 square yards in extent, and the rate of bountv is fixed by Ministerial decree. For 1902 it was fixed at about £ 1 3s. per acre. The expenditure for bounties since 1898 has been1808 ... ... ... 1899 ... ... ... 1900 ... .., ... 1901 (estimated) ... ... 100,000 1902 ,, ... ... 100,000 1903 ,, ... ... 100,000 Bounties to encourage cod fishing are granted to the crews of French vessels engaged in the industry. These bounties range from 12s. to £ 2 per head, according to the location of the fishery. A bounty on dried cod from French fisheries is also allowed, ranging from 4s. rod. to 8s. i d . per cwt., according to port of shipment and country of destination. From 1899 to -9°3 £1,037,000 has been expended in this manner. A system of preferential railway rates is also in force in connection with French products. In Germany no bounties are given for agricultural products, but in the case of goods manufactured from imported or excisable material, and afterwards exported, a drawback is allowed of the duty involved. In Italy there are no bounties, but preferential railway rates are allowed in a few unimportant cases. In Japan the Government granted a subsidy of £ 7 , 0 0 0 per annum in 1893, for a period of ten vears. to advertise and promote the com[69] 9^9 merce in Japanese tea. The Ministry of Finance are reported to be satisfied with the results obtained. In Portugal an effort was made by the Government in 1892 to encourage the consumption of native wines by the grant of a bounty to a company called the "" Companhia Vinicola de is'orte."" This association, in return for a bountv of £ 3 , 3 3 ° annually, bound itself to display exhibits and establish depots at various foreign cities, one of which was Berlin. The term fixed for the continuance of the subsidv was fifteen years, with the proviso that should the company's profits attain to a certain magnitude at the close of ten vears, a corresponding reduction in the grant should be made for the ensuing five. In Russia, in addition to the drawback of excise duty paid on the exportation of spirits, corn brandy, and preparations of : the same (infusions), the exporter receives a bountv. This bounty i& fixed at the rate of 3J per cent, for spirits of everv strength, both rectified and unrectified ; for rectified spirit not lower than 95-J per cent, proof, and satisfying the standard fixed for puritv; i j - per cent, is additionally payable to the exporter. The latter is, moreover, allowed a bountv for leakage or loss during the carriage of the spirit from the distillery to the Custom House-3 ^ per cent, for the first month of transit, 2 per 97,228 cent, for the second, ancl 1 per cent, for 97,250 the third. On rectified corn-brandy, and 97,250 preparations of the same, the bounty is fixed at =i per cent. Payment of the drawback and bounty is effected in "" instalment notes,"" calculated at the rate of 2d. per degree-the actual excise rate being 23rd. The allowance, however, on spirits extracted from frui t ancl grapes is reckoned at if d . ; the actual excise being if d . , with a like 1 addition to the rate according to the increase of the excise' duty. If the excise duty has been actually paid, the drawback is payable in full at i£d. per decree. On hemp and flax goods exported from Russia the following bounties are given : On varn and thread, unbleached, 7^d. per 36 lbs. On yarn and thread, ble.ic.hed, is. 5 i d . per 36 lbs. On tissues, unbleached, is. 6Jd. per 36 lbs. On tissues, bleached, 23. 4 f d . per 36 lbs. On tissues, dyed, & c , 3s. o£d. per 36 lbs.",15
22,Mr JOHNSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The fact that other countries have acted unwisely affords no reason why we should follow their bad example.,16
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"There is every reason why we should follow a good example when we have one set for us, and I think we shall do well to adopt methods similar to those I have indicated. It would not fee wise to follow in the footsteps of Russia in every respect, but we should take a note of what is being done in that country in order to increase production.",16
24,Mr JOHNSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The examples quoted by the Minister are shocking ones. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I hope that the honourable member will be quiet, and not continue to exhibit 'his mad antagonism to everything that is good for the country. The Bill does not deal with as many, industries as some honourable member might desire.",17
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,O r as the Minister would like.,17
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"If I had thought it desirable to deal with other industries, my colleagues would doubtless have agreed with me. I wish to quote a statement made by the honourable member for Gippsland at the Hobart Conference. In reference to bounties, he saidThese are matters which would naturally f all under the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture. Another is, of course, the Federal Government have sole power to encourage production and export by means of bounties or bonuses; then, naturally, the Federal Agricultural Department should do what it could to encourage the establishment of new and valuable industries. Tliere are many industries which are being successfully carried on in other parts of the world, and which to all appearances might be very successfully established here; but the transplanting of a new industry to a new country always involves new conditions of production. For instance, we would have to find the best seasons for planting, and the best seasons for harvesting, and many other things which involve a certain amount of risk; and therefore people are very slow to undertake that risk unless the State as a whole will give some encouragement during the first few years. *hink we should be very careful about encouraging the establishment of any industry, unless we are tolerably sure that it could be successf u l l y and profitably carried on, after it had a fair start, without any State advantage whatever in the future, and become a profitable industry to the whole Commonwealth. I quite agree with the statement of the honourable member, but at present we have not a Federal Department of Agriculture. My colleagues agree with me that the time is not very far distant when we shall have to establish a department of that kind. At present, however, the Slates have organised such departments, and perhaps it would be better for us for some years to come to work in co-operation with them, instead of duplicating expense. If the Bill be passed, we - shall probably enter into negotiations with the States Governments with a view to securing their co-operation in giving effect to our intentions. In the same way I am applying to the States to practically work the Commerce Act with the machinery at their disposal, reserving to the Commonwealth merely the supreme power of control. In Victoria, I may mention that many years ago a bounty was offered in connection with the planting of vines. The payment, I think, was based upon ihe acreage put under vines, and I am told that in a great many instances that bounty was practically wasted because sufficient inducement was not offered to the planters to obtain the best possible stock with a view to making substantial profit's at a later period.",17
27,Mr BATCHELOR,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Surely , there was the ordinary business incentive?",17
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I do not know why that incentive was lacking, but I am informed that after the planters had received the bounty, they did not proceed with the cultivation of their vines.",17
29,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The bounty must have been too high.,17
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Probably . Under this Bill we do not propose to pay any bouni'y for the cultivation of the soil, or for planting operations. We intend to pay upon results only.",17
31,Mr BATCHELOR,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Who will get the bounty-the grower or the manufacturer?,17
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The grower.,17
33,Mr BATCHELOR,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The Bill does not' say so. ' Sir WILLIAM. LYNE - If the measure be faulty in that direction, I am quite prepared to amend it. Its object is that the I grower shall obtain the bounty. In connection with the payment of the sugar bounty, I am aware that in some instances ihe growers do not get it.",17
34,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,It must be handed to the grower in the first instance.,17
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That is so. But I have, seen some of the agreements with the growers-agreement s under which the bounty is not secured to ihem in the way that it should be. Whenever we discover a weak spot in that respect, we should endeavour to provide against it. The' Bill is so framed that no bounty will be payable in respect of the articles enumerated in the schedule unless they have been produced by white labour. That provision is in accord with the declared policy of this Parliament and of the country. It is further proposed that the bounty shall become operauve only when the plants are sufficiently matured to produce the particular commodity required. Just now I heard an interjection in reference to chicory. That leads me 10 say that I have received information from one or two persons in Sydney who have been dealing in that article. From them. I gather that the granting of a bounty upon the production of chicory is not a very important matter. 1 I learn that a great deal of chicory-al most sufficient to supply the requirements of Australia-is grown in the neighbourhood of Western Port. Consequently, when we come to deal with that item, I shall move that it be omitted. I was not aware until a few weeks ago that so much chicory was produced in the locality indicated. I hold in my hand a list of articles which is interesting from the standpoint of showing how much employment might' be afforded to our own people if we produced them in sufficient quantities to provide for our own requirements. Take the article cocoa as an point. I find that the value of the raw cocoa imported into the Commonwealth in 1904 was £ 1 7 , 0 3 7 ; in 1905 it was £ 1 9 , 4 4 1 , whereas the value of the manufactured cocoa imported in those years was £157,52 7 and £ 1 8 5 , 6 8 6 respectively.",17
36,Mr BAMFORD,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We ought to produce the whole of that ourselves.,18
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"-Exactly . Last year the importations of flax and hemp were valued at £ 1 2 8 , 3 8 3 ; of preserved milk, at £ 1 9 4 , 6 5 8 ; of concentrated preserved milk, at £ 1 , 8 1 3 ; of oils, at £174,501; of rice, uncleaned, ; £ 3 > 5 5 4 ; ^ d of rubber, crude, which is 1:I not dutiable, at £1.02,983, and of rubber manufactures, n.e.i., at £ 1 2 9 , 4 8 2 .",18
38,Mr SKENE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Pound s sterling?,18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Yes . At the present stage I do not intend to deal in detail with the various articles in respect of which I have information. I propose to have that information printed, and copies of it distributed amongst honourable members. In this connection, I may say that a great deal of very valuable data has been placed in my hands by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who has gone to considerable trouble to supply it. I mayinform honourable members that the Government have had under consideration the advisableness of grantinga bounty upon the production of a number of other articles, [ 6 ] -2 9 but, after discussing the matter very carefully, it was not deemed desirable to go further than we have gone in this Bill .  made in the measure for the grower.",18
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"If the honourable member is of opinion that the Bill is weak in that respect we are quite prepared to amend it. It is intended to benefit the grower. If honourable members will defer raising objections to it until the measure reaches Committee, they will enable me to get along much faster than I can do if I am called upon to reply to a running fire of interjections",18
41,Mr BATCHELOR,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,But the Bill should make it perfectly clear whether the bounty is to be paid upon the finished article or to the grower.,18
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,At the end of the Bill the honourable member will see that certain powers are vested in the Minister to make regulations. I can assure him that the bulk of the money is intended to go to the grower. The Bill is designed to prevent the manufacturer from fleecing him. instance in,18
43,Mr HUTCHISON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The Bill says that the ""owner of the land shall be deemed to have been employed in the production of the goods,"" although, as a matter of fact, he may have nothing to do with it.",18
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The principle is that the bounty shall be paid to the grower. In some cases in which it must be paid upon the finished article, I wish so to frame the measure that it shall provide that the producer shall get the larger share of it .",18
45,Mr HUTCHISON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Then this is a very at ill-considered Bill .,18
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"If that be so, the honourable member must blame the draftsman. Under the Bill a bounty of i d . per lb. will be paid upon manufactured cocoa. I have already mentioned the importations of raw and manufactured cocoa. I think that the quantity of cocoa imported into the Commonwealth is sufficiently large to warrant us straining every nerve to produce that article for ourselves. I quite admit that it cannot be grown in the south of Australia. I recognise that it can only be successfully cultivated in the northern parts of the Commonwealth. In dealing with that question we might well consider the prospects of the successful cultivation of cocoa in the Northern Territory. That Territory-if transferred to the Commonwealth - would be very much benefited if a stimulus were imparted to the production of cocoa by the granting of a bounty.",18
47,Mr HUTCHISON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Then send Dr Holtze up to the Territory. He will grow it successfully.,19
48,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Dee s the Minmanufacturer, ister think that a bounty of i d . per Ib. will be sufficient ?",19
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"-Before the honourable member entered the Chamber I referred to an experiment which was undertaken in Victoria some years which provided for the payment of a bounty upon the acreage put under vines. I stated that that experiment was a failure, and the honourable member for Wide Bay at once interjected that probably that result was clue to the fact that the bounty was too large.",19
50,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,That was not the cause of the failure.,19
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,I am not suffiit ciently acquainted with all that took place upon that occasion to say definitely what was the direct cause of the failure. No doubt we shall hear what it was from the honourable member for Moira.,19
52,Mr BATCHELOR,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,What is the maximum years. amount of bounties to be paid each year?,19
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The maximum now is j£5°> °°- UndeT the heading of "" Fish 0 - canne d or tinned,"" I notice a typograis phical error. The amount payable in relb. spect of that item should be £ 11,000not £.1,000, as it appears in the Bill . do not wish to enter into details, but may inform honourable members that I have .a mass of information in mv possession which I regard as of sufficient importance warrant its printing and distribution amongst them. Consequently, I content imported, myself at the present stage with dealing merely with summaries. Instead of ing the details published in Hansard I inper annum. tend to get them printed and circulated in a handv form.",19
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Why not hand to Hansard for publication?,19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The Prime land coffee in this House. Minister reminds me that twelve months have been absorbed in securing this infornumber mation.,19
56,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Put it in Hansard.,19
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I do not profor the purpose. pose to read the whole of it, but I intend to have it printed. The quantitv of formation I have would probably be found to occupy too much space in Hansard, and can be conveniently published in' the form of a paper. It is proposed to give a bounty-of i d . per ib. on dried beans. I do not know whether the honourable member for Boothby was referring to this item when he said the grower, and not the would receive the bounty.",19
58,Mr HUTCHISON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Uncle r the Bill the owner of the land mav secure it. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - If the Bill is defective in any respect we can amend it.,19
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"It is . a case of ago, and ""just say what vou want.""",19
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I say that the principle of the Bil l is sound, and that, although some honourable members occasionally accuse me of obstinacy, I am quite prepared to vary the wording should it appear to be wrong. This bounty is to extend over a period of nine years. The cocoa plant takes from four to five years to mature. It is said that in some cases does not reach maturity for a period of nine years, but that is the exception to the rule. Under our proposal, therefore, assuming that the p'lants reach .maturity in four years, the producers of the dried beans would participate in the bonus for five The life of the cocoa plant I am informed is about thirty years. I come to our proposal in regard to the production of coffee. A duty of 3d. per lb. imposed on raw coffee, and of 5d. per on roasted or ground coffee. In 1904 the imports of raw coffee comprised - I 1,291,114 lbs. valued at £ 3 7 , 6 6 8 , whilst I the imports of coffee ground, & c , consisted of 403,529 Ibs. valued at ,-£20,523. In 1905, 1,754,866 lbs. of raw coffee to valued at £ 5 4 , 4 8 2 were imported, whilst 324,558 lbs. weight of ground, & c , were the value being £ i 6 . q 2 8 . So far as I have been able to ascertain, the havproduction in Australia totals 83,632 lbs.  gentleman made any inauiry as to whether them the producers prepare the article?",19
61,Mr BAMFORD,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We have had Queens,19
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I know that a of gentlemen established coffee plantations on Norfolk Island, and that the soil and climate there are most suitable Whether or not an arrangement can be made to allow coffee inproduced there to enter Australia free of duty, I cannot say, but at present it is being grown on Norfolk Island uncler very great difficulties. I believe that, as a rule, the growers there send the berry somewhere else to be ground, but we all know that any one can grind coffee beans.  the growers would not secure the bounty ?",19
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The grower will receive the bounty. It is proposed to give a bounty of i d . per lb. on dried coffee beans, and that that bounty shall extend over a period of eight years. no case is more than £ 2 , 5 0 0 to be paid away in any one year in respect of the production of coffee beans. I clo not know how long the coffee plant takes to reach maturity, but I am advised that it is about three years. If that statement be correct the bounty will be pavable during a period of five years.",20
64,Mr BAMFORD,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,It takes from three to four years.,20
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"My information is that it takes three years, but probably the honourable member's statement is correct. There are very large areas, not only in Norfolk Island, but in certain parts of New South Wales and Queensland, ancl the northern parts of South Australia and AVestern Australia, where coffee can be produced, and the industry is one that certainly ought to be well advanced. It should not be necessary for us to import as much as we do at the present time. There is ample room for a rapid increase in its production here.",20
66,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,What about the bountv on chicory ?,20
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,I stated before the honourable member entered the Chamber that I did not intend to proceed with that proposal.,20
68,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,I should think not.,20
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"As the honourable member is in agreement^ with me in regard to that matter, we ought not to quarrel about it. The next item in the list relates to cotton, to the production of which the northern parts of Australia are peculiarly adapted. When I was in Queensland about 1864. I saw, on the Logan River, a cotton plantation where the plants were growing very well indeed. attempts have since been made to establish the industry there, but they have not been altogether successful. For the information of the House I shall quote the statistics as to our imports of cotton, which is free. In 1904 we imported 537,793 lbs., valued at 973 £ 1 1 , 8 4 4 , and in 1905, 1,049,306 lbs., valued at £ 2 0 , 9 6 2.",20
70,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Ra w cotton.,20
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The statement from which I am quoting does not indicate whether it was or was not raw cotton. The word "" cotton "" is used. The quantity of cotton produced in Australia is very small. In 1904, 30 acres were grown in Queensland, ancl cotton in seed netted In 1 4-5ths of a penny per lb. f.o.b. Brisbane, whilst ginned cotton realized 6Jd. to 4$d. f.o.b. there. It is proposed that the bounty shall extend over a period of five years, and. that it shall be 10 per cent, on the market value, payable in respect of quantities of not less than one bale of 300 lbs. The reason we have decided that this bounty shall be payable for only five years is that the time occupied by this plant in reaching maturitv is not as long as in the case of other plants to which I have referred. The producers of this cotton will enjoy the bounty for, at all events, four years. I need hardly remind honourable members that whilst we have refrained from proposing to grant the bounty for an extended period, it is always open to the Parliament to readjust the bounty, and, if necessary, to extend the period during which it shall be payable. We should be able to grow in Queensland and the northern parts of South Australia and Western Australia, a great deal, 'if not all, the cotton we reauire.",20
72,Mr LIDDELL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Who would pick it?,20
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I have before me a statement that it has been discovered that cotton can be grown in other parts of the world by means of white labour. If that be so, why could not white labour be employed in its production here? The idea so firmly entertained by Australian producers a few years ago that white labour could not be substituted for black labour-in certairTindustries is rapidlv dyinsr awav. It was said, for instance, to be impossible to grow sugar by white labour, but that objection is vanishing into thin air. I feel that that will be our experience in regard to other industries.",20
74,Mr R EDWARDS,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Do the Government provide a bountv for the manufacture of Several cotton piece-goods?,20
75,Mr DEAKIN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Not under this Bill. We must first obtain our raw material.,20
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"r come now to a very important proposal in relation to the production of fibres. Our proposition is that for ten years a bounty of 10 per cent. on the fair value shall be payable on the that is seen to be desirable. production of fibres, but that the total sum be paid in the first few years. so paid away shall not exceed £ 6 , 0 0 0 any one year. Under the heading of we have flax, ramie, sisal hemp, hemp, New Zealand flax, pandanus, and other approved fibres. Flax, hemp fibre, and coir, other fibre are allowed to come in free of duty ; on manufactured articles there is duty of 20 per cent-, whilst reaper and prevail. binder twine is subject to a duty of 5s. laide. per cwt. In 1904 our imports of flax and hemp were of the value of £ 1 4 5 , 9 2 5 , comprised 85,049 cwts. Of this amount, £ 7 3 , 9 9 3 represents the value of importain tions of New Zealand flax. During the same year, 7,459 cwts. of coir, valued at ^3>535> and 4,462 cwts. of jute, valued may not be reduced. at £ 4 , 3 5 4 , were imported; whilst in the imports were as follows:-Coir , 9,885 stringently. cwts., valued at £ 3 , 3 0 3 ; flax and hemp, 74,186 cwts., valued at £ 1 2 8 , 3 8 3 jute, 3,622 cwts., valued at £ 2 , 6 7 1 . The import value of cordage and twines in 1904 was £ 9 1 , 4 3 6, and of twine and yarn valued ;£54>578. I have no record of the imof ports of other fibres in 1904; but they comprised 3,500 cwts., of the value of .£5,146. It was at first proposed that a that was salmon? bounty of £ 3 per ton should be granted, but since the values of the different species vary so materially, it was considered that Australian seas. it would be better to give a bounty of per cent, on fair value for a period of years. On such fibres as New Zealand flax, ramie, and sisal hemp, the of which is not available until three or four years after planting, the bounty would be payable for only six or seven years. These were very large importations. It is remarkable that a country possessing every description of soil and climate should not grow all these kinds of fibre, and thus give employment to a large number of its own people, instead of obtaining its requirements from abroad to such an extent as at present.",20
77,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,How long does it take to produce coir ?,21
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,My informato tion is that it takes from three to four years to produce the raw material. give That will leave six or seven years in which to take advantage of the bounties.,21
79,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Th takes seven vears to bear.,21
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I do not to make the bountv period too long; but we can easily extend it in amy case in which Nothing wil) We havein fixed the period at ten years, and propose fibres to pay 10 per cent, on the market value of the article produced, or about £ 3 per ton. We also propose to offer a bounty for the and production of tinned and canned fish.",21
81,Mr HUTCHISON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"We cannot get enougha fresh fish, because of the monopolies which, I know that that is so in Ade",21
82,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"We should beand able to put an end to these monopolies. It has happened in Melbourne, and I believeSydney, too, fhat, when there has beero a surplus of fish caught, a large quantity has been destroyed, in order that the prices, Such action is dis1905 graceful, and should be dealt with very Notwithstanding the largequantity of fish in the waters which sur; and round our coasts, honourable members may be surprised to learn that Australia imported! last year 13,463,838 lbs. of tinned fish, at £ 2 8 8 , 3 7 1 , and 1,275,175 lbs.. fish, smoked or preserved by cold proin 1905 cess, valued at £ 1 6 , 5 0 5 .",21
83,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,How much o i,21

85,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Do they comeevery year ?,21
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I think so r though in some years they are more numerous than in other years. I think that the honourable member will find, if he reads a> report made to the Government of New South Wales by the Fisheries Commissionof that State, that these fish travel along our coast every year, and practically none of them are caught. They could, if sufficient inducements were offered to attract the necessary energy and capital, be used' establish an industry almost equalling the herring industry - It is proposed to a bountv of Jd. per lb. on all canned and tinned' fish produced within a period of five years, the payments mot to exceed* e cocoa tree £ 1 , 0 0 0 a year.",21
87,Mr HUTCHISON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We need a bounty for wish the production of fresh fish.,21
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"If the task is. not undertaken by private persons, the Government should endeavour to discover trawling grounds, and to find out what fish can be obtained by trawling. An attempt to obtain such information was made some - years ago by the Government of New South Wales, but it was practically a failure, because neither the proper, appliances nor the right kind of steamer were used. I think that honourable members will find that the Treasurer, when delivering his Budget speech, will have something to say about the fishing industry, and I do not wish to - forestall him. The Government will not shut their eves to the importance of the industry, but it cannot be dealt with in a Bill iof this character.",21
89,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Will the Minister ascertain, and inform the House, what quantity of salmon is annually imported?",22
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,I shall try to get the information.. But why should we not use our own fish in preference to imported fish?,22
91,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We have no salmon.,22
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"We have fish just as good, if we care to use it. ""We propose to give a bounty of Jd. per lb. for ithe production of condensed milk. bounty is to be paid during a period of five years, but the payments madein any one - year are not to exceed £5,000.",22
93,Mr THOMAS,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Condense d milk is now ibeing made in Australia.,22
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The honourable - and learned member for Illawarra can inform honourable members as to what happened in connection with the industry in the electoral division which he represents.,22
95,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Condensed milk is being made in Victoria.,22
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Not to any extent,22
97,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"All that is made is sold. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - Condense d milk is being_ made in Sydney also; but, notwithstanding, the quantity imported, is very large. The duty on sweetened condensed - milk is i d . per lb., but in 1904 11,196,882 lbs., or £197>253 worth were imported; the importation in 1905 being 10,895,469 lbs., - valued at £194,658. The exports for 1904 were only £4,018. The local production is valued at between £20,000 and £30,000 per annum, while the importations are worth about ,£200,000 per annum.",22
98,Mr HUTCHISON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Our producers cannot - compete against the rubbish which comes in.,22
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We are trying to assist them to do so.,22
100,Mr HUTCHISON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"To assist them we must shut out the rubbish, so that they may manufacture a good article.",22
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Our proposals will give a fillip to the industry, and, perhaps, we may do something else in another way later on. We propose to treat powdered milk in the same way as condensed milk, but the rate of bounty will be f d . per lb. One hundred pounds of milk yield about 36 lbs. of sweetened condensed milk, or about 13 lbs. of powdered milk.",22
102,Mr THOMAS,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,There is a big importation of eggs into New South Wales. Is a bounty to be paid for the production of eggs?,22
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,There is a big importation of Chinese eggs. We cannot give a bounty to hens to induce them to lay more eggs.,22
104,Mr THOMAS,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We could give a bounty to those who keep fowls. I know that at present I cannot make fowl-keeping pay.,22
105,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"When at Mildura I was very much struck with the statement that it is intended to dig up all That the olive - trees there, because they are not profitable. I think that that is a great pity, in view of the proportions which the olive oil. industry might reach in this country if it were properly fostered. The duty on olive oil is is. 4d. per gallon. In 1904 28,420 gallons were imported, valued at £6,518. In addition, £38,857 worth of castor oil, and £17,597 worth of China oil which comes in duty free, were imported. On linseed there is a duty of 6d. per gallon, and its importation was valued at £108,147 while £2,160 worth of colza oil was imported. We propose to give a bounty on the production of ""oils extending over a period of ten years, and amounting to 10 per cent, on the market value, the payments not to exceed £6,500 in anyone year. It has been objected that these bounties may not go to the producers; but I hope that they will go partly to the producers and partly to the manufacturers. No doubt, if the industry flourishes, and production is increased, growers will be able to supply the manufacturers at more reasonable rates than are now charged. Th'at, however, is a detail to be dealt with afterwards. In 1905 16,3.30 gallons, or £3,512 worth of olive oil, £21,784 worth of China oil, £80,235 worth of linseed oil, £9,453 worth of cotton seed oil, and £25,969 worth of essential oils were imported. As the olive tree flourishes in Australia, we might reasonably be expected to supply our own requirements in the matter of olive oil. Very little rice is grown in the Commonwealth.",22
106,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Some is grown in Queensfand.,23
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The Prime Minister has reminded me that in other parts of the world it is being produced by white labour, and there must be large areas suitable for its cultivation on the Gulf of Carpentaria, and elsewhere in Northern Queensland, and, perhaps, Westerr. Australia.",23
108,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,An experiment in growing rice has just been commenced on the Murray.,23
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"An article which appeared in the American Review of Reviews, written by Robert S. Lanier, shows what is being done in this matter in America. The article is headed "" The Revolution in Rice Farming,"" and is as follows :Now, the settlers have seen labour saving implements make wlieat fortunes in the Dakotas and California. Why could not they themselves make these Gulf prairies blossomwith rice at a profit? Accordingly, they brought on the wheat machinery they were used to, they adapted it to the new crop, they worked out irrigation methods, and vvith Government help found the best seed varieties. Here is one result of their labours : before the Civil War, South Carolina produced about three-fourths of our home rice; North Carolina and Georgia most of the rest. To-day, it is Louisiana and Texas that produce three-fourths of the whole. However, the greatest result is that, for the first time in history, a labour-saving method of rice-production has been demonstrated. American farmer, although he pays a higher price for labour than any rice grower in the world, may eventually find himself in control of the world's markets. The patient Chinaman with his mud-rake and his twenty-five dollars a year profit, the Punjab ryot's women wielding their slow hand-sickles, the toiling fellah of the Nile delta, the Japanese mattocking his plot, too tiny for a flow to turn-al l will be undersold by the progressive American driving his four mule twine binder to his power cultivated fields, past the steam plant where a battery of clanking pumps, impelled by eight hundred horse-power, has sucked up to his growing crop its seventy-day bath of vital, fresh river water. Down on the Gulf coast, one farmer, one helper, and good teams can prepare and plant to rice two hundred or three hundred acres. In general, rice can be Drofitablv grown by the new methods wherever there is land so level that large single fields can be uniformly flooded by fresh water, and possessing enough clay, either in soil or subsoil, to hold water and quickly to drain the fields dry enough for the support of heavy terms. This shows what can be done by the employment of machinery, and indicates to us how we might carry on the cultivation of rice in Australia. At present we levy a duty of 3s. 46. per central upon uncleaned rice. Starch rice is free, But rice n.e.i. is subject to a duty of 6s. per central. In 1904 we imported 232,611 centals of uncleaned rice, valued at £107,070, and 267,574 centals df rice n.e.i., valued at £129,465. In J905 we imported 259,004 centals of uncleaned rice, valued at £113,554, whilst of rice n.e.i. we imported 253,319 centals, valued at £112,939. Rice is worth 2^d. per Ib. The local production is very small indeed; in fact, we cannot ascertain that any is produced.",23
110,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,All rice is not worth 2jd. per lb.,23
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That is the information given to me. We propose to grant a bounty of £ 1 per ton of unhusked rice for five years. Now we come to the last item in the schedule, namely, rubber. Last night, I had an interview with the manager of the Dunlop Tyre Company, who told me that if we could produce rubber in the northern parts of Australia-and there is, no doubt that it could be produced, because we have a native rubber tree which is capable of being cultivated with advantage - 'his company would purchase £10,000 worth of rubber per month. In view of this large local demand, every encouragement should be offered to planters to engage in the enterprise. It is proposed to give a bounty which will not exceed £7,000 per annum for a period of ten The years, under conditions to be prescribed by regulation. We have not been able to fix the rate at which the bounty shall be payable, because the matter is a difficult one to deal with. At present, crude rubber is admitted free of duty, but we levy 15 'per cent, upon rubber manufactured n.e.i. In 1904 our importations of rubber manufactures, including crude rubber, which were admitted free, were valued at £100,389, whilst the imports of rubber manufactures n.e.i. were valued at £100,275. In 1905 the imports free of duty were valued at £102.983, whilst the rubber manufactures n.e.i. introduced were valued at £129.482. At present the rubber used by the Dunlop Company comes from Java, or South America, and their consumption is very large. They offer to take rubber to the value of £10.000 per month, or in all, £120,000 worth per annum. I have referred seriatim to the matters dealt with in the Bill , and I hope I have sufficiently explained them to honourable members. I trust that they will have no hesitation in passing the Bill , because if we can merely meet our own requirements, to say nothing of exporting the commodities mentioned, we shall confer a great benefit on the communitv generally. We should have preferred to bring forward this measure at an earlier stage, but it was impracticable to do so. We should! also have liked to embrace a much larger number of items, but we did' not think it wise to submit any more comprehensive programme at the present time. We have endeavoured to make' provision for the encouragement of those industries which can most readily be developed, and which will conduce in the greatest degree to the settlement of our territory.",23
112,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Echuca) [12.55] - I think it is unfortunate that a larger number of members have not been present to listen to the very interesting speech delivered by the Minister upon a subject of vital interest to the people of Australia.,24
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I think that might have a quorum. [Quorum formed.""]",24
114,Unknown,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Sitting suspended from 1.0 to 2.0 p.m.,24
115,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I think it is a grave rebenefit. flection on this Parliament that, although nearly six years have elapsed since its inception, this Bill represents the first tempt that has yet been made towards veloping our primary productions. HowBill, ever, it is refreshing to find that the vernment are awakening to a recognition the fact that something requires to be done in that direction. Hitherto the only stimulus which has been imparted to agriculture has been by way of the bounty which has been so generously granted for the purpose fostering the sugar industry. I am glad to know that the Government are now ing their attention to the development other products. I need not surmise why they are taking this step. I can only press my gratification that attention is devoted to this particular matter. It is fortunate that the Bill is so badly drawn, and it was scarcely fair of the Minister saddle the draftsman with the blame this connection, because we all know that the Parliamentary Draftsman merelv frames a measure in accordance with the instrucsolve tions which he has received from the ister. The statement that the Bill can be our work with that of the States. altered in Committee shows that the ister of Trade and Customs has an open mind upon it, and is prepared to accept amendments. To my mind there is no B i ll which ought to be considered less of a party measure than ought this. It is a Bill upon which honourable members can express themselves freelv without being open to the taunt that their criticisms are prompted byparty motives. Another reason why we should express out opinions - freely, is that the step which we are now asked to take is a very grave one. We should endeavour to pay the greatest attention to it, in order that we may start upon sound lines, and not be subsequently called upon to retrace our steps. Whilst fully agreeing with the"" system of bounties, I doubt whether the proposals which have been submitted today are best suited to the requirements of Australia at the present time. The Bill proposes that we should spend a very large sum of money, namely, £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The expenditure of that amount, if directed into proper channels, would prove of incalculable benefit to this country. If , on the contrary, it is 'frittered away, we may continue the system of granting bounties for we six or eight years, and at the end of that time find ourselves asking, "" What benefit have we derived from this expenditure?""",24
116,Mr LONSDALE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We shall derive no,24
117,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I do not agree with my athonorable friend. In some respects, I like dethe proposals which are embodied in the though they are scarcely upon the Golines that I should have chosen mvself. of If we look at the circumstances of Australia today, we find that a large extent of our territory is arid. I suppose that, after we utilize to the fullest extent all our water resources, 90 per cent, of our terriof tory will be absolutely dependent upon the rainfall. In other words, we shall have turna territorv as large as that of Europe, of which will be dependent upon the natural rainfall. Consequently, we should ask ourexselves, "" Can this great tract of country being be made wealth-producing, or must it alunways-by reason of the intermittent character of the seasons-remai n a place where to all the operations of the producer are a in mere gamble-wher e there is no cerfainty that he will secure a return from one year to another. Our first attempt should be to this great problem. In making that Minattempt we should endeavour to co-ordinate We Minshould co-operate with them in what they, are doing. The Minister has expressed a similar opinion, but I would point out that the Bill contains nothing in the shape of proposals to that end. We know that some States are doing a very great deal towards developing their territory, whilst others are doing very little. At Perth, in Western Australia, there is a station which is accomplishing a little. In Queensland there is the Gatton College, which takes students, and which, within its circumscribed area, is performing good work. In New South Wales there is the Hawkesburv College, and several' other institutions which are rendering excellent service ; and in Victoria, we have the Dookie College and the Longerenong institution, although as a Victorian I am 'bound to confess that they have not proved the success which they should have been. The Dookie College has not sent out one man who has left the imprint of his individuality upon farming operations in this country.",24
118,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,How long has that institution been in existence?,25
119,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"For about twenty years. The fact which I have just mentioned evidences that there is something wrong in connection with the Dookie College. South Australia possesses a college at Roseworthy, but in Tasmania there is no such institution.",25
120,Mr HUME COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Is not the Dookie College merely a preliminary school ? Do not the boys leave it when they are about seventeen years of age?,25
121,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Some of the pupils are twenty-five years 'of age, according to the evidence.",25
122,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"We must deal with the problems presented by our arid country. Until we do .so we can have no permanent settlement. In the first place, the soil requires to be so treated that all the moisture precipitated shall enter it, and be stored tliere for plant use. In order to accomplish this, it needs to be worked by special cultural methods. Then we require to plant crops which are adapted to our soil and climate. We must further 1 develop the seed that we get. in order to obtain that which is most suitable to the conditions of our country. Then we must learn the right time and manner of planting that seed. It is well known that crops grown under arid conditions are better than those which are produced under more humid conditions. If we can accomplish something in that direction we shall be moving upon right lines. In regard to the cultivation of tropical products we must always recollect that they will have to compete with the cheap labour of the world. For a very long time the market for thoseproducts will be outside our own country, and consequently I do not think it is eithernecessary or desirable to introduce into thisBill restrictions as to the class of Labour that shall be employed in their cultivation. It seems to me that our present restrictivelaws are sufficient to enable us to deal with that aspect of the question without imposing upon the growers of these productsany more restrictions than are absolutely necessary. As far as is possible, consistently with the d'eclared policy of"" this: country, we should allow them as much freedom in carrying out their experimentsas we can. Then the Minister has given, us absolutely no information whatever regarding the organization under which effect is to be given to the provisions of the Bill. When proposals involving such an enormousexpenditure are submitted to the House, it is only reasonable that details as to how they are to be carried out should also besupplied. It seems to me that we ought to have adopted the advice which was. given to us some years agOj and to have had' in existence today a Federal Department of Agriculture. Honourable members will recollect that in June, 1901, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo brought that matter under the notice of the House. It was then dropped for a period of three years, but in July, 1904, the honourable and learned member again pressed the subject upon the attention of Parliament. Hisproposal was supported in most eloquent speeches by the Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, the honourable member for Macquarie, and others, but up to the present time nothing whatever has been done to give .effect to it. I . contend that we need not start upon elaborate lines. If we commenced operations upon a small scale, and allowed the Department to grow gradually, we should be acting wisely. If we did that, and co-operated with the States, we should be confident that the undertaking would he efficiently supervised, and that our operations would tend to ultimate success. In moving the second reading of the Bill, the Minister of Trade and Customs referred to the experiment which was made in Victoria, in granting a bounty upon the planting of vines. I was a member of the State Parliament when those proposals were submitted, in 1886 or 1887. They were very much better thought out than are the proposals contained in the Bill under - consideration. They were submitted by the Hon. J. L. Dow, who has always been .a strong supporter and sincere friend of the agriculturist. Their objects were as - follow :First, to induce the farmers throughout the - Colony to enter upon the growth of additional products by means of acreage bonuses, in order that they may not confine their attention to the production of one or two cereal crops; second, ito promote an improvement in the quality and packing of dairy produce, fresh fruits, and - wines exported to the London market; third, to induce the establishment of factories for fruit canning, fruit drying, dairying, wine-making, raisin and currant making, vegetable oil making, and preparing for the manufacture of flax, ihemp, silk, and other products to be named in regulations; fourth, for the introduction of new - varieties of seeds and plants; fifth, for the - establishment of a system of agricultural - technical education; sixth, for the publication of agricultural reports; and, seventh, for the introduction of new kinds of agricultural machinery and appliances. I should very much Jike to have seen a - comprehensive proposition submitted to this Parliament, instead of the proposals which are embodied in the measure before MS, great and useful as many of them are.",25
123,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The proposals contained in this Bill are merely am earnest of what we intend to do.,26
124,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"But they involve such a large expenditurethat I fear other matters with, which it is essential we should - deal immediately will be relegated to the background for many years. The bonuses arranged to be given by the Victorian Government totalled £250,000, and were to - extend over five years.",26
125,Mr WILKS,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Did they do any good?,26
126,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"So far as I am aware, the butter bonus was the only one that had a beneficial effect. Whilst a large proportion of that bonus went into the hands of merchants and middlemen, the whole of it - did not do so, because in many cases the prices which they paid to the producers for their cream were increased owing to the fact that they were to receive the bonus - on the export of the butter.",26
127,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Tri e agents collected the bonus, but the producers secured a great deal of it.",26
128,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That is so. The - agents have been blamed for having secured the whole of the butter bonus, but, as I have already pointed out, a great part of i i went to the producers in the shape of increased prices for their cream or butter. The Victorian proposals, to which I have referred, were much wiser, more comprehensive, and far more suited to our circumstances than are those now submitted to us. When we examine the Bill, we find that the bouniies are to be paid on goods, and not on crops. It is specified that they are to assist agricultural development, and they have been heralded with the cry of "" Protection for ihe farmers."" They will certainly give assistance to the farmers, but they will not constitute protection for the farmer in the sense that we understand the term. They will probably help some but not many farmers. I believe that the Government proposals will play into the hands of the manufacturers, and help them to a much greater extent than the farmers. I understand, however, that that is not the intention of ihe Minister. The honourable gentleman emphasized the point v that his desire was to assist the primaryproducer. I would remind the House, however, that under this Bill, the bounties are to be payable only on the finished product placed on the market. We shall find that the great bulk of them will be paid to those who turn the raw material inio various manufactures, and not to those who actually produce it.",26
129,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The definition of "" manufactured"" will cover a good deal.",26
130,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That is so. The Minister has expressed his disapproval of the system of paying on acreage. If we are to help the farmers, however, that is the system we should adopt. We should divide these bounties into two parts, and pay the farmer separately for the work that he honestly performs-for the cultivation of his land and for the production of the raw material which the manufacturer can work up inio the finished product. We ought' to pay the farmer according to the quality and quantity of the raw article that he produces. With one or two exceptions, ihe bounties are to be paid on the manufactured product, arid, therefore, the manufacturer will reap the benefit.",26
131,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,To what items does the 1 honourable member refer? 0,26
132,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Ric e and cocoa are the only raw materials in respect of which - bounties are io be paid.,26
133,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The first three bounties in the schedule to the Bill will all go to 9 the farmers. And so with fibrous products.,26
134,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The Government do not intend to proceed with the proposal in regard to chicory. If a proposal like this had beeri made with respect to the payment of the sugar bounty the House would not have accepted it. We insisted that the bounty on sugar grown by white labour should be paid direct to the farmer. If that is the correct policy to pursue with regard to the production of sugar by white labour, why should we not follow it in dealing with other primary industries?",27
135,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,It is the right policy to apply all round.,27
136,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Why should the Minister condemn the system of paying according to acreage-o n the raw material, instead of on the manufactured products? The honourable gentleman said that four or five years would elapse before a return would be obtained in respect of some of these manufactured products. What farmer would be prepared to till his soil and waste his time for the sake of a prospective return so far ahead ? We should pay the former on his own work. He will grow the raw material, but in very few cases will he treat it. The will be - in the hands of other parries, upon whom he shall have to depend. The farmer may put his best work into the cultivation of one of these products, whilst the reward for his industry will depend on the treatment of what he produces by some one else. What guarantee will the farmer have that the raw material that he produces will be treated in such a way as to secure a return to him in the shape of a bounty ? Cocoa and rice are the only two raw products in respect of which bounties are to be paid, and we find that the bounties payable in respect of them are very small. In all other cases the bounties will be payable in respect of manufactured articles.",27
137,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Do not forget fibres? . Mr MCCOLL - All the fibres will also require considerable treatment before the bonus on them can be paid. The farmer should be paid for what he grows and puts on his waggon for delivery to the person who is to treat it . To the farmers in the Minister's electorate, as well as in that which I represent, and also in. South Australia and Western Australia, these bounties will be practically valueless. Very few will be able to take advantage of them. Whilst in Bounties Bill. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bounties Bill. themselves these bounties are good to a certain extent, do not let us delude the farmer into the belief that they are going to participate in their distribution, when the great bulk of them are not likely to do so. I believe, however, that these proposals will do good. The Government proposal, although not altogether on the lines that I favour, is in the right direction. In making this, our first attempt to encourage primary industries, we should fake care that we start on sound lines. Another point is fhat the Bill itself is a mere skeleton. The whole body of the proposals wilt lie in the regulations.",27
138,Mr WILKS,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,It is like all Bills introduced by the Government.,27
139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"And good regulations, too.",27
140,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"This is another illustration of the character of the legislation we are passing. Skeleton Bills are passed, and everything that is to be done under them is defined in regulations drawn up by officials. There is no proposal that the regulations under this Bill shall be placed! before Parliament. We do not iknow what shape they will take, or whether they will carry out the object we have in treatment view. They will be framed at the will of the Minister. The honourable .gentleman says that he will invite the co-operation of the experimental farms, but he is to have supreme power, under this Bill. He is to prescribe who may be employed!, what wages shall be paid, what acreage is to be cultivated, and what bounties shall be paid, and he is also to fix the time that must elapse between the growth of the product and its manufacture in a form to warrant payment of"" the bounty. He is to have a stiU greater power-the power, at his own sweet will, to divert a bounty from one product to another. These powers are too great. I hold that the regulations under this Bill should be submitted"" to the House, and that the whole scheme should be subject to proper supervision. We have no indication, however, that that courseis to be followed. In the face of these drawbacks to what are otherwise good proposals, what farmer is going to risk his time and monev in seeking to earn the bounty? If bounties are to be given, let them be allocated between the various parties instrumental in placing these new products on the market. If that be not done, the whole scheme will fail. Thefarmers will not take it up, but we shall have a combination of farmers audi manufacturers making arrangements to secure the bounties. Wealthy people who can afford to buy the necessary land, employ the requisite labour, and wait until the result of their work appears in the shape of the manufactured article, when they can claim the bounty, will take up these proposals. The ordinary working farmer, whom this Bill is intended to help, will not participate in the bounties except to the verysmallest extent. The provisions in regard to the employment of coloured labour are somewhat ludicrous. It is interesting to learn that a man who has one white parent may be employed in producing any of these articles, but I do not know why ethnological problems should be submitted to us in a Bill of this character. one white parent will have a chance, but who is to prescribe the degree of whiteness necessary to enable a man to participate in these bounties? Perhaps, it will be necessary to produce a certincate of marriage.",27
141,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,I presume that the honourable member doe? not desire that Hindoos shall be engaged in producing rice on which the bounty 'is paid.,28
142,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"No ; but under this Bill a coloured man, even if he employs white labour in producing one of the articles on which a bountv is to be paid, will not be allowed to participate in it. A coloured man from a country where some of these products are grown might be disposed to come here, purchase an area of land, and produce some of these articles by white labour; but he would be unable to secure the bountv. . If we hamper these proposals in such an arbitrary way, we shall probably deter people from embarking on these newindustries. Our ordHnary immigration restriction laws should deal with theso matters, instead of their being dealt with in a measure for the advancement of the industrial welfare of Australia. yet to be shown whether white labour can successfully grow these products in the north, where many of them can be raised. Throughout the rest of the world manv of these products are grown by coloured men, and it is with the products of these men, i;vinrr under the lowest conditions, that we shall have to compete. obtained some information with regard to the production of rice, which is undergoing not in the councils of the free-traders. great changes in the United States of may be said that it is easy to criticise; America. In the Carolinas and other what would you propose? I desire to parts of the United States, where rice is grown on swamps near the seashore, the sea has encroached on lands previously used for rice cultivation, and rendered it totally unfit for that purpose. As the result of this encr'pachmeint the jrice-growers have been obliged to go to the uplands of Louisiana and Texas-no t California, as the Minister said-and to form artificial swamps there for their crops. Rice must be grown in swamps. It has to be planted in water, and after that water has been allowed to remain for a certain time it must be drained off. I o America they have made great levees, and have placed on the rivers immense pumping plants, because the water has to be flooded over the land very quickly, and got rid of again at the proper time with equal rapidity. In this way A man with rice is being grown which is equal to that grown in any other part of the world. The labour employed cloes not consist entirely of white men, much of it being Chinese and Japanese, while, in some cases, European aliens are engaged. There is nothing to prevent us from growing rice in Australia in a similar manner; but what stimulus will the offering of a bounty of £ 1 , 5 0 0 a year be to the industry ? I believe that in the electoral division of the Hume, and in other parts of Riverina, the growing of rice could well be carried on under conditions such as I have described ; but the offer of a bounty of £ 1 , 5 0 0 per annum will not stimulate the industry> .'because those embarking in it will require a large amount of capital in order to obtain land, to make it ready for their operations, and to erect the machinery necessary fbr pumping water upon it. Formerly, the granting of bounties was the free-trade method of encouraging production, which the protectionists used to condemn. When the giving of bounties was first proposed in the Victorian Parliament, it was condemned by many sincere protectionists, being looked upon as a freeI t - has trade device, preventing the imposition of duties. I am therefore surprised that the free-traders are resisting these proposalsespecially since John Stuart M ill , the great apostle of free-trade, recommended the bounty system..",28
143,Mr BAMFORD,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Is there a split in the The Minister has camp ?,28
144,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I do not know. I am It but put forward my proposals with all modesty and diffidence. I think there is a more excellent way in which money could be spent to assist the agricultural development of this country. The Minister sought to recommend the Bill by referring to a number of countries which give bounties. named. Hungary, Brazil, Chili, France, Portugal, and Russia. I do not think we should follow on the lines pursued by those countries, where labour receives the very lowest payment. They are not countries whose example we should follow ini trying to develop Australia. We should rather look to those parts of the world where agriculture has greatly progressed, and whose peoples are now in the front rank of the world's producers. We shall find that they do not give bonuses. I do not recommend that we should slavishly copy the example of any country; but we should carefully examine all successful attempts to assist agriculture, in order to see if cannot profit thereby. The countries which have made the greatest agricultural progress are Germany and America.",28
145,Mr DEAKIN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Not France ?,29
146,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Not to the same extent as the other two. France is a country of very small holdings, where assistance has been given to the small man; but the assistance proposed to be given by the Government - would not, I think, go to small men. One word alone will explain' the progress and development of the countries I have named, and that word is "" education."" They have educated their people by means of experimental investigations, having thus built up a sound and scientific method of agriculture. If we consider the work of Liebig, in Germany, in regard to the chemistrv of the soils, and the discovery of the fertilizers necessary to make them useful, and to restore the waste that is conand tinually going on, we must recognise the jrreat utility of his labours, not only to Germanv, but also to the rest of the world. The first experimental station in Germany was started at Moeckern in 1851, and since that time practical experiments, coupled with chemical investigations, have enabled the country to progress by leaps and bounds. There are now seventv experimental stations in Germany, designed to assist the farmers of that country. Germany was the first country where an attempt was made to discover the true relations between chemistrv and agriculture. America has, followed suit, and is battering the instruction it has received. Washington himself saw clearly what the development of agriculture would mean to that country, and in 1796, in his address to Congress, saidIt will not be doubted, with reference either to industrial or national welfare, that agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as He nations advance in population, and other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage.' Although America was slow to adopt these views, when it took the matter in hand it went ahead very fast. The first experimental station there was established in 1875. By 1886 twelve stations had been established, and now there are in the United States over sixty stations, with a staff of about 700 persons, nearLy all of whom are scientific teachers. At these stations every branch of agriculture receives attention, from the first operations in connection with' the treatment of the soil, to all details conwe nected with plant and animal life and their diseases. Whereas in this country agriculture is. an industry conducted at random, the sport of season and circumstance, in America the work of the farmer is carried on in accordance with well-defined"" scientific principles. The investigations of the experimenting stations cover, amongst other things, the perfecting of machinery and implements, the fertilizing of the soil, the suitability of soils to crop, drainage, seepage, irrigation, methods of cultivation, rotation of crops, feeding and digestion experiments, and the value of different kinds of food for various kinds of stock, laboratory investigations of diseases of plants, the introduction of drought-resisting seeds and plants into arid areas, and the crossing of plants to secure stock which will suit special conditions. The effect of these wide investigations has been to put America in the front rank as an agricultural country, it has been brought about by the efforts of far-seeing men, among whom is Justin S. Morrill, who, in 1862, had 11,000,000 acres set aside for experimental purposes. He was followed by W. H . Hatch, who brought in a Bill instituting experimental stations. Later on Morrill obtained a further grant, so that now each experimental station receives 25,000 dollars a year from Congress, while they are also assisted by the States. I visited one or two of them, and saw the work which they are doing. They have sent trained men all over America, who assist the agriculturists when in difficulty or trouble, by putting them on the right road, and keeping them there. At the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, scores of letters are received every day from farmers from all parts of the Continent. The officials deal with the matters referred to in these letters, or remit them to experimental stations, from which experts are Sent to ascertain the cause of the trouble, and to put matters right again. The work of the experimental stations was crowned by the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture, which is what we require in Australia. That Department was established in 1862 ; but it did not attain its full measure of usefulness until, in 1897, it was reorganized by Secretary Wilson, who had been Senator Wilson, of Ohio. I had the pleasure of meeting him a short time ago. He brought the Department tp such a pitch of perfection that now there is no institution of the kind elsewhere which equals it, or whose work will compare with that done by it . There is no matter affecting agriculture with which it does not deal. . There has recently been added a Bureau of Rural Engineering, which will be a most valuable branch of the Department. Experiments have been made as to the best implements for dealing with various classes of soils, and especially for the cultivation of arid soils. The circumstances of Australia are similar to those of the United States. Although the area of the United States is so large, they are as hard pushed there to find land for the people as we are in Victoria. The good country lying to the eastward of the 96th meridian, which divides the humid from the arid area, is all taken up, while to the westward there is a tract over 500 miles wide by 1,100 miles long, with a rainfall declining from twenty inches to nothing. The problem of America, during the last seven or eight years""; has been how to get this arid country settled. Every effort has been made by the Central Department of Agriculture, and by the experimental stations, to obtain a solution of this problem, by discovering means whereby the land can be farmed with some certainty of a profitable return. The farmers there have been faught how to store the - moisture in the soil by proper cultivation, how to use the winter floods, how to bore for wells, and what are the best implements for deep cultivation. Professor Campbell has been fourteen years at the Nebraska University, doing nothing else but investigate the problems raised by the dry area, with a view to ascertaining how best to keep moisture in the soil, what are the best means of cultivation, and how it can be used to most advantage. In 1899, they sent men all over the world to obtain drought-resisting seeds. These agents brought back with thefn from the plains of the Volga, from Siberia, Algiers, and other places, wheat, oats, maize, grass, sorghum, and various other seeds, which have been distributed throughout the droughty areas. As one consequence the wheat-producing area has, since the beginning of ihe century, been extended 200 miles further west, I saw beautiful crops being grown in country which enjoyed only a 12-inch rainfall.",29
147,Mr BATCHELOR,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We are growing good crops in South Australia on country that has only that rainfall.,30
148,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Yes , under the example of America.",30
149,Mr LONSDALE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,It all depends upon when the rain falls.,30
150,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That is where the honourable member makes a mistake. Under ihe system of cultivation adopted in the United States, the ground is kept open and the moisture is able to find its wav well below the surface, and remain stored there for the use of the plants t ill they come to perfection. I am quoting these cases to show that it is desirable that we should educate our people as to the best method's of cultivation, and the proper crops to grow, rather ihan bring in proposals intended to encourage the cultivation of only a few products. I do not say that the Government proposals are wrong. They will probably be productive of much good, but I contend that under present circumstances, we should consider first measures that would be calculated to help the country further ahead. It is our first duty to assist those . who are occupying our dry areas, who are fighting against drought, and dust, and hot winds, and all the discomfort's that attach to life in the interior. We should show them-as other countries are doinghow they can increase production, and make life bearable. In the State of Utah, which has about the same area as Victoria, namely, about 83.000 square miles, :not 1 per cent, of the land is under irrigation. It was thought that the rest of the territory was practically useless except for the rearing of rough siock. but by means of diligent cultivation and deep soiling, much of the area that was held in such low estimation is being rendered productive. In 1903, Dr Widstoe, the chemist at Experimental Farm, at Logan, Utah, joined with Professor Morrill, the agroopposed nomist, in recommending to Governor Heber that experimental stations should to the larger question. be established in various parts of the State. This suggestion was brought fore the State Legislature, and was forthplace with adopted. Senator Whitmore joined with the experts mentioned in selecting six sites in country that had 'been deemed almost valueless, and in each case forty acres were tenced in at the cost of the country, which also found the land. The experimental stations were located in places where the soil contained 40 or 50 per cent, of gravel, or 60 per cent, of sand, or and other unpromising elements. I following season, crops averaging from twenty down to four bushels of wheat were obtained, and the results were quite a lation to the people of the Stare. ",30
151,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Seventee n or 18 inches in some places, and only 8 or 9 others. 0  under a 9-inch rainfall in some parte of South Australia.",31
152,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That is not being done many cases. It has been established bebut little. yond doubt that nearly the whole of the area in Utah that was regarded as practically worthless can be cultivated with profit, and large tracts of country are being settled by persons who know that under a proper system of tillage they can feel assured of obtaining a return for their money. This matter is of greater importmental ance than my remarks up to the present might indicate. This is not merely a matwould ter of consequence to us, but is an perial question also. When I was in old country I was a strong adVocate preferential trade, but I found veryto few people who agreed with me, because greater extent. nearly all those I met were free-traders, who thought that a duty on foodstuffs would ruin the country. I was asked we could guarantee to supply Great Britain with all the food-stuffs she required, and I was told, "" If you will guarantee to. supply all our needs in the way of fooddustries. stuffs, and thus render us independent of foreign countries, we are prepared to adopt a preferential Tariff, and place you in position of advantage as compared other countries."" It seems to me that the solution of the question lies in the utilizajourned. tion of our enormous areas of country, the which, under improved methods of cultivation, could be made productive. I am not to the granting of bonuses, but I think that we shoulddevote our attention We should cooperate with the States Governments in conbeducting experimental stations, and should the work of such stations to a very great extent under 'State supervision. We should endeavour to show our agriculturists how to successfully grow different products. If we once did this, and demonstrated that certain products could be grown with profit, we should ""not need to grant bonuses. The enterprise of our settlers would be sufficient to bring about the production of all clav that we require, and a great deal more. n the I would ask honourable members which would be the best plan to adopt: to educate our people up to the point necessary reveto enable them to profitably utilize our large waste areas, or to grant bounties they? and largesse to a comparatively few?",31
153,Mr BATCHELOR,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The , first matter is inches in largely one for the States.",31
154,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"No doubt; but we must work with the States, which are now struggling along in the best way they can. New South Wales and Victoria are doing in fairlv well, but the other States are doing",31
155,Mr BATCHELOR,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,South Australia is also doing very good work.,31
156,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Ferhap s so; but we should approach the States, as has been done in America, and offer to contribute towards the expense of conducting experistations designed to promote the development of the country. The States have to find the land and the buildImings, but the Commonwealth should grant the them a certain sum extending over a term of of years. They would then be stimulated make use of their resources to a much  member make grants out of the surplus if revenue of the Commonwealth ?",31
157,Mr MCCOLL,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"It is now proposed to spend £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 during the next ten years in the .encouragement of a very few inI do not object to that. But I contend that there is a larger work before us, which, if it received adequate cona sideration, would be attended with very , with much more important results. Debate (on motion by Mr FISHER) adSTANDING ORDER 241 : "" GRIEVANCE DAV . """,31
158,Mr DEAKIN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [2.55] - I move That so much of standing order No. 241 as provides for the question being put on every third Thursday, "" That the Speaker do now leave the Chair,"" on the Order of the Day for Committee of Supply or Ways and Means, be suspended for the remainder of the session. I submit this motion, because within the next few clays the ""Budget speech will be delivered, and the Estimates laid on the table. The discussions that will take place in Committee of Supply will afford honourable members the fullest opportunity for ventilating any grievances they may have, or of. debating any and every question relating to the affairs of the Commonwealth. We have, owing to the lapse of motions during the last few weeks, been enabled to avail ourselves of a small portion of the time usually devoted to private business, and do not yet propose to ask honourable members to forego the privilege now enjoyed by them on one afternoon each week. I hope, however, that the provision on the notice-paper for the so-called "" grievance day "" will be allowed to disappear for the remainder of the session. We have a great amount of work to do, and I am sure that it is desired in all quarters that ""we should close the session at the ""earliest possible moment, consistent with the transaction of the business now remaining. I should have been loth to submit this motion if I had thought honourable members would be denied an opportunity to consider various details arising from time to time in connection with the administration of the Departments; but I think that the discussion uDOn the Estimates will afford'every facilitv for the ventilation of grievances. I trust, therefore, that honourable members will make the sacrificei f anv sacrifice is involved-wit h a good grace, and assist the Government to make this, the last session of the present Parliament, as f r u it f u l as possible. Mr TOSEPH COOK [2.58] - I shall offer no objection to the motion. I recognisethat it is desirable that we should concludeour labours as soon as possible. At the same time there is much important work to be done-perhap s the most important that has yet engaged our attention. I trust, therefore, that the Government will afford us an opportunity at the earliest possible moment to fully and freely discuss the matters which must engage our attention before the session is closed.",32
159,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,To what business does the honourable member refer?,32
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"To the reports of the Tariff Commission, of course. We already have some reports upon the Tariff which I think should be disposed of without further delay. I recognise that the Government are responsible for the conduct of business, but I venture to say that they are adopting a wrong course in this matter, and that they will inevitably be led into a difficulty at a later stage. I agree with the Prime Minister that the Budget debate will furnish honourable members with every opportunity for the ventilation of grievances. At the same time, I consider that we are making a sacrifice in surrendering "" grievance day,"" and I am glad that it is proposed merely to suspend the Standing Orders, and not to abolish that'institution. I knew nothing of "" grievance day "" before I came to Victoria, but in my judgment it is a very useful institution, and but for its existence numerous adjournment motions would be moved and much time would be wasted. If time were not consumed in this way grievances would be ventilated as they arise, and .more time would thus be occupied. At any rate, that is my experience, extending over a good many years. However, I hope that the surrender of private members' day will afford the Government a further opportunity of disposing of the remaining business of the session. My advice to them is that they should make up their minds speedily as to the particular business which is to be transacted, take the House into their confidence by letting honourable members know the task which they have to perform before they separate, and then, no doubt, the Prime Minister will be able to command the co-operation of everybody concerned in an endeavour to deal with it in some shape or form.  (Parramatta) ber anxious to get on to the Tariff?",32
161,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I dare say that I am quite as anxious.as is the honourable member. I am sure that he will be with us when the Tariff is under consideration, and that he will be prepared to give it that attention which it undoubtedly deserves. I again urge upon the Government the desirablenessof taking the House into their confidence, and of making an earnest effort to wind up the session as early as it way is possible to do so. The best way to complish that is to let honourable members know exactly what they are expected to so that we may address ourselves to the task of disposing of the business at early date. I do not think that the vernment can complain of the attitude which the Opposition have adopted this session. We forfeited our privileges entirely in connection with the debate upon the Addresspoint in-Reply. We did so in the interests of public business.",32
162,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,It was due enhours. tirely to an accident that that debate not prolonged.,33
163,Mr TOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I hope that the private members' day. honourable member will get that idea of his mind at once. No charge can lie at the door of the Opposition this session on account of the attitude which they have assumed towards Government business. cient Take the present week as an example. Very little of the discussion has emanated from members upon this side of the House. The bulk of the debate upon the mail conanother tract to Europe has come from the Labour corner. It was quite a refreshing change see the members of that party taking a keen interest in the debates of the Chamber. However, the mail contract has now been disposed' of, and therefore see them once more assume their attitude of wonted calm and philosophic consideration. I sincerely hope that the action which the Government are taking will sult in a speedy close of the session, that we may all betake ourselves to the crossing of that swelling political Jordan into which we must soon plunge. I conask cur in the proposal of the Prime Minister.",33
164,Mr FISHER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Wide Bay) [3.5] - I do not agree with the view which has been expressed by the deputy leader of the Opfor position in regard to the value of grievone, ance day. In my opinion, it is the weakest link in our parliamentary procedure. I saying that, I am not merely expressing own opinion,, but that of some very shrewd judges. They avow that they do not exentertain aggerate when they say that, in connection with grievance day, they have heard more drivel talked than they have ever listened. to in any other deliberative assembly. I should have been much better pleased the Prime Minister had proposed to abolish grievance day altogether. It is quite true a motion for a special adiournment. that the adoption of that course might give rise to the discussion of an occasional motion of adjournment. But that is the sideration of their business. in which an important matteracshould be dealt with. It ought not to be sandwiched between a proposal, probdo, ably for the mending of the village pump, and another, perhaps, for sticking a postage an stamp upon a sign board of the CommonGowealth.

For the sake of accomplishing that object, I think that honourable members would be prepared to forego the consideration of their own private business for the remainder of the session. I wish to embrace this opportunity to again urge upon the Prime Minister the necessity for dealing with, the reports of the Tariff Commission as soon as possible. It seems to me a great anomaly that honourable members sitting behind the Government should daily devote hours outside of this House to emphasizing the necessity which exists for Tariff reform, and still be content to take no action in this Chamber, where some practical result might accrue frOm their efforts.",33
168,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,What can be done at present ?,34
169,Mr MCLEAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Canno t we proceed with the consideration of the reports which are already to hand? There are three reports to which the members of the Tariff Commission have unanimously agreed.,34
170,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,They will provide only half-an-hour's work for the House.,34
171,Mr HUME COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,What reports they-the reports dealing with spirits?,34
172,Mr MCLEAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"What were the illustrations which the honourable member for Bourke himself used last session, when he declared that men were being thrown out of employment as the result of the closing down of works? No other factories in the Commonwealth had been closed except those to which reference is made in the reports already presented by the Tariff Commission.",34
173,Mr MAUGER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Oh , yes.",34
174,Mr MCLEAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"The matter should be settled without delay. I think that honourable member for Bourke would being much better use of his own time if instead, of going round the suburbs of bourne preaching the necessity for Tariff reform, he attempted to accomplish thing in this House. I do not wish to apply mv remarks to the Prime Minister, because he was not so persistent out of pledge. - season as were some of my honourable friends opposite in urging the Tariff revision. I believe that he is sincere in the matter, and I hope that he will show his sincerity by asking bers to forego their private business for the rest of the session, so that the question of Tariff reform may be dealt with at the earliest possible moment.",34
175,Mr JOHNSON,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Lang) [3.12] - Whils t I am prepared to support the motion of the Prime Minister, I am opposed to the idea that private members' day should be entirely dispensed with. I was very much surprised at the attitude taken up by' the honourable member for Echuca, especially in view <^f the fact that a few weeks ago he objected to postpone a motion which he had upon the business-paper to enable honourable members to witness a very important experiment in connection with the transmission of the first Marconi message to Tasmania. Upon that occasion he urged that his proposal was of such serious public import that it did not admit of any delay. I note that it is now set down for consideration upon 2nd August. If it were important previously it is equally important now, so that the honourable member, by making it appear that private members' business is of no consequence, has practically condemned his own proposal. I agree with the remarks which have been made regarding the wisdom of abolishing grievance day, because I hold that any important matter can and should be ventilated upon a motion for adjournment. are Mr KENNEDY (Moir'a) [3.15] - I think it goes without saying, that the motion will have the unanimous support of the House, since we shall have ample opportunity to discuss any grievances under which we labour. I desire to pay my tribute of respect to the new-bom zeal displayed by the honourable member for Gippsland for an early discussion of the Tariff.",34

184,Mr MCLEAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,It is not new-born thusiasm. I favoured the appointment of the Tariff Commission in order that grievances might be investigated and settled.,35
185,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That was the position of affairs about eighteen months ago. As to the claim that the Government should immediately bring before the House the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, it is scarcely necessary to remind the honourable member that he announced to the Commonwealth or.lv twelve months ago that, in his opinion, this Parliament should be forthwith buried.",35
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,It would have been a great deal better for it had it been buried.,35
187,Mr DEAKIN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,We should have had a glorious resurrection.,35
188,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The honourable member for Parramatta must admit that since then we have passed very useful legislation.,35
189,Mr SPEAKER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Does the honourable member think that his remarks relate to the motion ?,35
190,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I do, sir. The Prime Minister has asked us to forego the right of dealing with grievances on the formal motion, "" That the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply,"" so that I shall not have another opportunity to refer to this matter. I have been asked point blank what attitude I shall take up when certain proposals are submitted to the ' House. The honourable member for. Gippsland 'knows very well what my attitude will be. I merely desire to say, as has been stated by the. honourable member's leader-the leader of the Opposition",35
191,Mr MCLEAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The honourable member has 110 authoritv for asserting that the right honourable member for East Sydney is my leader. I agree with him on one important question.,35
192,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,I am only seeking; They information. I was under the impression that the honourable member for Gippsland had as one of his colleagues in the late the present leader of the Opposition.,35
193,Mr MCLEAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,And a. straight colleague he was.,35
194,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I am still under the impression that the honourable member is sitting in Opposition, and supporting the right honourable member for East Sydney in his desire to defeat the present Government at the first opportunity.",35
195,Mr SPEAKER,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I am very reluctant ento interrupt the speech qf an honourable member, but I fai l to see what relation the remarks now being made by the honourable member for Moira have to the motion under consideration. If he can connect them. I shall be pleased, but otherwise I cannot allow him to proceed on these lines.",35
196,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I shall connect them with the motion. The honourable member for Gippsland announced that he supported the motion because he thought that the time devoted to the consideration of grievances might well be devoted to the discussion of other business, which, he. suggested, should be submitted by the Prime Minister. I feel sure that the Prime Minister will take advantage of the opportunity, and that, if reliance can be placed in the preaching of the Opposition during this session, the recommendations of the Tariff Commission can be dealt with in one day. We have the statement of the leader of the Opposition that he would have no hesitation in accepting any unanimous proposals made by the Commission. So far, the only reports submitted relate to distillation of spirits, wines, and industrial alcohol, and the recommendations with regard to those items are unanimous. That being so, when they are suhmitted to the House we should be able to deal with them in a few hours.",35
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Would it take longer now than at any other time to deal with them?,35
198,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Speakin g generally, so far as I can judge at present, I have no fault to find with the recommendations of the Commission.",35
199,Mr MCLEAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,Is the honourable member in favour of postponing the consideration of the Tariff?,35
200,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,That question does not arise at present.,35
201,Mr MCLEAN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The honourable member will try to pump life into it when the general election comes round.,36
202,Mr KENNEDY,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That is not the question. I am not attempting to forestall the reports of the Commission. We ought to be able to deal with those already submitted without much discussion, since they have been unanimously arrived at. Consequently, until further reports are presented, there should be no insane desire for the question to be suhmitted at this stage, more especially as we are engaged on other useful worjk.",36
203,Mr GLYNN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"Angas) [3.25] - In surrendering grievance day, honourable members are not depriving themselves of a chance of extemporizing grievances on matters not altogether of public interest.",36
204,Mr DEAKIN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,All grievances are extemporized.,36
205,Mr GLYNN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"I say that they are, because I think the evil lies in allowing grievance day to recur at regular intervals. In my opinion, much exception can be taken to that practice. Here, as in many other Parliaments, grievances can be ventilated when the Estimates are under consideration ; that gives honourable members an opportunity to improvize them.",36
206,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,On grievance day we have largely a waste of time.,36

208,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,The effect of the proposal on the revenue will also have to be considered.,36
209,Mr GLYNN,CLOSING OF TELEGRAPH,"That is so. As the general election is now close at hand', it is almost a pity that the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Moira should begin to have differences of opinion as to the urgency of considering the Tariff reports at this stage.",36

I have found a copy of the condition to which I referred last night as included in a British con* tract. I should have said that it was included in a draft contract, submitted to us by the British Government, which arrived just before the publication of our advertisement for tenders for the present mail service.

The matter is of importance only by as showing that we were correct in claiming to have followed' a British precedent. This is the latest British precedent obtainable. It arrived towards the close of last year, and for the only important change made by us in adopting its wording has been the substitution of the Postmaster-General for the Admiralty as the authority who shall make purchase. We have no Admiralty here, and had, therefore, to substitute some authority. We chose the Postmaster General as most appropriate.",37

He would make it appear that the object is, in both cases, the same. If this is so, it would surely be within the ability of the draftsman to declare that the mail steamers are to be purchased only for belligerent purposes. That could have been provided for without using the name of any Minister. In my opinion, the alteration has been made deliberately, with a view to giving the Commonwealth power to purchase the mail steamers for 'general commercial purposes, as well as for defence. The Prime Minister's explanation would make it appear that the Government did not intend to take that power, but were forced to do so because there, is no Admiralty here. .
