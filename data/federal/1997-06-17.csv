1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 2.00 p.m., and read prayers. NA",13
2,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Hon. Bruce Scott, will answer questions in the absence of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon. John Sharp, for the remainder of this sitting fortnight. NA",13
3,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CLEANING,"I refer to the question to me on 4 June from the member for Canberra concerning cleaning services. Limro had advised their cleaning staff in Parliament House of a proposal-to take effect in four weeks time-of a change to their early shift start time from 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. No change has been made. Limro's written advice to their workers was that a change to shift times was proposed from 30 June. The proposal was suspended following the hearing in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on 4 June 1997. Limro was formally advised by the Joint House Department that the implications of the proposed changes would be considered after consultation with building occupants. Initial consultation has taken place with the chamber departments and the ministerial support branch of DAS. Party whips and some senators and members, particularly those who are frequent early attendees, will also be individually consulted. A summary of outcomes from the above consultative process and the resultant departmental response to Limro's proposal will be studied before the proposal is accepted, modified or rejected. Limro states that: It is currently undertaking a survey of all morning shift cleaners to find out how many will be able to start on the new shift; Cleaners changing from the 4 a.m. start to a 6 a.m. start would lose entitlement to a penalty payment of some $70 per fortnight; and, Any cleaners with seven years or more service who are unable to ,\·ork the proposed shift will be paid pro rata long service leave entitlement if they have to resign. Any financial benefits accruing from revised arrangements will be shared by the Joint House Department and the contractor. This information was provided to the member for Canberra earlier today.",13
4,Mr MCMULLAN,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CLEANING,"Canberra}- Mr Speaker, thank you very much, and thank you to your staff for their courtesy. Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to make a onesentence response to that. I want to save the survey time to which you referred a little effort and indicate to you and to the House the implacable opposition of opposition SERVICES members to any proposal to reduce workers wages by changing the working hours from six until 10 for cleaners.",13
5,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE CLEANING,That was an unduly long sentence but in order. NA Aboriginals: Stolen Children,13
6,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the government's Chief General Counsel, Mr Henry Burmester, informed a Senate estimates committee last week that it was possible to word an apology to the stolen generation without incurring legal liability but that 'I have not been asked to look at that issue'. Will the government now ask Mr Burmester to do so?",13
7,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister, the Leader of the House and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs have already indicated the government's approach with regard to matters arising from the key report Bringing them home in relation to separated children. It is not the intention of the government to deviate from that approach. Mr Tuckey interjecting",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor.,13
9,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, part of that approach is that there will be a comprehensive response from the government but it will take time to prepare. It will not be a piecemeal response; it will he a properly prepared and comprehensive response which will he tendered later this year. Home Loan Affordability",13
10,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer would he aware of the high mortgage holders in my electorate. Can the Treasurer advise the House of the results of the latest home loan affordability report? What part have the government's budget repair, low inflation and low interest rate policies played in achieving this result?",14
11,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I am aware of the number of home buyers in the electorate of Deakin, an electorate that I have a great deal of familiarity with. I know that the member for Deakin will be pleased to know that the latest Citibank-REIA home loan affordability indicator released yesterday showed that home loan affordability rose 5.1 per cent in the March quarter for 1997 and 16.7 per cent over the year-the strongest annual growth in four years. The Commonwealth Bank-HIA housing affordability index showed even stronger growth: affordability increasing 6.4 per cent in the March quarter 1997, following a five per cent increase in December 1996. This makes housing the most affordable since this indicator began in December 1984. The reductions in the home loan standard variable interest rate which have occurred under this government mean that on the average Australian mortgage of $100,000 the interest savings are $292 per month-$292 per month after tax money as a result of lower interest rates. Not only arc home buyers and young families reaping the benefits but business is benefiting from reductions in interest rates as well. The government's policy to engage in fiscal consolidation and lower interest rates was fought every step of the way by the Labor Party. The Labor Party had a policy of keeping interest rates high in this country. The Labor Party got interest rates up at the end 1994 and fought to prevent them coming down. Those opposite fought every fiscal consolidation measure-every single one of them-and then, just for good measure, the ALP went into the national wage case to argue for an increase in wages to try and kick inflation higher and put more people out of jobs. We can be pleased that the Industrial Relations Commission rejected the submission of the Australian Labor Party. The people of Australia supported the government in its fiscal consolidation efforts and as a result interest rates have fallen and the conditions have been set for small business and home buyers. On station 4BH on 17 June 1997 Mark Silver from the REIQ said: ... it's a very exciting time for Queensland's property market there are good things in the front, I think we have got a fiscally responsible Federal Budget. That is what he said this morning. Setting the conditions for families, setting the conditions for small business, setting the conditions for fiscal responsibility, setting the conditions for growth and setting the conditions for economic generation-that is the policy of this government. Unemployment",14
12,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. It goes to the question of high unemployment and the real reason interest rates are going down. Do you realise that in trend terms the number of jongterm unemployed hit 242,500 today, a twoyear high and 28,000 more than when the government began slashing job programs exactly 12 months ago? Isn't it a fact that the government's attitude to the jobless is demonstrated by the insensitive comments of Mr Howard when he asked the unemployed to be patient? When will we see an end to a policy of smokescreens to avoid offering real vision, understanding and leadership on job creation?",14
13,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No good asking you for advice, Martin!",14
14,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor.,14
15,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Clearly there can be no complacency with regard to creating more of jobs and reducing the unemployment levels, but I remind the House that this government, under the Costello budget, will spend in fact $1.15 billion on labour market assistance in the next financial year. Further, we have facilitated, through the budget strategy and the good discipline of the budget strategy, four consecutive interest rate reductions, which in turn are now starting at long last to flow through to small business, to flow through to primary producers-whether it be our hardpressed citrus primary producers or droughtaffected primary producers-and to in fact provide a confidence and a circum5tance of borrowing capacity at a far more realistic interest rate. I might add, with regard to our handling of it, that the labour market assistance will be client focused, not program driven. Employment services providers will be paid on their performance in placing job seekers in employment. Job seekers will benefit from higher standards of service, more flexible ar.d customised assistance and ultimately better and more lasting employment outcomes. I am always a little hit hemused when the ex-President of the ACTU asks questions about unemployment and would be even more so if the Leader of the Opposition was game enough to put his head up on this matter, because I have a bit of paper here which reminds me that in fact the unemployment rate hit an all-time historic high in December 1992, in the middle of his period as Minister for Employment, Education and Training. That was 11.2 per cent. We are getting on with the task; you clearly failed in that task. Medicare Agreements",14
16,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Will the minister inform the House on the progress to date of the renegotiation of the Medicare agreements for public hospitals? How will the new Medicare agreements impact on the government's policies on access to quality and affordable health care?,15
17,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased to advise the House there has been some encour-ging progress so far in attempting to renegottate new agreements. The current ones expire on 30 June next year. There are a number of problems that public hospitals have, and we are trying to address these in the agreements that we are negotiating. There are no incentives at the moment for appropriate ambulatory care. There are no incentives for appropriate sub-acute care, research and teaching are being squeezed in public hospitals, and people have an understandable concern that quality issues may not be being addressed. These agreements are the best chance we get in any five-year period to appropriately address these issues. We are also concerned that there are not appropriate linkages between what happens in hospital and what happens in the community. Clearly if we are going to provide the best possible health care, we have to improve those linkages. So we are optimistic that these can be addressed and, in recognition of this, health ministers have agreed that the next agreements should be called 'Australian health care agreements' as they will be broader agreements than in the past. We are working around four main areas. The first area is the acute in-patient services, and we are looking at links between hospital based services and post-acute care. The second area is ambulatory services, which is outpatients and other services like that, and we are trying to put incentives into the system that will give appropriate incentive for having people treated where it is most appropriate, not where costs can be shifted from one level of government to another. The third area is broadly called 'other elements' - teaching, research and quality issues. Teaching is important because the community deserves an appropriate number of specialists in all different professions and particularly in medical areas such as dermatology or radiation oncology. Those areas have been squeezed and we are not going to meet the community's future needs unless we can find a way of putting that training into an appropriate funding context. Finally, if we are going to progress in the policy area, we have got to have appropriate data development and sharing, and this is something where Australia, at a Commonwealth level, has led the world. If we can integrate state and Commonwealth data and share it appropriately, we will have something that will be the envy of many countries. These agreements are never easy, as it is a very major part of any state government expenditure. I would not pretend that in the past they have been anything but long, bloody, drawn-out affairs and it may be that, in the end, this is what will happen with this agreement. But I would say that so far that has not been the case. Health ministers have met six times in the last 15 months and that compares with one occasion in the two years up to the last election. For that reason, it is somewhat disappointing to find one newspaper today attempting to create some discord where in fact there is none. Health ministers have been working on this, realising that here we have a unique opportunity for those who have to make the system work on a day to day level to try and get it right. Of course, if we are unable to this we would expect others to do it for us. But it would be rather unique in health if those who cared about the system and those who had to manage the system had the chance to drive reform in the system into something that was, in the end, in the interests of patients. To give one example, I opened some what are called cardiac flats at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago, with the member for MCEwen. These flats enable people who are having heart surgery to go out into a halfway house on day four, rather than to continue in the hospital. They are linked the hospital; they have a nurse visit in the morning and in the evening, they can go down and get their own meals and they can have their husband or wife move in with them for the recovery. It is voluntary-70 per cent of people choose to go that way-and the Austin Hospital has been able to reduce its heart surgery waiting list from 600 to zero in a nine-month period, just by better utilisation of its beds. Previous agreements have tended to be just arguments about money. Money is, of course, an issue in hospitals but so is appropriate of services, so is appropriate sub-acute care, so are appropriate linkages with the community and so is appropriate ambulatory care. I do not underestimate the difficulty of reform but the signs so far are encouraging. Illegal Immigrants",15
18,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. With respect to the 139 Chinese boat people from Fujian Province in China attempting to enter Australia illegally, is this the largest single incursion of illegal immigrants since the 1850s? Does the fact that this ship was bound for the east coast of Australia and that all the illegals had haircuts and smart new suits indicate that Australia is being targeted by Fukienese crime gangs, as are the US, Europe and Japan? Does this sort of operation suggest that logistical support will need to be provided in Australia? Given that Fukienese crime gangs are now operating in the US and Europe, does the minister take this invasion of our sovereignty seriously, and do does he now seriously believe that these crime gangs are not operating in Australia?",16
19,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly can confirm to the honourable member that there was an arri val in Australia of a boatload of 139 individuals whom we believe intended to come here for what appear to be immigration purposes. They were certainly unauthorised. We believe them to be from the People's Republic of China. All of them have now been transferred to the immigration reception and processing centre at Port Hedland and inquiries are being undertaken at this very time in relation to the way in which they to sought to come here and the extent to which it was organised. I take on notice the comments that the honourable member has offered. I cannot confirm any of those observations, although it is clear that there have been, at various times, attempts by people who have come from China to enter the United States. There was the very tragic sinking of a boat in New York harbour not so long ago that was well known publicly. This case is very unusual in that a steel-hulled vessel that was specially acquired for the purpose of this voyage to use Australia was used, it had sophisticated navigational devices on it and these people who were intent on reaching Australia presented in a very different way from others we have seen before. Certainly this journey would not have taken as long and was in no way as hazardous as those of many who have embarked upon these journeys before. I will endeavour to better inform the member when I have further information but I cannot confirm the allegations about the nature of this party, other than to say that the circumstances are certainly very unusual and do require the further investigations that I have initiated. Employment: School Leavers",16
20,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Educamember tion and Training. Is the minister aware of opposition to government initiatives to imfacts prove the employment prospects for young Australians? How is the government providing schoolleavers with opportunities to find jobs?",17
21,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable memand ber for Wide Bay for his question. As he says, the government is committed to providtime. ing young people with opportunities to access real jobs and I am aware of criticism of the government's policies from the Carr government of New South Wales which is doing the bidding of the education unions in New South Wales, backed by the member for Werriwa. The fact is that the Labor Party has been obsessed with the 30 per cent of students who are going on to university from school and has completely neglected the interests of the 70 per cent of students who are not going directly to university from school. If that seen to be an incorrect statement, let me that it has been endorsed by the member Sydney.",17
22,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It was not.,17
23,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition denies this. Let me quote the member for Sydney-the bold and the beautiful member for Sydney; you know, the young and the restless down there and the bold and the beautiful up here. The member for Sydney said: Accommodating the needs of those not intending to proceed directly to university in the final of schooling is something we did not do enough about in government. Nothing could be clearer than that. Mr Crean-On a point of order, Mr Speaker, this is the same quote that the minister alluded to in the last sittings and on which the member for Sydney made a personal explanation to show it was completely untrue. You have said, Mr Speaker, that you cannot see the context of all of the quotes that ministers might make from time to time, but this is a specific repeat of what has already been rejected by the author of that document, and I would ask you to get the minister onto thpoint and off this nonsense and misleading of the House.",17
24,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable for Hotham. All members would note that I am not in a position to ascertain the relative to a ministerial answer. I am not in a position to determine the truth or otherwise of the ministerial assertion. There are other forms available to you to seek redress, if it is appropriate the member can make a personal explanation at the end of question Mr Latham-Further to the point of order, Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the third edition of House of Representatives Practice-I suppose we now call it Barlin-which at page 477 rules as unparliamentary the misrepresentation of the language of another. The member for Sydney has plainly made known to the House the nature of the misrepresentation, it is unparliamentary on according to House of Representatives Pracis tice, and I would ask you to call on the say Minister for Schools, Vocational Education for and Training to withdraw accordingly.",17
25,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have no occasion to change what I said a moment ago. There is no point of order. Mr Crean-On a further point of order, Mr Speaker, what I am suggesting you have not addressed in terms of my point of order is that this is a matter that has already been responded to in this House. Therefore, you can be apprised of it, because the shadow minister who is being misquoted, not here to years defend himself, has already raised the matter and the minister is misquoting him yet again. That is why I am suggesting you should call him to order on this point.",17
26,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Mr Crean-Of course there is a point of order. It goes to relevance. It goes to misleading.,18
27,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resume your seat. Mr Fitzgibbon-On a further point of order, Mr Speaker, I refer to standing order 146. I suggest that if you reflect on the question asked by the honourable member, Mr Speaker, you will find that this question has previously been asked not only once but on a number of occasions. I believe that understanding order 146 it has been asked and already answered.",18
28,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Crean-Is that a direction?,18
29,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, they are certainly very sensitive",18
30,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hotham is testing my patience.,18
31,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,when they are presented with the truth.,18
32,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker, that goes to relevance. The minister clearly intends to persist with this line. You, sir, were in the chair when the explanation was offered by the member for Sydney concerning what the minister now clearly intends to persist with. We have been complying with your new guidelines on standing orders in the way in which we have been asking questions in this place but there has been precious little conformity from the other side.",18
33,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am listening very carefully to the points of order. I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I am also listening very carefully to the ministerial response. I do invite the minister to pursue the direct answer to the question asked.,18
34,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, I am, Mr Speaker, and it is time that the Leader of the Opposition imposed some discipline on his members and faced up to the disagreements between them.",18
35,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister is not heeding the advice I gave him. I do not want debate on the question; I want an answer to the question.,18
36,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, Mr Speaker. The government recognises, as the former government did not, that young people are the most disadvantaged group within the labour market. The government is responding to these changes with a variety of innovative strategies, including opening new opportunities for schools. One of the most important innovations that the government is making is inviting schools to take responsibility for the job placement of their students. There are two government programs which provide schools with these opportunities. One is the jobs pathway program, which has already completed the first tender round. Two schools tendered successfully in that program, and I am pleased to tell the House that they had a 100 per cent success rate-the first time this has happened in Australia. The second tender round is now under way, and I invite schools to tender for the some 70 contracts that the government will be writing which will aim to help students in up to 1,000 schools. There will also be an opportunity later this year in the tendering out of the job placement services of the CES when, again, schools will be able to tender for labour exchange services and entry level training support services. The President of the Australian Secondary Principals Association has endorsed these policies of the government, and said that principals and teachers want to help their students find permanent jobs. There is an endorsement right across the community except from the Labor Party and except for the Carr government. The Carr government has made it clear through its Minister for Education, Mr Aquilina, that it will not permit schools in New South Wales to tender for these services. Indeed, Mr Aquilina has said: If individual schools were to enter the employment agency business",18
37,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to the fundamental concept of questions without notice. While I do not want to interfere with the process of ministers giving backbenchers questions to be answered, I think it is a bit much and against the spmt of the whole concept of questions without notice that minister comes in with a typed answer, at the question box and proceeds to read it. In Werriwa. fact, if you have any doubt about this process, Mr Speaker, I invite you to ask the honourof able minister to show you copies of the answer that he has prepared with respect to this. There is a very real difference a minister having a brief which carries a whole range of information which he may refer to and what this minister continually does, which is come into this House and be so dimwitted as to be unable to answer a question without reading it out.",18
38,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I thank the memrun ber for Melbourne Ports. Resume your seat. As a former distinguished member of the state parliament of Victoria and a very distinpoint guished member of this House, the member is fully aware of the conventions of this House.

40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,19
41,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, this is absolutely central to the point of the question and to the point that I am making. Mr Aquilina says: If individual schools were to enter the employment agency business under these plans, it would an onerous burden on them and detract them from their core role of teaching and \earning. What that demonstrates is that there is absolutely no appreciation whatever within New South Wales of the facts of the government's tender process, because the schools will gain additional resources as a result What we have here is a policy designed to the deny opportunities to young people, which stands have been endorsed by the member for",19

43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition. There is no point of order. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: it does seem transparent to all of us that there is a bit of a mini-campaign being today by the opposition on points of order. We have had a series of clearly frivolous points of order to the absolutely absurd of order from the member in respect of questions and answers.

As you would be aware, there is within standing orders a general opportunity for the Speaker to utilise the authority of the chair to keep general order within the House. Members are obliged to assist the Speaker in that regard. There is no question about that. I do remember one of your illustrious predecessors began most of his rulings or his statements to people with, 'You are not assisting the chair.' There is an obligation upon all of us to assist the chair. Part of the process of assisting the chair, Mr SPEAKER Mr Reith- Mr SPEAKER ",20
52,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am making a point of order. Part of the process of assisting the chair is that those who are on their feet heed your directions, whether or not those directions necessarily come within a particular framework of the standing orders.

Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that rural and regional Victoria are the black spot for regional unemployment, with 11.2 per cent on the jobless queues? That is up from 8.5 per cent when the coalition was elected in March this year. Is he aware that that translates into more than lO,OOO people in rural and regional Victoria losing their jobs since the coalition was elected? Is it not a fact that the coalition let down the people of Geelong, Bendigo, Portland, Ballarat, Mildura, Shepparton, Horsham, Bairnsdale and Sale because it has no vision for jobs in rural Australia?

68,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If there is any demonstration of behaviour like that again in this chamber, which I find intolerable, I will take very positive and immediate steps. If you want to leave, do so. Do you want to leave? Mr Bevis-Do you want me to answer?",21
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Just resume your seat! I have issued a general warning. Transgress it at your peril.,21
70,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker: whatever might have been your views about the last part of the question, it has not been uncommon in this place for parts of the question which are clearly in order to your mind to be permitted. I would have thought that, irrespective of an argument over the last sentence, the remainder of the question was completely in order.",21
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"An element of the question was in order. The member for Corio ignored my advice to stop debating the question. The question was therefore ruled out of order. Mr O'Connor-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I would say 90 per cent of the question was asked with good intent",21
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have ruled the question out of order. I am not going to debate it. Resume your seat. Mr O'Connor-I am quite happy to withdraw the last sentence, if you would ask the Acting Prime Minister to proceed.",21

74,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham had better be very careful. I may have a hearing problem, but my left ear hears particularly well. Homeless Youth",22
75,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Following the minister's recent visit to Gippsland to launch a regional project, could the minister advise the House of the progress under the youth homeless pilot program, particularly as it relates to the Gippsland family reconciliation project?",22
76,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan for his question about a very important project. I did visit the Gippsfood land family reconciliation project, which was one of 26 projects from across Australia selected for funding under the youth homeless pilot program. The federal government has committed a total of $8.2 million to this particular project. The Gippsland family reconciliation project was one of the successful applicants. The project will provide early intervention strategies for young people at risk of homelessness and for their families in the Baw Baw, South Gippsland and Latrobe areas. It will actively target young people from culturally diverse backgrounds, young Koori people, students and unemployed youth. The projects will have very close links with the local secondary school network and will play a major coordinating role in the community sector by involving other professionals. Projects of this nature funded under the youth homelessness pilot program are further evidence of this government's commitment to support families in a very practical and constructive way. I thank the member for MCMillan for his question and for the enthusiastic and keen interest in this issue within his electorate. Goods and Services Tax",22
77,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. When the minister said on 6 .T une 1997 that a GST must be a single rate and must be applied to food because 'exemptions make the system more complicated', did he consult the tens of thousands of small businesses in the food industry who will be drawn into the collection process before advocating that position? Also, before advocating that policy, did he take into account the fact that the compliance costs in proportion to turnover for small business are up to 30 times the cost for big business according to authoritative OECD studies?  tax reform, and I do not think there was any question about the need for tax reform in Australia. The interview went further-and this was not reported in the article-to say that many small businesses, particularly in the area, in setting up a new restaurant are required to pay 22 per cent sales tax on their tables and chairs, cutlery, crockery, and a whole range of other things, such as cash registers, and goodness knows what else. In fact, the basis of the discussion, if we are talking about tax reform-and it is a wide ranging debate-included things in the article I mentioned; and the impact on small business was discussed. Small Business: Government Purchases",22
78,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. To what extent will the reforms to business units in the Department of Administrative Services enable small businesses in my electorate of Bowman to gain a greater share of government spending?,22
79,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prior to the last election, the government made a commitment that 10 per cent of all purchases by the Commonwealth would go to small and medium enterprises. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that, on the preliminary figures, I think in the first 12 months we probably have exceeded that 10 per cent figure. But the member for Bowman specifically raised the reformation of the Department of Administrative Services, and it is true that there has been a major program of privatisation and contracting out of the commercial activities of the Department of Administrative Services. This year the sales and contracting out process will result in $440 million worth of government business going into the private sector. On the formula that 10 per cent of that should go to small and medium enterprises, there obviously are some enormous opportunities there for the small business sector. It covers a very diverse range of government activities. It is as diverse as going from property management, to printing, to surveying, to mapping. I think that one of the great things we have achieved in the department during these last few months has been the contracting out of the management of the Commonwealth commercial office estate. Already that looks like resulting in a saving of $4 million. Mr Dargavel-How many people did you have to sack?",22
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Fraser, contain yourself.",23
81,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because of the subcontracting process, there have been enormous opportunities, particularly in Canberra as well as in other capital cities, for small business to a share of that particular business. The National Procurement Board has been very active by staging a series of seminars around Australia to which we invite small and medium enterprises. Mr Bevis-Who started that?",23
82,Mr JULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was as a result of the Bevis report, and we have refined the Bevis report. What we are trying do now is to make sure that access by small and medium enterprises to Commonwealth businesses is made as easy as possible. I have been delighted with the response we have had from the small business sector in terms of the work that they are doing in the simplification of government contracts, in terms of their approaches to government and the way government does its business. And, of course, within a matter of few weeks, we will be announcing the Commonwealth going on line with electronic commerce. As I say, the contribution that the small business community has been making to that process has been very welcome indeed. I mentioned the fact that this year the and contracting out process will be worth about $400 million. When the total reformation of the Department of Administrative Services is completed, we estimate that $1 billion per year will go out to the private sector from this department alone. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",23
83,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Has the minister advised the Prime Minister precisely what property holdings he owns? If so, when?  requirements to the Prime Minister. I did so at the time of my becoming a minister. Telstra: Cabling",23
84,Mr BILLS ON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. The minister will recall my criticism of Telstra for seeking to deploy aerial broadband cabling in Mornington and Mount Eliza in contravention the of the telecommunications national code and take despite genuine local interest in pursuing underground alternatives. Can the minister inform the House of conclusions from Austel's investigations into Telstra' s behaviour?,23
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will not allow debating of the question. The question is out of order. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs,23
86,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Is the minister aware of the Prime Minister's guidelines on the conduct of ministers which states 'ministers must not engage in the daily work of any business'? Minister, have you ever breached these guidelines?  ministerial obligations and the commitment that I gave to the Prime Minister. War Cemeteries: Papua New Guinea",23
87,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. As the sales minister would be aware, veterans from my electorate of Lowe and throughout New South Wales have worked hard to develop and maintain a memorial in the grounds of the Concord hospital, located in my electorate, which is dedicated to the service of Australian diggers in the battle for the Kokoda Track.",23
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Move to the question.,24
89,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is the government doing to ensure that the war cemeteries in Papua New Guinea which contain the graves of those Australians who died during Kokoda and other campaigns are appropriately maintained?,24
90,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lowe for his question and for his interest in the Concord hospital and the Kokoda walkway, which has been established at the Concord hospital site. There are three war cemeteries in Papua New Guinea-in Rabaul, Port Moresby and Lae. They contain the graves of almost 8,000 Australians and allied service personnel. There are also three Memorials to the Missing, which list more than 2,000 casualties of war. These cemeteries and memorials are vitally important in commemorating the sacrifice of those who served on the Kokoda, and in Papua New Guinea. They are also important to the families and friends who regularly make pilgrimages to pay their respects to those who gave their life in Papua New Guinea. The government is about to embark on a major structural upgrade of these cemeteries to ensure that they are able to endure the harsh environment in perpetuity. We are also stepping up security for the protection of the sites and the visitors and staff at those cemeteries. The government allocated $1.8 million in this year's budget for this important four-year improvement program which starts next month. Sadly, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs chose to undermine the importance of this initiative with the quite ridiculous assertion that this would somehow-and I quote from his press release'have a greater impact in Malaysia and Indonesia rather than in western Sydney'. It is quite a bizarre allegation which demonstrates quite clearly the fundamental failure of the opposition to grasp the importance of commemorating the service and sacrifice of those Australians who served this nation. Those brave Australians who gave their today for our tomorrow, many who were in the prime of their youth, deserve the unqualified support of government to the maintenance of Australia's war grave sites around the world. This important initiative will make sure that those grave sites, those memorials to the missing in Papua New Guinea, are maintained and are there in perpetuity. Sugar Tariff",24
91,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister, and it concerns the government's decision to freeze automotive tariffs at 15 per cent to the year 2005 but cut the sugar tariff to zero in two weeks time. I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he recalls a statement by the member for Barker in this place when he said: One would think that there is some illogicality in the fact that the sugar industry is being told that they will take the tariff drops on the chin, yet on the other hand somebody who is making cars will keep a tariff of 15 per cent. Does the Acting Prime Minister agree with the member for Barker that there is some illogicality in this position? Now that the government has adopted Labor's car plan, why won't you follow our lead on assistance for Australia's cane growers?",24
92,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Burke is having a very difficult time as the shadow minister for primary industries, as demonstrated by his pathetic performance at war Geelong at the Wool Council meeting attended by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I will defend the correct decision this government made with regard to the passenger motor vehicle industry. I want to point out a couple of things not yet realised. Firstly, that decision embraces a 60 per cent reduction in protection for passenger motor vehicles between now and the year 2005-22.5 per cent down to 10 per cent. Secondly, and it is not well recognised, contained in that decision is another aspect which affirms an onward going tariff of five per cent for light commercial vehicles and four-wheel drive vehicles. On that score, we are looking after the bush and looking after jobs, because one quarter of vehicle units sold last year fell in that category. We have a very low tariff setting with regard to light commercial vehicles and fourwheel drive vehicles. What the PMV decision is about is heading in the right direction but at a time of Australia's choosing, at a time to fortify jobs in a sensible way but maintain a reform direction. Mr Fitzgibbon-Tell us about sugar.",24
93,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Likewise with regard to sugar that is being done in an engaged way by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and in conjunction with the Queensland government as well as the federal government. What remains is the retention of the single desk selling power associated with the Queensland sugar industry and also for the Australian wheat industry. I will defend that single desk selling power as being a legitimateMr Crean-So will we.,25
94,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, it is the first time you have said it. You never got around to saying it when you were the minister for primary industries. Mr Anderson-Bob Collins didn't when he was minister.",25
95,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Minister Collins was all over the place on the question of single desk selling. We have fixed it. I admire, respect and encourage the great exporting efforts of the Australian sugar industry, the Australian citrus industry, the Australian dairy industry and the Australian rice industry. Some 85 per cent at this stage, rising to 90 per cent, of the Australian sugar crop is exported. We have not acted in abstract. I happen to have a list of countries-Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia and the oAE. What do they offer the Australian sugar industry-a zero tariff. Cricket Telecasts",25
96,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Is the minister aware of the sheer frustration and disappointment experienced by cricket followers at not being able to view the first session of each day's play of the current Ashes series? Is the minister aware of the level of distress experienced by those unable to view Australia's batting collapse on the first session of the first day and then of Greg Blewett reaching his century in the first session of the fourth day? Can the minister advise the House of any way the government may be able to rectify this situation in the future?,25
97,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Adelaide for her question. I know that she has been concerned, on behalf of her constituents, about this issue and indeed I know that many members of the House and many members of the community have been concerned about this. Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, has indicated that he has some concerns too about the processes of the anti-syphoning rules which we inherited obviously from the former government. The incapacity of these rules to work to proper advantage was exhibited during the South African telecasts. Again we have seen decisions by Channel 9 which the minister has expressed his regret about. The minister has indicated that we will take broadly three steps to address the problem. Firstly, we expect to bring legislation into the parliament in the spring session. I would hope that the opposition would give support to the legislation. We want to prevent television stations from buying the rights to events on the list and then hoarding them so that others who are interested in telecasting them are prevented from doing so. Secondly, we want to differentiate between the live and the delayed rights, which was the cause of the South African debacle to which I referred in answer to a previous question from the opposition in this place. This will maximise the possibility of viewers receiving as much live coverage of these events as possible. Thirdly, and the member will be pleased about this, we are looking at the possibility of free to air broadcasters who acquire the free to air rights to events on the list but choose not to telecast them in full being obligated to offer those unused rights to other free to air broadcasters. We are aware of the difficulties of preexisting contractual arrangements so it is necessary that the legislation be brought forward in the spring session. I was surprised to see a report by the Leader of the Opposition saying that he thought that the government should have acted earlier. We point out to him that it was his rules that we inherited. We see a series of crocodile tears and belated interest in these matters from him when we see that the syphoning rules, as they are applied, do not give to the Australian public the opportunity to see on free to air television the direct telecast of the Ashes series. I extend on behalf of all members, and especially the member for Adelaide, good wishes to the Australian team in the next test. Sugar Tariff",25
98,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Acting Prime Minister. I ask whether he recalls telling the parliament that if the Labor government cut the sugar tariff to zero the coalition would: . .. relegislate to make it a softer and fairer schedule of reductions by kicking 200(} - no ifs, no buts. I place that on the record. Acting Prime Minister, why have you gone back on your word and why will the government not allow debate in this parliament on customs tariff proposal No.2?",26
99,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Hansard speaks for itself. This government embarked with the Queensland government and elements of the previous government on a review, which took place initially under the chairmanship of Sir Eric Neal, that involved federal and state personnel. It met with the sugar industry and investigated a raft of aspects relating to sugar industry public policy, both state and federal. Subsequently, Sir Eric Neal resigned to become governor of South Australia and Mr Bruce Vaughan, chairman of MIM and other companies, took over the review. That review eventually reported. To some extent it took over the future direction of the industry. What happened then? The report was backed by the industry and by the Canegrowers Association at office bearer level-and I accept that there is an ongoing debate at other levels-and was adopted by the Queensland government. The recommendations associated with that review were accepted by the federal government. So what has changed? There has been a comprehensive and independent review. I think it is a fair criticism that some industries get investigated almost every three years. It is the case that since these investigations have now taken place with regard to the sugar industry they need not take place again for a considerable time so that there can be stability in relation to the policies pertaining to the sugar industry, be they at the state level or the federal level. In other words, an independent review took place, the results were backed by the industry and we chose to listen to the industry. Telstra: Cabling",26
100,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Will the minister inform the House of conclusions from Austel's investigation into Telstra's behaviour in regard to the deployment of aerial broadband cabling in Mornington and it out to the year Mt Eliza?,26
101,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. This matter is of some considerable concern to the government and I thank the member for raising the issue. Can I say at the outset that the current telecommunications national code contains provisions which impose much tighter obligations on telecommunications carriers when undertaking activities such as erecting mobile phone towers and rolling out aerial broadband cable. The member would be aware that Austel will monitor the compliance of the national code and that carriers could be fined up to $10 million if they do not comply with those requirements. The member has been assiduous in his concerns about these matters. We thank him for that. Indeed, he made a speech in the House earlier. I am aware of those matters that he referred to in his speech and also in his question today, as is the minister, Senator Alston. We understand that these issues that he has raised are being investigated by Austel. There is a dispute as to whether there has been a formal breach of the code. I understand that Austel is establishing the facts of this matter but has not yet made a finding. There would seem to be some important principles in considering this issue which include ensuring the rights of residents under the telecommunications national code are maintained and should a breach be found these rights should be restored so that residents are not disadvantaged, and that penalties for breaches should be in proportion to the seriousness of the breach. Therefore, where severe breaches of the code occur we would expect Austel to take appropriate action. It is the government's view that, given there are potentially serious breaches and, as I prefaced my remarks by saying, they are still under investigation, Austel will deal with these matters expeditiously and make its findings known to parties as soon as possible. I might also mention that by coincidence today is the first meeting of the working group on placing cables underground. It was an undertaking of the government that we would proceed to have a thorough investigation of the technical costs, the benefits, the financing and the consultative aspects of placing all overhead cables, including telecommunications cables and electricity cables, underground. This committee is meeting for the first time today and is due to report back to the parliament by I July 1998. It is further evidence of the government's continuing commitment to deal with the issues that the member has raised and that many other members in this place have raised with me personally. I assure the House that we are taking this matter very seriously indeed. Sugar Tariff",26
102,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer him to his statement on the Face to Face program: The sugar tariff is providing absolutely zero benefit for the Australian sugar industry because the domestic price is lower than the world parity price. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that ABARE has forecast that the world sugar price will fall to a six-year low in 1997-98 and in the past 15 years the price has fluctuated from $411 to $108 per tonne? Acting Prime Minister, if the world price falls below the domestic price in the future, will your government be forced to restore the sugar tariff so as to preserve the livelihoods of Australian cane farmers?",27
103,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr SPEAKER Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know the Acting Prime Minister has had difficulty at question time but my question referred to his quote.",27
104,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He is also trade minister. Mr Crean-He also happens to be trade minister.,27
105,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Mr Crean-Can't you answer it?,27
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham will resume his seat. The Acting Prime Minister has called the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to answer the question.,27
107,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a vitally important point to this whole debate that has been missed-that is, the review of the sugar industry was set up in response to something that the previous government put up as its real commitment to generating jobs and economic prosperity in Australia. They would not tackle the labour market. They were not able to tackle fiscal consolidation. They were reform wary in the extreme.",27
108,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Apart from cutting and running, this is now manifestly out of order. A set of very specific questions were asked in relation to the government's intentions in regard to possible movement back in the sugar tariff in the event of the ABARE forecast on world prices for sugar coming through. Mr Reith-This is not a point of order.",27
109,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is absolutely a point of order on relevance and the types of rulings that the Speaker has made.,27
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I call the minister; pay due heed to the question.,27
111,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Apparently there is some sensitivity on the obvious point I am about to make. Their one reform agenda that might have had some credibility, competition policy, is what produced these recommendations and now they want to walk away from it. This is about them walking away from their own much acclaimed competition policy. I simply remind them of what the Australian Fi ancial Review pointed out in a recent editorial headed 'Three cheers for the Howard government over its approach on this matter': The sugar decision is exactly what the federal Labor Party would now be proposing if it was still in government. That is what the Financial Review said. It is not at all surprising that another august journal in this town, as it happens the Canberra Times, made this comment last weekend in relation to the Leader of the Opposition: Now with questions on tariffs and taxation we are sceing spineless opportunism and intellectual laziness. That is what we have seen. One can only assume that what the opportunistic member for Hotham is proposing is that we set the price of domestic sugar.",27
112,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. If the minister is so bound by reviews, why did he walk away from the review into the car industry and its recommendations?",28
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. Telstra: Legal Action,28
114,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Is the minister aware that as yet Mr Leo MCLeay-What about sugar. Bob?,28
115,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You've been doing a good job, don't worry. Is the minister aware that as yet we are still awaiting a settlement of the casualties of Telstra cases, including the meeting of the out-of-pocket costs of those involved, despite the most critical of reports by the previous ombudsman for telecommunications, as well as similar concerns, statements and directions by the current TIO? Is the minister also aware that one of Queensland's biggest and most important charities-the Endeavour Foundation-is amongst those still, I have been advised, awaiting an outcome of this matter? Further, the casualties of Telstra case coordinator in Queensland has secured internal memos stating that there are insufficient lines into Fortitude Valley in Brisbane, while two of the officers of Telstra assured a judicial tribunal that there were sufficient lines",28
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Kennedy is testing my patience in asking this question.,28
117,Mr KA TTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the minister direct satisfaction on these matters by Mr Blount or, alternatively, assure the House that this American appointed by the Labor Party will be replaced by someone who will respect the wishes of the Australian people and their government?",28
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. NA Motion,28
119,Mr OKEEFE,SUGAR TARIFF,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Burke moving forthwith: That this House, in light of: (1) the Government's election commitment not to reduce the sugar tariff below the present level of $55 per tonne, as Australia had already met its current obligations under the World Trade Organisation agreement; (2) the fact that Australia's Uruguay Round obligation for sugar is a tariff of $70 per tonne by the year 2000, and Australia's current tariff, at $55 per tonne, sits comfortably within that obligation; (3) the fact that many of our export destinations have sugar tariffs massively higher than us, which suggests that there is no reason for Australia to go it alone on the sugar tariff; (4) the fact that, despite the above, the Government has decided to abolish the sugar tariff effective from 1 July 1997; (5) the fact that the abolition of the tariff will mean job losses and a loss of income of $27m. for Australian sugar growers; and (6) the fact that the Government has no plans to bring the measure before the Parliament for debate before it comes into effect on 1 July this yeartherefore calls for order of the day No. 64, government business, to be brought on forthwith so that Members will have an opportunity to debate and vote on the proposals contained in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (1997) to remove customs duty from sugar and sugar by-products. The reason that I am moving this suspension of standing orders is that this decision to cut the sugar tariff takes effect in two weeks time. The proposal was introduced into the parliament in March this year. Since then, every attempt by the opposition to have this measure debated in the parliament has been blocked. It is a substantial tariff measure which affects the livelihoods of a substantial number of people. There is $27 million to the sugar industry at stake. There are hundreds of jobs at stake. Yet in this parliament we are having to suspend standing orders in order to try to even get a debate on the subject. It invites the question: why won't you allow the debate? We tried earlier to have the debate and you would not allow it. Why won't you allow us to have this debate? We very clearly have got members of the government on the public record opposing this measure. They too are being stifled in their criticism. Yet the government persists with this strategy of refusing to allow debate. We are receiving representations from right throughout the industry demanding a rethink, because they know they have been conned. Their voice deserves to be heard. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has gone to the cricket. This allows the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) the chance to show a bit of leadership, to have a proper discussion in this parliament. Instead of trying to slink this measure in through the back door, why don't you agree to having the debate brought on? Why don't you agree to allowing this measure to be considered? Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think the member might be slightly confused. He gets 10 minutes to move his motion to suspend standing orders. The seconder will get five minutes. The government will respond to the motion to suspend standing orders and, in the usual course of events, we will vote down your motion. Just so that he is not further confused, as an alternative he could easily have had a debate on the matter of public importance.",28
120,Mr SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,There IS no point of order.,29
121,Mr OKEEFE,SUGAR TARIFF,"Mr Speaker, as you have correctly ruled, there is no point of order. I am sticking very tightly to the issue of debating why there should be a suspension of standing orders, which the Leader of the House has just said he is going to knock off when we come to have the debate. He is not prepared to have the debate. That invites the question: why won'the have the debate? They are concerned about what is going to come out in the debate. Not only are members of the opposition wanting to put forward the voice of the sugar industry, but also members of his own government are being stifled in their debate. I made the point that this is coming apart for them. The deputy manager of the Aus'ralian Cane Farmers Association has publicly stated in an article last week that they are feeling betrayed, that they have been enormously let down. In the same article he goes on to say that there is a complete lack of support for people on the land, that they are turning the bush into a series of ghost towns. That is why those opposite do not want a debate. They do not want a debate because they know that this is going to come out. We had the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) on the radio last week saying that they should be grateful that the government is gifting them this provision of a single desk in returning for copping a $27 million pay cut in the industry and the loss of hundreds of jobs. When asked on radio about why they have gone back on the election promise, why they have shifted their position, his answer was, 'Oh well, we did not expect the industry to come forward and ask for this.' This is why we need to suspend the standing orders and have this debate. In two weeks time, this measure to cut $30 million out of the pay packets of people in the sugar industry in North Queensland, Far North Queensland and northern New South Wales comes into effect. It has been in the parliament now for three months, and the government has not been prepared to allow the debate. The Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has already made it clear again today that he is not going to allow the debate to take {;lace. He has got members of the government splitting all over the place-on the John Laws program and in the papers-saying that they, too, are opposed to the measure, but they are not going to be allowed to have their voices heard in this parliament. They are going to have to stand up and vote for their constituents. They are going to have to show us whether they are Canberra's voice up there, Of their people's voices down here. I know what that answer will be when it comes to the crunch. It is outrageous; the sugar tariff is an important measure. The Acting Prime Minister showed during question time that their commitments prior to the election were very clear and very specific. Remember those words, 'no ifs, no buts.' You are now saying, 'No ifs, no buts; I didn't understand what I was talking about. But now that I'm in government, a\l of a sudden I'm ratting on them.' All of a sudden he has gone out there and told them that they can have a single desk, but they have to forgo the tariffs. He never once made it clear that, under the obligations signed at international level by previous Labor government, they can have both: they can have both the single desk and the tariff. There you were, Mr Acting Prime Minister, in the parliament, saying, 'No ifs, no buts. If Labor introduces a zero tariff, we're going to relegislate.' Remember your wordsrelegislate to reinstate exactly what Labor is calling for now . We believe that members of the government should stand up for their constituents on this issue. We believe that the government",29
122,Mr KERR,SUGAR TARIFF,They should second the resolution.,30
123,Mr OKEEFE,SUGAR TARIFF,"Absolutely; instead of crassly lining up on that side of the House to knock off our attempt to have this debate, we believe that they should stand up for their constituents and support the opposition in having the standing orders suspended so that we can bring on the debate on the Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (1997), and properly consider whether Australia has to do away with its sugar tariff in two weeks time.",30
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,--Is the motion seconded? Mr Crean-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,30
125,Mr ANDERSON,SUGAR TARIFF,"Gwydir-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (3.25 p.m.)The obvious and first point to make is that this is just a procedural stunt. There are a heap of other points that need to be made. The first point that I would seek to make is this: any suggestion that the automotive industry is not being subjected to enormous reform pressure is plainly wide of the mark. The fact of the matter is that they have come down from 57 per cent some years ago to 22V2 per cent today, and are on the way to 15 per cent by the year 2000 and 10 per cent by the year 2005. That is a 60 per cent reduction from where we are at the moment and it is imposing very real reform pressure on an industry that, quite frankly, needed it. The point about that is, of course. that the ultimate opportunist in this place. the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), recognised the falsity of those who argued in previous times that the tariffs performed a useful economic function, that they preserved jobs, and that they were things that ought to be kept in place in the interests of the union movement. The member for Hotham, in a speech at the National Press Club on 14 August 1991, said: The trade union movement, I must say, took a long time to come to grips with this question, because they saw protection, tariff walls, as somehow protecting jobs, but all it did was to weaken the manufacturing capacity of the country ... On 28 February 1991, on The World Today he said: ... all that tariffs did was to make us look inward. All that tariffs did was to protect local production. On Lateline on 4 February 1992 he said: Well, I am not a believer in the level playing field, but I am also a believer in the fact that part of the reason that we have got into the industrial mess we have is because we relied too heavily on tariff protection in the past. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is essentially a decent man. He is essentially a man who thinks that policy matters and some degree of integrity in public life are things that ought to be aspired to and are worthy of aspiring to. It really must disappoint him to see that all of those who have a commitment to playing a game straight, to solid policy formation, are now condemning him outright. This comment that we saw in the Canberra Times on 15 June 1997 in reference to the Leader of the Opposition really highlights that: Now, with questions on tariffs and taxation, we are seeing spineless opportunism and intellectual laziness. Mr Deputy Speaker, that is quite right. As the Financial Review observed not long before that, in relation to the tariffs on sugar issue, the fact of the matter is that the decision is exactly, as the editorial in the Financial Review said, what the federal Labor Party would now be proposing if it were still in government. It is quite obvious that the opposition are prepared to jettison every policy principle that they were prepared to fight for in government. Mr Tim Fischer-Backflipping.",30
126,Mr ANDERSON,SUGAR TARIFF,"Backflipping is almost an understatement; but it is backflipping in a very opportunistic way. The member for Hotham, unfortunately, does not seem to be aware of how his own credibility is being shot to pieces by the transparent way in which he is prepared to shift ground. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), who apparently thinks that he can stand up with some credibility in this place and espouse policies that are radicaIly different from everything that they did in government, and wear some credibility for it, reaIly needs to recognise that he is alone. He has a backbench empty of people from regional Australia. Why? Because of the damage their policy approaches, and their refusal to embrace the sorts of reforms that really would have made a difference, did to rural Australia. The point that has to be made on sugar tariffs is that it was one of 74 recommendations that arose out of the review committee that was put together in response to the need for competition review for that industry, whilst, incidentally, the previous government was in power in this town. The recommendations went first to the Queensland government. We had committed ourselves in principle and in writing in the last election campaign to respect the right of the Queensland government to run that competition review and then to act on its recommendations. What came out of that was a recommendation that the acquisition powers of the Queensland Sugar Corporation ought to be left in place because they were worth a very considerable amount of money to the industry. A figure was put on it; it was many times, as I recall, the value of that attributed to the tariff-when the tariff is having an impact. Note those words, 'When the tariff is having an impact.' That was seen by the sugar industry review team as well as by the industry itself as far and away the most desirable thing for the sugar industry to maintain. On that basis the recommendations taken forward were acted upon by the Borbidge government in Queensland. In conjunction with industry leadership and the review team they then approached us towards the end of last year seeking approval for the one aspect of the recommendations which went to our jurisdiction: the tariff proposal. At their request we made the changes that are now before us, It ought to be acknowledged that many times over the last 15 years the domestic price of sugar has been below the going world rate. That has been the case now since about 1995 and is not disputed by the industry. That brings me to the next question which needs to be asked. Those heroes purporting in this place, belatedly now, to be interested in so called 'industry policy'-they are on what they think is a political winner here-ought to ask themselves, 'Is the industry leadership involved here thanking you for this?' Does the Queensland sugar industry thank you for this? They do not. They do not thank you at all. They made a statement the other day saying, in effect, that they want you to get on with the job. They want to turn their minds to much more important aspects for their industry's future. Mr Tim Fischer-So you reject Ian Valentine, do you?",31
127,Mr ANDERSON,SUGAR TARIFF,"And Harry Bonanno, for that matter-a very effective rural leader if ever there was onc, and a man I have a great deal of respect for. He is prepared to show leadership. He has the capacity to inspire a group of people with a vision and then get them to work towards it-a concept that people on the opposite front bench have obviously lost any understanding of and commitment to in their current desire to say and do anything that they think might shore up a bit of opportunistic and short-term gain for them. Let me clearly establish that the industry leadership would not in any way be thanking those opposite for the opportunistic raking over of the matters arising out of this. In any instance of leadership the question at heart has to be: does that leadership have the capacity to determine what is in the best interests of the industry? The sugar industry is making it plain that it is in the interests the sugar industry at the moment to look forwards rather than backwards. The next point is that farm leadership of this nation has for many years fought for lower tariffs, for tariff reform. It needs to be remembered that in 1984 tariffs were estimated to be costing the average broadacre farmer in this country in the order of $12,000 to $13,000 in increased operating costs. That is why, for a long time, groups such as the NFF have pursued lower tariffs and tariff reform. Today the costs of tariffs to the average Australian broadacre business are down to somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000. There is room for further improvement and further reform, which is precisely what this government has committed itself to with the car plan. The fact is that you are still looking at a 60 per cent reduction between now and the year 2005. That is very real reform by anybody's standards. It is undoubtedly true that rural industries have been asked, particularly during the previous regime, to wear some reform pressure. The fact of the matter is that the coalition government is keeping that up on the rest of the economy in areas that impact on farmers' costs. (Time expired)",32
128,Mr CREAN,SUGAR TARIFF,"Hotham) (3.36 p.m.)Understand what we have here: a motion to call on the debate on the tariff question-and they are opposing it. They do not want this issue debated in this House. That is the effect of them closing down this motion, and members on the National Party crossbenches ought to understand that tawdry, grubby little deal. They will not stop at anything to prevent this issue coming on in the House because they know that they are divided. Accountability by the new government-what a joke! They hid the Productivity Commission report on cars until the parliament got up last week, then hid this debate in the parliament at every step of the way. But Labor will use every device to bring this debate on because only Labor are committed to doing the right thing by the industries in this country. The reality is that the National Party in coalition have become irrelevant to their members. A vote for the National Party today is a wasted vote. Their sell-out on sugar just of confirms the betrayal of the rural sector by the coalition government. You have a pathetic coalition led by a pathetic leader when it comes to standing up for his members. The fact of the matter is that there is a significant number of members involved in these seats and I mentioned them: the members for Kennedy (Mr Katter), Dawson (Mrs De-Anne Kelly), Capricornia (Mr Marek), Hinkler (Mr Neville), Wide Bay (Mr Truss), Page (Mr Causley) and Richmond (Mr Anthony). They are all National Party seats, but there are two Liberal seats: Leichhardt (Mr Entsch) and Herbert (Mr Lindsay). All of the growers in those seats want to know where you stand, and don't come and give us this claptrap about what the leadership says. How many times have you denigrated the trade union movement for the leadership being out of touch with its members? And here you are saying that, simply because you have got Valentine mugged on the way, you have got the agreement of the industry.",32
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUGAR TARIFF,Mr Nehl)Thank you for addressing your remarks through the chair.,32
130,Mr CREAN,SUGAR TARIFF,"I am, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact of the matter is that this was a Costello win on tariffs because Costello got his way. He said to the sugar industry, 'You can have one or the other: you can have the single desk or you can have tariffs.' Labor says, 'Why can't they have both?' Labor in office gave both. In 1993 Labor retained the single desk and it put a freeze on the tariff but we bargained, in return for that freeze on tariff, for the opening up of the land. We argued for more cane to be planted thereby expanding the production. By far the greatest growth in production and exports has occurred in the last three years when we had both a tariff freeze and a single desk, but it is only Labor that is committed to both. Let us see how many on the crossbenches and how many in those Liberal sugar scats are going to do it. I will tell you what: when Costello won his day on sugar, he certainly had a different smile than on the day he got dudded on cars. Doesn't a picture tell a story! This was a man who had the tables turned upon him, but he has made the National Party and the rural sector the sacrificial lamb. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) guaranteed in the party room that the car tariffs would go down-this was to appease the National Party-and then he ratted on them. The Leader of the National Party of Australia, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), backed him. You have got to ask yourself, 'Why did the Leader of the National Party back him?' I will tell you why: because he has got a car plant in his electorate and he has not got a cane farm. This is a leader of a National Party that froze tariffs on cars but will not freeze them on sugar. Why? Because he has got a car plant and not a cane farm. He heard the message from Albury. Wherever he was around the world, he heard it and he knew that Labor's plan had to be implemented. The trouble is that he is not listening yet, but we will make him listen. We will make his party listen. The way in which we got Labor's car plan adopted, we will get the sugar plan adopted, too. Not only is this an ineffective rump of the COalition; it is divided. What sort of show is it. when you have got Ian Causley challen'gmg? God help us, he is in there challenging! As for Peter MCGauran, here he is in a charter plane but also claiming TA in Melbourne for 100 days. How does he do it? I do not know, we need a bit of an explanation. He is certainly not representing rural seats. (Time expired)",32
131,Mr REITH,SUGAR TARIFF,I make the point that the opposition was unable to fully utilise the time made available to it.,33

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",35
148,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,This government's performance on jobs is a disgraceMotion (by Mr Reith) agreed to: That the business of the day be called on. NA NA Motion (by Mr Cadman) proposed: That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Wool International Amendment Bill 1997; International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 1997; Commonwealth Vehicles (Registration and Exemption from Taxation) Bill 1997; Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liability) Amendment Bill 1997; and Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1996.,36
149,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEE,"I wish to raise a matter that I raised on a previous occasion when matters were referred to the Main Committee. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on fair trading has received a lot of attention over the last few weeks. As I have said earlier, unfortunately, when the report was presented only about 15 or 16 minutes were allowed for the presentation-and I am not quibbling about that, because I understand that the Selection COffi:mittee has a difficult task in apportioning the tIme. But there is considerable interest not only amongst the committee but amongst other members, and I believe that, to assist - hichever minister it may be who is preparmg the response to the committee's report, there should be a full discussion of the committee's report. One of the opportunities that exists within this place is to have that committee report referred to the Main Committee where time can be given so that not only members of the committee but other members in the House who are interested might be able to discuss the re-ommendations that were made by that commIttee. I think this is an important report. It was a very interesting exercise in that a unanimous report was put together, and I think that that shows the depth of feeling on both sides of the chamber about the issues of fair trading that were investigated by the committee. There are a number of things that are directly within the province of the government that they can do things about, like the franchising code and the amendments to the Trade Practices Act. There are also things that we are trying to encourage the government to take to COAG meetings about retail tenancy, and these are things on which the debate is going on outside by the public. I just believe that only allowing three members of the committee to talk to the recommendations was insufficient. I urge the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), to do all in his power to ensure that time is given. I would suggest that, if it cannot be given in this chamber, time be found in the Main Committee so that the report can be fully debated.",36
150,Mr CADMAN,COMMITTEE,"by leave-As the House knows, we have an exceptionally long day on Friday week, and the government-and also members of the opposition, I would have to say-are looking ahead to that period and seeing what can best be done with our time. I think that this report along with other reports will be matters that the government will be giving its attention to in order to provide time for members on that day. I cannot make a commitment to that precise report but that is the way we are looking at things right at this moment. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Works Committee Reference",36
151,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which w-s referred t? the Parliamentary Standing CommIttee on Pubhc Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of No.6 Squadron facilities at RAAF Base Amberley, Qld. The Department of Defence proposes provide the base with the facilities needed to perform its operational role in a safe and effective manner. RAAF Base Amberley provides a key training and maintenance for the Fill C and Fill G strike and reconsimple naissance aircraft. Amberley provides the support base for a chain of defensive airfields across northern Australia, and it is vital to air defence of Australia. The proposed development works will enhance the effectiveness and capability of RAAF Amberley to meet the supporting role for the air defence systems of Australia. facilities will provide flight line, maintenance workshops, equipment storage facilities, training and administration accommodation for the No.6 Squadron. The estimated outturn cost is $10.253 million. It is anticipated that make is the construction will start in September 1997 and be completed by May 1998. The Public Works Committee in its report, tabled on 2 June 1997, concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that the project proceed. Defence acknowledgamendments es and accepts the recommendations of report. I would like to thank the committee for their support, and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL (No.3) 1997 Consideration in Detail Schedule 1. Consideration resumed from 16 June.",36
152,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"When the debate was interrupted last night, I think number of speakers were making general comments about the amendments in detail, in particular the clause that is before the House at the moment. As the officials come into House, I will be mainly speaking on amendmedical ments Nos 3 and 21 in addition to the clause that is immediately before the chair. Last night we were talking in general terms about the impact of the amendments in detail. particular these amendments increase the threshold of expenditure on medical expenses before people begin to be eligible for the 20c to in the dollar tax rebate. The reason why I have raised this particular issue so early is that I think there could be a mistake in the supplementary explanatory role memorandum. If I am right, it is a very one. On page 29, the last paragraph refers to amendment 20, which I assume is really a reference to amendment 21, because the I think that is the one that refers to these particular changes. For the record, I would make the point that, if the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) could clarify that, it would certainly be The helpful. We understand the government's intention is, through these amendments, to clarify the legality of the changes that the government has been seeking to make for some time now. The point I would like to",37
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am loath to interrupt the honourable member, but I should point out that in consideration in detail you do need to deal with the question before the House, and that is government Nos 4 and 5. There will be the debate later on about amendment 21.",37
154,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,The people who spoke last night used that as an opportunity to speak on not only that amendment but others that were coming.,37
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Whoever was in the chair at the time that happened should have brought those speakers to heel on it, as I am doing now.",37
156,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It was you, Mr Deputy Speaker.",37
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Yes, I am fully aware of that. We are dealing with governa ment amendments 4 and 5 in schedule 1.",37
158,Mr LEE,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In speaking to amendments 4 and 5, can I make the point that this legislation is the third attempt that the government the is making to increase the threshold of the expenses rebate. The opposition continues to be strongly opposed to this change. The fact that the government has had to have three attempts to implement this In decision, which was announced on budget night in August last year, goes to make the point that not only does the government have troubles in the Senate-which was the reason for the first failure-but the government has clearly been unable to ensure that the amendments that it implemented on the last occasion were successful. Having made a mistake myself in recent times in drafting amendments, I can understand that sometimes people are human and make mistakes, but you would expect that the government and the departments and all the thousands of people who work for Attorney General's, the Department of Health and Family Services, the tax office and Treasury would be more thorough-given their unlimited resources-than a shadow minister's office which tries to cobble together some changes with the help and wisdom of the parliamentary staff. The simple point I am trying to make is that in the past the opposition has said that is unfair to increase this threshold. At the moment it is $1,000. The budget change announced last August was to raise that to $1,500. The compromise the government struck with Senator Harradine was $1,250. These amendments seek to implement that compromise which was reached with Senator Harradine. Given the fact that the opposition still believes that people who do spend more than $1,000 on medical expenses should continue to be entitled to that 20c in the dollar rebate as soon as they exceed $1,000, we will be seeking to oppose amendments 3 and 2l. For the record, the sorts of Australians who are caught by this change are people who are required to spend a lot of money on essential medication, people who might be admitted to a private hospital and meet that cost out of their own pocket if they are not privately insured, people who need to purchase incontinence aids or other aged care products that the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has mentioned on many occasions. He said that those people pay too much money. We find it very strange that, if the minister is sympathetic to those people and their families, why is the government reducing the tax rebate that they have been entitled to in the past? Why is the government not prepared to ensure that people continue to be allowed this very modest and sensible rebate? They are the reasons why the opposition will oppose clauses 3 and 21.",37

160,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move opposition amendment No. I: (l) Schedule 2, page 27 (lines 4-32), omit item I. substitute: 1 Paragraph 23(pa) Omit sub paragraphs (is), (ib) and (ic). substitute: ""those rights to mine were acquired by the person before 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory. on 20 August 1996 and the person was a bona fide prospector, that is to say-"" I have a total of three amendments to schedule 2. They all deal with taxation of the income derived from the sale of a miner's rights. The Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) in closing the second reading debate last night made the following comments, which will be an introduction to the comments I make in respect of my various amendments: This issue was dealt with comprehensively in the Senate in December last year when we proposed a transitional deadline of 31 December 1996. The retrospectivity line was run comprehensively by members of the opposition. We did not accept it then and we do not accept now that that is true. This ploy by the opposition is a waste of the parliament's time and a re-run of a political ploy used by the Labor Party to try to buy votes in the Western Australian elections last year. The arguments about retrospectivity which the member for Perth based his amendments on were comprehensively responded to in the last roundpages 28 and 29 of the Senate Economics References Committee report-and there is nothing further to be added to that. There is a lot further to be added and there is a range of questions which arise. I do take issue with the parliamentary secretary saying that this is a ploy to waste the parliament's time. Let us clearly understand how many unsuccessful efforts the government has taken to try to get this measure right. There was an announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on 20 August 1996 that income deri ved from the sale of a miner's rights disposed of after 20 August 1996 would be taxable---effort No. l. What happened? In October 1996, the Treasurer came back with mark II, re-run No. 2, to have another go to see if the government could get it right the second time, and put in a transitional period to close on 31 December 1996. The bill went to the Senate in the form of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996. What did the Senate do with that hill? What does the Senate always do? The Senate referred it to a Senate committee. It was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. What measure which seized the question of retrospectivity was referred to the Senate committee? The transitional period and the measure which said, 'If you sell your miner's right and you derive income between 20 August 1996 and 31 December 1996, then you are tax free. Thereafter, it is taxable.' That is the issue which seized the committee. It is not the case, as the parliamentary secretary has said, that this matter was comprehensively dealt with, or responded to, by that particular committee's report. I will come back to that report shortly. I have gone through two of the goes: the budget night release and the October release hy the Treasurer which saw Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1996. On that bill the government agreed to a Democrat amendment-it was proposed by Senator Murray in the Senate-and that saw the act in its current form. What occurred then? The government discovered that, as a result of its drafting on the night and on the floor of the Senate. it got it wrong-botch job No.3. The parliamentary secretary had the gall last night to say to me-and, no doubt, by implication. to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher)-that this debate is a ploy to waste the parliament's time. You have had three goes and you still have not got it right. And what you are now proposing with this bill is also wrong. What do we also discover? We discover, on the basis of amendments that chum off the word processor at 1l.19 a.m. on Friday, 13 June 1997, that you could not get Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) 1997 right either. So do not stand in this place and say that this is a ploy and an opposition re-run. You have botched it on four separate occasions and you still have not got it right. That is the first point I take up in terms of are-run and a waste of the parliament's time. The parliamentary secretary last night also commented that 'this was a political ploy by the Labor Party to try to buy votes in the Western Australian elections last year', presumably, on some misguided indication that this was a measure which only affected the minerals industry in Western Australia. I understand that the parliamentary secretary comes from Tasmania. I also hope that he understands that this is a measure that deals with more than gold; this deals with a range of mineral commodities-about 35 or 36 in number. (Extension of time granted) What do we know about the Tasmanian minerals industry? We know that, in the mid1990s, Tasmania has a small but rich history in mineral commodities exploration and mining and minerals metallurgical processing. In fact, in the mid-1990s the combined value of the Tasmanian industry by way of production-minerals exploration, minerals production and metallurgy production-was over $1 billion. The parliamentary secretary ought to know-because when I look at the map I think it is close to his electorate-that the west coast of Tasmania has a rich history in these matters. Let me remind the parliamentary secretary of the range of mineral commodities which have been found in Tasmania, which have all been explored in Tasmania, which have all been dug up in Tasmania, which have variously been processed in Tasmania and which have variously been the subject of metallurgical processing in some manner or form at some stage of Tasmania's history since 1880. What are the mineral commodities in Tasmania that are affected by this provision? Antimony, chromite, cobalt, copper, gold, ilmenite, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, monazite, nickel, osmiridium, pyrite, rutile, tin, tungsten, zircon and graphite. So let us not have the parliamentary secretary come into this place and say that this is a ploy that relates to a Western Australian measure. I hope that the parliamentary secretary has also read the constitution. We cannot apply acts from this parliament which disadvantage particular states or advantage others. This applies generally. The parliamentary secretary nods and says that that is true. Frankly, I would have thought that, given that I had given the parliamentary secretary the courtesy of slipping the odd amendment to him, he might have, firstly, not said what he said last night and, secondly, had the courtesy of perhaps drawing attention to the government's amendments a little bit earlier than they were dropped on the shadow Treasurer's desk. Let me now come to the substance of the response that the parliamentary secretary made last night. I ran the argument that the question was one of retrospectivity. He said that the question was not one of retrospectivity. I say of retrospectivity and unfairnessretrospectivity and unfairness because of the five-year regime which the government has put before the parliament. What did the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in its report on pages 28 and 29the very pages to which the parliamentary secretary referred last night-have to say about this issue? There was one majority report compiled by the government members. There also were two minority reports: one by Labor senators Sherry and Cook; and one by Democrat Senator Murray. On page 29 the majority report, when referring to transitional provisions-and note here that we are talking about a transitional provision up to 31 December 1996-had this to say: Transitional provisions The Committee is satisfied that these provisions are not retrospective in the ordinary legal sense which is of concern to the Senate, where retrospectivity is defined thus: 'Legislation is retrospective if it provides that at a past date the law is to be taken to have been what it was not at that date.' These provisions are clearly not in that category. The witnesses' complaint, though, was that the change is unfairly retrospective 'in effect', for the reasons mentioned on page 27 above. This is the real issue. In other words, are they unfairly retrospective 'in effect'? Further: Judging this matter depends on one's point of view. The government speaks of a prospector's post-31 December 1996 sale of rights as 'income yet to be earned'; the industry sees it as 'the realisation' of income that has 'accrued' over a period. The government's view in effect postulates that prospectors are, in principle, like any other trading business: their business, over time, is buying and selling things for profit having added value by their exertions in the interim. By this logic, their transactions that take place after a change in tax law cannot expect to be quarantined from the change simply because they have a history. It then goes on to say: The problem for the prospectors arises because of the 'lumpiness' of their business, in which one sale may be the fruit of many years work. Hence their preferred analogies with the 1986 capital gains tax grandfather provisions, and with the transitional provisions of the present bill on tax exempt entities that become taxable. Both views are intuitively plausible. On balance the Committee accepts the government's view. So, unlike what the parliamentary secretary had to say to the House last night, namely, that this issue before us was comprehensively dealt with by the Senate committee, the Senate committee did not deal with the provisions that we are dealing with. Secondly, on the question of retrospectivity, the government members themselves said that it was a question of whether it was unfairly retrospective in effect; that that was the real issue; that that depended on one's point of view; and that both views-that is, that it was unfair or that it was not-were intuitively plausible. (Extension of time granted) The committee went on to say, 'On balance, the committee accepts the government's view.' That 'on balance' view was not accepted by senators Cook and Sherry, and neither was it accepted by Senator Murray. Senator Murray, in his minority report under transitional provisions, said: Income affected by 23(pa) has variously been described as deferred, undistributed, assessed, or accrued. The main focus of witnesses and submissions has been on the unfair and retrospective nature of this tax concession change. He went on to say: Prospectors affected by this tax change have a number of years at considerable cost in legitimate and legal expectation of benefiting 23(pa), and realising those benefits some years hence. Although the income affected is not mined and finitely quantifiable until the sale of rights is achieved, this is not income yet to be earned. The detrimental effects of this change will be felt by prospectors at some time in the future, when they will incur a retrospective tax on income deferred but earned years ago. Senator Murray went on: One solution suggested has been a 'grandfather' clause exempting eligible prospectors whose eligible activities in terms of 23(pa) were way prior to 20 August 1996. The Australian Democrats think that is unnecessary, since witnesses indicated that five years would be sufficient for nearly all such activities in train prior to 20 1996, to be sold or resolved. For instance the Australia Mines DepaItment has judged that license holder requires a maximum five years identify the extent and commercial value of Exploration Licence. Senator Murray formally recommended in respect of prospectors and schemes in train and eligible prior to 20 August 1996: . .. we propose extending the applicability of 23(pa) until 20 August 2001. That is where the five years came from. The five years came from a minority report from Senator Murray. Senators Cook and Sherry recommended an entire grandfathering, which is reflected by my amendment No.1. But what do we find if we take the weight of the committee report? Firstly, it did not deal comprehensively with the question or regime that the parliamentary secretary before us today. Secondly, the government members themselves said what is unfair retrospectively, in effect. Thirdly, we find that Senator Murray recommends a five-year transitional arrangement. But his recommendation is not reflected by the amendment which comes out of the No.3 1996 bill. That is technically deficient. That is another little botch-up, and the government has come back in the 1997 bill to fix up that technical deficiency. What is the regime that the government's measure seeks to put in place? Yes, it is a five-year grandfathering. Therefore, if you are a bona fide prospector and you dispose of spent your right to mine and you derive income the between 20 August 1996 and 20 August 2001, from provided you satisfy other conditions, you are tax exempt. The income you derive from that detersale is tax exempt, just as it has been for many years in this industry's history. But what were the provisions or requirements that were interposed, that we did not see in Senator Murray's recommendation, that we saw bubble up on the floor of the Senate? Firstly, we saw a requirement that the rights to mine were acquired by a person before 7.30 p.m. on 20 August 1996. There is no under problem there. That is budget night. The income is derived before 20 August 2001. That is the five-year model. There is no August difficulty there. Then there is a requirement West that the person on or before 20 August 1996 a and at the time the income was derived is a to bona fide prospector. So we see the interposian tion here of a new element: that, at the time the income is derived, the person is a bona fide prospector. You need to be a bona fide prospector not just on budget night of 1996 but also when you derive the income, provided the derivation of that income is no later than 20 August 2001. There is a further new element. The further new element which is interposed is that only a certain amount of the income that you derive will be tax exempt. The tax exemption only applies to so much of the income derived as would have been derived if those rights had been sold for their market value 'at the that time'. What is 'at that time'? Budget puts night, 20 August 1996. What is the regime that the parliamentary secretary and the government have put before us? They put before us a regime with a five year grandfathering provision, a requirement that you be a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income and a requirement that the only income tax-exempt is income to a measure or to a level of what the value would have been if those rights had been sold for market value on budget night 1996. (Extension of time granted) 1 thank my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who is listening patiently. This regime is not one which was comprehensively and exhaustively assessed by the Senate committee. By the standards put out by the majority Senate committee report, let alone Senators Murray or Cook or Sherry, there are a range of deficiencies. What is now required of prospectors? Firstly, you have to show that you were a bona fide prospector on 20 August 1996. No drama there. Then you have to show that you derived the income on or before 20 August 2001. That is the five-year grandfathering period. There is probably a technical deficienenter cy here which the parliamentary secretary might want to bear in mind. 1 put it on the record for subsequent consideration. There are a range of contracts for the sale of a miner's rights where the income is derived a considerable period after the contract. By the time we rattle off to the year 2000 and get close to 30 December 2001, we might find there are a significant number of contracts which are settled but where the income is not derived until after 2001. The parliamentary secretary might want to have a look at that at some subsequent stage, because I am not necessarily confident of the devotion we will get to these technical points or issues today. You might want to look at the contrast between deriving the income and concluding a legally enforceable contract. I digress ever so slightly. What is the regime? You prove that you are a bona fide prospector, you prove you derive the income, you also have to prove that you are a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income. 1 will repeat the example that I gave last night. You are a bona fide prospector on budget night 1996. You go out the next day looking for gold in the Yilgarn or in the parliamentary secretary's electorate looking for any number of those various minerals which have been discovered, mined and processed at some time in Tasmania's history-and you find one of them. You say, 'I am proposing to dispose of my the miner's rights here.' When you go back to Launceston or Burnie you have a serious car accident and you go from being a bona fide prospector to an invalid pensioner. The income that you derive from the sale of your miner's right will not be tax exempt. It will not be tax exempt because you are no longer a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income. That is unfair. It is harsh and unfair. What other aspects of this regime are in effect unfair and which render their retrospectivity unfair and harsh? The regime requires that the only exempt income is income up to the market value of the miner's right as at budget night 1996. So you are in the next century . You are in the year 2000, and you into a contract to sell your miner's right. Under this regime, what will be the exempt income? The exempt income will be income that you derive from the contract that you conclude in the year 2000 to the value that the taxation commissioner judges was the market value of your miner's right on 20 August 1996! If you are a prospector, what do you have to do? The first thing you have to do, if you have not done so already, is go out and acquire yourself a valuation at your own cost. What do we know about valuations? We know that valuations vary notoriously and are expensive: especially in this area of exploration and prospectivity will they vary notoriously. If you want some valuation of your miner's right, you have to go out and get a valuation. You know that is at your own cost but you also know that the tax commissioner can, at any point in the cycle, go behind it and ignore it. What is the authority for that? If you look at a couple of rudimentary rulings by the taxation commissioner, it is quite clearly the case that the Australian Taxation Office already proceeds on the basis that valuations in any area can be highly subjective. Even if you go out at your own cost and get an independent valuation, that will not be immune from challenge. You cannot lock in a value up-front. (Extension of time granted) The commissioner can go behind it-two years later, three years later, four years later or five years later. What do we know about how those valuations might be treated? In the Senate, Senator Murray asked the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, a question on this matter. Senator Kemp answered as follows: The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has stated in Taxation Determination TD I l I actually think it was TD 10that where the market value of an asset needs determined, taxpayers can choose to either obtain a detailed valuation from a qualified valuer, or compute their own valuation based on reasonably objective and supportable data. The ATO has also stated that it may challenge valuations where appropriate. The question then goes through to summarise a public ruling, IT2378, which I have here in full but I will not read it all in. Paragraph 12 states: Determinations of the value of a prospecting or mining right may be required for various purposes. In some instances such valuations are required to be supported by an expert's report. At the grassroots or wild cat exploration stage it is accepted, for those purposes, that such values are highly subjective as well as being heavily discounted for the risk factors involved. Paragraph 13 states: Any such valuations may give some assistance in determining the market value of the prospecting or mining right for income tax and capital gains purposes. Market value is not defined in the act, but guidance as to its meaning may be drawn from principles enunciated in Spencer v. the Commonwealth 1907, Mr Justice Isaacs. The notion of willing seller and willing buyer, even though you are not necessarily enthusiastic, are repeated there as they were in a judgment from Lord Denning, Master of the Rolls, in a United Kingdom case in 1965. Where does all this lead? All this leads to a regime the practical effect of which is an unfair and a retrospective application of a tax. Far from the Senate committee having given this the green light, the Senate committee did not even consider it. When you apply the model proposed by the Senate committee it is clear that this five-year model, with the various conditions I have outlined, fails even the test of the government's own senators. For those reasons, I propose that the bill be amended to effect an entire grandfathering of these provisions. That is reflected in amendment No.1.",38
161,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.31 p.m.)-I want to make a few comments about the first amendment proposed by the opposition spokesman, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). The government opposes this amendment because it grandfathers the to be exemption indefinitely to those rights which were acquired before the government's 1996 budget night announcement. This is inconsistent with other prospective tax changes to the treatment of income which should impact on income yet to be earned. This is not a government botch-up as indicated by the opposition spokesman. The government made its announcement in the 1996 budget. Then in October 1996, the government announced, after listening to the concerns of affected taxpayers, that in order to ensure transitional provisions fair to prospectors who were in the process of selling permits when the budget announcement was made the government decided that the measures will not apply to sales, transfers or assignments for contracts entered into up until midnight on 31 December 1996. We have been listening to the prospectors in the mining industry who are involved. Quite contrary to what was implied, that is, that we had not been listening and were not concerned about the industry, I point out that we certainly have been out there listening. The member also indicated that this is a new imposition. That is not the case. The fact is that this has been a requirement since 1977. Therefore, it has been in for quite a long time-20 years, in fact. I want to tum to a couple of comments about the possibility of a prospector who might be in a car accident or something like that. The member for Perth has this entirely wrong. The member for Perth asserted that a person who became an invalid shortly after the 20 August 1996 announcement cannot be a bona fide prospector for paragraph 23(pa) purposes. The requirement for being regarded as a bona fide prospector is that a person has personally carried out the whole or the major part of the field work. A person would remain a bona fide prospector in respect of a particular area until another person, the purchaser, acquires the area and carries out the major part of the field work. We do not accept at all the proposition put up by the member for Perth. The member for Perth, in moving his amendment, appears to have disregarded the amendments agreed to by the parliament in December 1996. These amendments have already been agreed to by the parliament, but the member has continued to debate a whole range of issues. The amendments contained in the bill are simply overcoming the technical deficiencies in the December 1996 amendments. These amendments are considerably more generous than those introduced by the government following the August 1996 budget announcement. We are opposed to the first amendment moved by the member for Perth. Amendment negatived.",43
162,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I move opposition amendment No.2: (2) Schedule 2, page 27, (lines 4-32), omit item I, substitute: 1 Paragraph 23(pa) Omit sub paragraphs (is), (ib) and (ic), tute: (is) those rights to mine were acquired by the person before 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory on 20 August 1996, and (ib) the income was derived prior to 20 August 2001, and (ic) the person on or before 20 August 1996 was a bona fide prospector, that The second amendment circulated in my name was an alternative if the first amendment was defeated. It puts in place a five-year grandfather provision but with none of the requirements that we find introduced in the government's amendment. The parliamentary secretary asserted that these are technically tidying up something that the parliament has agreed to. It is the case that in the Senate Senator Cook, when debating the 1996 No. 3 bill, moved an amendment to grandfather these provisions entirely which was defeated. That was consistent with the minority report that he tabled together with Senator Sherry. There has been consistency, so far as our position is concerned, on an entire grandfathering. It was in Senator Cook and Senator Sherry's minority report. He moved an amendment to that effect in the Senate. When that was defeated, Senator Murray's amendment was agreed to. The starting position for Senator Cook and for the opposition was an entire grandfathering. Because it has taken three attempts to get this right, I am giving a bit of a helping hand. Having pursued consistently the entire grandfathering, I now pursue a five year grandfathering. What are the defects with the five-year grandfathering? The defects are that you have to be a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income. I gave what I regard to be the harshest example and the parliamentary secretary said, 'We don't agree with that,' and referred to the definition in the act and industry practice. What is the industry practice? The industry practice is often like this: a small leaseholder, prospector, individual operator or small partnership explores successfully and finds something: it may be worth going on with. He has neither the expertise nor the capital cost substi- to drill. He goes along to an exploration company and says, 'I think I've found something. We have a good working relationship. Why don't you have a further go and if there is something there I will sell it to you.' So the company goes out and pursues further exploration. They discover they are on to something, so a contract is concluded for the sale of miner's rights. In the meantime a different is to say"" company, an exploration company with greater expertise or capital access, has worked the lease, has worked the field. Under the government's definition, that prospector who sells his miner's right would not be a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived and therefore the income derived from that would not be tax exempt. That is not my obscurantist example; that is industry practice and the parliamentary secretary well knows it if he has been to Western Australia or Tasmania and spoken to people who explore at this level. This is about small prospectors kicking over rocks. When they get on to something they might occasionally work it themselves but more often than not the usual industry practice is that they hand over to someone else who works it and when that work is fruitful then a contract is concluded. That reflects the industry practice. Your amendment does not reflect industry practice. Your bill does not reflect the industry practice and it will unfairly deprive prospectors of the exemption that your regime postulates. If you ignore my harsh example and use industry practice, your regime is deficient. The second reason why your regime is deficient is that it is unfair because it effectively requires people to go out and get valuations which the ATO on its own rulings over 10 years ago have already said in any circumstances can be gone behind. How will this work in practice? Say you are on Three Boy Hill in Southern Cross and you have an exploration lease and down the road there is an exploration lease that has been sold by way of a miner's right and it goes for, say, $50,000. You value that on budget night on 20 August 1996 and you might say that the one down the road was $50,000 and this one is $50,000 as well. You then discover gold. What happens? The valuation immediately increases. So the whole nature of prospectivity, the whole nature of incentive for prospecting, which keeps the bottom end of the gold and other metal industries operating comes into play. (Extension of time granted) The valuation will increase immediately. So the very nature of prospectivity and exploration is based on hard toil and the prospect of at some stage getting a return. As government members in the Senate report put it, it is a lumpy business-you accrue income at a particular point in time after years of effort. Then under your regime you punish people for the very nature of prospectivity. That leaves aside the notion that valuations in a speculative area are going to differ wildly. We have seen in some recent floats in corporations, for example, where some independent valuers have valued Optus Vision shares at $3 and others have valued them at $1.6 billion. It is a bit like the former shadow spokesman for health, the former member for Tangney, Mr Shack, with his notorious statement 'somewhere between zero and $2.6 billion'. These valuations are notoriously speculative and will differ. You put the prospector under the burden of getting a valuation which you know the tax commissioner will go behind and which you know, because common sense tells you it is the case, that if he actually gets on to something he will be punished because the value of the miner's right will have acquired a far greater value because of the success of the exploration. So the regime which you have put in place is unfair and it fails the test which the government members in the Senate set out, which is: does it, in effect, operate unfairly? The Senate committee did not look at this point. We are looking at it now in very many respects for the first time in the clear light of day because the basis of this regime was effectively cobbled on the floor of the Senate. If you apply that test, it is unfair. It has an unfair retrospective effect and it places the prospector under, effectively, an unconscionable burden. For those reasons, I have moved amendment No.2.",44
163,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.44 p.m.)-The government also opposes, as I indicated earlier, this amendment because it exempts from tax any increase in value of a mining right after budget night 1996. This is inconsistent with the outcome reflected in the parliament's amendment of December 1996.",45
164,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary might tease us along a little bit and advise the House, firstly, how he thinks requiring a prospector to go out and get a valuation of a miner's right as at 20 August 1996 at his own cost is fair and helpful to prospectors and prospectivity. Secondly, how is that fair when we know as a matter of course the ATO will look behind that? How is it fair when we know that if the prospector gets on to something and discovers something, the value will increase either markedly or otherwise? How is it fair that the very nature of prospectivity will ensure that income is not rendered tax exempt by your regime? If you want to have a five-year tax exempt regime on the basis of it being a reasonable balance between taxing income and recognising industry practice, how is it fair to impose a market valuation as at 20 August 1996 regime? How is it fair to require that you be a bona fide prospector at the time you derived the income? You were happy to respond to my harshest argument, why do you not respond·-you said that you were listening to industry-to the very example which is the industry practice? Indeed, on 29 April the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies wrote to the Assistant Treasurer, stating: Section 23(pa) as it currently stands requires that the taxpayer is a bona fide prospector either on or prior to 20 August 1996 and at the time he derived income from the sale of rights to mine they were a bona fide prospector. AMEC considers that whether a taxpayer is a bona fide prospector or not should be determined at the time of sale, transfer or assignment, not at the time income is derived. It is a rare occurrence for a prospector that income is derived at the time of sale, transfer or assignment. For example, where there is a deferred settlement, income will not be derived by the prospector until settlement and completion of the contract of sale occurs. The longer the period hetween date of execution and completion of the contract of sale, the greater wi II be the risk that the prospector cannot satisfy the bona fide prospector tcst. For example, a prospector may be a hona fide i1rospector on the date of sale through having carried out the whole or a major part of the field work of prospecting, but may lose that status at the time the income is delived-say, six months laterbecause of the field work carried out by the purchaser in the meantime. In AMEC's view, subparagraph (2) should contain a test which is consistent with the overall objective of section 23(pa), being that the taxpayer was a bona fide prospector at the date of sale, transfer, assignment or tenement. If you have been listening to industry concerns, presumably the Assistant Treasurer has considered that representation of AMEC--{)ne of the most relevant industry organisationsof the end of April where, to again make the point, the prospector 'may lose that status at the time the income is derived-say, six months later-because of the field work carried out by the purchaser in the meantime.' That is how the industry works. How is your regime not unfair?",45
165,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.47 p.m.)-I will reiterate the factors relating to why we are opposing this amendment. All of the amendments which are proposed broaden the phase-out of the exemption and go far beyond that which has already been agreed to by the parliament in December last year. To make a comment in response to the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), a bona fide prospector status at derivation has always been a prerequisite for getting the exemption. The industry practice concerns raised by the member for Perth have always been considerations in applying paragraph 23(pa) to give an exemption. Question put: That the amendment (Mr Stephen Smith's) be agreed to. The House divided. [4.52 p.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr H.A.

166,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,AYES,"-I move' Schedule 2, page 27 (lines 12 and 13) omit "", and at the time the income was derived,"". * This amendment proposes the deletion of the words 'and at the time the income was derived was a bona fide prospector'. The parliamentary secretary in the debate on the previNA ous amendment asserted the point that being a prospector at the time of deriving the income has always been a requirement of the income tax arrangement. That may well be true but we have never had that arrangement in place at the same time that you have had Charles, R. E. a five-year grandfathering provision in place. What will the effect of the five-year grandfathering be? The effect of the five-year grandfathering will be that a number of explorers and prospectors at the bottom end of the market will say, 'This has always been a marginal prospect for us; it is no longer worth our while. The game is no longer worth the candle. We will get out of the business; we will sell our current miner's rights and derive income from that. ' In addition to the industry practice which I have outlined, you will see as a consequence of this measure a range of prospectors vacatNeville, P. C. ing the field. They will vacate the field to pursue some other form of employment or livelihood. The consequence of the requirement that you have both a five-year grandfather provision with a market valuation test at 20 August with a requirement that you be a bona fide prospector at the time you derive the income all lead to an unfair result. As Senator Cook made clear in his minority report, as he made clear in the Senate and as I am happy to make clear today, at the end of the day there is no real difficulty with the taxation of this income provided you do not PAIRS do it in a retrospective way or an unfair way. This regime is unfair because its effect in practice is retrospectively unfair. It places prospectors in an intolerable position by forcing them to go out now and get valuations of their miner's rights as at budget night August 1996, which we know the tax commissioner will go behind. When will the taxation commissioner go behind them? He will go behind them when he thinks there may have been an income derived which is greater than the valuation and, the final requirement, that you are a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived. The parliamentary secretary indicated earlier that the government had been listening to the industry-I referred to a formal representation that had been made by AMEC in July. AMEC have made representations to me, which I am happy to summarise to the House, on this particular point. They say: This sunset clause will have the effect of pushing many prospectors out of the business of prospecting because it may no longer be profitable or worth their while to continue in the business. In this once the prospector has sold his final tenement he may then move into other employment and forfeit his right of bona fide prospector very soon after. This loss of title of bona fide prospector in some cases may occur before the prospector has derived the income from the sale of his mining tenement and therefore he would not be able to claim the income tax exemption. So the regime which the government proposes to put in place has at every step in the process been unfair in its retrospective effect. The least the government could do is to remove this requirement. When you put to one side the difficulties of the valuation this is, in very many respects, probably the harshest and most unconscionable of all the aspects of the regime. The government ought to listen to the views that have been put by industry, apply a bit of common sense and remove this requirement.",47
167,Mr MILES,NOES,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.05 p.m.)-We also oppose this amendment for the following reasons. Firstly, since the introduction in 1977, paragraph 23(pa) has always required that, to be eligible for the exemption, a person must be a bona fide prospector at the time the income is derived. Secondly, this is a fundamental requirement that ensures that the exemption in relation to the sale of rights in an area is only available to the person who has undertaken the majority of the fieldwork in that area. Thirdly, this requirement also ensures that the tax treatment of income derived in an income year applies to the circumstances in that year. Lastly, to remove this requirement would amount to a change in policy during the phasing-out period. This is inappropriate and it is inconsistent.",48
168,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,NOES,"To pick up the parliamentary secretary's last point: it does not amount to a change of policy in the phase-out period. The government has been trying to get a phase-out period going since October 1996 and it has failed at every step in the process. This amendment gives the government an opportunity, if it does go down the road of a five year regime, of at least removing the very worse excesses of it. How can you say, 'We sense are not going to pick this up because this is a change of policy during the course of a phase-out period'? What have we seen in the course of your phase-out period? In the first announcement you knocked off the tax exemption 'from 20 August 1996'; in the second announcement you knocked off the tax exemption if you did not derive the income before 31 December 1996; in the third announcement there was a five-year grandfather clause with various conditions which you mucked up in the Senate; and in the fourth announcement now we are right in the middle of determining the phase-out process conditions. Do the decent thing: remove this most obnoxious of all the unfair requirements that you are imposing and at least allow some orderly transition which is, to pick up again the marker laid down by government members in the Senate, not retrospectively unfair in its practical effect. Amendment negatived.",48
169,Mr MILES,NOES,"Bradd on-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (5.07 p.m.)-by leave-I move government amendment No.6: (6) Schedule 2, page 27 (after line 32), at the end of the Schedule, add: Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 2 Subsection 330-60(1) - mi.t ""If 1'ou are a - genuine prospector, your ordmary Income (for the 1997-98 income year or a later income year)"", substitute ""Your - ordinary income"". 3 Subsection 330-60(1) After ""income tax"", insert if: (d) you acquired those rights before 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 20 August 1996; and (e) you 'derive the 'ordinary income before 20 August 2001; and (f) you were a 'genuine prospector on or before 20 August 1996, and you are one when you derive the ordinary income. 4 After subsection 330-60(1) Insert: (lA) If you 'derived the 'ordinary income under a contract for the sale, transfer or assignment of the rights 7.30 pm, by legal time in the Australian Capital Territory, on 20 August 1996, the exemption applies only to: (a) so much of the ordinary income as you would have derived if those rights had been sold for their market value at that time; reduced by: (b) any amounts you incurred before that time that you have deducted or can deduct for an earlier income year under Division 10 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in respect of expenditure on exploration or prospecting (within the meaning of section 122J or 122JF of that Act) in that area. 5 Subsection 330-60(2) Omit ""The exemption"", substitute ""If subsection (lA) does not apply, the exemption"". 6 Paragraph 330-60(2)(b) Omit ""section 122J"", substitute ""Division 10 of Part III"". 7 Paragraph 330-60(2)(b) Omit ""that section"", substitute ""section 122J or I 22JF of that Act"". Amendment No. 6 proposed by the government includes additional amendments to schedule 2 of the bill, which deals with determining the extent to which income derived from the sale of mining rights is exempt from taxation. The amendments are necessary to ensure that a consistent outcome is achieved from applying the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, as amended by schedule 2 of the bill, for years of income up to and including 1996-97 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 for 1997-98 and later income years.",48
170,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,NOES,"I made the point earlier that I only had the opportunity of seeing these amendments some time yesterday. I indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) that I think they are okay, but I will just leave a bit of space for further concentrated attention to the detail for another place just in case we need to. I understand the intent of the amendments and, on the basis of the regime that the House ha: adopted, I do not believe there is any difficulty with them. If there are, I am sure that Minister Parer will be pursued accordingly in entered into after the Senate. Amendment agreed to. Schedule, as amended, agreed to. Schedules 3 to 10-by leave-taken together.",49
171,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"Curtin) (5.09 p.m.)Because there are 15 schedules to the main bill, it was not possible to canvass all the schedules in my speech during the second reading debate. As I mentioned last night, there are a couple of points that I want to raise in connection with both schedules 9 and 10 which I have not had the opportunity to air yet. First, I wish to comment on schedule 9. It involves an amendment that would see employers bound to continue making superannuation contributions on behalf of their employee if a bona fide link with the paid work force is maintained by that individual until age 70. It proposes that a worker must be gainfully employed for a minimum of 10 hours per week over the year if they are to continue with their superannuation contributions. It is a proposition that I wholeheartedly support. Participants in the 1996 tax summit were told that, if current trends in birth rates and extended life expectancy continue, 'most Australians can expect to spend up to one-third of their lives in some form of retirement from full-time work'. That would represent a huge drain on future public revenue which is arguably unsustainable. The legislation in schedule 9 also provides some incentive for individuals to postpone their retirement. It gives those Australians who want to remain productive in the paid work force for longer the opportunity to save more for their retirement, but the effect of the legislation will be undermined by the fact that many Australians can draw on their superannuation fund at the age of 55. The Australian Institute of Family Studies reported in March 1997 that the participation of older men in the paid work force is undergoing a long-term decline. The decline is apparently most marked amongst men in their late fifties and early sixties. For example, there has been a drop of men aged 55 to 59 in the work force of almost 10 per cent since 1978. If that trend continues, only 66 per cent of men in this age bracket will participate in the paid work force by the year 2011. Obviously this decline was under way long before the former government announced its campaign to lift national savings through compulsory superannuation. However, the trend will continue if the current government fails to act to stop people from accessing their super funds as early as age 55. The impact of raising the age threshold on superannuation contributions on the federal government's unfunded liability should not be underestimated either. As at March 1996, the public sector held between $80 billion to $100 billion in unfunded liabilities, most of which is a liability on the Commonwealth. On top of that, they have got contingency liabilities on former government trading enterprises and the like that have been privatised. By increasing the age threshold on compulsory employer superannuation contributions, the government will have to fund an even greater debt in the future. The financial impact statement estimates that the cost to revenue of this measure will amount to around $16 million over the years from 1998 to 2000. That is not an insignificant sum in terms of a cost to the revenue, but it is a cost worth bearing if it is offset a greater increase in superannuation contributions. (Extension of time granted) The other amendment relating to superannuation in the bill comes in schedule 10. It will allow for a rebate of up to $540 per annum to be paid to any person who contributes to superannuation on behalf of a nonworking or low income earning spouse. The government is meeting one of its 1996-97 budget undertakings. Under present superannuation laws, a fund cannot accept contributions from non-working individuals and the laws favour full-time and part-time employees. This amendment should, therefore, be of particular benefit to many women and casually employed Australians who cannot at present take full advantage of contemporary superannuation arrangements. Given that household savings have actually declined over the past 10 years since the introduction of award superannuation in 1986, the government is to be commended on this attempt to make superannuation more attractive to more people in the community. The rebate of $540 is quite generous and it should provide further incentive to maintain regular superannuation contributions. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the working spouse can opt to contribute to a retirement savings account, RSA, on behalf of his or her spouse once the RSAs are operational-and I guess that depends on our friends in the Senate. This element of the government's approach also represents good policy. What is not stipulated is whether a working spouse will be able to make contributions on behalf of their non-working or low income earning partner to their own company or industry fund. Under current legislation, it is prohibited. It is widely accepted that employee and company superannuation funds are amongst the more efficient funds operating in the industry. Unless the government legislates to extend employee based funds to include contributions made on behalf of spouses, the non-working spouse will have to establish a private fund. The cost involved with that by alternative will render the whole proposal much less attractive and could undermine the effect of this amendment. The government needs to make clear its position on this point, and I would welcome that. If the parliamentary secretary can enlighten me on that last point, I will be very grateful. In the meantime, I will seek the call to speak on schedule 11 later.",49

Amendments 7 and 8 are minor corrective measures which ensure that amendments to the income tax research and development provisions made by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.3) 1996-and announced on 23 July 1996-apply as intended. Amendment 9 will provide that the amendments contained in part 1 of schedule 14 of the bill will only apply to the 1996-97 year of income. Amendment 10 will insert definitions for the purposes of the special tracing rules. Amendment 11 will provide that the special tracing rules can be used to determine whether the new current year capital loss provisions in the bill will apply to a listed public company. Amendments 12 and 13 will align the terminology used in the current year capital loss provisions of the bill with that used in the new 1997 Taxation Act. Amendment 14 introduces the new special tracing rules for listed public companies. These new tracing rules will result in a reduction in compliance costs for listed public companies as they streamline the requirements for determining continuity of majority underlying ownership. Amendment 15 will ensure that an explanatory note in the provisions correctly reflects the operation of the provisions. Amendment 16 will omit a definition in the bill which is already found in the new 1997 Taxation Act. Amendment 17 will ensure that provisions dealing with subvention payments operate as intended. Amendment 18 will ensure that the commissioner's power to amend an assess(after ment will apply in a similar manner for current year revenue and capital losses. Amendment 19 will make several consequential amendments to ensure the provisions of the bill have their intended effect. The amendment will also extend the changes to the revenue loss provisions in the bill to the corresponding provisions in the new 1997 Taxation Act. Amendment 21 will make a minor amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1997 to ensure the capital loss transfer provisions apply as intended.",51
174,Mr ROCHER,NOES,"I wish to speak to government amendments Nos 7 and 8. As the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) has indicated, these amendments concern changes announced to research and development by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in his 1996-97 budget. I have already spoken in some depth about my misgivings of the way in which the government has handled--or should I say mishandled-the whole issue of research and development in previous debates, so my comments will be brief. Section 11 sets out to extend the core technology deduction rules to include companies in a partnership structure. In so doing, it levels the playing field in Australia between companies in partnership and those with alternative business structures. But it should not be forgotten that Australian companies involved in research and development are now trying to compete on very uneven conditions, thanks to decisions taken by this government in its last budget and to sloppy handling of legislation by the government. I remind the House of the terrific gamble the coalition took last year when it axed the R&D syndication program and reduced the general R&D concession to 125 per cent. It was a punt taken on the premise of rorting and abuse of the concession, although the government was never able to produce anything which substantiated those claims. The success or failure of the gamble will not be known for years to come. On the whole, I would like to say that careful consideration should be given to these amendments, and I think it will be in the Senate as well as here. The fact that four of the 15 schedules have been referred to Senate committees for review suggests that adequate thought did not go into the drafting of the legislation or, at best, it is suspect. In particular, the government, which continues to champion the cause of small business while doing little of substance to alleviate the compliance burden, must seriously consider reviewing schedule 1 in this legislation. I register my qualified support for the bill.",63

I spoke in the second reading debate on this bill and indicated the opposition's continuing major concerns about what this government has done to the research and development effort of this country. The cuts to the 150 per cent and the ending of syndication have seen a massive falling away in expenditure on research and development in this country. It is very interesting that the amendments we are now dealing with are government amendments. So what they are doing is amending what they sought to get through before. There are a number of examples where we want to draw attention to this. The minister refers to them as minor corrections. For example, the feedstock provisions, which are items lA, lB, 1C and 1H of amendment 7, recognise that sometimes feedstock can be transformed into a valuable product at the end of an R&D process rather than being consumed in that process. Accordingly, the research and development provisions grant only the concessional 125 per cent deduction for the amount of feedstock consumed or used up in the R&D process with normal provisions applying, that is, the 100 per cent deductibility to feedstock that is transformed into a valuable product. This seems to us to be on the face of it a reasonable system, because you get the benefit of a traded good at the end of the transformed process which can become a deduction as an input into the process of production. But the government, in dealing with this problem, botched the implementation of the legislation, because it rushed it through last year, by not adequately covering situations where there is more than one R&D activity being conducted. The amendments seek to fix this up with the explanation in the replacement supplementary explanatory memorandum admitting that the formula 'can have the unintended effect of providing deductions (concessional or otherwise) for non-existent costs' . Here we have a government, therefore, which made bogus claims about rorts as an excuse to limit R&D introducing a rort of their own which they are now having to correct. I agree entirely with the member who just preceded me, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), that we still have not had an explanation in this House of an actual example of a rort that justified the end to research and development syndication. We have the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) being fed pieces of paper to get up and meet these points, but as late as yesterday he was saying, quite contrary to what I have been saying, 'the government is keen to see research and development continue, but I do have to point out that there were many rorts involved, particularly in the syndication area'. Well, tell us where they are, Parliamentary Secretary. This is a bill that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and I attacked you on last year and attacked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) onhad him sitting in this chamber at that chair signing Christmas cards because he was so embarrassed-and we were saying, 'Just give us an example. One example of a rort will do and we might consider it.' He could not produce one. Mr Latham-Silence of the dogs.",64
176,Mr CREAN,NOES,"Exactly. Silence of the dogs. And that press release that was put out that had the so-called four actual examples? Not one of them was actual; they were all concocted-the Wright family into syndication. Your excuse for ending it was that you said you had a rort. Not only have you not produced one example of a rort; you now have an amendment to correct one that you created because of your sloppy workmanship on the previous occasion. It appears as though the replacement supplementary explanatory memorandum is in error as it talks about the formula used and examples in Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997. The issue of feedstock is not dealt with in this bill except in those amendments. I also make reference to core technology, items IE, IF and IG of amendment 7. Items IE and IF correct a huge mistake in the core technology provisions. The bill itself",64
177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Mr Crean-I would just like the opportunity,65
178,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"You can keep going when I have called the member for Hotham, which I now do. Mr Crean-I thought you were going to call the parliamentary secretary.",65
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,"I do not wish to delay the honourable member for Hotham. The parliamentary secretary is sitting in a somewhat, you might say, 'ready to rise position', and I was anticipating that seeking the call as the next government speaker. He then shook his head and I now call the member for Hotham.",65
180,Mr CREAN,NOES,"I want him to give me an example of the rorts, Mr Deputy Speaker. If he is rising to do that, invite him to do so. I would welcome that. I would be prepared to cede the point to him, but let him tell us where the rorts exist. Anyway, I go back to the issue of core technology, because this was a huge mistake . in the sloppy draftsmanship and the hurried way in which they brought the issue before the parliament last year. The bill itself is already correcting the anomaly between partnerships and separate companies concerning core technology. We do not believe that syndication should have been ended. We do not believe that the baby should have been thrown out with the bathwater. We were in favour of tightening up properly. the provisions but not ending the scheme, but nevertheless the government has chosen to end it and in the process created this anomaly between partnerships and separate companies, with partnerships still able to claim for core technology-the whole 100 per cent in terms of core technology, as I understand it. We now have this amendment which reveals an incredible additional error in the law and means that currently a deduction is denied for any core technology in the year that it is incurred. The way in which it was drafted means that deductions are allowed only in future years, not in the current year. Clearly this is a huge mistake-symptomatic of the bad processes which were undertaken last year. The further amendment in item 1G replaces an incorrect paragraph reference with the correct one. Of course, we do not oppose this, but we do note that it is a further error. The third area I want to address my remarks to relates to pilot plant, items ID and 11 of amendment 7. Item ID is fixing yet another serious error in the R&D provisions concerning depreciation allowable for pilot plant. There is a circular inconsistency in the existing provisions which is described in the he was government's replacement supplementary explanatory memorandum as a nonsense. That is on page 26. A further mistake is being corrected by the enactment of item 11, which provides a balancing adjustment for post-23 July 1996 I pilot plant disposed of prior to the completion of the relevant R&D activity. This is further evidence of the mess that the 1996 changes have created. Again, we do not have any option but to support the amendment, as it is fixing up a serious error which should never have been allowed to have been legislated last year. If I can just say this in conclusion: I reiterate this point. The Labor Party said, 'Tighten up the scheme, fix what you claim to be the rorts' - we still have not seen any evidence of it-'but don't end the scheme.' What we seem to have achieved is a government that cannot fix it and cannot even end the scheme So it is symptomatic of the inability of this government to come to grips with sound policy prescription. Then when they proceed down this blind course of cutting for the sake of it, addressing the budget bottom line but not the impact on Australia's research and development effort, they muck it up. This is a government that does not deserve to be returned at the next election, and I think this process is but one of the examples as to why people will see the need for a change. I hope that not too much damage is done in the process, but already the indications are of a massive walking away from research and development in this country, when every other nation in the world is increasing their effort and providing incentives to do so. Our future does depend on innovation and skills, yet the two areas that have been hacked at massively are incentives to research and development and incentives to skill formation. This is a government that has no sense of where it is going and, in the process, the nation is going to suffer greatly.",65
181,Mr MCMULLAN,NOES,"Canberra) (5.33 p.m.)I simply wanted to put on the record that there were certain clauses within this section to which my colleague the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) expressed his reservations in his earlier contribution. They are not matters which I will be speaking about, but I do want to make sure that it is recognised that in his earlier contribution he expressed his concern about matters in these sections. That should be drawn to the attention of the House. Amendments agreed to.",66

(3) Clause 2, page 2 (after line 26), at the end of the clause, add: (12) Item 8 of Schedule 15 is taken to have commenced immediately after the commencement of item 9 of Schedule 1 to the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No.2) 1997. (13) Item 9 of Schedule 15 is taken to have commenced immediately after the commencement of item 1 of Schedule 3 to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Act 1997. Amendment 1 will provide that the amendments contained in parts 4 and 5 of schedule 14 of the bill, referred to as amendment 18, will apply from 1 July 1997. Amendment 2 sets out the commencement dates for amendment 20, which provides for income tax deductions to be allowable for gifts to the Australian National Korean War Memorial Trust Fund, AAP Mawson's Huts Foundation Ltd and the Australia Foundation for Culture and the Humanities Ltd. There are a couple of technical amendments which relate to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Act 1997. Schedule 3 of the act currently contains a drafting error; it does not specify the title of the act to be amended and, therefore, the schedule is technically deficient. Amendment 21 rectified this. Amendment 3 provides that the amendment is taken to have commenced immediately after the commencesub- ment of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Private Health Insurance Incentives) Act 1997.

NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 May, on motion That the bill be now read a second time.",67
184,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) is of the opinion that a properly resourced university sector is vital to Australia's economic and social well-being; (2) expresses deep concern at the damage caused by the Government's funding reductions to higher education, which are forcing universities to seek alternative sources of funds, such as undergraduate fees, which in turn are reducing access to universities at the very time when Australia needs to be broadening such access; (3) expresses particular concern at the ending of the successful Commonwealth Industry Places Scheme; and (4) condemns the Government for failing to recognise the importance of education to Australia's future and for continuing to draw public investment in it"". This higher education legislation is very much an admission of failure, almost another apology from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. It is her attempt to place a bandaid on the gaping wound that she has opened up in Australia's higher education sector. But, in every respect, the bandaid is much too small and the wound much too large to have any lasting impact. This bill must be seen in the light of the budget decisions from both last year and this. Last year's budget produced a funding cut for operating grants to the tune of $624 million, a cut in discretionary funding of $215 million and a further $l.l3 billion in savings from changes to HECS. Last year's budget dealt a savage blow to higher education. It was a disturbing comment on the government's priorities that it decided to quarantine funding for defence and yet hold out cuts to education, higher education in particular, as the largest amount of fiscal consolidation on the Howard government agenda. To find in 1997 these minor concessions to that scale of cuts is, indeed, disappointing. I would have thought the government, acting out a sound policy, would have reversed the swingeing cuts to higher education and tried to grow the sector, as indeed most of our economic competitors are trying to do. The fact that the government is announcing and trying to implement a so-called restructuring and rationalisation plan to the tune of $26 million is an admission of defeat. What sort of government is it that causes so much crisis and disturbance in higher education in Australia and then, having caused the problem, tries to rectify it with a small amount of $26 million in so-called restructuring and rationalisation? The truth is that the rationalisation funding, which I believe was intended for a fouror five-year period, is probably going to be eaten up in the first year in trying to compensate those universities that have been severely disadvantaged by the abolition of the Commonwealth industry places scheme. Minister Vanstone, having been a poacher with- in higher education for so long and so comprehensively, is now trying to tum towards being gamekeeper, trying to argue that this $26 million of crisis management funding will have a lasting impact. My recommendation to the government is to use it as early as possible in compensating universities like Charles Sturt and Deakin University based in Geelong in Victoria for the severe impact of the abolition of the successful Commonwealth industry places scheme. The other decision reflected in this legislation-the introduction of a discount of 25 per cent for up-front HECS payments of $500 or more commencing in 1998-is also a minor concession only, a minor concession indeed. The whole range of students, a whole generation of young Australians, who have been turned away in their aspirations for higher education by the massive changes in HECS will not be the ones who will benefit from this minor discount of 25 per cent for up-front payments of HECS. Indeed, to have the discount on the up-front payment, it is not likely the most disadvantaged students will have that money available. Again this concession, minor in its nature, is also poorly targeted. It is the students from the lowest socio-economic bands that require assistance, given the nature of the HECS changes. There is no doubt that the government needs to reverse its priorities. I placed a question on the Notice Paper to the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan), in acknowledgment of the quarantining of defence expenditure, to ask about the expenditure by the Howard government on Department of Defence golf courses. The answer came back that there are 20 such golf courses around Australia at a public cost of $3.4 million. Mr Lee-That sounds essential.",68
185,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"As my colleague the member for Dobell points out facetiously, how can they be regarded as an essential defence purpose in Australia? How can they be regarded as worthy of quarantining of expenditure at a time when $840 million is being wiped out of higher education? Mr Lee-How much?",69
186,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"There is $840 million being wiped out in funding for higher education. For the governments that sit in South East Asia, in Europe and in North America and look at Australia and our future prospects, they must be curious indeed to understand what sort of government would quarantine expenditure on 20 Department of Defence golf courses whilst, at the same time, making higher education its No. 1 target for budget cuts. What sort of government would run down opportunities for some 21,000 students who are now unable to get into our university sector while enabling its defence forces to play golf on their 20 golf courses at a public cost of close to $3Y2 million? That is an absurd set of priorities-an absurd and damning set of priorities for the Howard government. Mr Lee-Why can't they lease the golf courses, just as everyone else does?",70
187,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Of course. They should be leasing out the golf courses, and they should be growing the higher education sector. They are the priorities you would find from a Labor government. Growing higher education access is the best opportunity for Australia to have decent economic and social prospects into the future. We all talk about competition in the world economy. We all talk about the new instruments of national sovereignty in the economic and social debate. There is only one lasting answer: it is in educational opportunity; it is in growing higher education access. But the Howard government has a different set of priorities. It is the quarantining of expenditure on golf courses for the Department of Defence, and its No. 1 targeting of expenditure is in the education area. These are perverse priorities which, undoubtedly, will lead to perverse national outcomes in the years ahead. The other aspect that needs to be raised in this debate is that there will be a further one per cent cut to operating grants applying in the year 2000, a further funding reduction of $47.3 million. The minister all up, out of the $840 million, and now the further one per cent cut in the year 2000, has tried to claim that the savings are small. She lectured the vice-chancellors that they could not expect to be immune from expenditure cuts. But this is the double speak of Senator Vanstone in Orwellian mode. One moment she is saying that these are not cuts; they are just nicks. The next moment she is saying that they are small, but when pressured about her failure as minister and why she is so unpopular she runs out the line that she alone was responsible for the most extravagant amount of funding cuts and fiscal consolidation in the first Costello budget. She cannot have it both ways: she cannot blame the Treasurer e Mr Costello) for the huge cuts in her portfolio for her own unpopularity and then try to tum around and say that universities are thriving and the funding cuts have only been small. I think the latest version of this Orwellian double speak is to say that the funding has not actually been cut; it has been capped. This is the double speak of saying that cuts equal growth, that reduction is good, that contraction of the university sector is just fine, that the universities are thriving-total double speak in the rhetoric and public performance of Senator Vanstone. Senator Vanstone is now describing the cuts as the 'removal of promised growth in the forward estimates' and calling Labor's forward estimates 'not a credible base against which education expenditure can be measured'. Again she is conceding there are cuts. There are cuts that have a huge and lasting impact on the higher education sector. Her whole credibility on these things is shot to pieces. The cuts do impact severely on universities, and I can provide a survey of that to the House-and it only is a survey of some 10 institutions. I am pleased to provide this information to the House. It really represents the on-the-ground impact of these funding cuts and what they are doing to each of the 36 higher education institutions around Australia. At the University of Ballarat, for instance, there are 53 redundancies in place; the engineering course has been revised as a new integrated course with a more restricted number of specialisations; the librarianship course is completely removed for all new students; there are reductions in the number of graduate diploma in computing and information technology courses; music courses and performing arts are being curtailed; chemistry offerings are being reduced; the library opening hours are being cut by 11 Y2 hours per week. This is the on-the-ground impact at the University of Ballarat of the huge, swingeing funding cuts introduced by Senator Vanstone. I turn to the University of New South Wales. There is the complete closure of the St George campus. What sort of country wanting to be competitive in the global economy, wanting to grow opportunities for young Australians, actually gets in the business of closing down a complete campus, as it has done with the St George campus of the University of New South Wales? Also, at that institution a further 110 staff, including approximately 50 academic staff, are to lose their johs. Most jobs will be lost as the courses are phased out over the next two years. The Victoria University of Technology has put in place a voluntary departure scheme, with 60 staff targeted and a further 60 maintenance staff expected to lose their jobs as services are contracted out. The number of tutorials at the Victoria University of Technology has he en reduced either by enlarging class sizes or replacing tutorials with lectures. ingly. At the University of Adelaide, in the minister's home state, a total of 91 redundancies have been put in place. Drama courses have been abolished-indeed, phased out over the next two vears. The education course has lost eight of its 15 academics, with a consequential reduction in student enrolments. Other departments such as history, animal science and crop protection will no longer be offering course options due to the redundancy of their staff. Again, here is clear evidence of the on-the-ground impact of the reduction of educational opportunities around the country because of the minister's cuts. These institution'·' are not thriving. These institutions are sutrering. As they suffer, Australian students suffer. As students suffer, the whole nation is much diminished in its future prospects. I turn to the University of La Trobe, which I will he pleased to visit just this Friday, where 144 redundancies are being put in place. French courses are being phased out; the Italian department is to be halved; there are reduced subject offerings in courses such as history. At the Bendigo campus of La Trobe university, 78 out of approximately 400 staff are losing their jobs. As staff go, courses go. Science and engineering courses are now under threat. The University of Tasmania, which is so important to the island state, is such a prospect. It really should be built up as the best way of holding talented young Tasmanians in their home state. Yet 160 jobs have been lost at the University of Tasmania-SO to date by the redundancy program-Italian courses have been axed and there have been decreases in a range of subjects such as physical science and Asian studies. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology is estimated to be forcing the loss of 110 tenured academic and general staff, as well as 40 contract staff who will not have their contracts renewed. At the University of the Northern Territory approximately 70 academic general and T AFE staff have left on voluntary departure packages. Further staff cuts, a total of 75, have been experienced at Flinders university, with courses being affected accordThen there is the University of Sydney-not only my alma mater but also that of the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). Indeed, I first got to know of the member for Warringah on the toilet walls of the University of Sydney where a number of reflections had been made on his parentage-things, of course, that I could barely repeat here in the House of Representatives. But it is always interesting to catch up with the member for Warringah, knowing of those days and how he is now aiding Minister Vanstone in running down these educational opportunities. Mr Abbott-Obviously nothing's changed.",70
188,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"That is true. If the graffiti had to be identified and revised for 1997 conditions, it probably would not change that much. Mr Lee-A footnote on the graffiti on a wall somewhere.",72
189,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"That is right. It was said of Clyde Cameron that he might just be a footnote in history. I think the parliamentary secretary deserves a better place than associatbase ing himself with the closure of technological and applied studies undergraduate teaching training courses in the Faculty of Education at the University of Sydney. That is not a good legacy for a former president of the student representatives council at that institustudent tion. He knows full well from his alma matur the swingeing impact of these cuts. Courses are being lost. Even for a university that foolishly has made access for the up-front undergraduate fees, courses are being lost. The capacity of the university overall has been run down. Finally, I make mention of the Australian National University where some 150 staff redundancies have been put in place with a consequent series of threats to their courses and student options. There is no doubt that the minister is in a state of denial and a state of delusion. I have given to the House the impact of her cuts on some 10 institutions, but it is repeated in the other 26 essentially right around Australia. The courses lost, the staff positions abolished, the students denied their educational opportunities show comprehensively that Vanstone has entered a state of delusion, a state of denial where she can rationalise these things only with Orwellian double speak. To say that universities are thriving is an out and out untruth. It is not matched by the courses and opportunities that are being abolished across the country. Another important point to make and one which is of great concern to many universities is the stability of funding and the basis on which they might conduct their future planning. Labor recognised this and legislated funding for universities on a rolling triennium basis. All the details were spelt out in the annual higher education funding reports. Before the election the coalition committed itself to continuing the rolling triennium arrangements, but this promise unhappily has gone the way of those on operating grants and those on HECS-that is, it has been junked. In Labor's last budget in 1995, we legislated funding for universities to cover the following three years. In the two budgets since the election, however, there has been no move by the coalition government to provide funding beyond 1998. Large fixed capital universities are facilities that require some forward planning. There is a great deal of uncertainty in higher education not only for the funding cuts, for the abolition of courses and opportunities or for the severe impact on income arrangements but also for the lack of forward planning in the forward estimates. The university administrators are trying to plan well ahead as they cope with the cuts, but this is made more difficult by the absence of an allocation of funding amounts beyond 1998. As a result of funding cuts-the funding cuts which the minister now seems to deny-there have been in total some 2,000 job losses and the closure of an entire campus, as I mentioned earlier. I am sure my colleague the member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) will be addressing the concerns of the closure of St George campus in even greater detail. Tutorials have begun to disappear, replaced by so-called optional study sessions for which universities can and do charge. This is the creeping user-pays approach that the government is propagating throughout the sector. The chair of the government's own review, Roderick West-almost an experience on the road to Damascus in recent times as he has toured each of the institutions-has acknowledged that the funding cuts have hurt universities. He is a latter-day convert to the virtues of government funding. Mr Abbott-He has recanted.",72
190,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"You have thrown him off the road to Damascus and put him back in the temple of Amanda. That is a sad thing to hear. There is no doubt in his public comments that the learned West, picking up the full benefits of learning in practice, having visited all the institutions, told the Australian newspaper that the funding cuts were hurting universities, that the level of public funding needed to be restored if we were to restore the health, confidence and success of Australia's university sector. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee-the board of which I was delighted to dine with last night without my tape recorder-in their submission to the West review called for an increase in government funding for higher education of over 20 per cent. The higher education round table warned in its submission to the West review: Without a national vision and sufficient investment in our higher education system, Australia and today's young Australians are likely to be marginalised as the region moves towards higher living standards and more advanced social and political structures. The round table members went on to say: Institutions are struggling to find investment for new technologies and teaching materials, to restructure their physical and staff resources to meet new demands. A sufficient increase in institutional funding to assist in this restructuring and reinvigorating process is needed and justified. Government funding will have to provide the major source. Whether it is Roderick West or the Business Council of Australia or the higher education round table or the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee-and I suspect in his quieter moments even Dr Kemp-everyone recognises that Senator Vanstone has thoroughly mismanaged higher education around Australia. In the current environment, universities are struggling to meet the new challenges of internationalisation. I think there is a certain complacency in the Howard government about the future prospects of Australian universities. We have grown used to the idea of universities being a strong and growing source of export income for Australia. There is now a certain complacency in government policy making whereby, with the internationalisation of universities, we could face serious import threats. At a time when Australia is running down R&D, running down our standards and status for academics, running down our prospects to develop learning products in the new interactive technology, we place ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. We place ourselves at a competitive disadvantage that could tum the historic opportunity for Australia in export income in higher education into real import threats. I urge the government at the very least to tum around the funding cuts in research and development, to tum around the prospects of Australian universities building up their expertise in the development of learning products. The international market for universities is very much emerging and will continue to do so for the next 10 or 20 years. I am sure that the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) appreciates these things better than most members. He understands the university sector in the United States. He would know that, unless Australia builds up its research capacity and its capacity to capital develop learning products, we will be wiped out of that internationalised market for higher education learning. This will be one of the sad and most unfortunate legacies of Senator Vanstone. In the context of those problems and the swingeing funding cuts and the loss of courses, tutorials and opportunities around the country, this bill brings very little comfort. The government announced in the budget just past that it will provide $26 million over four years to help universities restructure and rationalise. This is code for hoping that universities might be able to cope with the massive funding cuts. Why is the amount not reflected in the additional expenditure provided for in this bill? Because even the rationalisation money is offset by yet another expenditure cut-the ending of the Commonwealth industry places scheme, a hif""h 1y successful program to encourage itio!:istry investment and involvement in higher cdu(:,(tion. By 1999, CIPS would have been supponing some 4,700 full-time university places Aw;tralia-wide with a concentration of the-e numbers at Charles Sturt University ill western New South Wales and Deakin and Swinburne universities in Vidoria. This was supposed to be a budget l<1r l'l'.- regions-a budget that had no cuts in c'JijCat!Cn. But the abolition of some 4,700 places is an enormous cut. When it is concentrated in just three universities around the country it is a cut that is hard to handle. The bad news for universities like Charles Sturt is that the cuts effectively mean that some 200 jobs are now likely to be lost as a product of the ending of CIPS. The regional and newer universities have also been hit hard by the government's decision to allow full up-front fees for Australian undergraduates. So while Deakin, Swinburne and Charles Sturt are taking the huge cuts and the abolition of CIPS they have very little capacity indeed to levy the up-front fees. Yet it is the up-front fees that the government is using as the rationale for the abolition of CIPS. This is indeed a false economy. The universities that are losing places because of the abolition of industry schemes are not the universities that can compensate through the levying of the upfront undergraduate fees. It is the sandstone universities who can trade on their prestige. They have some capacity to use the fees option as a way of making up for the funding cuts. I again point out to the House that they are not the universities that have been accessing the Commonwealth industry places scheme. To quote Professor Gavin Brown, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney, speaking on Sydney radio earlier this year: It's the only mechanism left to fill the huge gap which has been bequeathed to us by Amanda Vanstone. Even vice-chancellors supporting fees recognise that it is only happening in universities because, for all intents and purposes, they have had a funding gun held to their heads. For other universities, the outlook is even more unsatisfactory. A bleak future for universities equates to poor prospects for Australian students, especially those whose parents do not have a spare $100,000 to spend on a full fee university education. The Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University, Professor Michael Osborne, has voiced a clear warning about the direction of Australian universities under the Howard government. He has predicted that the ability to pay will carry greater weight than academic merit for university enrolments resulting in a fall in the quality of education. In a recent issue of the La Trobe Bulletin Professor Osborne said: It will be interesting to observe how long the resolve to preserve standards will be sustained if the students willing to pay are for the most part well below ... standard. The vice-chancellor also said: One student may fail to secure enrolment to his or her preferred course by virtue of a single mark and through want of means have to miss out while another more affluent student, whose marks are considerably lower, can still purchase entry to the same course. At a time when economic globalisation and restructuring are polarising labour market earnings and opportunities, governments need to do more to ensure that education acts as a genuine tool of social justice and access in Australia. But this is a government creating two tiers of university access: one for the wealthy who, even if they underperform at school, can still get a place at university by paying their up-front fees and a different tier of access for those who are left out because of the way in which tertiary education is being wound back by this backward looking government. The University of Western Sydney recently reported that 15 per cent of its students have now been discouraged from pursuing a university education. By creating two tiers of university access, the Howard government is funding adding to the inequality and fragmented opportunities in our society. In May, the Anglican Social Responsibilities Committee of Melbourne-maybe they do not have a lot of weight with the member for Warringah but I believe other members might heed their call-has described the introduction of the upfront fees as 'a deliberate shift away from a commitment to an egalitarian society'. In its submission to the West review the church committee also saidMr Abbott interjecting",72
191,Mr LATHAM,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I am ret1ecting on past training and inclinations, of course. The church committee said: ... almost certain that a free market in education will in time weaken faculties and/or departments and/or universities which are already relatively impoverished. If the parliamentary secretary is supporting the Anglican Social Responsibilities Committee in their assessment of the reforms, I welcome that. At a time when the minister is fond of describing a university education as a privilege, she needs to understand that so many Australian students are not able to access that particular privilege. Increasingly, students see a university education as an emerging necessity for employability in the new economy. These economic realities point to the need for mass vocational education in Australia rather than the Vanstone view of an elite fee paying access. The minister has also compared universities to a used car sale yard saying that some degrees are worth the price of a used Commodore. In truth, universities do not work very effectively as an open market. It is also worth recalling the words of Roderick West, who on 28 May this year said: There's no doubt about it, there's such a strong link between higher education participation and expenditure and economic and social well-being. So there are very compelling arguments for continuing substantial public support. Those views are reflected in the amendment that I have moved and advocate to the House. It is very important to have a properly resourced university sector. It is important for Australia's economic and social well-being. We express our concern about the impact of the government's cuts in higher education. We express our concern about the ending of the successful Commonwealth industry places scheme and note in the substance of this particular legislation that the $26 million allocation in crisis management would not be needed if the government had not caused so many cuts and so many sources of distress and unequal opportunity in higher education in the first place. On balance, the Labor Party does not oppose the discount of 25 per cent for up-front HECS payments of more than $500, but again we point out that this is a poorly targeted measure which will not assist those students who have now been discouraged from taking up their university education. There is nothing more damning for this government than the fact that it has quarantined Department of Defence expenditure while making education its No. 1 funding cut. There is nothing more damning on this government's record than the sorts of figures released by DEETY A; to see that there has been a 3.4 per cent decline in applications for universities Australia-wide-a fall in New South Wales and the ACT of 4V2 per cent, in Victoria close to five per cent and Tasmania 3Y2 per cent. In Senator Vanstone's home state of South Australia, the drop was 11 per cent overall. What sort of minister can live with herself and her policies knowing that one in 10 students in her own state have been turned away· from their aspiration for a university education? So much for the clever country. So much for a government that has a clear sense of Australia's national interest and where our best investment could be made in our national sovereignty. They deserve to be condemned. I hope the House supports my amendment accordingly.",74
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Lee-I second the amendment.,75
193,Mr CHARLES,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"La Trobe) (6.09 p.m.)The contribution of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) tonight was a bit light on. I expected a bit more fire and brimstone. I suspect the speech will read as an utter condemnation of the government, notwithstanding the fact that he really supports this bill. In general, I will comment on some of his remarks later in what I want to say. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 incorporates measures that will contribute to the government's aims of a higher education sector that is responsive to student needs and efficient in its operation. The purpose of the bill is fourfold: first, to provide funding of $9,658,000 for price movements affecting some areas of universities' activities, including such items as superannuation, grants to teaching, hospitals and special capital projects; secondly, to provide $26 million over the next four years to fund the rationalisation and restructuring program as announced in the budget; thirdly, to increase the number of students to be able to benefit from the 25 per cent discount for up-front payments of HECS by allowing for a discount for partial payment; and, fourthly, to make HECS debt more flexible for those students who withdraw from a course of study. So to those issues. First, the bill introduces measures to maintain the real value of Commonwealth grants to higher education institutions for superannuation expenses, open learning organisations, teaching hospitals, special capital projects and for certain other grants, including equality of opportunity, research, multimedia, innovation and quality assurance. The total increase as a result of this measure will be over $9 million in additional funding. The member for Werriwa talked about universities abolishing courses and talked about rationalisation. He said that the government was complacent in its approach to higher education. I find that somewhat contradictory. The member for Werriwa, as I listened to his comments, apparently wants us to maintain the same system we have had for many years-a system which was gradually changed year by year by Labor in power over 13 years. But the member for Werriwa wants to keep it as it is or perhaps he would like to go back to the Whitlam days. Perhaps he would like to go back to free tertiary education for everyone. Is that what the member for Werriwa, the shadow spokesman for these issues, wants: to go back to free public funded tertiary education for anyone in Australia who happens to meet a particular TER cut-off score? Is that what we want? I don't think so. When your mob was in power what did we get? We got HECS, didn't we? You said that the students need to make a contribution. We agree with that. We have changed the relativities that were left by Labor to ask for a greater individual contribution from students. As I have said many times, this business of education is one where there is benefit, I think, to three parties. The first, and I acknowledge this, is a benefit to the nation. A highly educated population and a highly educated work force is of benefit to the nation overall. We inject into society ideas and thoughts, the ability to learn, the ability to carry forward, to move forward, to change, to adapt to new situations. Certainly this House knows how rapidly the world around us is changing. We know we have to change to meet the challenges that face us. The brick walls are gone. Fortress Australia has been long since tom down. We cannot live behind those fortress walls. The modem world of telecommunications has brought the world so much closer together. Some of the emerging giants in wealth, in growth in education and in growth in industrial capacity, particularly the tigers through Asia, give demonstration to the fact that the world is on a chain. We have not reduced poverty yet, but we are making some inroads into it. I think it is very important that we continue that. We have to learn to live in a world that is changing. It is different than it was last year and the year before and the year before that. To pretend that because the public receives benefit from higher education we can take public money from those who will never have a chance to go into university, take their taxes, and use it to support those who are more privileged and who have a chance of going on to university by virtue of their efforts in secondary school, to say that the public must continue to entirely support this micronism of our economy, is an absolute nonsense, because the second beneficiary of tertiary education is the student. The one who obtains the degree also is a major beneficiary, perhaps the greatest beneficiary of all, out of the education system itself. The individual not only acquires an ability to learn and acquires knowledge but also acquires skills in some particular vocational area. We talk about TAFE being vocational training. University, to a very large extent, is vocational training too. Lawyers learn about the law; biologists learn about biology; engineers learn about engineering and science; and so it goes on. So there are skills imparted by universities. Individuals benefit from those and they also benefit from jobs which are more readily obtainable at entry level with that piece of paper. They also receive higher remuneration for that piece of paper, not only at entry level but generally throughout a person's career, whether they stay in the same field or move on to another field. So higher education is a great benefit to the individual. The third sector of society that benefits from education is industry, business, commerce and, indeed, the public sector as well. They obtain the knowledge, the benefits, the skills, the ability to learn and the understanding of the students who exit the university system, having successfully completed their courses. They use them at entry level and later to expand their businesses or to help us do a better, more effective job of running the public sector. In Australia, that mix between public sector, individual and industry-if I can use that terminology-has always been biased in favour of the public sector. So we took the English model and we said, 'We the public will pay for the students.' Labor in power decided that the students had to make a contribution. In this world where resources are scarce, where they are thin on the ground, where it is important for us as a nation to demonstrate to ourselves and to outsiders that we care about deficits, that we have to run a tight ship in the macro-economy, it is important that we recognise we must constrain spending. So it is entirely equitable that the students pick up a larger portion of the expense incurred in giving them that higher education. Australia has accepted it. We have not lost university students as a result of the government's measures. The university sector is expanding. The member for Werriwa amazes me. He said in his contribution that Courses have been abolished. Of course Courses have been abolished. When this issue was running around the traps last July and August, when it was really rampant and everybody thought the world would come to an end because change was going to come to the higher education sector, several vicechancellors told me, 'Thank goodness it is happening. We have got courses in our curriculum that have been here for so long, that are so outdated and so unnecessary they are propping up professors that are tenured. They insist that this course must stay in the curriculum, so we have to continue to run it. But it is of no cost benefit to the university. It is of questionable benefit to the students who are required to take the course.' This, along with the industrial relations reforms through the Workplace Relations Act, is giving universities the opportunity to make change, to restructure, to get rid of some of the dead wood. We are not even talking about driving for tomorrow. The member for Werriwa says that there is a bleak future for universities because all of a sudden they have to find a bit more of the money themselves. It is only a little bit. Students have to pay a bit more for their courses in differential amounts, depending on the benefit they are likely to receive from those courses. He sees a bleak future for universities. In the country that I grew up in, I paid for my university degree-and most people did. That is how you went to university. Industry paid one heck of a lot more contribution into the tertiary education sector than ever we have had it paying in Australia. I have thought about that some. I have thought about why that is. I think it is because we have said to industry, business, commerce and the public sector, 'The government is here to take care of you. The government will pay for education. Every child who is capable will have access to free tertiary education.' So why should industry bother? Industry says, 'You are going to give me trained and educated people that can perform for me the modern miracles I need to compete in this highly competitive world. Thank you very much. I do not have to contribute.' What a nonsense. Of course industry needs to contribute. They do need to contribute and increasingly we need to find mechanisms to encourage industry to make their proper contribution to tertiary education. It will happen. In the country that I grew up in, that has been a norm for 200 years. For 200 years business and industry have been contributing to tertiary education in a big way-in capital expenditure, recurrent expenditure and in scholarships for worthy students to attend university. So how on earth can we say that there is a bleak future for universities because they are starting to restructure a bit, starting to catch up with the 20th century and move into the 21st century? It is well past time that we did that. So this $9,658,000 will help those universities through part of their restructuring phase. The second issue that the bill deals with is to provide benefits to higher education institulike tions through giving the Commonwealth the power to provide funding for special grants for rationalisation and restructuring. This gives effect to the government's 1997 budget commitment to assist higher education institutions with restructuring and rationalisation activities where they lead to permanent benefits and where those activities would otherwise be beyond the capacity of the institution involved. That is, in essence, the government saying, 'We know that we are taking a bit of the funding away and we have restructured HECS, and you need to start thinking about a changed world and how we are going to operate in the future to be able to afford to continue to educate the maximum number of Australians. You have got to start thinking about the future and you cannot live in the past.' Industrial relations reform is a very ant part of that for universities. Instead of negotiating across the entire sector. departments, parts of departments or a university itself now have the t1exibility to strike agreegreat ments with staff, teachers and professors in order to get the best value for money and still give the people who work in those institutions high incomes so that the most qualified people will be attracted to those positions. Universities will have available $26 million over the next four financial years to use in such activities as the collaborative use of resources, improved efficiencies in program delivery and the development of joint institutional infrastructure. A concrete example of the coalition's commitment to a vibrant and diverse university sector is this commitment in the bill. The measure gives institutions the opportunity to generate their own productivity improvements and to restructure their activities to take advantage of the new competitive environment for higher education-and it is a competitive environment. It will be increasingly so. An example is the new Berwick campus of Monash University in my electorate, a university campus that I fought for in the early 1990s. It is a new university with a limited number of places and yet it had over 4,500 concrete, first-up applications for something 250 funded places. I understand that the university has made a decision to expand by using its own capital resources because the Commonwealth was not able to assist. The Commonwealth felt that it was more important to fund growth areas in Queensland and New South Wales. That is the Commonwealth's decision. I might not be quite as happy about that decision as I should he, but people understand that I have concern for my area. I know that there are many students who need an education. The memher for Werriwa implies that kids are dropping out all over the place, that the number of students is falling and that there is a reduced demand. That is an absolute nonsense. The Berwick campus of Monash University proves the point of an unbelievably high demand for a few funded places. The institution will go ahead and expand, and that importis an example of how the market ought to work. Their courses are excellent and they have provided an exciting challenge for students. Students are taking up the places in droves, despite the fact that it is not a sandstone institution-it does not have ivy on the walls. This measure will give the institution time to plan and adapt, and to pursue options opened up through the new tlexibility available to charge fees. This program recognises that some institutions may need more help than others to better position themselves to meet the challenges of increased competition. There is no doubt that that is true. Not only does quality vary across the sector but, at the same time, how the institutions behave in certain course structures and their external reputation-all of these matters-have a part to play. The third issue which this bill addresses is that students paying at least $500 in up-front HECS fees will be able to receive a 25 per cent discount. This extends the discount facility for partial payments for HECS. The measure is intended to encourage earlier repayments of HECS deht. I note that previously only those paying full HECS contributions up front were entitled to the discount. That discount facility has now been extended for all partial payments of at least $500. Students are the ones who will benefit because this measure really helps to return equity across all the faculties. For example, an arts student paying a total HECS contribution of $3,300 up front was eligible for the 25 per cent discount but a law student would have to pay $5,500 to be eligible for the discount. All students are now treated equally, with all payments of at least $500 attracting the 25 per cent discount. We are saying to students, 'If you have any money at all, if you have worked and saved a bit of money and you can afford to pay part of your fee up front, we will accept that partpayment and that will ultimately help to reduce the amount of your HECS debt.' I suspect that many students will take advantage of that facility. The final issue that the bill addresses is that Brough. M. T. it assists students by streamlining the arrangements for applications for remission of their debt under the HECS or open learning deferred payment scheme when they withdraw from a course. The current complex twotiered application period will go, to be replaced by a set period of 12 months-that is, students who withdraw from a course will have 12 months from the date of ceasing study in which to apply for remission of their HECS debt. I support this bill, but there is no way known that I could support the Clayton's amendment proposed by the member for Werriwa. The purpose of his amendment is to indicate some annoyance with the government but, in reality, he does and will support the bill.",75

195,Mr MCCLELLAND,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Barton) (8.12 p.m.)Interestingly, the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) made the comment before the suspension of the sitting for dinner that he had been educated in the United States as a full fee-paying student; in other words, he paid for his education. He held that out with some pride. He may well be entitled to have considerable personal pride in that achievement. No doubt he made some sacrifice on his own behalf. One would also assume that his parents supported him. He is entitled to have personal pride in the fact that he paid for his university education. Those involved in the education system of the United States cannot similarly have that pride because it is a system that requires the payment of education which discriminates against the less priviNOES leged-those who, because of their backgrounds, simply cannot raise sufficient funds to pay for their education. In many ways the contribution of the member for La Trobe was prophetic: in today's Sydney Morning Herald there was an article entitled 'US-style private uni funding predicted'. Reference was made to a recent publication of Professor Gordon Stanley in which he has made that prediction. To lose the equitable system that we have had. cerNA Melham, D. tainly since the Whitlam period of government, is something that should be of real concern to all Australians. It is fair to say that a number of people in this House would not be here, or certainly would not have their education, if it had not been for the fundamental shift in policy that occurred during the Whitlam period and which until now has really been regarded as a holy grail: if someone is talented enough, they will have the opportunity of studying at university. I have noticed, while sitting in question time in this chamber and from reading some Hansard of the other chamber, denials by ministers that there have been any funding cuts to tertiary institutions. Those denials are completely and entirely hollow. One simply has to look at the budget papers themselves, which state that the 1996-97 budget reduced funding to higher education institutions by one per cent in the 1997 calendar year, three per cent in 1998 and a further one per cent in each of 1999 and 2000. Against the black and white evidence of those budget papers, which were distributed to the public, there is no way that any minister can deny that this government has cut funding to higher education institutions. The attitude of the government is demonstrated most profoundly in the response I received from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to a question without notice I asked him on 5 June. I asked him: Why has the government forced cuts of 1,900 student places and $14.4 million from the University of New South Wales and forced the closure of the St George campus, the only university facility in southern Sydney ... He replied with words that indicate the thinking of this government, which is often repeated: I believe that those policies will provide greater opportunities for Australian students. Those policies will relieve the heavy burden carried by the working people of Australia for the education of people from middle and upper income families. This is the underlying philosophy of the government: that the lower socio-economic groupings have obvious difficulties in achieving the entry qualifications to university. He is saying that, because of those difficulties, we are shutting off, in a practical sense, their access to university because the raising of funds to a prohibitive level necessarily precludes them from entering universities. Fortunately, those very narrow viewswhereby you are suggesting that those who are poor are not capable of achieving university entrance, and thereby creating some degree of resentment-are not shared by the Australian public. A recent Newspoll survey showed that 73 per cent of those surveyed believe that universities are very important for shaping Australia's future. Another question showed that 65 per cent of Australians believe that Australia should spend more than our Asian neighbours spend on tertiary education. In fact, that is not occurring. As the member for La Trobe indicated, these Asian tigers are really full-on for developing their resource base-including their intellectual resource base-and we are falling way behind. Indeed, the survey indicated that 60 per cent of the people surveyed believe that the government priority for higher education investment is too low. Again, fortunately, the general population are much more broad-minded than the government in their comprehension of the benefits of education. The criticisms of government policy have not been made only by Labor members of parliament or those involved in universities who perhaps have some barrow to push. I refer, for instance, to comments made by the Anglican Church, reported in the Australian on 7 May. The comment was: The intrusion of a free market via fees into higher education ... risked creating ""deeper economic divisions within the social fabric which will, over time, lead to severe and possibly dangerous polarisation within the community."" That is coming from an objective source, albeit one which is caring for the welfare of Australians. The member for La Trobe said there has been no reduction in university applications, despite the increase in fees. Quite frankly, that is not matched by the statistics that are occurring. According to a survey conducted by the University of Western Sydney of prospective students and their parents in the outer western and south-western suburbs, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 May, 'higher fees were a major disincentive for many families, especially those from lower socio-economic backgrounds'. So there is no question. It stands to reason that higher fees are a disincentive to poorer students. In fact, even if those students go on to tertiary studies, they are likely to choose cheaper courses. When we are talking about choosing cheaper courses, many students now have to look at two options. One is the straight-out HECS payments and the other is up-front fees. For an arts degree, the HECS payment is now $3,300 and the up-front private fees for 1998 are between $9,000 and $11,000 per year-so about $33,000 for an arts degree. For law, the fees are about $12,000 per year-about $60,000 over five years. An economics degree is the same-about $60,000 over five years. Science and engineering are $15,000 per year; veterinary science is $24,000 per year. So you are looking at closer to $120,000 which some people will be able to pay to buy a degree. The reality is that, come October, there are going to be a number of students sitting in assembly halls, as many of us did when we were undertaking our higher school certificate. As I recall, it was one of the most stressful exams that I had, even considering the university exams that I went through. The facts of the matter are, however, that there are now 25 per cent fewer places available for students and they will be competing, effectively, for 75 per cent of places. The government will say , 'We have enabled universities to create an additional 25 per cent of places by way of their funding.' But I have not seen any buildings being built; I have not seen an increase in staff at universities of 25 per cent. Indeed, I have not seen university resources expanding one iota. I have actually seen them decreasing. To suggest that there is going to be a 25 per cent increase in the capacity of universities is false; it will not occur. What will occur is a 25 per cent reduction in non-fee-paying places. That is repulsive and repugnant, and something that parents are really going to resent. Indeed, some children who are, it has to be said, fair, average quality students but with a wealthy mother or father will probably be going into that exam in quite a relaxed fashion, because they know that funds are there to pay for their degree-whether it be $33,000 for arts, $60,000-odd for law or even $ 120,000-odd for dentistry. Those who have the means of paying will be able to purchase 25 per cent of places. As Professor Osborne, the Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University said, it would surely be repugnant to all fair-minded people: that one student may fail to secure enrolment or her preferred course by virtue of a single mark and through want of means have to miss out while another more affluent student, whose marks are considerably lower, can still purchase entry to the same course. Indeed it will be repugnant. I have discussed the consequences of the government's policy on individuals in terms of the effect it is going to have on Australia. I tum again to an objective source: the BusinesslHigher Education Round Table, which consists not only of academics but business leaders from companies such as the Advance Bank, MCDonald's, CRA, Mallesons Stephen Jaques and IBM Australia and many other very significant companies. Of Australia's need for tertiary education, they said: Australia is likely to remain in the most dynamic region of the world during the lifetime of today's young Australians. Without a national vision and sufficient investment in our higher education system, Australia and today's young Australians are likely to be marginalised as the region moves towards higher living standards and more advanced social and political structures. They said, in commenting on the 'Asian tigers' that the member for La Trobe referred to: Our trading partners, particularly in our region, recognise the importance of education and training to their future and are investing accordingly. They said: Building national intellectual capital, available for industry to exploit, remains one of the accepted means to promote local industry and employment, a technique being embraced by Australia's competitors in international trade and commerce. We are simply going to lose the game in comparison to the investment that other nations are making-specifically other nations in our region. To look at education in terms of a black and white balance sheet is wrong; it is an investment. Any businessman knows that if they do not invest in their business it will fail. We are simply not investing in our most prized asset, and that is the talent base of our nation. As another commentator said: The cost of Australian inaction will be that, as a nation, we are left behind ... In a relatively short time, our national influence, prestige and ultimately to his our security could be undermined. The talk was in terms of Australia reverting to the days of the 1950s and 1960s when we were regarded more as a quarry and farming paddock without the skills to value add. Other commentators have stressed, as I have, the contrast between what is occurring with our Asian neighbours with the tremendous investment that they are making. If there is any doubt that the government's policies have already affected the quality of education, I need do no more than refer to comments of Mr Roderick West, who is the chairman of the government's review of higher education. He is reported in the Australian on 28 Mayas saying: University operating grants will fall 6 per cent against forward estimates during the four years to 2000. Tutorials had vanished in some courses. In others they had been cut from one a week to one a fortnight and group sizes had increased from 12 to 30. Mr West said that there was little doubt that the sector is looking at further reductions. If the government's own adviser is expressing concerns, then all Australians sincerely have to be concerned. A matter which affects my constituents chronically is one which reflects a trend which will occur as a result of this government's policies. The member for La Trobe spoke of the United States example where universities canvass private industry for political donations. Professor John Niland, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales, is unquestionably a competent man and is well aware of what the university will have to do to attract those private funds. He has a policy of concentrating on the prestigious courses. Unfortunately, the St George campus of the University of New South Wales was not regarded by the university hierarchy as offering prestigious courses. The campus concentrates essentially on teacher education, sports sciences and some other faculties, but its real reputation is in teacher education. I think it fair to say that it is the premier teacher education institution in New South Wales. Although I have not inspected other state institutions, I suspect that it is right up there among the states. It has developed a number of teaching techniques. In particular, it has essentially pioneered the use of computer interaction where students interact with the teaching process. The research as to the comprehension that primary school students obtain as a result of this constant interaction compared with sitting mutely looking at the blackboard is really dramatic. The teachers trained in these methods obtain outstanding results. We are looking at a situation where all education ministers in Australia have recently met and have expressed concern about a teacher shortage by the year 2003. Indeed, some suggest we will be short of the requirement by as many as 7,000 teachers. So we have this first-rate institution but, because Professor Niland thinks that it is - o-ng to retard the prestige of the university In Its endeavours to recruit funding, he wants to cut it adrift. Indeed, the university has placed in the local newspaper an ad calling for expressions of interest from other institutions which may want to lease the site. Despite the university site being one of the most demanded by students, the uncertainties and insecurities which have been caused by this whole event have resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in their teaching staff, which is a real tragedy, because it was a first-rate institution. I note with some relief that in this higher education bill there is a provision-with the insertion of section 19 into the Higher Education Funding Act-whereby the minister can allocate funds for restructuring and rationalisation. My submission to the minister is that, if ever there were a cause for such funding, it is the St George campus of the University of New South Wales. There is a proposal, which is a very viable proposal, for that campus to be taken over by the University of Wollongong. It appears the state Minister for Education and Training, John Aquilina, will cooperate in that process. All politicians-be is they Labor or Liberal, local or state or federal-are cooperating. All that is required is sufficient funding to facilitate that transfer. It is very much a situation where the ball is in Senator Vanstone's court. I would implore her, in view of the circumstances that I have outlined, to look very hard at the situation, because I think St George campus has to be right up there at the top of priorities. I hope other members on the other side of the House will echo my views to the minister. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (8.32 p.m.)-I am always surprised when I stand up in this House. It surprises me that I am actually here; it surprises me that I am actually the member for Lindsay, which has traditionally been Labor's heartland; it surprises me that I won the election on 2 March; and it especially surprises me that I won the by-election on 19 October. But when I listen to members on the other side speak about this particular issue, I realise why their basic constituency turned to the Liberal government for salvation. They express concern for the lower socio-economic areas getting access to higher education. There is absolutely no evidence that there has been an increase in people in my area gaining access to universities by the price with which you have to pay for a degree. It has had no bearing whatsoever on the issue. In fact, the work force in the area of Lindsay out in western Sydney-which also houses the Nepean campus of the University of Western Sydney-have an average income of around $35,000. It is mainly made up of a trades and retail and labouring work force, with a small percentage of tertiary educated people. They pay-and they are quite aware that they pay-for higher education. The Labor government at no stage in the last 20 years helped them out with their businesses or their careers with a massive injection of funds to get started on the road to a very profitable earning capacity, yet they pay for higher education. What is keeping my constituency out of university is not a higher education contribution scheme; it is primary and secondary education. It is gaining the TER required to gain a place in university. Those issues must be addressed before I will even countenance the bleating from the other side that, 'Oh, we should make higher education exceptionally free,' because remember that in 1975, when we introduced the scheme, we had colleges of advanced education and we had institutes of technology. They have all become university places. The explosion in university places has been an epidemic. In fact, at one time you had 10,000 places in law school. It has exploded to something like 25,000, which is nearly equivalent to the number of people who are actually practising law. So the taxpayers of Lindsay are paying for people to get a degree in a subject that they are unlikely to be progressing to employment in. How valid is that? This is a very hot issue with me, because it was a central plank to Labor's campaign in the October by-election. Ross Free, the former minister for education, really was on ground that he was familiar with and comfortable with. He ran very hard in the Nepean campus of the University of Western Sydney. He campaigned largely on higher education and how unaffordable it was. The scare campaign that Labor ran in the Lindsay by-election on higher education was astounding, and I am not surprised that a few months later the University of Western Sydney did a survey and found that a disincentive was the cost of higher education, because it got lost in that by-election. The fact that got lost was that you do not pay anything until you are earning a wage, and then you are paying back only a proportion of your wage. Labor scared their own constituency, and I have spent the last six months repairing the damage of that by-election and assuring the students in my area that they can get to university and it is worthwhile studying. I have instituted a scholarship program in years 11 and 12 to assist kids in my area to get extra tuition, to get access to books and excursions and to get access to other educational tools that people in higher socio-economic areas have access to in order to get the high TERs. It is quite apparent to me that the wealthy in Lindsay get high TERs and the wealthy in the North Shore get high TERs and those in the eastern suburbs get high TERs, but the battlers of Lindsay do not get those sorts of TERs. They do not have that assistance. They do not have those sorts of resources at primary school and then secondary school. At least I am doing something about it. All Labor can do is run the most massive scare campaign in my electorate to scare every year 11 and 12 student-and even year 10 students-away from even considering higher education because, 'Oh! I can't afford it.' It costs you nothing to get into university. If you get the TER, you do not pay back anything until you have graduated and are in employment. That also brings up the subject of compulsory student fees, which is about the only thing that you do have to pay, but we are even looking at addressing that. With the second bill coming through, we are clearly breaking down the barriers that prevent anyone in my electorate from gaining access to higher education. It is important because a lot of people in my electorate go to university as mature age students. As mature age students, they have the capacity to get the TER to enter. If they cannot get the TER to enter, then they have the earning capacity to buy their place if they want to. So no longer are those people in the higher socio-economic areas taking all the free government places. If there are none left for the people of Lindsay, we can buy our way into university just as Malaysian students can, just as Singaporean students can and just as the numerous Canadian students at the University of Western Sydney can. It is a bit of an anathema to everybody in Lindsay to see these Canadian and foreign students out taking advantage of our superb education system when the people in my electorate cannot save up and go there if they want to. I think that is the important fundamental basis of this thing. We will finally see access gained by mature age students and those who have made their way in the world who did not necessarily get a big TERbecause the very successful people in my electorate quite frequently did not go past year 9, but they have made it in trade, trucking, industry, building, retailing and restaurants. Those people might want a university degree. I think they are entitled to buy one if they want to. This measure will see for the first time in 20 years the percentage of tertiary degrees in my area finally going up. It does not surprise me in the least that the people of Lindsay voted for the coalition government. We are offering them something that Labor never has. Labor simply took their taxes to provide free places for people from the wealthy areas of Sydney. I think it is important to repair a lot of damage caused to the University of Western Sydney in that by-election. It is an exceptionally good institution. It is the third largest New South Wales and the 10th largest in Australia. It has seven campuses across the greater western Sydney region. It is federated under the Hawkesbury, Macarthur and Nepean network of administrations and it caters for the 1.8 million people who live west of Parramatta. The university offers 700 undergraduate and postgraduate courses. There is an enormous choice of courses to do. It is diverse. We are not pumping people through multiple programs which are already oversupplied in the industry. We are linked very closely with businesses and industry in our region and are delivering education which will get them jobs in our region. Over the next 15 years, we will finally see students from the 670-odd schools in our area going to a university in our area and getting jobs in our area. For too long we have seen kids from our area go into the inner city to get their degrees and stay there. They have never returned to western Sydney. That has had a major impact on a number of areas. Part of the University of Western Sydney has a number of teaching and research facilities at the Westmead Hospital. It is one of the largest hospitals in the Southern Hemisphere. We hope that the Nepean Hospital can reach similar standards, but we need the professionals to come out and practise there. People with affiliations to the University of New South Wales, Sydney and downtown Sydney do not tend to come to the Nepean Hospital. We need to train our own school students and our own graduates in our own area and get them to stay in our area. This is something that we hope will occur. The New South Wales government has approved the funding for extensions to the Nepean Hospital. But, as yet, we do not know what will actually be placed inside that hospital. I am very curious to see what is budgeted for the outfit of that hospital and whether we will get those sorts of facilities even further out west. It is my commitment to my region which the leads me to stand up here today. I think it is really important to undo the damage done in that Lindsay by-election. It scared a number in of people away from even considering a tertiary degree and it was exceptionally unfair. You will notice that in New South Wales there was a decrease in applications while some other parts of Australia had an increase in applications. When all the dust had died down, the enrolments were up. In fact, New South Wales overenrolled by more than 10,000 places. That is something the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, is to be congratulated on. She has managed to make the savings that were required of her from the Expenditure Review Committee. She has managed to create more funded places and, on top of that, she has managed to create another 6,000 additional places nationwide that are funded as well as taking on 26,500 additional students. The fees from those students are rolled back into the university. The University of Western Sydney has negotiated for that money to be transferred into a 15 per cent increase in staff wages. That is a key thing. The minister has given a staff wage rise, increased the number of free places and increased the number of places that are able to be bought by those who do not get a TER all within the first 18 months of coming to government. That is something the previous minister-my counterpart in the Lindsay by-election-had failed to do. I am not surprised that I stand here in this House representing the electorate of Lindsay today. The minister has done all these things in spite of the $10 billion black hole found on 2 March by this government. Nobody, if not the people of Lindsay, understands the repaying of debt and living within your means. The previous government left a debt of $10.3 million. It had been spending well outside its means. It had been spending largely on inefficiencies within a system that was not catering to the needs of my electorate. In response, the minister has delivered the savings required to get Australia back on track, and there has been minimal impact on universities. This government has funded staff wage rises; it has funded extra places; and it has established a loophole through which mature age or working people can seek to undertake tertiary education. Too often in the past Australia has missed the boat in keeping up with modem technology. One example was the introduction of colour television. Australia took 10 years to move from black-and-white to colour television. Certainly, the fact that Australia was not in that market showed in the corresponding loss of production, programming and feature films. Australia was 10 years behind the American and other markets that had moved to colour earlier. This is certainly something that we are in danger of doing with on-line services, and it is certainly something that we must watch with education. Education in our region has become a marketable commodity. A number of foreign students all through the South-East Asian region look to Australia as having the highest calibre of education available, and they are prepared to pay for it. I think it is important that education, as an export resource, is recognised and used to stimulate our economy. A recent report commissioned by the mvs shows that university education enhances gross regional product in our area by $280 million annually, and it boosts regional employment by 4,800 jobs. Although only 50 per cent of the staff live in the region, two-thirds of staff income is spent in the region. If we can make our universities major export industries, then there are even further spinoffs for the people of Lindsay. If we stay at the forefront of education, we can certainly do a lot for our region, for our people and for our deficit. The minister should be congratulated on the excellent job that she has done on this bill. It was a difficult task. She has shown outstanding talent and compassion in dealing with a difficult subject. The Labor Party had a lot to gain by bashing and knocking her policies, and by scaring the people of Lindsay over that period from the budget through to October. It did not wash. The figures there now show that it did not wash. If anything, I believe that speakers following me should apologise to the minister, as well as to the people of Lindsay. The scare tactic the Labor Party used in that by-election was shocking. On all accounts the results show that there was a disgraceful, scaremongering, sky-is-falling campaign which was not in any shape, fashion or form responsible. The minister has delivered a very responsible initiative. It positions Australia to go forward in this field enabling all Australians to access, at some stage in their life, a higher education and allowing them access to information, research and technology as our nation moves further and faster towards a leading role in our region. I think also the US has inextricably linked itself with the community in my area in a number of sports. For the first time the university is providing a number of sporting facilities, and drama, music and art facilities, that we have not seen in western Sydney. Do not forget, Mr Deputy Speaker, that western Sydney is Labor's so-called heartland yet there are no major facilities for sport, music, drama, theatre or regional museums; they do not exist. University campuses traditionally hold excellent facilities in all of those areas that are accessible by all the community. I think it is about time that western Sydney finally had access to those sorts of facilities. The University of Western Sydney, under the stewardship of Deryck Schreuder, has gone a long way towards achieving those goals. It has not lost any funding; it has been capped, as has been admitted by the President of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, Professor Fay Gale. It was capped, the funding was exactly the same, and they have managed to do more with less. That is all we have asked of anybody. That request by the minister has not been unreasonable. It has simply addressed the 13 years of rot and spendthrift ways of the Labor Party that had spent the hard earned dollars of the taxpayers of Lindsay. The people of Lindsay are finally getting their own back by putting me here in this place to represent them. I commend the bill to the House.",80
196,Mr OCONNOR,PAIRS,"Corio) (8.50 p.m.)Listening to the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly), one would be tempted to conclude that over 13 years the previous Labor government did nothing in the area of tertiary education. But, of course, what we did over those 13 years was to rectify 23 years of absolute neglect of Australia's tertiary system. If you want to look at statistics, funding was massively improved over that period; and access by ordinary Australians, the sons and daughters of working people, was massively increased with a doubling of the tertiary intake. The honourable member for Lindsay talks about the rot of the last 13 years. I wonder how she would have coped with a treasurer who left the Australian economy with an inflation rate in double digits, a growth rate in a negative phase-that is, losing thousands of jobs a day-and who left the incoming government with a $25 billion budget deficit. I wonder what the honourable member for Lindsay would say about that legacy. We all know that that was the legacy left to Labor by none other than the present Prime Minister, John Howard, when he was Treasurer. I have said before on the floor of this House and I will say again that I cannot believe so many economic ignoramuses have accumulated in one particular place: that is, on the government benches. The government of the day is the only group of parliamentarians in the Western world that can categorise a four-year period of four per cent economic growth, massive job creation, massive strides in maintaining the social safety net, breaking the back of inflation and having the best industrial relations record in Australia's history as being rot. That is exactly what the honourable member for Lindsay has said. I guess her statements to the House tonight merely demonstrate the point I am making: not only is there an economic ignoramus in the seat of Lindsay; they abound on the government benches. The budget cuts that have been introduced by the Howard government in its first and second budgets really lead one to pose the question: whither the clever country? If Australia has a competitive advantage, if it has a cutting edge as far as its economic performance is concerned, then it has come primarily from the quality of its education system. In the state of Victoria we have seen a dismantling of a quality educational infrastructure by a state Liberal government, and at the national level we have seen massive assaults on the tertiary institutions of this nation by another Liberal government. One must ask the question: where is the vision of the conservative parties in this country? Australia beyond the year 2000 will rely very much on the competitive edge that will be generated through the fruits of the labours in our tertiary institutions. Our cutting edge will be in the area of education. What sense is there for us in destroying one particular leg of our competitive advantage? We are a very innovative culture as far as our industry is concerned. Our great Achilles heel has been putting the commercial and financial sector on a footing to take advantage of that innovative culture commercialising brilliant technologies and generating employment. That has been our Achilles heel, but we have another one emerging now. It has been alluded to by people on this side of the House as we try to bring this particular government to its senses on the education front. The cutting edge for Australia beyond the year 2000 will be in the quality of its skills formation, and that will be generated in part from the expert tertiary institutions that we have developed in this country. I can think of no greater act of stupidity than the wholesale dismantling of our education system at a state level, with a federal conservative government proceeding along the same path as we have seen in Victoria with the primary and the secondary schools sector. The one thing that will give us our competitive edge, the one thing that will secure the future of our children is the tertiary education sector, and this great visionary government led by that great visionary, the honourable member for Bennelong, has cut into it like no other government before it. We all have a vested interest in ensuring that educational dollars are spent well. Nobody is denying that. What we are seeing now is a stupid dismantling of the tertiary education infrastructure. One really wonders about the vision of a government that would embark on this particular course of action. In barely 16 months in office we have seen cuts to operating grants. We have seen increases in HECS charges and lower repayment thresholds which are deterring many students from even attempting to enter tertiary institutions. In the most recent budget we have seen perhaps the grossest act of stupidity-the reduction in the Commonwealth industry places scheme. I acknowledge the presence in the House tonight of the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), who has associated himself with the very cuts to the university that is in his electorate-the one regional university that has established an international reputation in the area of distance education. The honourable member for Corangamite comes into this House proud of the fact that the government has ripped into the one particular program that has sustained the links of Deakin University with industry throughout this nation. He will wear it in his electorate. They are already after him in the Western District. It is very doubtful that he will survive another challenge. We will not see the member for Corangamite next time in this House, nor will we see the government which is spawning such stupidity in the tertiary sector. We have seen from this government the ending of the triennial funding arrangements for tertiary institutions in this country. One thing that Labor did in government was to give some certainty to the funding base for tertiary institutions. We put them on the correct financial footing to mount the challenges they needed to mount to take part in the global expansion of educational services that we have seen over the past decade. It was Labor that positioned them. It was Labor that encouraged the universities into the export arena and developed a very strong export industry for this country in the educational field. It was Labor that encouraged the vast research that is the hallmark of Australia's reputation in South-East Asia and around the world. Testament to that fact is simply that many overseas students not only from Asia but also from Europe have decided to come to Australia to undertake their tertiary studies. I note that the honourable member for Corangamite is leaving the chamber. May well he do so because I know he is ashamed of the indefensible cuts that have taken place in the first and second Howard budgets and the emasculation of Deakin University's capacity to relate to Australian industry and to sustain a regional presence at their campus at Warrnambool. What did the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee have to say about this government's attitude to tertiary and higher education in this country? They made a submission to the government's review of higher education. They stated in a press release: ... without sufficient investment in higher education, Australia's future wealth, prestige and even its security, could be undermined. That is a fairly strong statement not from a group of radicals in the Australian community but from learned people who have the interests of their sector and also the interests of Australia at heart. It is a fairly blunt warning. The press release goes on to state: The submission says that while Australia is currently well placed to take advantage of the dramatic economic growth of our Asian neighbours, the Government needs to understand that unless we match these countries and our OECD partners with higher education investment, our favourable position will soon be lost. It is not my future that is at stake here. I had the great fortune to be educated in a tertiary institution in Victoria. That great tertiary institution was Monash University. It is the sons and daughters of working people throughout the length and breadth of Australia that are having and will have in the future their opportunities curtailed by the funding cuts that have already been made by this government. The future of their country is being truncated. It is being damaged by the actions of a government that is ideologically driven and lacks vision. The sentiment that was echoed by the ViceChancellors Committee has been echoed as well by the business and higher education round table group. That group is representative of business people in this country and the heads of our tertiary institutions. They said: Without a national vision and sufficient investment in our higher education system, Australia and today's young Australians are likely to be marginalised as the region moves towards higher living standards and more advanced social and political structures. Here is a very blunt warning directly from not only the leaders of our tertiary sector in Australia but also the business community. They had this to say to an ideologically driven government that seeks to slash and bum when it comes to the tertiary sector in this country: That foundation of national intellectual capital will continue to demand (and justify) substantial public funding. The government may well argue to us that the moneys that they have allocated in those two budgets represent substantial funding. It . certainly does to a degree. But for us to keep pace with the demands of our own economic growth and the growing demands of the region we ought to be investing more dollars which are better spent and not cutting them back in this important sector of Australia's service industry. I would like to make a few comments about the university that is in my electorate and the electorate of the honourable member for Corangamite, Deakin University. It was one of Australia's first regional universities. It was established in 1971 in Geelong and it has grown and amassed a very formidable reputation as a quality tertiary institution, especially in the field of distance education. It is also a pacesetter in its links to Australian industry through its business arm, Deakin Australia. There are some 30,000 external or distance education students enrolled at Deakin and about 28,000 HECS enrolled students. So it is a fairly substantial operation. There are some 2,500 staff. Due to the funding cuts that have been instituted by this government, we have seen a reduction of some 200 in the staffing level in that particular institution. That has simply meant a weakening of the university's capacity to offer good courses to its students and to establish the links with Australian industry which are vital to its survival. Deakin University has a campus in Warrnambool in the electorate of Wannon further down in the western district of Victoria. I was down in that area recently and some deep concerns were expressed to me about the future of the Warrnambool campus. Due to the government's tertiary education funding cuts, we have seen the termination of the education faculty and the degree that comes from that faculty. The Warrnambool campus has been stripped of its famous public relations course. What the government fails to understand is that these particular campuses are very important to regional communities. They are important in the level of staff that are employed there and the income flow that is generated in the local communities. They are very important links between the business community in the local area and the tertiary institution. They attract students and their families. Some of the students who go to the Warrnambool campus are external students and their families visit them. There are many spin-offs for regional communities in having these campuses in their midst. What we have seen with the funding cuts that have been delivered by the government is a threat to that particular campus. The community is rallying to ensure that it survives. The government, realising the mistake that it has made in this area, has allocated some moneys, in excess of $25 million, to rural and regional universities in an attempt to paper over the cracks that have emerged since the funding cuts in the first two budgets. The most devastating blow to Deakin University was delivered in the recent budget with the cuts to the Commonwealth industry places scheme of some $7.2 million. Deakin University will lose some 2,000 places due to these funding cuts. This program was the means by which the university had established very strong links with Australian industry. Its clients were the Who's Who of Australia's manufacturing sector: Ford Australia and Coca-Cola and, in the services area, Qantas and Ansett. Some very big companies have availed themselves of the services of Deakin U ni versi ty and the educational services provided through the Commonwealth industry places scheme. At a time when the government was encouraging Australian universities to make these links with Australian industry, from the point of view of not only improving the networks and the linkages between industry and tertiary institutions but also improving skill formation in Australian industry, it then removes the onc program that was giving Deakin University an opportunity to establish these linkages and to develop alternative sources of funding for many of its courses. So, on the one hand, it is saying to the university, 'Go out into the marketplace, develop these linkages and develop alternative sources of income so you can sustain your level of operations,' and, on the other hand, it goes to that one scheme that is Deakin University'S strength and which addresses that very question that it is posing to the university. It is a nonsense for the government to proceed with this particular cut in its budget. Professor Wilson, who is the Vice-Chancellor of Deakin University, had this to say in the Geelong Advertiser of 15 May 1997 about these particular cuts to funding that have affected the university so badly: It is difficult not to be depressed about the Government's seeming inability or unwillingness to understand the need for human and capital investment in higher education as the best means for ensuring our longer-term economic strength. That is not me saying that; that is a very eminent Australian, a very eminent tertiary educator. It is a very simple statement. The government has no vision when it comes to the tertiary sector in this country. The cuts are doing untold damage to the tertiary educational infrastructure of this nation and, in the long-term, Australia's economic interests, its security interests and its social and cultural interests are going to be damaged by a short sighted and quite pathetic government.",87
197,Dr NELSON,PAIRS,"It gives me great pleasure to speak to the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1). For the first part of my address I would like to speak specifically to the billwhat the bill does and seeks to achieve-and then I would like to make some general remarks about the future of higher education under this government. why we are doing what we are doing in the general sense, and then address some of the remarks made by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and other speakers on the opposite side. This bill further develops the government's the reform program for higher education and it is necessary not only in its own right but through the need for fiscal consolidation. I certainly was privileged in one sense to be the product of a tertiary education system where I personally did not have to pay anything for it at the time other than to try to put something back into the system these days. The reality is that in Australia we can afford to spend only that which we earn. We cannot afford to spend social infrastructure on debt and the continual sale of assets. Every member of this place and every Australian ought to remember that this year we will spend $82 billion on health, education and welfare. That is far in excess of the $74 billion that will be rai sed by taxes on PA YE income earners, companies and also fringe benefits tax. We cannot indefinitely spend more on those big ticket items of health, education and welfare than all the money that is raised by taxation on income. The bill provides funding for price movements which affect items such as superannuation, grants to open learning organisations, teaching hospitals and special capital projects. In 1998, this supplementation will provide about $9.65 million to the tertiary education sector. To further foster and develop rationalisation and restructuring by institutions, the bill enables them to receive special grants. Such a move should silence those who argued after last year's budget that the government had in some way turned its back on the tertiary education sector as it comes to terms with significant change. By assisting them with restructuring, institutions will derive permanent benefits from the $26 million that this measure will provide over the next four financial years. The program guidelines setting out the criteria and the procedures that will be used in assessing those activities are to be set down in disallow able instruments. The package is aimed at encouraging institutions to rationalise staffing, infrastructure where educationally sensible to do so to achieve long-term efficiencies and create a more competitive higher education sector. Whilst education and certainly health care cannot simply be set entirely loose to the forces of the private sector, there is little doubt in my mind and I am sure that of the government's that a bit more competition in the higher education sector could only do the Australian taxpayer and certainly recipients of that education a lot of good. To be eligible for assistance, proposals from institutions need to generate long-term benefits, benefits to them, and demonstrate that the cost of implementation is unquestionably beyond the funding capacity of the institution. Up to $5 million of the $26 million over the four years of the estimates will be available for the 1997 program year. The government will be especially disposed to proposals that are put forward by regional institutionsinstitutions frequently seeking to provide educational opportunities to working and lower income families. Ultimately, of course, the decision lies with the minister. The program to which this bill gives effect complements the assistance made available to institutions in last year's budget through advances of operating grants. It recognises that, by providing a modest level of assistance, institutions which do not have the same high level of total resources available to them-and that is largely the newer universities and those servicing lower income areasthat others have will be better able to reposition themselves to meet the challenges of increasing competition. In addition to this, universities will also be able to apply for an advance to operating grants as a means of managing their cash flow and the consequences of structural adjustment. No interest rate is to be applied to these advances and universities have got up to three years to pay. I think many of us over the years, including myself, have been very critical of the intransigent inflexibility of government, but for a government to fund a system and to provide advances in this manner for what are basically long-term changes to higher education is something that ought to courses and be applauded. The second major initiative contained within this bill is to encourage student repayments of the higher education contribution scheme. This will be achieved through a new provision which will enable students to receive a 25 per cent discount for any upfront partial payment of $500 or more. At the moment, only those students who pay their total HECS contribution for a semester upfront receive a 25 per cent discount. This measure represents a better deal for students, who can access the 25 per cent discount for partial up-front payments of $500 or more. It also addresses the anomaly of a student who might be enrolled in performing arts, for example, who pays his or her total HECS contribution of $3,300 and receives a 25 per CCl - discount for paying the full amount; whereas a dentistry student who might come from a low income background and who might want to pay the same amount cannot access any discount unless he or she pays the full up-front HECS contribution of $5,500. Making the higher education contribution scheme more equitable and workable for students is surely something people ought to support. When a partial up-front payment is made, the remaining HECS contribution will be deferred for payment through the taxation system. For example, if a student has a HECS liability of $2,350 for the first semester and he or she wants to pay $1,000 up-front towards that liability, paying this amount before the census date will reduce that deferred liability by $1,333 or 125 per cent times $1,000. Such a student's deferred HECS liability will be $1,017. If a student has a total liability of less than $500 for a semester and the full amount is paid up-front, a 25 per cent discount will still apply. A partial upfront payment can be made through a student's higher education institution and must be made before the census date of the relevant semester. Five hundred dollars has been set aside as a minimum up-front payment. I have had one or two constituents making inquiries of me about this. We have set $500 as a minimum partial up-front payment to attract a discount as obviously the costs in processing diminishing sums can be prohibitive and actually negate the effort the government is making for administrative simplicity. The discount for partial up-front payments will apply only to those of $500 or more that are made after 1 January 1998. Those students who have elected to defer their HECS repayments can still receive the 15 per cent discount for voluntary payments of $500 or more. The bill also assists students by streamlining the applications for remission of their debt under the HECS or the open learning deferred payment scheme, otherwise known as OLDPS. Applicants will now have a set 12month period from the date of withdrawal to apply for remission of their debt. The measure addresses the inequitable situation of linking the application period to the census date and instead links it to the date on which the student can no longer continue his or her course, and that is the date of withdrawal. For anyone who is affected by this, whether it be a student or a parent, that is common sense in action. The bill also addresses the complex twotiered application period, replacing it with a set period of 12 months. Until now, students had to apply within three months of the census date-31 March for the first semester or 31 August for the second semesterirrespective of when they withdrew from the course. An application for remission could be considered within a further 12 months only if the applicant could demonstrate that the special circumstances became known only after the initial three-month period or if, because of circumstances beyond the student's control, it was not possible to apply within the initial three-month period. Clearly, these measures will greatly enhance flexibility. When a student is withdrawing from a course-sometimes through choice but sometimes through family or other personal circumstances, or sometimes through life crises-the last thing you want is to have to go through the nonsense that currently applies and the inflexibility of trying to sort out your HECS repayments and remission of them. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which has raised its concerns about the existing guidelines for remission lacking any legal basis, should be satisfied with the specification in the act of the secretary's powers to remit a student debt-either HECS or OLDPS-and empowering the secretary to issue guidelines for the exercise of this discretion. As a result of these measures, most students will actually have longer in which to seek remission of their debt. More students will be able to seek remission of their debt as they will not any longer be required to satisfy a two-tiered application process to receive consideration. There are a number of members on the other side, and certainly some of the more vocal students in the community, who are continually berating the higher education contribution scheme system and, in particular, the changes announced to it by the government in last year's budget, along with some amendments to it since. The fact is that in 1988, when the HECS scheme was introduced, there were 186,15 I students enrolled in Australian tertiary institutions. Last year that had increased to 235,253. The number of applications had increased from 283,465 in 1988 to 454,846 last year, and it would not have been possible without HECS. So, too, the long-term viability of the higher education system depends on sensible and sustainable reforms to the higher education contribution scheme. If we are to have a place in a tertiary institution for those young people and mature age students of the future who wish to have it, it does not seem unreasonable that those who are beneficiaries of this education be required to pay a proportion of it; and to have a system which requires payment essentially only when you earn a certain level of income seems eminently reasonable. Also, to provide a discount to students who are willing or able to pay up front or, as this bill allows, to even pay a portion of it, again, is a sensible initiaMoreover, tive. When you consider that HECS funds only about 27 per cent of the cost of the tertiary education which the person is going to receive, it seems like a very reasonable system for us to apply. I have listened to valuable contributions in this chamber by people from all sides on all kinds of issues. One of the less noteworthy contributions has come from some members on the other side who have argued about equity. I have heard people railing against the inequitable changes in higher education which the government has introduced. The fact is that as of last year 38 per cent of tertiary education benefits went to households with the top 20 per cent of average income and only 15 per cent of university students have come from the bottom 25 per cent of income earning households. That means that almost 40 per cent of the higher education dollar, most of which has come from low and middle income earning families in Australia, has been going to subsidise higher education for families with an average income of $84,000 a year. Whilst we may all have different notions of what equity is, I do not consider that equitable. The fact that most of the people carrying the tax burden in this country have funded the higher education of people such as myself from which I have derived a great benefit is not, in my opinion, an equitable way to run a higher education system. I have read a number of editorial pieces that have been written about what the government has been doing in higher education, and one of the more interesting, if not provocative, ones is from Professor Michael Jackson, a director of the Civics Centre at the University of Sydney, who published a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald on 2 June 1997. I will quote some passages from it. He said: Concerned teachers and idealistic students worry about the introduction of fee-paying Australian students. Today a Malaysian student can buy into an Australian university but an equally qualified Australian cannot. Universities have a social responsibility to educate a student body that looks like Australia. those universities claiming to be the best must accept the challenge of educating the worse students, not those judged best by the HSC. High scorers will do well anywhere. Social benefit could ensue. If universities developed the potential of the worse students, it might persuade Canberra policy-makers to reconsider the value of higher education. Professor Jackson went on to say that it should be clear that not all those without a HECS place are without intelligence. He then stated: Some of those who do well in the HSC feel superior to those who score less. Yet students with lower scores but greater motivation can unlock further talents in higher education, and so they should. My own experience in the world of medicine has shown that for every student who is successful in achieving a place in a university in medical school, there are 10 who have applied but miss out, yet who are academicalIy capable of being excellent medical practitioners in whatever field they pursue. I have seen cases where an individual student has achieved a TER of 88, 89 or 90 and missed out on a place in medicine. Yet at the moment in Australia we have 1,000 feepaying overseas students who will graduate with Australian medical degrees, a number of whom, by the way, will find devices that will enable them to stay here when they finish. Then we have Australian children of Australian citizens-a lot of those citizens, by the way, who themselves had been migrantswho are quite capable of being doctors in Australia and would reflect the multicultural nature of the country, apart from anything else, but they are not able to do it. If they can buy a place, having missed out on a government-funded place, then why should they not be able to do so, whether it be in dentistry, in law, the arts, or any other discipline which people choose to pursue? For members who have not had this experience, I can say to them that they only need to feel and hear the anguish of people who, since the age of 10 or 11, had their hearts set on a particular career, who wanted to do nothing else for most of their teenage years and yet, because they did not achieve a TER within two or three points of the cut-off, were forced to do something in which they were not interested and for which their skills were not suited. Maybe the kind of flexibility that this government has had the courage to unlock, which is based on long-term planning and vision for Australia, will provide a more equitable outcome for some people who have been missing out. Another outstanding contribution to the understanding of higher education, as always, was from Professor David Penington. I will read a couple of excerpts from his address which was published in the Melbourne Winter Conversazione for 1995. It is a publication of the Boston, Melbourne, Oxford Conversazioni on Culture and Society. I will read part of Professor Penington's address to that meeting: Education must recognize the wide diversity of potential amongst young people and must foster the fulfilment of this potential to the greatest extent possible in the course of their careers. In a society where new knowledge will continue to emerge and where organisations and patterns of employment will continue to change at perhaps an increasing rate, learning how to learn and adapt, and acquiring a thirst for these, represent some of the most important challenges in education. The need for continuing, lifelong education is a natural consequence. Thomas lefferson was principal author of The Declaration of Independence, third President of the United States and founder of the University of Virginia. This remarkable man declared: ""education is the defense of the State"". The traditional universities have a commitment to research and to testing knowledge and education in a research environment. Included in this is a commitment to extending the most able young people to the limit of their capability, whether it be in the humanities, the physical, biological or social sciences, or in those professions which depend strongly on a research base. Asian nations, with their proud Confucian tradition of respect for teachers and for education, could leave us far behind if we are not willing to make our own positive commitment to the provision of education of a kind which caters for and fosters diversity of achievement and responsiveness to the needs of individuals. It is time for countries such as our own to rethink their approaches to education in order to achieve such a framework. That is what this bill and similar legislation put up by this government is achieving and will achieve.",90
198,Mr ABBOTT,PAIRS,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (9.31 p.m.)-This Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No.1) 1997 is essentially a very straightforward bill implementing the 1997 higher education budget measures. In most respects it is essentially a piece of legislative housekeeping. It is essentially a steady-as-she-goes bill which is designed to keep the higher education sector in good standing and good stead over the next couple of years. There are four major measures in this bill. The first provides for supplementary funding of about $9 million to pay for changes to superannuation rates, to make certain cost of living adjustments to other funding and to provide a safety net wage rise for university staff. The second sets up a $26 million restructuring and rationalisation fund that will essentialthis ly help various campuses to better collaborate and cooperate. It will help them to jointly develop infrastructure. It will help fund the sorts of things which are already beginning to enable universities to develop, for instance, remote tutorials using interactive technology. It will help universities to better collaborate in teaching and in jointly offering courses and so on. As I said, these are things which are already happening to a considerable extent in our system. I believe, for instance, that the Australian National University is rapidly becoming the centre of classics teaching in this country. A great university such as Melbourne University is continuing to offer, as it should, classics courses hut it is doing so with the assistance of the ANU classics department. This is the kind of cooperation which this fund will facilitate. This will mean that small campuses will remain viable because they will be able to offer a full range of courses while at the same time specialising in the things that they have comparative educational and intellectual advantage in. That is a very important innovation brought in by this piece of legislation. The third thing this bill does is allow students to claim a 25 per cent discount for up-front HECS payments of less than the full amount of their course. Anyone paying $500 or more towards their HECS contributions will be able to claim the 25 per cent discount. This is an important equity measure and I am pleased to see that the opposition supports it. The final significance of this bill is that introduces simpler and more liberal procedures for the remission of HECS charges for course drop-outs. At the present time former students have a three-month period in which to apply for the remission of their HECS. There is then a further 12-month period in which they can apply on rather more stringent conditions. This bill provides for a 12-month period in which to apply for HECS remissions provided, generally speaking, the relevant factor is severe enough to make it impossible for the student to continue the course, the factor which arose was beyond the student's control and the student did not know about development before the census cut-off period. It is interesting that the actual provisions of this bill have not been opposed. In fact, the opposition supports, with greater or lesser degrees of enthusiasm, everything in this bill. There are other things which, I suppose, flow from the bill that are criticised, but essentially the opposition supports all the things that are in this bill. What we have had from the opposition is an amendment attacking not this year's budget but last year's. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in his contribution pointed out that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) had been rather flat and disappointing. I did not agree with my friend and colleague the member for La Trobe. I thought the member for Werriwa was actually giving a typically spirited performance, despite the admonition of his leader to stop showing up the relevance deprivation syndrome of some of the member for Werriwa's most senior colleagues. The member for Werriwa's biggest problem was that he simply could find nothing to attack in this year's budget and therefore he had to recycle old arguments from last year's budget. That is what he did tonight. Last week he was somewhat more up to date when he complained about problems with the Austudy hotline which had arisen in late January-problems which in fact the government had fixed by mid-February and which Senator Stott Despoja had cottoned onto on 6 February. Senator Stott Despoja's press it release of 6 February this year was almost entirely echoed by the member for Werriwa's press release on 5 June this year, It seems that the only person still hanging on the end of the AMT hotline is none other than the member for Werriwa himself. Anyway, when the member for Werriwa got on to debating his amendments, he made four substantial criticisms. The first criticism was that the government had slashed funding and cut student numbers. This is simply untrue. The university sector is estimated to have $250 million more revenue from teaching activities in 1997 than in 1996. Total Commonwealth operating grant funding is up by $147 million to $4.866 billion. Total postgraduate fee-paying students increased by 22 per cent. Total overseas student numbers are up by some 9,000 and that is worth $92 million. Compared with 1996, total student load increased by 12,300. Compared with 1997 targets, universities overenrolled a total of 33,025 equivalent full-time students. So there is more money and there are more students in our university system this year than last year. The member for Werriwa also said that research funding had been slashed. Again, that is not true. Last year's budget provided for an extra $90 million-plus for research infrastructure. Under this government in 1997 there is $415 million for that targeted research. Next year there will be $443 million. Under the former government, the projections were $394 million this year and $399 million next year. So again the member for Werriwa is quite wrong in his facts. The second point that the member for Werriwa made was that individual universities were suffering disastrously from staff cuts and course amalgamations. He went through a list of campuses where various redundancies and course reorganisations had taken place. I would be the first to concede that this has not been an especially easy time for our universities. It is never easy to readjust, and yes, arising out of last year's budget, there were some very considerable readjustments for our campuses to make. But the fact is that fewer staff and reorganised courses are not necessarily a bad thing. It is my understanding that, when the member for Werriwa was the Mayor of Liverpool, there were indeed rather significant staff cuts and rather significant service reorganisations in Liverpool council. Was it a worse council as a result? Perhaps it was, perhaps it was not, but the point I am trying to make-and the point which, I am sure, the member for Werriwa would concede if he was being less one-eyed-is that these things may be bad or they may be good, but to draw a long bow and to make sweeping generalisations is simply not on. He named a number of universities. I am not sure that I got them all, but there was Ballarat, the University of New South Wales, the Victorian University of Technology, Adelaide, La Trobe, Sydney and the ANV. He said that these universities had been devastated by cuts to funding. He said these universities had been devastated. What he was saying was that these universities are now devastated universities as a result of the policies of this government. I would be the first to concede that many of their vice-chancellors have been critical of aspects of government policy. But would any of those vice-chancellors stand up here and say that his or her institution is a devastated institution? That is what the member for Werriwa was saying. He was saying that each one of those institutions was now a devastated institution because of the policies of this government. It seems to me that the worse you can say about these universities is that they are coping. Probably it is more accurate to say that, whatever the vicissitudes of the last 12 months, each and everyone of them is flourishing. He quoted Rod West, the head of the government's investigation into higher education, as saying what a shocking thing had been done. He obviously has not been reading all of the press as assiduously as he reads Glenn Milne's column because, if he had been reading all of the press, he would have seen that Rod West has denied what was attributed to him in the Australian. Rod West has issued a statement called 'University Funding Cuts-The Facts' in which he has said that total education funding in 1997 was higher; that per student operating funding had remained stable; and that there had been 'big increases' in research funding in the 1996 budget. That is what Mr West thinks about the federal government's changes, contrary to the words that were put in his mouth by the Australian and which were repeated tonight. The third big criticism of the member for Werriwa is that the introduction of full fees for domestic undergraduates is producing rich, thick graduates and students. Again, the member for Werriwa has been indulging in a form of institutional defamation because that is far from what those campuses are saying. Let me quote Professor Alan Gilbert, the Vice-Chancellor of Melbourne University, who says: First, let me say unequivocally that the Universimember ty of Me1bournethe old university of the member oppositewill not lower its standards. We are not going to betray our graduates in such a way, or compromise our vision of Melbourne's future as one of the great universities of the world. Mr Gareth Evans-There were some rich, thick people when I was there!",94
199,Mr ABBOTT,PAIRS,"They have very high standards to maintain, as the member opposite knows. Professor Gilbert continues: We have not just become a founding member of Universitas 21, an international association of world-class research and teaching universities, only to turn our back on the highest international standards of teaching ... The first thing to say is that no system of higher education yet invented has been inherently equitable. The system of free public universities introduced by the Whitlam Government is a case in point. Incontrovertible evidence showed that participation in free higher education was always biased towards the middle and upper middle classes. The result was that relatively privileged young people gained the considerable benefits of a university degree with a de facto subsidy from less privileged taxpayers who never got to a university. Ironically, the principle of user-pays, well managed, may actually promise fairer outcomes than the older alternative involving a subsidisation of middle class students by working class taxpayers. If that does not satisfy the member for Werriwa, here is Professor Fay Gale, head of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, who said: Universities believe in merit because that is what we are about but it is also true that it is a simple matter of institutional survival as well. No university which thinks beyond tomorrow will fail to consider the effect which falling ards would have on its reputation and its long-term viability as a credible learning institution. The final big attack was on the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, for being inconsistent. He made great play of the minister's description of what happened last year as, variously, a cut, a nick or a cap. I have got to say that this is a little bit rich coming from a who once talked about taking a bit of good old-fashioned Labor stick to the business sector. He has also, as I recall, praised aspects of Premier Jeff Kennett's health care reforms, including casemix funding, which produced one hell of a bunfight in this parliament with the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) before the last election. This is the same person who, in one breath, endorsed the higher education paper of the member for  Some reports following the paper's release drew analogies between my model and the sort of scholarship (or voucher) proposals found in Fightback. I don't resile from thinking that it is time that those of us to the political Left-of-Centre took a fresh look at the way we view choice. Indeed, I believe we should make expanding the ability of all people to shape and control their lives to make choices--one of our core ethical goals. That is what the member for Sydney said and that is what the member for Werriwa endorsed. And yet, just a couple of weeks later, in his own education statement, the member for Werriwa said: Within this context, the days of the public sector seeking to fund choice for choice's sake are over. So the member for Sydney supports choice and the member for Werriwa does not. And here we have the member for Werriwa standing up and slagging off the minister for alleged inconsistency. No doubt if the member for Werriwa were here he would make statements about foolish consistency being the hobgoblin of tidy minds-and of course he would be right--but he should extend to others the same latitude that he would no doubt claim for himself. I want to say that I believe Minister Vanstone has been a great reforming minister. The changes she has brought to labour market assistance and to the Commonwealth Employstand- ment Service are the biggest changes in 50 years. They will ensure that our labour market services are geared precisely to what must be their goal: to get people jobs and not shuftle them through the unemployment queues. On higher education, Minister Vanstone has presided over the biggest changes in at least a decade. At the same time, what she has done in higher education has not been revolutionary so much as it has accelerated an evolution that was already there. She took the former government's HECS system and refined it. She took the former government's acceptance of up-front fees and expanded the freedom of choice. She took the diversified funding that the Labor Party introduced and built upon that. The minister has done an excellent job which has built upon some of the strengths that were left to her by the former regime. I think it is appropriate to leave tonight's debate with some challenges for the Australian Labor Party. The member for Werriwa and others have been throwing down the gauntlet to the government and it is only right and fair that we should return the compliment. In another speech, the member for Werriwa said: . . . the ""next generation of Labor reforms""that is when people like the member for Holt, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), have been shuffled off to the United Nations or shunted aside by the members for Melbourne and Werriwawould also see the removal of the worse features ""primitive Vanstonism""Mr Gareth Evans-Are you going to talk for the entire time? I was told I would be on in two minutes.",97
200,Mr ABBOTT,PAIRS,"You are learning something from this, Gareth, and I can see you are enjoying it: ... the ""next generation of Labor reforms"" would also see the removal of the worse features of ""primitive Vanstonism"" from the university sector. I pose these questions to the member for Werriwa and to his boss, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. Is the member for Werriwa and is the Labor Party-if it ever gets back into government-going to abolish the $26 million restructuring and rationalisation fund? Is the member for Werriwa-if he ever gets to be minister for education-going to expel domestic fee-paying students from our universities? Is the member for Werriwa-if he ever gets to sit in a ministerial chair-going to immediately restore the $800 million to universities that he thinks the government has ripped off? Does the shadow treasurer have $800 million to give to the member for Werriwa to restore the cuts that the member for Werriwa keeps going on and on about? Because if the member for Werriwa is not able to do this, he is exposed as a con man: someone who says one thing in opposition and then does something completely different in government. There is one final point: some of the statements made by members opposite have helped to stoke the fires of anarchy which have flared up recently on a number of Australian campuses. The University of Sydney had its administration block invaded by a number of people-most of whom were not studentswho smashed their way in and caused thousands of dollars worth of damage. The same thing has happened at a number of other universities, including Macquarie University and the University of Technology, Sydney . The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Technology, Professor Tony Blake, said that those individuals were from external organisations. He said: It is clear that the occupation of US Administration was carefully planned and involved a small of number of US students and individuals and organisations with an agenda much broader than matters concerning US and its students. He said: During the actual occupation, the protesters sought to maintain their numbers by inviting sympathetic individuals to join them. At various times the group included infants, young children, high school students and some homeless people. There was clear evidence of drug use including the use of hypodermics. When the invasion at the University of Technology, Sydney, took place, thousands of dollars worth of damage was done and records were tampered with. This kind of thing has got to be condemned and discouraged. Unfortunately, the sorts of statements coming from members opposite can do nothing but inflame this kind of activity. I challenge the member for Werriwa and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: will they condemn this kind of activity? Because unless they will, they have no credibility whatsoever on any higher education issue. (Time expired) Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative.

201,Mr GARETH EVANS,SMALL SUPERANNUATION,"The opposition has no in-principle objection to the Small Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill, but we do have some concerns about it, which I will spell out in a little while, and which will lead us to support the reference of the bill to an appropriate committee in the Senate for consideration of those issues, report back and further consideration by us and, I hope, by the government, of some of its implications. The bill deals with a significant issue, namely, the rules governing the early release of amounts within the superannuation system. I begin by explaining the background. A major impact of the superannuation guarantee scheme has been the creation of a large number of small balance accounts as people have entered the superannuation system for the first time. The superannuation guarantee system is a .major achievement of the previous Labor government, one of which we are very proud. It will be shown over time to have been one of the great reforms in Australian history:simultaneously delivering financial secunty and improved standards of living in retirement and building a huge pool of funds for Australia's future development. Of course, by definition, all super accounts start at zero and do have a low balance inevitably for some time. For those with a secure job and a regular, reasonable wage that balance increases over time as contributions mount and compound returns start to accrue. The scheduled growth of the superannuation guarantee charge from six per cent today to nine per cent in the year 2002 will again mean that those balances will increase even faster in future years. That said, for a whole variety of reasons, some super accounts do not increase and, in the past, have actually decreased over time as a result of fees and charges. Many part-time and casual workers, predominantly women, receive relatively low wages and therefore receive low super guarantee contributions. These employees are the groups most at risk of having their benefits significantly affected by fees and charges. Recognising the need to protect small super amounts from erosion, we in government required super funds to ensure that those administrative fees and charges could be no greater than the return earned for accounts with a balance of less than $1,000. We also recognised that some super funds might not accept the requirement to protect small amounts, and therefore complemented the small amounts member protection rules by establishing the superannuation holding accounts reserve-SHAR-through the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995. SHAR is a superannuation collection mechanism administered by the Australian Taxation Office, to which employers who are unable to find a suitable member protected fund may contribute on behalf of their employees. It is a low cost vehicle for accumulating small super guarantee contributions until a request to transfer moneys to a superannuation fund is received from the employee. The amendments contained in this bill propose to implement three of the government's 1997-98 budget superannuation measures. These concern the tightening of the circumstances under which the early release of super benefits are to be allowed from 1 July 1997. But the bill applies only to the SHAR. The legislation dealing with superannuation funds at large is still to come and we are awaiting it. nuation funds at large is still to come and we are awaiting it. Currently, the rules for the early release of superannuation moneys from SHAR-the superannuation holding accounts reserveprovide that the balance of a person's account may be withdrawn if the balance is less than $500 and the person has ceased to be employed by all the depositors; the person is in severe financial hardship; the person has retired because of permanent disability; the person has turned 65, or the person is not an Australian resident and is not employed in Australia. Specifically, the amendments in this bill are designed to remove access to amounts in SHAR of less than $500; restrict the access of non-Australian residents to funds in SHAR except where the individual has reached preservation age, which is currently 55; replace the current severe financial hardship test for access to funds in SHAR with a new test-this test being that an individual must have been in receipt of specified Commonwealth income support payments for a continuous period of 52 weeks or, if over the age of 55, a cumulative amount of 39 weeks after that age. Even though the announcement is couched in terms of a commencement date of 1 July 1997, I should note that the proposal does grandfather all requests which were provided to the commissioner prior to that date. Those requests will apparently be considered under the old rules. The opposition position on all of this can be described as follows. We recognise the need to prevent unnecessary leakages from the superannuation system, so we do not oppose the legislation in principle and we certainly will not be doing so now in this House. But we do have some concerns about the impact that these amendments may have, particularly on people who are genuinely experiencing financial hardship and who may not be able to access their super funds when needed as a consequence of this new, more rigorous test. I should say more generally that, despite the government's rhetoric about the healthy state of our economy, the recent jump in the unemployment rate to 8.8 per cent, the loss of more than 40,000 jobs in one month and the reality that we are losing jobs at the rate of 3,000 to 4,000 a month-as we need to create them at the rate of at least 15,000 a month if we are to even keep pace with present needs to maintain the rate even at its present levelall highlight the fact that many Australians are facing unemployment and of course that unemployment is without question the major cause of financial hardship for Australians at the moment. Access to super in times of severe financial hardship may be the only way that Australian families are able to make ends meet. We are concerned, as a result, about the impact the government's amendments to the severe financial hardship test proposed in this legislation might have on Australians experiencing economic difficulties. Under the current test, individuals experiencing hardship can apply to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission for early release of their benefits. If the commissioner determines in writing that an applicant is in genuine severe financial hardship, the funds can be accessed and those applications are looked at and approved on a case by case basis. While we recognise that an objective test of financial hardship is needed to prevent rorting of the system, we are concerned that the arrangements proposed may not allow, as I have indicated already, people who experience genuine severe financial hardship to get adequate access to their super savingsperhaps when that hardship is caused, as it so often is, as a result of retrenchment or redundancy. People suffering financial difficulties still have families to feed, mortgage payments to make and, increasingly, education costs to meet-as people tend to have young families even at those ages. Imposing a test linked to the number of weeks a person has been receiving social security benefits or pensions, service pensions or income support supplements may, in practice, have too severe an impact on families. A situation might arise where a oneincome family may lose that income due to retrenchment or redundancy and, although qualifying for an income support payment, will still not be able to meet its ongoing financial commitments such as mortgage repayments. Should families have to default on home loans due to an inflexible severe financial hardship test and consequently risk losing their home? So our situation in a nutshell can be, I think, described as follows. We do recognise the need to prevent leakages from the super system. We will not be opposing this legislation in principle but, equally in that context, we recognise the importance of building up a nest egg for retirement. Indeed, it was us, as I have indicated at the outset, that introduced the whole universal super guarantee system to allow all employees to have a nest egglegislation that, I hope people remember, was bitterly opposed by the coalition. The government's approach to achieving adequate retirement incomes for all Australians does have these contradictory elements. On the one hand, there is a proposal to prevent access to very small super amounts of less than $500 to increase private savings. On the other hand, in the same budget the government is proposing a much greater loss to national savings by introducing so-called 'opting out' for a person earning less than $900 and, of course-most significantly of all-by not delivering on the government cocontribution that was promised not only by us but by this government in the 1996-97 budget. These two initiatives alone will lead to massively reduced levels of saving for retirement-much greater reductions than the sums it is attempting to prevent leaking from the superannuation system with the measures proposed in this legislation and the further expected general hardship measures which are yet to come. The government really only applies the concept of choice when it suits it. We would like a little bit more systematic attention to the implications of that for individuals, particularly those in need. The implications of this legislation are significant, not only because this legislation is important for all current and future members of SHAR but because at a later date the government will be introducing more general legislation to establish principles for the entire super sector. To the extent that we are establishing a precedent for that more general legislation today, that adds again to the significance of what is before us now. So for all these reasons, and I hope I have explained our position clearly enough, we will-while not opposing the legislation right now and while supporting the general objectives of it in principle-nonetheless be referring it to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for comprehensive analysis and full hearings as to its implications, particularly for low and middle income earners. Our final response to this legislation will depend upon the evidence presented there and the conclusions we reach as a result of that.",99
202,Mr WAKELIN,SMALL SUPERANNUATION,"I will speak briefly on the Small Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill 1997. As the previous speaker, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), summarised, it is a housekeeping matter in terms of the amendments that are made to the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 with regard to the early release of money held in the superannuation holding accounts reserve, otherwise known as SHAR. The amendments are in line with budget measures of 1997-98, reforming arrangements for the early release of super benefits to members. These reforms will be applied to savings in super funds and RSAs-that is, retirement savings accounts-and will be implemented through the amendment of the superannuation industry supervision regulations and the retirement savings account regulations. To ensure complete coverage, the government has extended the reforms to the superannuation holding accounts reserve. SHAR, the superannuation holding accounts reserve, was established to accept super contributions from employers in circumstances where the employer's super fund is not able to accept such small levels of contributions. SHAR is administered by the Commissioner of Taxation. At present, SHAR only permits contributions to be accessed by individual members when the balance is less than $500 and the individual has ceased to be employed by all depositors; the individual is in severe financial hardship; the individual has retired due to a permanent disability; the individual has turned 65; or the individual is not an Australian resident and is no longer employed in Australia. The government's reforms restrict the circumstances when moneys can be withdrawn. The $500 threshold will be abolished. The severe hardship test will be replaced by an objective test of hardship based on Commonwealth payments. SHAR will be able to release moneys to a non-resident only after that person reaches the preservation age. These amendments will take effect on 1 July 1997 but will not apply to withdrawal requests lodged with the Commissioner of Taxation before that date. That is a summary. On the retirement savings account issue itself, which is an ancillary component of this legislation, I make the general comment that it was with great angst that many people with small superannuation accounts-particularly in the pastoral industry, shearing industry and a range of the casual work force around regional Australia-saw these small amounts eroded over the years by the fees and by the administration costs. So it was a great step forward by the government to propose such a reform. I know that many people are appreciative of the fact that lower income earners and those on casual wages were able to at least see these amounts build up into something which was worthwhile. What was better was that it was not just wasted in fees and just dissipated into nothing. I think also women, who are very much a part of the casual work force, were greatly advantaged by that step forward, by that reform. It is with pleasure that I support this Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill 1997. I look forward to its passage through the other place.",101
203,Mr ROCHER,SMALL SUPERANNUATION,"The Small Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill 1997 is one of the less contentious pieces of superannuation legislation we have debated in this place in recent times. These proposals seek to alter the principal act in three ways. In the words of one of Perth's leading actuaries, the bill is 'simply bringing the superannuation holding accounts reserve, SHAR, into line with other superannuation funds in terms of when people can access their superannuation moneys'. That is good policy. But this bill is yet another in a constant stream of legislative changes which are ensuring that our superannuation legislation is becoming as complex and as unmanageable as the tax acts. When I joined the debate on the superannuation surcharge earlier this year, I noted that since July 1994 there has been a legislative change or Insurance and Superannuation Commission release affecting the operation of superannuation funds, on average, every 6.5 days. Notwithstanding other legislation that may be introduced into the House before the next budget, the 1997-98 budget outlines a further seven changes to legislation in the pending financial year. It is little wonder then that Mr Don Mercer. the Chief Executive Officer of the ANZ Bank, described the industry as 'muddled' earlier this month. He said: I'm hoping and hoping that one of these days someone's going to do for superannuation what Wallis has done for the financial system. Mr Mercer may be hoping for some time. After four years, millions of dollars and countless man-hours, the tax law improvement project is yet to yield any real advancement in the simplification of our tax legislation. That does not auger well for a clarification of the superannuation codes. At present there are five instances in which an account holder can access funds held in SHAR. The government is seeking to restrict this access by preventing an individual from withdrawing funds simply because the balance is $500 or less. Also, individuals will no Small longer be able to draw on their funds in SHAR simply because they are not an Australian resident, unless they are of preservation age. The third change will see a new severe financial hardship clause incorporated. The introduction of award superannuation and the superannuation guarantee scheme, the SGS, were the catalyst for a steady increase in the number of small superannuation accounts in Australia throughout the 1990s so far. The union movement applauded their genesis, asserting that the SGS and award superannuation schemes would ensure that every employee and employer would have access to a member protected superannuation fund. However, the fact that the SGS legislati.on compelled employers to contribute to a recognised fund on behalf of any employee earning just $449 each month meant that many part-time workers and those who were employed for only a short period became the owners of a superannuation account that housed a very small sum of money. A further complicating factor in the management of these small accounts has been the increase in casual employment in Australia. By and large, employers prefer to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees into a single fund. Most are reluctant to make payments to a fund previously utilised by a worker because of the increased expense and complexity it involves. Consequently, many casual and part-time workers now have multiple and unrelated superannuation accounts with small balances. For as long as the public and private sectors continue to demand a more flexible, mobile or casual work force and for as long as our student population, which adds substantially to the casual work force, continues to increase, this situation will proliferate. While the concept of superannuation is widely regarded as being a valuable tool for fostering national savings and for providing a retirement income stream for more Australians, small superannuation accounts are often simply not effective. Once entry and exit insurance fees, administrative fees and the on contributions are accounted for, there is usually very little left in these smaller accounts, and what is left evaporates pretty quickly. The superannuation holding accounts reserve became operative under the former Labor administration on 1 July 1995. It was an attempt to deal with the problem. It was originally established to collect superannuation payments on behalf of individuals who contributed less than $1,200 to superannuation for each term of employment. Contributions to SHAR have allowed employers to meet their superannuation guarantee obligations without making payments to recognised superannuation funds on behalf of their employees. The superannuation holding accounts were, and continue to be, administered by the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, which recognises these employer payments as superannuation contributions nevertheless. Some tax experts are concerned by 1 section 14 in this bill, which will see removal of the $500 threshold on SHAR accounts. Those experts argue that the maintenance of accounts of $500 or less is costly to the fund manager and unfair to fund members, who often see their account balance swallowed up by fees. They argue that the government should consider raising the threshold to something like $1,000. This is almost certainly true of recognised superannuation funds, and it is supported by the findings of several independent studies. But this bill will not have any impact on recognised superannuation funds. Business and Investment, in its March 1995 edition, reported that the average industry superannuation fund costs $1 per account per week to run, while each account of a typical large fund costs $1.56 to operate. In the same year, a Senate select committee found that: Where the account balance is less than about $750, the net (after tax) annual earnings are likely to be less than the administrative fees and charges, as well as any death and disability insurance premiums applied against the account. The Senate select committee confirmed that fees, this problem was compounded when fund tax investment returns are low. However, it is important to remember that the SHAR account trust fund was always intended to be a 'low cost vehicle' for the collection of small superannuation contributions. SHAR is not a superannuation fund and its accounts have not been subjected to the same prudential standards as have the accounts of recognised funds. SHAR accounts have been, and will remain, shielded from many of the costs involved with maintaining a superannuation account. The original Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995 put the onus on the ATO to advise an individual when their SHAR account exceeded $1,200 and to request that the money be transferred into a recognised superannuation fund. This legislation will not alter that arrangement. Individuals who have a SHAR account of less than $ 1,200 will continue to be immune to the litany of costs involved with managing a superannuation account. In the case where this figure of $ 1,200 is exceeded, individuals should be encouraged to transfer the proceeds into a superannuation account that will see them earn greater returns on their investment. If the government's decision to abolish the $500 threshold results in a greater number of SHAR accounts reaching maturity and being transferred into a complying superannuation fund, then goodoh-it will compel people to become more accountable for providing for themselves in retirement, and should be supported by all. Individuals will continue to have acce-s to their SHAR account if they can prove they are facing severe financial hardship, but the criteria will be modified under 1 section 14 of this proposed legislation. It is intended that Australians who are not yet of preservation age-that is, below the age of 55-will have to provide evidence that they have been in receipt of particular Commonwealth income support payments for a continuous period of 52 weeks before their request to access their SHAR account will be considered. Those who are older than preservation age will have to demonstrate that they have been in receipt of income support for a minimum of 39 weeks, or two or more periods that add up to at least 39 weeks. The explanatory memorandum accompanying this bill states that the new criteria an objective test. The clear implication there is that the government regards current practices as not necessarily impartial. If indeed that is the case, then the new method for determining financial hardship is entirely supportable. One of the measures of good tax policy is equity. Although SHAR accounts are technically not superannuation accounts, their sole purpose has been to facilitate an increase in the level of retirement savings. It is likely that some individuals will find it harder to access their SHAR funds as a result of these measures. However, as one Perth actuary has indicated, this provision 'simply tightens up some of the looser conditions of the parent legislation'. If the government is aiming for symmetry between SHAR and superannuation funds, then this is an even-handed approach. If the amendment prevents the erosion of income, as it should, then it is also supportable on that score. The final change proposed by the coalition in the bill, 3 section 14, relates to foreign residents in Australia. This amendment has proven to be more problematic than the changes I have already touched on; one tax expert in Western Australia has gone so far as to label it as outrageous. Non-residents presently are allowed to access their SHAR fund regardless of their age. This legislation proposes to prevent them from doing so until they reach preservation age. It is true that this will bring SHAR accounts into alignment with recognised superannuation funds. But this amendment will pose serious hurdles for the many firms who employ nonresidents working in Australia. With the increasing globalisation of resources, including human resources, a greater number of employees are now required to travel and work abroad. It does not appear to be fair that, before heading back to their home country, these workers, who may only work in Australia for a short period of time, will not be able to access their superannuation contributions and the contributions they make while in Australia. Employees will end up in the unenviable position of having to keep tabs not only on multiple retirement funds but on funds that will be are scattered throughout more than one country on occasions. This amendment is also likely to create huge administrative difficulties within the ATO. As I have already indicated, the Commissioner of Taxation has a judicial obligation to inform shareholders of a SHAR account if their funds exceed the $1,200 threshold on an annual basis. Can you imagine the logistical nightmare that will result if the commissioner has to track down individuals who once worked in Australia but have since returned to their country of origin to advise them of the status of their SHAR account? It will be absurd. If this clause is enacted without change, the government will have to consider negotiating some form of reciprocal arrangement with other governments to allow for the transfer of funds from SHAR into a recognised superannuation account in an employee's home country. I will be interested to hear whether the government has any response to that particular concern. There was a very real need nuation holding account reserve when it was introduced by the former Labor government in July 1995. Many low income earners and casual workers who were unable to take full advantage of the benefits of superannuation were finally given the opportunity to make some contribution towards their retirement. However, with the enactment of the retirement savings account legislation earlier this year, SHAR no longer has the same relevance in the push for increasing national savings. The 1997-98 budget papers indicate that the government eventually expects SHAR to shut up shop. However, it makes no mention of a definite time frame-or even a rough one for that matter-of when this is likely to occur. The coalition stated in budget paper No. 2 that SHAR 'has not been able to payout any moneys in excess of contributions due to high administration costs'. Why then is the ATO not committed to encouraging the transfer of funds from SHAR into retirement savings accounts as of I July 1997? The immediate transfer of funds would benefit account holders in the form of increased returns and will bring about substantial savings to the taxpayer. The government's suggestion that the A TO will continue to administer the SHAR in the short term is simply not good enough. Interestingly, the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum suggests that this bill will have a negligible impact on the budget bottom line. Yet the 1997-98 budget papers tell a very different story. Page 145 of budget paper No.2 indicates that the phasing out of SHAR will bring about an estimated saving of almost $25 million over four years. I simply say to the minister responsible and those responsible to him for preparing explanatory memoranda and financial impact statements that, if they cannot get cases. it right and cannot include information which is plainly there in the budget papers, they have a great deal to be worried about in my opinion. It seems rather cavalier to me to dismiss $25 million in savings as a negligible financial impact. What is the point of providing an explanatory memorandum if the information presented in it fails to provide all the for the superan- relevant details? Retirement savings accounts are intended to provide a low cost alternative to individuals who are not likely to benefit in full from superannuation. RSAs will be portable and will remain with their owners regardless of for whom or when they work. As with SHAR, holders of retirement savings accounts will be encouraged to roll their savings over into a recognised superannuation fund once the balance exceeds a specified amount. The introduction of retirement savings accounts and the tightening up of the provisions in the small superannuation accounts are consistent with the government's commitment to increasing the number of people taking full responsibility for their own retirement. As I have said in this place on many occasions, it is both reasonable and fair to expect people to remain as financially independent as they can for as long as possible. With the exception of the one matter to which I have referred and about which I have some reservations, this bill brings the superannuation holdings account reserve more into line with recognised superannuation funds and, as such, deserves the support of the House.",102
204,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SMALL SUPERANNUATION,"in reply-In concluding the debate, I want to thank honourable members for their contributions to the bill. The measures aim to tighten and streamline arrangements for the early release of superannuation benefits. In doing so, the new arrangements will promote the fundamental retirement income purposes of superannuation without compromising the need for early release in genuinely deserving I note that the oppOSitIOn gives general support to this legislation, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) raised a question in his address to the House. In relation to his query, the government considers that the new rules are fairer as there will be guidelines to ensure that people in similar circumstances will be treated alike. His concern was in relation to the new tests and in relation to financial hardship. His concern was that the new test was too harsh. There will still be scope for people to access their superannuation benefits on compassionate grounds which will include preventing foreclosure by a mortgagee over a family home. In relation to the queries by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the new rules for the release will improve conditions for negotiating reciprocal social security arrangements with some countries. His concern was in relation to those people who were temporary residents in our nation. The new test will also significantly reduce the scope for circumventing the early release arrangements by individuals who leave the country and then resume residence not long after obtaining their benefits. I hope those two explanations help the member for Curtin and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I thank members for their general support of the bill. I also thank all those who have made a contribution to this bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

205,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Bringing Them Home  p.m.)-I am proud to read into the record of this parliament some excerpts from this most important report entitled Bringing them home which has been brought before the parliament. The second paragraph on page 184 states: Unresolved trauma and grief has its own severe consequences. There is an association between bereavement in childhood and later psychiatric disorder ... The circumstances and consequences of bereavement render the child vulnerable to stresses, perhaps damaging the child's self-esteem and self-efficacy and often resulting in depression in adolescence and adulthood. The bereavement experienced by many forcibly removed Indigenous children was traumatic and later they were often told they had been rejected or that family members were dead (typically neither was true). They could be punished for expressions of attachment or grief. The next paragraph states: I remember when my sister come down and visited me and I was reaching out. There was no-one there. I was just reaching out and I could see her standing there and I couldn't tell her that I'd been raped. And I never told anyone for years and years. And I've had this all inside me for years and years and years. I've been sexually abused, harassed, and then finally raped y'know, and I've never had anyone to talk about it ... nobody, no father, no mother, noone. We had no-one to guide us. I felt so isolated, alienated. And I just had no-one. That's why I hit the booze. None of that family bonding, nurturing-nothing. We had nothing. Confidential evidence 248, South Australia: a woman removed as a baby in the 1940s to Colebrook; raped at 15 years in a work placement organised by Colebrook. At the bottom of page 184 it states: There's still a lot of unsolved issues within me. One of the biggest ones is I cannot really love anyone no more. I'm sick of being hurt. Every time. I used to get close to anyone they were just taken away from me. The other fact is, if I did meet someone, I don't want to have children, cos I'm frightened the welfare system would come back and take my children. Confidential evidence 528, New South Wales: man removed at 8 years in the 1970s; suffered sexual abuse in hoth the orphanage and foster homes organised hy the church.

Confidential evidence 379, South Australia: woman fostered at 9 years in the 1970s. It goes on to state on that page: I've always been sorta on the outerside of things. I've always had my guard up, always been suspicious and things like that, I guess. Confidential evidence 168, South Australia: man removed to a boys' home at 6 years in the 1950s. Further on page 185 it states: The youngest member of our family, Jill, was perhaps more traumatised through all this process because she grew up from the age of 9 months being institutionalised the whole time. She actually had some major trauma illnesses and trauma manifestations of institutional life evident in her life and yet nobody new the root of it, or the cause of it, let alone knew the remedy to it. [The cottage mother] used a lot of mental cruelty on Jill-I mean, through cutting all of her hair off at one time to exert authority and to bring submission and fear into you ... making the kids look ugly and dress like boys. She did that to the younger childrenwell Jill in particular because she was younger and more impressionable. Jill died because of those policies in law. She committed suicide. She was 34 and death was the better thing. Turning to page 240, it states: It was a shock to find out my father wasn't Aboriginal. I didn't like it at all. It didn't seem right ... I thought it was the same father that we'd all have as well. It makes me angry, very angry. If I met him, I don't think I could be very nice to him.

Bowen, Queensland",106
206,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to talk about the difficulties in the town of Bowen, which is situated in the seat of Dawson. The town has experienced a steady loss of employment as the horticulture industry has contracted from over 100 farms some years ago to less than 20 farms now. Over 100 jobs have been lost in the railways in the last few years under the state Labor Goss government. The level of unemployment in the town, which has a total population of 8,522, as at December 1996 was 951. This will obviously climb now that the Borthwicks Abattoir in the town has permanently closed and there has been a loss of approximately 380 full-time positions. There is a high dependency on social security in the town which is a reflection of the very depressed economic circumstances. There are 2,054 people on pensions in the town of Bowen. On 14 May, I wrote to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, requesting that Bowen be included in the depressed regions program. This is a very worthy program, implemented in the last budget, which looks at regions which have suffered from major retrenchment activity and heavy loss of employment. Regrettably, the town of Bowen fulfils this requirement. I am looking forward to receiving a response from the minister when the guidelines for this program have been drawn up. I have also approached the Institutional Investor Information Service in order to find other avenues for regenerating the town of Bowen. This is a recent initiative between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments designed to link investors with regional investment opportunities. There is the establishment of a register of investor ready infrastructure projects. I believe that some of these available projects will be appropriate for Bowen to pursue with investors. Ideally, if there are projects suitable for the town, the local community, shire council and Regional Development Bureau will have the opportunity to highlight Bowen's attractions to potential investors. The purpose of the IllS is to promote sustainable regional economic growth through higher levels of investment activity and facilitate greater private investment in economic and social infrastructure. The IllS is predominantly an initiative of the state Minister for Investment and Economics, the Hon. Doug Slack. All of the projects listed on the register have to be assessed by an independent financial analyst and verified as commercially viable before lodgement. The types of projects that appear on the register include transport and communications facilities, social infrastructure, manufacturing plants, production and transmission facilities for electricity, gas and water as well as tourist and environmental facilities. There will be other opportunities for Bowen in July when Senator Parer, the Minister for Resources and Energy, is planning to visit the seat of Dawson for four days. I am very hopeful that he will visit the town of Bowen and look at some of the opportunities for investment and development there. One of those that we have looked at recently-and we spent a day with the mayor and other leaders of the community in Bowen-involves the Elliot River channel, which would take part of the Burdekin River irrigation scheme and channel it down through Giru and Gumlu to the town of Bowen. The water from this would open up over 19,000 hectares of farmland to grow sugar cane and various horticultural crops. As well as that we are looking at opportunities for Urannah Dam, which could potentially open 22 mines in the Collinsville area and create more than 6,096 sustainable full-time jobs. I have written to Howard Hobbs, the Minister for Natural Resources in the state government, and asked him to look at the Elliot River channel proposal particularly as a priority without having to wait for the 18month Burdekin catchment analysis. Certainly these are a number of the options that are being explored by the shire council, the development bureau and myself to increase investment and job opportunities in the town of Bowen.

Quoted by Link-Up submission 186 on page 21. Professor Beverley Raphael told the Inquiry, Part of the reaction to being traumatised, like suddenly having your child torn away from you, is what we call a high level of arousal ... that heightened arousal can stay on a heightened level with physiological responsiveness for the rest of one's life ... so that people are aroused, alert. And one reason they take alcohol and other substances is often to dampen this down and they don't know its cause. (evidence 658). A further story to relate: My parents were continually trying to get us back. Eventually they gave up and started drinking. They separated. My father ended up in gaol. He died before my mother. On her death bed she called his name and all us kids. She died with a broken heart. Confidential submission 106, New South Wales: woman removed at 11 months in the late I950s with her three siblings; children fostered in two separate non-Indigenous families. I tum briefly to page 215. An explanation that I think is worth putting on the record states: Because 'mixed race' children were particularly targeted for forcible removal, non-Indigenous parents and families also lost children. The following evidence was given in that regard: In some circumstances the non-Aboriginal parent actually believed that they could have done something to stop what happened. In some experiences that I'm aware of, that has led to long-term ill health of that non-Aboriginal parent. In some circumstances it has led to breakdown in those relationships [between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal parent] ... But how do you tell your father that it's okay; that it wasn't their fault; and that his whiteness and maleness in a patriarchal society that should have been enough to protect any person's family did no good because of the nature of the relationship with his partner? (Joanne Selfe, NSW Aboriginal Women's Legal Resource Centre, evidence 739). On a personal note, I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) on national television a couple of weeks ago make the comment that everyone in the country should have access to this report and everyone in the country should be encouraged to read it. As we know, and as has been discussed in this place, there was a slight difficulty in getting hold of the report at point but a subsequent reprint was carried out. When I knew that that reprint had been done I went to the government information bookshop in Canberra and purchased two copies. I also got access to one additional copy through our members' free issue. I took the opportunity of presenting those three copies of that report to the local libraries in my electorate yesterday morning. Can I tell members in this House of the absolute joy that they were received with by library staff? In one library they had had, up until that time, one copy that had been going out on overnight loan. As we can all imagine here having seen this report, it is impossible to read it overnight. I encourage other members to consider undertaking a similar action in the hope that more people in the community can access this report. United Hospital Auxiliaries",108
208,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to talk about communities-not in the narrow sense of the word which has become popular in Australia, not communities defined by ethnicity, by lifestyle, political or religious orientation, but all-embracing communities, groups of people who give their time and work to community causes which benefit all members of society alike. What prompts these thoughts is a visit I made to the United Hospital Auxiliaries Illawarra conference last month, in the town of Berry, in my electorate of Gilmore. The Berry branch of the UHA is one of many such branches scattered across New South Wales. This non-profit organisation was officially established in 1933 to raise funds for hospitals to give both longand short-term patients a better environment and better facilities. The Illawarra region of the UHA, with its membership of 377 people, has done more than its fair share of revenue raising for hospitals throughout the region. Since 1926 the organisation has given a total of 494 years of service-in other words, the equivalent of 500 years of time-to various activities, with a particular focus on raising funds. In dollar terms, the UHA' s 1997 financial statement for some my area says a great deal about the commitment of people working for such worthy causes. The Milton-Ulladulla branch raised over $45,000; Greenwell Point, $19,000; Nowra, $31,000; Kiama, $19,000; and the branch I visited last month, Berry, raised over $31,000, with much of the money raised going to assist the Berry hospital. The reason why I wish to talk about a sense of community is that none of the UHA members do it because they have to. There are no profits to be made and there is no real gain to be obtained other than the joy of doing something for those in need. This is the type of dedication and generosity I come across time and time again in my electorate. Only a few weeks ago I was given the honour of addressing the changeover dinner at the Bomaderry Lions Club. The committed members of this organisation have raised enough money for a young boy to travel overseas in the hope of finding a medical solution to alleviate the suffering caused by a rare illness. Again, this is a group of people whose endeavours will never be front-page news, but whose actions are, in my view, heroic. The work of our local UHAs is of great community importance. Their funds help to pay for wheelchairs, thermometers, phones, scales, therapy equipment, showers, lockers, robes, heart monitors-everything and anything that is needed in hospitals. The UHAs go about their important tasks in a discreet, unassuming way. They hold raffles, luncheons, dinners, t-shirt sales, sewing sales, sausage sizzles, trivia nights-anything at all that will help raise funds to support the important work done in hospitals. These are people who work tirelessly to bring about a sense of community, a sense of human beings caring for one another. I mention this for no other reason than to acknowledge the efforts of those who at this moment are working hard to benefit others. These people hold values of decency and kindness that, in spite of everything, are still alive and well in my electorate of Gilmore. They are people like the Alzheimer's Support Group in my electorate, who for many years now have been extremely active in caring for those affected by this devastating disease. Again, this is a community organisation, run by people who are motivated by generosity alone. They are people who through regular meetings promote a better understanding of Alzheimers and dementia, and offer assistance to those whose loved ones are affected by such debilitating illnesses and who provide a support group for those coping with the trauma and grief of losing loved ones to this condition. These are organisations that deserve the support of a caring government. I am pleased to be able to say that the Alzheimer's Association has recently received a federal government grant in recognition of respite for carers and under our aged care policy there will be an extra 30 per cent funding for each and every dementia sufferer. This government has recognised that more had to be done-something the previous government failed to support. However, such assistance really tells only part of the story community organisations. The most important feature of these groups is that they exist as part of a community, part of a wider commitment to the welfare of the people of their towns or regions and, in particular, Gilmore. While always advocating the implementation of government policy that will make a real difference to those in need, I am also of the opinion that we must never lose sight of community based initiatives, of volunteers who work simply to do good, and not because they are receiving government wages. My support for a well-run work for the dole scheme is based on a belief that communities can work for a common goal and could do ;lOrc if given the chance. I personally have no objection whatsoever to the notion of young, energetic Australians working as part uf a broader community, to acquire important skills and to make a contribution to society. Indeed, many unemployed people in my electorate have expressed their willingness to be involved in such community based schemes. In fact, they would consider it a privilege to do so. My electorate understands that we must return to our values of giving as opposed to receiving, no matter how small the gift, be it in kind or spirit. The people of Gilmore have demonstrated through their work that service groups can bring society together. No matter the beliefs and values that may divide us, a sense of community service will always win out. Bringing Them Home",109
209,Mr HATTON,ADJOURNMENT,"Blaxland) (10.50 p.m.)Tonight I wish to detail some of the stories from Bringing them home, the government report detailing the effects of government policy in the past on Aboriginal families and the stolen children. I will start at page 246 with two insights from evidence given to that inquiry. The first is confidential evidence No. 332 from Queensland. This reflects a child's natural approach to their parents and to their memories of the past: We all adored our mother. She was petite, with long black hair down to her waist. Her skin was soft and chocolate in colour, her big brown velvet eyes were always full of love for all her children. of She was a very outgoing caring woman, extremely clean in her home and she kept herself and all we children immaculate in appearance. She was always there for us, her arms wide to comfort us when we were unhappy. In confidential evidence No. 323 from Tasmania, the time when people are cut off from that parental memory and taken from their homes is nicely encapsulated: Even though at home you might be a bit poor, you mightn't have much on the table, but you know you had your parents that loved you. Then you're thrown into a place. It's like going to another planet. Having gone to another planet, having gone through a series of experiences from the positive to the entirely and extremely negative, as I have detailed from throughout the pages of this report-this reports concentrates on those that are most negative-one of the things that the report then goes on to deal with is the question of how and in what manner people should be reunited with their fami lies. It recommends that the reuniting should be done on the basis of counselling services being provided to people, because following the trauma of being taken away from their families many years ago there is also trauma associated with reuniting. In particular, this report outlines the fact that a number of cases came to light where there was no thought, no counselling and no hclp for the people who had been so disunited and who became, becausc of that, dysfunctional when they were actually thrown together with their parents. For some, it was a situation that provided great difficulty. I will quote from page 240, which sets out confidential evidence 203, Victoria. This evidence was from a youth who was 15 at the date of the incident, when he had his first meeting with his birth mother. The evidence reads: I was in one of the cottages (in a juvenile detention centre] and they called me up to the head office and they said, 'Your mother's gunna come and visit you this weekend'. And I said, 'Who?' and they said, 'Your mother'. I said, 'Oh yeah, yeah, me mum from Greensborough (foster mother],. They said, 'No-no, your real mother'. That just tossed me completely. I thought that she-(foster mother] was my real mother, you know, because 1 didn't know I was Koori then. I didn't know I was a blackfella. I just thought I was something different-you know, just dark-tanned or something. I didn't know. And the day came, you know, and she walked down-you know. I was at school and I seen them, you know-me mum and me stepfather. I seen them walking down and I've looked over and then they called me over, you know, and sat down, you know. talked I remember I freaked out a little bit. I didn't know what to say, what to do, you know. And I was hiding behind someone else. You know how when you're-kids are kids ... Because you don't know who it is and they say, 'Yeah, it's your mum'. How the hell do I know ... ? That sense of loss, having been heing confronted with his actual birth mother, who he had been Cut away from when he was taken away, and then, at the reuniting, not having counselling appropriate to his case, indicates that we need to put more effort into addressing that. Confidential evidence 529 outlines the case of a New South Wales woman who fosters a baby in the early 1970s. Having been rejected at 13 years and returned to her mother by welfare officers, rejection by her mother forced her onto the streets. The evidence reads: I was out of control. They (foster parents] wanted to get rid of me. So they packed us on a plane, and dumped us at our mother's place, which we'd never really known. And she never knew we were coming. We were just there and she didn't like us. She didn't talk to us for three days. There was just no connection there. Home never became a home. Vocational Education: One-stop Shop",110
210,Mr BARRESI,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to highlight an initiative of the coalition government which has significantly benefited young people in the Deakin electorate. Mr Speaker, I am cognisant of the fact that you, as the member for Casey, and I are beneficiaries of this initiative-an initiative which has been brought about by the hard working efforts by the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). Melbourne's eastern suburbs are the information technology centre of Australia. In fact, it is one of Australia's fastest growing regional areas. Deakin is a base for hundreds, if not thousands, of small to medium sized businesses. These organisations provide employment opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Australians. Despite the success and growth, it is fair to say that more can be done. I am glad to say that the coalition government is doing more. We are listening to the people of Deakin and working towards opportunities. The coalition is totally committed to maximising vocational education opportunities for young Australians. As I move around the electorate and across Australia with the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, a common complaint by kids and employers is the transition from school to work and the lack of vocational opportunities. A mind-set has emerged of 'university or bust'. This mind-set has enveloped our kids, parents and teachers. As a result of last year's budget, a one-stop apprenticeship shop has been established in the heart of Ringwood, servicing the entire eastern suburbs of Melbourne and, in particular, as you would know, Mr Speaker, the areas of the Yarra Valley, which are crucial to Melbourne's growth and which are experiencing high levels of youth unemployment. The shop is centrally located on the Maroondah Highway, close to public transticeships port, an Internet cafe and an ice skating rink. Since its opening by the minister, the facility has operated successfully, providing and real assistance to young people wanting to get the most out of life. So far, 400 emterritory ployers have been contacted, with 102 young people placed in apprenticeships and traineeships. As members would know, the coalition has Deakin. put into place new programs and funding to give young Australians the opportunities they deserve-not merry-go-round labour market programs on which the opposition and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) have a fixation. Last month's budget will area. provide $265 million for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships. funding is part of the $415 million for the new apprenticeship system. As an example of the successful work by the facility at Ringwood, the coalition's apprenticeship one-stop shop records, promotes and fills apprenticeship and training vacancies. It processes all approval and registration requirements for apprenticeships and traineeships. It monitors training arrangements, including back-up support where necessary and arranges off-the-job training. material, The work of the Ringwood location has been complemented by a second site in Mitcham. It will also be complemented by the jobs pathway program. I invite schools in my electorate-schools like Norwood, Ringwood, Forrest Hill, Heathmont, Blackburn, Mitcham, et cetera-to consider their involvement in such a program, to consider the rewards that are out there for the students and their lies. Facilities at the offices of Jobs East and Business East provide a convenient contact point for schools and businesses to discuss their training requirements. Australia now has a national vocational education system-a system that is more responsive to the training needs of young people and industry alike. It is now much easier and faster to create new apprenticeships and traineeships. This is especially important for the high-tech information technology Public industries based in Melbourne's east where new types of opportunities and new apprenwill be created. Due to the focus on outcomes, the process of creating new apprenticeships and traineeships can now occur over advice weeks instead of months. I congratulate the minister and the state and ministers for their achievements; in particular, my state colleague and Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, the Hon. Phil Honeywood, whose electorate is within The location of these facilities in the Deakin electorate is a recognition of the hard work and success of organisations like Jobs East, large businesses, educational organisations and group training companies in the It is an exciting initiative. It is just one example of the coalition's policies which are This benefiting the Deakin community.",111

(2) What steps is the Australian Government taking to ratify the Convention. Dr Kemp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The New South Wales Government reserved its position on ratification when the issue was considered by the Australian National Training Authority Ministerial Council on 23 May 1997. (2) The Australian Government sought advice from all State and Territory Ministers on ratification of the Convention at the meeting of the Australian National Training Authority Ministerial Council on 23 May 1997. It was agreed at that meeting not to ratify the Convention, with New South Wales reserving its position. Kirribilli House (Question No. 1229) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 February J997: (I) Did he state that Kirribilli House is supposed to be a residence not of the Prime Minister but for guests of the Commonwealth (Hansard, 15 October 1986, page 2012); if so, does he still hold that view; if not, why not. (2) Has he approached the Prime Minister to discuss the statement referred to in part (I); if not, why not; if so, what was the Prime Minister's response.

Department of Social Security: Office Closure and Abolition of Positions (Question No. 1488) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 18 March 1997: Have positions been abolished or offices closed in the Minister's Department since 2 March 1996; if so, is the Minister able to provide a detailed breakdown of (a) how many jobs and offices have been abolished or closed and (b) which localities are affected. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) During the period 2 March 1996 to 31 March 1997 staffing of the Department of Social Security increased from 19,781 to 20,676 (both full-time equivalents). However, for a variety of administrative reasons, 464 positions were abolished in this period. (b) Of the 464 positions that were abolished across the network during the period March 1996 through to March 1997, the majority occurred as a result of staff taking Voluntary Redundancy.

Legal System (Question No. 1566) Mrs Crosio asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 20 March 1997: (l) Have steps been taken to establish: (a) the Australian Legal Access Forum; (b) the Australian Legal Insurance Taskforce; (c) an Australia-wide jury education program; (d) the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime; and (e) the Human Rights Division of the Federal Court for determining disputes that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is unable to mediate or conciliate; if not, why not. (2) Was funding allocated for establishing the programs referred to in part (1) in the 1996-97 Budget; if not why not. (3) Will funds be allocated for establishing the programs referred to in part (1) in the 1997-98 Budget; if so, what sum. (4) How many times has each of the programs referred to in part (l) been mentioned by him in the House of Representatives since 2 March 1996. (5) Did the Government announce during the election of 1996 that it would give Australians a window on the law through the development of innovative software products that will be widely accessible through schools and libraries and legal centres; if so, what steps have been taken. (6) Was funding allocated for establishing the program referred to in part (5) in the 1996-96 Budget; if not, why not. (7) How many times has the program referred to in part (5) been mentioned by him in the House of Representatives since 2 March 1996. (8) Did the Government announce that it would legislate against the export of child pornography; if so, has action been taken; if not, why not. (9) Has the Government taken steps towards undertaking a statute stocktake program of repair of existing Commonwealth laws; if not, why not. (10) Has the Government taken steps towards providing support for, and fostering the growth of, restorative justice programs; if not, why not. (II ) Was funding allocated for establishing the programs referred to in part (l0) in the 1996-97 Budget; if not. why not. (12) How many times have the programs referred to in part (10) been mentioned by him in the House of Representatives since 2 March 1996. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) I am committed to the Australian Legal Access Forum and the Government is currently considering proposals by the Law Council of Australia on the scope and timing of such a forum. (b) I asked the Australian Legal Assistance Board (ALA B) to examine legal expenses insurance schemes in Australia and overseas. In its report, ALAB recognised the significant contribution of the schemes but considered funding and support of these schemes is more appropriately left with the private sector. I am currently considering ALAB's report. (c) An Australia-wide jury education program has not yet been established. (d) The National Campaign Against Violence and Crime (NCAV AC) was announced in the 1996/97 Budget and is being developed and implemented by the Office of Law Enforcement Coordination in my portfolio. The NCA V AC represents a strategic approach to crime prevention across Australia, and is being developed in close cooperation with the States and Territories, particularly through the Lead Ministers' National Anti-Crime Strategy Group and its supporting Officers Group. Extensive consultations have already taken place to develop a set of priorities and demonstration projects which will be implemented in partnership with the States and Territories. (e) After carefully considering this issue, and consulting with the Federal Court, I have decided that the establishment of a Human Rights Registry in the Federal Court, in conjunction with the use of judicial registrars, is a better option. Separate Divisions can impact adversely on management flexibility within the Court. It would also be difficult to justify the creation of a separate Division of the Court for human rights matters when there are no separate arrangements for other significant and much larger workload areas in the Court, such as trade practices and commercial work. Creation of a Human Rights Registry acknowledges the mainstream nature of human rights matters, yet enables the Court to develop user friendly procedures and separate listing arrangements to facilitate handling of human rights cases. The expected caseload means that, at this stage, registry facilities for human rights matters will be co-located with existing registry facilities. However, the Court advises that its registry staff will receiving appropriate training to deal with human rights cases. Consultations with the Court are underway about the introduction of special procedures and registry facilities for human rights cases. (2) (a) No funding was allocated in the 1996-97 budget for the Australian Legal Access Forum. I am still considering the views of the Law Council of Australia about the Forum proposals and will address potential funding needs when I have had the opportunity to consider these proposals further. (b) No funding was allocated in the 1996-97 budget for the Australian Legal Insurance Taskforce. I am still considering the views of the Australian Legal Assistance Board about the Taskforce proposals and will address potential funding needs when I have had the opportunity to consider these proposals further. (c) No funding was allocated in the 1996-97 budget to establish an Australia-wide jury education program. (d) The Government allocated $4.4m to the NCAVAC for 1996/97. (e) No funding was allocated in the 1996-97 budget for a Human Rights Division in the Federal Court. As there will be no new Division in the Court, and due to the expected caseload, existing court registry facilities will be used for human rights matters. (3) (a) No funding has been allocated in the 1997 -98 budget for the Australian Legal Access Forum. (b) No funding has been allocated in the 1997-9' budget for the Australian Legal Insurance Taskforce. (c) No funding has been allocated in the 1997-98 budget to establish an Australia-wide jury education program. (d) Approximately $4m will be allocated to the National Campaign Against Violence and Crime in 1997/98. (e) No funding has been allocated in the 1997-98 budget for a Human Rights Division in the Federal Court. (4) This information is available from the House of Representatives Hansards which can be examined via the Parliamentary Database Service. (5) Yes. A program entitled 'Window on the Law' was announced by the Government in the Law and Justice For Us All policy statement issued prior to the March 1996 election. The objectives of the program are as set out in the question. A number of steps have been taken to implement these objectives. First, all Commonwealth legislabe tion has been consolidated in electronic form. Second, that material (together with other Commonwealth caselaw and State and Territory legislation and caselaw from the Attorney-General's Department's SCALEplus system) has been made available free to air for all Australian schools, libraries and legal centres and the general public from an internet service operated by the Australian Government Publishing Service (AGPS). SCALEplus has been available from 1 January 1997 and statistics of use are showing wide acceptance with, typically, more than 4,000 daily 'hits' being recorded on this site. The formal launch of 'Window on the Law' is to be held in the near future. 'Window on the Law' will be an internet-based, free to air service which will provide Australians, schools, libraries and any organisations with internet access to: an overview of the legal system in Australia; and a gateway to SCALEplus, with access to Commonwealth legislation and other legal data. (6) 'Window on the Law' objectives are being achieved through a reprioritisation of recurrent funds within my Department. (7) This information is available from the House of Representatives Hansards which can be examined via the Parliamentary Database Service. (8) On 9 July 1996, the Government announced that it would legislate to prohibit the export of all refused classification materials, including child pornography, to ensure that export regulations are consistent with import regulations. The announcement followed the Government's pre-election commitment to legislate to prohibit the export of child pornography. Regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations prohibits the importation of a category of publications and other goods which is defined to include child pornography. This regulation is administered by the Attorney-General. The Minister Responsible for Customs, the Hon Geoff Prosser MP, is responsible for those provisions of the Customs Act which deal with prohibited exports. In consultation with the Attorney-General, the Minister Responsible for Customs is seeking amendment of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations to make those regulations mirror regulation 4A of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. The Australian Customs Service, in consultation with the Attomey-General's Department, has issued drafting instructions to the Office of Legislative Drafting within that Department in order to implement the necessary legislative changes. The draft regulations are at an advanced stage and are currently being settled by the relevant agencies. (9) The Government has commenced the statute stocktake. As stated in More Time for Business, the Government's response to the Small Business Deregulation Task Force, I have written to Ministers requesting that Departments advise the Office of Parliamentary Counsel of redundant Acts for repeal, and that Ministers set priorities for repair of existing legislation. These measures complement the Commonwealth's Legislation Review Schedule, the review of legislation costly to business or restricting competition, announced by the Treasurer on 28 June 1996. (10) The Government is awaiting the findings of research being conducted by Professor John Braithwaite at the ANU into the ACT Reintegrative Shaming Experiment (RISE project) being conducted in association with the Australian Federal Police. In addition, the Australasian Police Ministers' Council has been reviewing the range of such programs operating in different jurisdictions.

(2) If so, in which cities, suburbs, towns or regions are those jobs currently located. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. The Defence Efficiency Review identified 4,700 Australian Defence Force positions in administration and support areas to be saved. About half of these will be redirected to combat and combat support areas of the Australian Defence Force. In addition, a further 7,000 Australian Defence Force positions will be subject to market testing. The final number of Australian Defence Force positions that will be saved cannot be known until these processes are complete. In addition, 3,400 civilian positions in the Defence Organisation are expected to be saved, and a further 5,900 will be subject to market testing. (2) All States and mainland Territories will be affected by the findings of the Review. The Review did not identify the location of positions to be saved or tested in the level of detail sought by honourable member. Health Policy: Mr G. Samuel (Question No. 1668) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a speech given by Mr G Samuel, newly appointed President of the National Competition Council on 23 April 1997 in which he spoke about the need for a revolution in health care. (2) Is the Government considering a quasi voucher system for patients; if so, when will the system be introduced. (3) Has he met with Mr Samuel to discuss health policy since Mr Samuel's appointment as President of the National Competition Council. (4) Is he able to say whether Mr Samuel holds or has held positions within the Liberal Party's Victorian Division. (5) Is he able to say whether Mr Samuel holds a position within the Victorian health system. (6) Is he also able to say whether Mr Samuel played a role in the decision to close Burwood Hospital in Victoria. (7) Has he had discussions with Mr Samuel in regard to the closure of Burwood Hospital; if so, when.",172
268,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,COMMONWEALTH CAPITAL FUNDING TO GOVERNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. Inquiries to Mr Samuel's office indicate that his speech was largely about AFL football. (2) No. (3) No. (4) No. (5) Mr Samuel is the Chairman of the Inner and Eastern Health Care Network, Melbourne Metropolitan Health Care Services. (6) No. (7) No. Adult Migrant English Program (Question No. 1678) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: (1) Is the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) being left to tender; if so, what savings will be or are being achieved. (2) Do suitable service efficiency comparisons the exist between the existing Adult Migrant Education Service and other organisations. (3) Will the tendering process open up more places for clients needing access to the AMEP. (4) Has his attention been drawn to claims made in the House of Representatives (Hansard, 12 November 1992, page 3327) that direct funding provided by his Department was 38% cheaper than through competitive tendering; if so, what has occurred to change this situation. (5) What steps are being taken to ensure that ethnic community groups and migrants will not be confused by a multiplicity of service providers which may result from the tendering process. (6) Will the tendering process result in a change to a user pays system instead of a free service to migrants or will the new system generate sufficient funds to maintain the free service. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) is being tendered, as I foreshadowed in my announcement of 20 August 1996. The process of selecting AMEP service providers through competitive tendering is currently nearing completion in Victoria and Western Australia and will shortly begin in other States and Territories. New contracts are scheduled to be in place nationally by July 1998. The Government believes that implementing tendering for the AMEP will deliver a better service to clients, including better access and improved learning outcomes, for example through greater flexibility of learning arrangements, client choice of provider and partnerships between service providers and community agencies. While ensuring best value for money is an important consideration in tendering the Program, the primary objective in subjecting the market to competition is to achieve improvements to program delivery for clients. (2) Benchmarks are being developed by the National Centre for English Teaching and Research (NCELTR) at Macquarie University which will allow comparison of outcomes across all AMEP service providers nationally. The benchmarks provide predictions of AMEP clients' likely learning achievement against the number of hours they spend in the AMEP, taking account of factors such as the client's literacy in own language, use of roman or non-roman script and age. (3) Tenderers for AMEP services are required to adopt measures to increase AMEP reach, that is the percentage of eligible clients who access the service. It is expected that this requirement, with the additional flexibility made possible through tendering, will lead to more clients taking up their AMEP entitlement. (4) In 1992 I commented on the comparative costs of English language programs delivered by the (then) Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Employment, Education and Training. Such comparisons have little application today as the English as a Second Language industry has changed significantly, including through the development of new high quality public and private sector providers. (5) Currently the AMEP is delivered by a range of agencies: Adult Migrant English Service (AMES) and University of NSW in NSW, AMES, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and Northern Metropolitan Institute of T AFE (NMIT) in Victoria, AMES in South Australia and Tasmania, T AFE in Queensland and WA, Northern Territory University in the Northern Territory and Postcodes 2606--2607 2900-2906 the Canberra Institute of Technology in the ACT. My Department has put into place strategies including community consultations to ensure that ethnic community groups and migrants are aware of the additional choices which tendering is expected to offer AMEP clients. Further information will be provided to the community when decisions are made on service providers following completion of the tender processes. (6) Migrants in the skilled categories who do not have functional English are required to pay a charge before visa issue. Preferential Family and Refugee/Humanitarian entrants are exempt from the charge. The tendering process will not lead to changes in the user pays system. Proposed Second Sydney Airport: Holsworthy Military Reserve (Question No. 1682) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 13 May 1997: Have assessments been made regarding the (a) number of civilian jobs to be lost at the Holsworthy Military Reserve and (b) effect on the regional economy in the event of Sydney's second airport being constructed on the site of the Holsworthy Military Reserve; if so, what. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) No. (b) This question cannot be answered by Defence. Veterans' and War Widows: Australian Capital Territory (Question No. 1722) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 14 May 1997: How many (a) veterans and (b) war widows reside in the postcode areas of (a) 2900-2906 and (b) 2606-2607. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Details of pensioner numbers are provided in the following table. Veterans* War Widows** 383 99 918 121 * includes veterans who have a treatment entitlement service pension. ** some war widows also receive Petroleum Taxes: Timor Gap and (Question No. 1764) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 28 May 1997: (1) What revenue does the Government raise from taxes on oil or gas extracted (a) off the west coast of Australia in the area adjacent to Onslow and (b) from sources in the Timor Gap. (2) Is the information sought in part (1) able to be itemised on an island and platform basis. Mr Anderson-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) There are a number of petroleum projects operating in the offshore waters adjacent to Onslow. The aggregated estimate for 1996-97 Commonwealth petroleum taxation receipts for these water is $267M. (b) There is only one petroleum project operating in the offshore waters of the Timor Gap, and information about the estimated Commonwealth receipts is commercial-in-confidence, as it would disclose information about an individual taxpayer's cost structures and revenues, and is therefore publicly unavailable. (2) Information on taxation receipts for individual platforms or islands is also commercial-in-confidence, as it would disclose information about individual taxpayers' cost structures and revenues, and is therefore publicly unavailable. Travel Allowance: Mr Moore-Wilton (Question No. 1772) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 28 May 1997: What has been the cost in (a) air travel, (b) car travel, (c) travel allowances and (d) other expenses incurred by Mr Moore-Wilton commuting to Canberra from his Sydney home since Mr MooreWilton was appointed head of his Department.",201
269,Mr HOWARD,COMMONWEALTH CAPITAL FUNDING TO GOVERNMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Mr Moore-Wilton travels to Sydney for business and personal reasons. He is entitled to a notional maximum amount of $6,600 per year for reunion visits. Reunion costs incurred by Mr Moore-Wilton but are not in receipt of a disability pension or income support supplement. commuting between Canberra and Sydney since his appointment as head of the Department of Prime Onslow Minister and Cabinet are as follows: (a) air travel-$2,443.73; (b) car travel*$757.71; (c) travel allowances-$O.OO; (d) other expenses**-$131.42; TOT AL-$3,332.86 * Comcar/cabcharge ** Fuel charges incurred through the use of DASFleet private plated vehicle Japanese Fishing Trawlers in Australian Waters (Question No. 1791) Mr Campbell asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 3 June 1997: (1) Will the Government sign a pact with Japan for $3.4m to allow 250 fishing trawlers into Australian waters for 5 months; if so, (a) when will the agreement be signed and (b) into what areas will the Japanese trawlers be allowed. (2) Will other foreign trawlers be allowed into Australian waters; if so, from which countries. Mr Anderson-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, the Australia and Japan negotiate an annual bilateral fishing agreement, which provides for fishing access by Japanese longline vessels to the Australian fishing zone, targeting mainly tuna species. However no Japanese fishing trawlers are licensed to operate in the Australian fishing zone. The Australian Government will be paid $3.4 million for a shortened five month access period in 1997, a fee which compares favourably to previous full year access fees, which the Agreement normally provides for. (a) This years Agreement was tabled in both houses of Parliament for the 15 day period required by the Government and was signed on 4 June 1997, with fishing commencing on that date and continuing until 31 October 1997. The Bilateral Agreement enables the operators of Japanese vessels to take tuna and associated species within the terms and conditions of access specified in an annually negotiated Agreement. The predominant species is yellowfin tuna followed by big-eye tuna and broadbill swordfish. (b) Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) is also caught in the waters off Tasmania and NSW. The SBT catch by Japanese vessels in the Australian fishing zone is limited to 400 tonnes and any catch against this amount is deducted from Japan's national catch allocation granted under the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna. The Japanese vessels have restricted access to three areas of the AFZ. On the east and west coasts of Australia, they can only operate outside 50 nautical miles (nm) and north of the latitude 34 degrees South. Adjacent to Tasmania Japanese vessels can operate outside of 17 nm. They are further excluded from areas within 17 to 50 nautical miles of the Australian coast and other areas such as marine parks and reserves. The fishing access provided by Australia returns a wide range of benefits including direct financial returns that cover management and research costs as well as providing a community return on the resources taken. Other benefits include co-operative research projects, fisheries data provisions, technology transfer opportunities for Australian fishers and a substantial in port expenditure by visiting Japanese vessels. Under the tenns and conditions of the Bilateral Agreement, administered by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA), the Japanese longline fleet are required to report position, effort and catch on a daily basis, are subject to pre and post fishing inspections, and at sea inspections. At the pre fishing inspection Japanese fishing masters are thoroughly briefed on the conditions on their licence and the codes of conduct in place under the Bilateral Agreement. An on-board observer program covers between 10 and 30% of all fishing trips by Japanese vessels, dependent on the fishing region. This assists in the verification of figures provided by the Japanese and also enables AFMA to gain information to continuously improve the bilateral management arrangements. The annual agreement has been the subject of an inquiry by the Joint House Standing Committee on Treaties, which recognised the overall benefits of the agreement. The Governments response to the inquiry's report is being finalised now and generally accepts the recommendations of the Committee. (2) Australia's current policy regarding foreign fishing is linked to its international rights and obligations under the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (the Convention) and the need to ensure responsible conservation and management of fish stocks in the Australian fishing zone. Under the Convention Australia will consider applications for foreign fishing vessel access to fisheries stocks which are not fully utilised. Where foreign fishing operations are permitted the main objective is to maximise genuine, tangible and assessable benefits to Australia. Preference is always given to fishing operations which are owned and conducted by Australians and which use Australian vessels. Foreign fishing access to the Australian fishing zone is strictly regulated and limited currently to the Japanese activity referred to in this answer, as well as limited access to United States purse seine fishing vessels licensed under the Forum Fisheries Agency Multilateral Treaty on Fisheries, some limited joint venture arrangements and some small scale artisanal fishing activity by traditional fishers in the zone. Australia is a party to the Multilateral Treaty on Fisheries, which is a treaty on fisheries access between the Governments of certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America. The Treaty only provides access to a limited area in the north east of the ·Coral Sea and United States vessels have yet to fish in our fishing zone under the Treaty. It has been in force since 1987.",203
