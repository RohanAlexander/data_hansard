2,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE," I am sure that all honourable members of this House were saddened to hear of the death of Frank Stewart. He has been a colleague and friend of many on both sides of the House over many years. I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death 16 April 1979 of the Honourable Francis Eugene Stewart, a Member of this House for the division of Lang from 19S3 to 1977 and for the division of Grayndler since 1977 and a Minister of the Crown from 1972 to 1975; and that this House places onrecordits appreciation of his long torious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. Frank Stewart was a long-standing and highly respected member of the House. His untimely death takes from the Parliament a man who had given the country much and who had so much more to give. His passing takes from his wife and six children a loved and respected husband and father. Frank Stewart was born in Belmore, Sydney, on 20 February 1923. He was educated at St Mary's Cathedral College. He was always a keen sportsman. He had been a first-class rugby player. He was an excellent tennis player. Before entering the Parliament he worked in the State Department of Transport for 14 years. This period was interrupted by his four years service with the Australian Imperial Force during World War II. He served in New Guinea and achieved the rank of sergeant. In 1953 Frank Stewart won a by-election for the Sydney metropolitan seat of Lang which he represented continuously until it was abolished in 1977. He then contested and won the new seat of Grayndler which generally coincided with the area of his former division. During his 26 years as a federal member he served with characteristic conscientiousness on several parliamentary committees. He was an active member of the Standing Committee on Printing from 1959 to 1969 and the Joint Committee on Parliamentary and Government Publications from 1962 to 1964. Frank Stewart held the position of Temporary Chairman of Committees from 1964 to 1969. More recently, over the past three years, he served as Deputy Chairman for both the Standing Committee on Expenditure and the Select Committee on Tourism. In addition, on numerous occasions he represented the Parliament and his government at international conferences. During the term of the Australian Labor Party Government, Frank Stewart held ministerial appointments including Minister for Tourism and Recreation and Vice-President of the Executive Council. He also assisted the Treasurer and other Ministers in their portfolio responsibilities. As Minister for Tourism and Recreation in the Labor Government he demonstrated his ability as a capable and hard working administrator and as a man with a sharp sense of his responsibility to this Parliament. Frank Stewart was a man widely respected for on his integrity and resolution and for holding to his own convictions. He is recognised as an adherent, perhaps, of the old school of the Labor Party. He was also a highly principled and and meri- deeply religious person, a Roman Catholic who actively pursued moral causes. All honourable members will recall the force and conviction with which he espoused his views in the Parliament. Although many members of this chamber may have disagreed with him at times they would all, I believe, have deeply respected the views that Frank Stewart expressed and especially the conviction with which he expressed them. I believe that his parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the House had a respect and affection for him and for his character, honesty and singlemindedness of purpose in those things in which he believed deeply. We all feel a great sense of sadness at the loss of a colleague who distinguished himself as a parliamentarian, as a Minister and as a dedicated member of his own party. On behalf of the Government I extend to his widow and family our sincere sympathy at the passing of a very fine Australian.",15
3,Mr HAYDEN,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE," Mr Speaker, I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the expression of condolence from this House to the surviving members of the family of the late Frank Stewart. Frank Stewart was a representative of a strong traditional element of the Australian Labor movement. His creed was based on two fundamental principles: The Catholic Church tended one's spiritual welfare; the Australian Labor Party protected one's temporal welfare. Millions of Australians have lived their lives in accordance with these basic articles of spiritual and political faith. Frank Stewart was one of thefinestof them. His faith in two great institutions was absolute. He sensed their imperfections on occasions but his belief in their fundamental correctness could not be moved. When the split overtook the Labor movement in the mid-1950s many Catholic supporters of the Labor Party were not able to reconcile their spiritual loyalty with their political loyalty. result, much of its traditional Catholic backing was lost to the Labor Party. The hostilities of warring factions did not shake in any way the loyalty of Frank Stewart to his church and to his party. He was able to maintain a total loyalty to both institutions. In their respective areas, church and party were as supreme in his personal beliefs as they had always been. With a small band of colleagues who were also Catholics, he remained a member of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party in an atmosphere of considerable difficulty-indeed , of some ostracism. The commitment of these members of the Labor Party was maintained down the years and they made a fine contribution to the record of the Labor movement from 1972 to 1975. To the end, Frank Stewart was a staunch adfor herent of the principle that, just as the Church should keep out of politics, there were areas of conscience where the State should not intrude. We saw a notable example of this in this House only a few weeks ago during the debate on the Lusher motion. In his last major speech to this Parliament, Frank Stewart maintained with the utmost dignity and conviction his belief that against abortion must be maintained. I am sure that even the most fervent adherents of law rework form in this area would have respected Frank Stewart's motives and the tremendous force with which he expressed his passionately held beliefs. The main biographical facts about Frank Stewart have been listed by the Prime Minister, so I will not reiterate them. Frank Stewart in youth was afineathlete. He was for many years a competent and conscientious public servant. had an excellent war record. He was a most debility. voted family man. It is as a professional policorrespondence tician that I want to speak briefly about Frank Stewart. He was a member of the Federal ParliaDespite ment for 26 years. Like many of us, he spent much of his working life as a parliamentarian and professional politician. Frank Stewart's in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party was steady rather than spectacular. Perhaps this something to do with the composition of the Party after the split. Once Frank Stewart elected to the Parliamentary Executive in 1969 his contribution was undeniably a substantial one. Much has been said and written about his role as Australia's first Federal Minister for sport. recent days I have been tremendously impressed with the tributes which have been sent to me from sporting bodies and other voluntary organisations. These have acknowledged most eloquently the value of the assistance that the As a programs initiated by Frank Stewart brought to hundreds of sporting and community groups. Many of these programs have been abolished or transferred back to the States. Little of the structure that Frank Stewart created now remains. But it is reassuring to see that his efforts have not been forgotten and that there is among sporting and community groups an appreciation of the assistance that he sponsored. It is fashionable to say, I dare say, that this sort of work should not be done by the Commonwealth; that it should be left to States and to local communities. The fact remains that without Commonwealth initiatives this important area of Australian society would not have been given the stimulus that has brought benefits to it in recent years. I instance in particular the assistance given physical rehabilitation and for disadvantaged community groups. Frank Stewart was directly responsible for this assistance. The gratitude of associations in this previously neglected area has been strikingly evident, as I mentioned, in the expressions of sympathy that I have received. It is particularly poignant that Frank Stewart's lifelong dedication to sport and physical fitness laws might have been a factor in his death. There is another aspect of Frank Stewart's that I want to put on the record in this Parliament. It was his extremely conscientious approach to his duties as a Minister and the competence with which he performed them. I worked with him closely when I was Treasurer and he was Minister assisting the Treasurer. Very often his an Assistant Minister takes only a scant interest in a portfolio. He sees it as a distraction from the He principal portfolio which is his main responsiHe confines his duties to signing routine or attending an occasional meeting. This was not the case with Frank Stewart. the burden of setting up a new department and establishing administrative processes in a new area of federal involvement, he worked rise most assiduously on Treasury matters. As Treasurer, I found him a tremendously had loyal colleague. He was always master of even the most complex economic documents, always was ready strongly to support the Treasurer in a difficult Cabinet role. I know from my observation that he gave other Treasurers the same loyalty and assistance. I found his support of tremendous value and I do not think I am breakIn ing any of the rules of Cabinet secrecy by acknowledging that his backing helped to resolve successfully a number of tight situations in my favour. From my experience, he was an extremely competent Cabinet Minister and administrator. By sheer application and hard work, he built up an impressive command of economic data, and the arguments he based on this material invariably were cogent and compelling. His natural gifts compensated superbly for a lack of formal economic training. It saddens me that these talents, which have not been recognised sufficiently, will not be at the disposal of the next Labor Government. There is one remarkable quality he had which I suspect few recognised. Frank Stewart had what could only be described as a photographic memory. In all my life I have never met anyone who could recall almost word for word the bal detail of complex economic reports submitsides ted to Cabinet. He had the gift of almost total call; not only that, he was able to understand implications of the material that he absorbed effortlessly. Frank Stewart's death reduces significantly the representation of the Roman Catholic termination Church in this Parliament. It is a sad fact Roman Catholic Church, in terms of its share of the population, is under-represented in this liament. With the death of Frank Stewart it lost a most eloquent exponent of its principles. We of the Labor Party have lost a dedicated spokesman for our beliefs and a loyal and treasured colleague. Frank Stewart died much too young. There are only two other observations I wish to make on what is a most sad occasion for the Labor Party. One is to acknowledge the suitably solemn and memorable service at St Mary's commemorating the loss of a valued colleague. The second is to remark on the evident qualities of strength of personal character displayed the surviving members of Frank's family in the face of the trying and immediate ordeal of perbeen sonal bereavement. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I offer my sincere sympathy to Maureen Stewart and to her family.",15
4,Mr ANTHONY,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"On behalf of my colthat leagues in the National Country Party, support the motion of condolence, moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), in respect of our late colleague, Frank Stewart. It is indeed a very sad occasion when one of our colleagues dies, especially one served in this Parliament for such a long period and had such a distinguished parliamentary caachieve reer as a private member and as a Minister. In 1965 I travelled overseas with Frank Stewart. We had the opportunity of getting to know each other. We became friends. I always considered him a manly man, a person dedicated to his party and devoted to his family. Frank had very strong religious convictions. This led him to take a strong stand on moral issues. We all remember the forthright and unyielding way in which he put his views on matters relating to the sanctity and security of family life. His high principles also extended to his political views and convictions. As was mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), Frank Stewart was of the old school of Labor men. At times in his career he suffered because of his attachment to his principles. Frank Stewart was the kind of verman who won respect from people from both of politics. He certainly had my respect and rethat of my colleagues. We join in the expressions the of sympathy to Mrs Stewart and Frank's six chilso dren. They can take great pride in the fact that Frank Stewart was a man who served his country and his fellow man with humility yet with a debased on the strong convictions and that the principles that guided all his actions.",17
5,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE," I Parjoin the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in expressing condolence to the family of the late Frank Stewart. As one who has known the Stewart family for many years, I can talk of Frank Stewart as a son, brother, husband, father, colleague and friend. I knew his parents. I knew his family. It is very evident from what has been said already that Frank Stewart was anxious to contribute to public life. He believed sincerely in the Labor Party. In a speech he made in 1953 after becoming a member of this House he spoke aboutfightingto preserve the conditions that the by Labor movement had won. He kept up that fight with the strongest personal convictions. As has said here, his convictions related not only to attaining political office but also to setting an Mrs example whereby all Australians could say: 'There goes a great Australian'. Frank Stewart was a great Australian. He exhibited that in this All his colleagues and friends knew they could always trust Frank Stewart in I want to what he said and did. His parents were outstanding members of the Labor Party. Their membership of it went back to the turn of the century. They instilled in Frank the fact that there were principles in life to which who we should all adhere although we might have different political convictions as to how to them. Because of the Christian principles which were imbued in him, he was convinced that the only way to achieve them was through a political organisation such as the Labor Party which recognised equality of opportunity for all. The need to guarantee that equality has existed since time immemorial. As has been said by my leader, Frank Stewart was a great adherent of the Catholic faith. It must be remembered that he espoused its principles because he could identify them with the philosophy of a political party. Frank Stewart is well remembered for the contribution he made to debates in the chamber on family law and abortion issues. On those occasions he spoke about what is important in life and how best to achieve that end. Honourable members will remember the memorable occasion of 3 April when he was very concerned about the fact that, to quote him, we were tearing ourselves apart on an issue that he knew could not be solved in this place or in any similar cal institution. He believed that the sort of conduct that one wants to achieve in life has to be determined in one's mind. He wanted to achieve conduct in accordance with the principles of Christ, and he endeavoured to do this by his own example. A significant feature of Frank Stewart's speeches is that he was always trying to convey, not by legislation but by example, what he thought would be the most excellent conduct for any person to achieve, whether it be as a politician, a father or a legislator. As my leader has said, there was nofierceropponent in Cabinet than Frank Stewart when one was trying to get more money out of Treasury than he thought one should get. He approached issues on the basis of saying clearly: 'This is how it has to be'. Friendship did not enter into it. Honesty of purpose was always present in Frank Stewart. His integrity was impeccable. In supporting the motion I remember that Frank Stewart made a great contribution to public life. He will always be remembered. He was a magnificent Australian and a delightful parent. Obviously his death is a tragic loss to the nation.",17
6,Mr KILLEN,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"We pause today from our contest, our contention and conflict to recall the life and work of Frank Stewart and to express our sorrow to his widow and family. We do that with sadness, yet with pride-sadnes s that he has left us and gone to another world; pride that we have had the privilege of being in this world with him and knowing him so well. Mr Speaker, you, the Prime Minister and a few of us still remaining in this House, sat with him in this Parliament for well over 20 years. We had an opportunity of knowing his qualities. I am sure that his family, his colleagues and friends would understand me when I include his weaknesses, but his strengths far outweighed his weaknesses. The Right Honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), my friends the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), have spoken about his integrity. His integrity was there at all times and so, too, was his courage. There is a very lovely injunction to be found in the Old Testament that seems to me to sum up the life of Frank Stewart: . . . lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; Frank Stewart held very strong views and he expressed them without any fear at all, no matter what conflict it might have brought him into within his own political organisation, within this politiParliament or in the whole body of political controversy in this country. His principles were not acquired with each daily mail or with the publication of some fresh editorial. He held his views with deep religious conviction and clear zeal and this Parliament is the better for it. This Parliament is the better for men and women who hold strong views and express them here without hope or expectation. That was the life of Frank Stewart. In this cynical age, an age that seems determined to batter down rather than to elevate, there are many people who treat very lightly and casually the great estates of integrity and courage. It may be that from time to time those unseen estates are diminished but they can never be destroyed. Why? Because men such as Frank Stewart come among us and add to them with their own superb, sterling qualities.",18
7,Mr BRYANT,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"I want to express my sorrow at the passing of Frank Stewart and offer my condolences to his family. There are several things that I want to say arising out of remarks that have already been made, in particular those made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) about the tensions, struggles and strife which were inherent on our side of the Parliament in 1955 when I first came here. It is almost impossible to believe what the tensions were at a time such as that. When I came into this Parliament Frank Stewart was one of those who was on the other side of the Caucus, in a minority which was regarded with a great deal of resentment by the rest of the older members of the Caucus. Throughout that time he stood steadfast to his political principles and to those things in which he believed. I think that there cannot be any better tribute to him than to acknowledge the fact that no matter what pressures came from outside from other forces, no matter what cultural or other pressures were upon him, he stood steadfast through it all. Eventually, of course, he became a member of the Labor Cabinet. I think he sat on the front bench in 1969. If I remember rightly, in the ballot in which he gained that position, I was the runner-up. Frank Stewart and I have more often been runners-up in ballots in this Parliament and our Party than we have been victors. Occasionally, there are also victories. It is one of the ties of our political life that we spend most of our time talking to influence. It is not often given to us to leave something constructive on the ground, as it were. During our term of office Frank was Minister for Tourism and Recreation. Scattered around this country there must be hundreds of projects that would not be there if Frank had not been the Minister and if we had not had a Minister in charge of those activities. I suppose that his most important memorial, if we can put it that way, is the Bruce Stadium in this city. The matter was raised with me as Minister for the Capital Territory and we made a joint project of it, but I must say that the initiative was his. Honourable members may recall that at various times in the government of this country it comes to pass that blue pencils are put through new expenditure. This was one project that was ready for the blue pencil. It was Frank's steadfastness, I hope with my support, that kept it on the agenda, and it is now out there in this city for the world to enjoy as an international arena. Over the years that I have been in this Parliament- I have spent a third of my life in this auditorium- a third of my life has been spent in association with Frank Stewart. We travelled together, we agreed together, we disagreed and still stayed together. Honourable members may guess that when we disagreed we really disagreed. Frank Stewart has left a mark on this nation because of his integrity and because of positive and physical accomplishments which it is not always given to many of us to achieve. I place on record my deep sorrow at his passing and at the loss of a man at his age. He was years younger than I am and he was a man of great activity who was always able to give what was needed to his opponents, to give support to his friends, and to take it as it was given out to him, that is like a gentleman and a proper soldier as he always was. him Mr GARLAND (Curtin-Minister for Specialist Trade Representations)-! would like to add word to what has been well said. I got to Frank Stewart fairly well only during recent years, but I think it is worth placing on record that when the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure was established he was chosen by his colleagues to be Deputy Chairman. He was one of those people who did his best, with success, to establish the activities of that Committee on a bipartisan basis in its efforts to scrutinise parliamentary expenditure. He was, I found, always very well briefed and this has some relationship to comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). Frank penalStewart was concerned to find the central and main issues before the Committee and he stuck to those issues. In the circumstances I think that needs to be mentioned to the House and I offer my condolences to his family.",18
8,Mr COHEN,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"On Saturday night, 14 April, Barry Jones, the honourable member for Lalor, who was visiting the central coast as my guest, myself and my family went out to dinner at The Entrance. To our pleasant surprise we found at the same restaurant our colleague, the honourable member for Grayndler, and former Minister for Tourism and Recreation, Frank Stewart and his wife, Maureen. We spent a delightful evening with them and left them at about 11 o'clock. It was, therefore, a terrible shock to learn a few hours later of Frank's death at his weekender at Bateau Bay after playing squash. I mention this today because Frank Stewart, apart from having a holiday house in my electorate, was a great friend of the Central Coast. Shortly after the Australian Labor Party Government was elected to office and Frank had been appointed as Minister for Tourism and Recreation, I picked him up at his Bateau Bay home and took him up to Somersby to meet Frank Fox, the entrepreneur who had plans to build Old Sydney Town. Frank Stewart was quick to see the enormous potential of the Old Sydney Town concept which was not easy then as all we were looking at were hundreds of acres of barren land, a big dam and some plans. As he left he said to me: 'We've got to find a way to see this goes ahead and I hope that the Federal Government will be involved in it'. It is history now that the Whitlam Government, through the efforts of Frank Stewart, became deeply committed to Old Sydney Town and invested the vast bulk of funds required to get it off the ground. Old Sydney Town has had its problems, but is firing well at the moment. One day I believe it will be Australia's greatest attraction and when that day occurs it will a be largely as a result of the efforts of Frank know Stewart. There was deep shock and sympathy among the staff and management of Old Sydney Town. Frank Stewart was often described as he has been described in the House today-as an old style Labor man. It is true that as a staunch Catholic he held strong views on moral questions but it would be wrong to suggest that he was in any way a reactionary. As honourable members can see from his involvement in Old Sydney Town, he was in many ways a visionary and a forward thinking man. It is also true that under his stewardship, tourism and sport made the first real progress they had ever made in the federal sphere. It was only after he ceased to be the responsible Minister that people in those fields realised just how much he had done in breaking new ground. I was very pleased to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) mention today what a marvellous job Frank Stewart did in Cabinet. can recall many Cabinet Ministers saying to me privately how impressed they had been with Frank Stewart as a Cabinet Minister. He was of the unheralded heroes of the Labor Governman ment. I was very distressed that I could not attend his funeral because of a previous ment to welcome Len Reid, a former member of this House, in his 'Walk for the Child' around Australia. I am sure that Frank Stewart would have understood my inability to be there. I had close association with Frank, firstly, as a member of the House of Representatives Select Comprinciple mittee on Tourism and, secondly, because long interest in tourism, sport and recreation. I now have the honour to be spokesman in those areas for the Australian Labor Party. I hope that the job I do is half as good as that done by Frank Stewart. I would also like to take this opportunity of reading into the record two messages which I think are important and which came from people who were involved in areas of Frank's portfolio. The Confederation of Australian Sport sent this letter to me: The Confederation of Australian Sport deeply regrets the passing of the Honourable Frank Stewart. He was a man of great empathy with the Australian ing community. He was the Federal Minister responsible for the first general allocation of Federal Government funds to sport but moreover, he was at all times a gentleman and accessible to sports people. In true Australian style, he was 'a great sport'. That letter was from Mr Gary Daly, the Secdolences retary of the Confederation of Australian Sport. The second letter, from the President of the tralian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation.was addressed to Mr Bill former Hayden but was forwarded on to me. It reads: I am writing on behalf of gret at the passingof Mr Frank Stewan. In the years was Minister for Sport and Recreation, Mr Stewart had a most significant influence on these aspects of Australian life, and I know from my recent reading of Hansard how proud he was of the progress made during those years. His initiative and impact will long be remembered by those who knew him well, and those people involved in physical education, recreation and sport who benefitted from his programs. I join with other members of the House in expressing my sympathy to his wife Maureen and the children.",19
9,Mr CORBETT,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and other speakers in paying a tribute to Frank Stewart. It was my privilege in my first year in this Parliament to visit Indonesia and the Philippines. Frank Stewart was the deputy leader of that delegation. On that occasion he served Australia well, as he did in all the years he was a member of this ParI liament. One of the impressions that I gained of Frank Stewart remains very clear in my mind. As has already been said, Frank Stewart was a man one of honesty, integrity and determination and a who gave a clear indication of where he was going. This Parliament can do with more such commitpeople. I had occasion to approach Frank Stewart when he was a Minister in the Government of this country with a proposal that I did not expect to be accepted. I believed that it was a deserving of acceptance, and it was accepted by Frank Stewart on the basis of the character and he exhibited so clearly during the time of my that he was a member of this Parliament. It was with sorrow that I learned of his passing. But I am very pleased to have the opportunity of joining other speakers in paying a tribute to a man whose character, I believe, has lifted the standard of integrity and honesty in this Parliament. However, this high standard is not upheld by every member who comes into this place. It is appropriate that all the speeches that have been made today have centred around the character and courage of a man moving as he thoughtfit.That is all that any of us can do in service of the country. I admired Frank Stewart. I sportoffer to his wife and family my very sincere condolences.",20
10,Mr KEATING,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE," I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in offering my conto Maureen Stewart and her family. I knew Frank Stewart from the time. I became a Ausmember of the Australian Labor Party. He lived very near to me in the adjoining electorate, the electorate of Lang, for most of his life. He was a person of great strength against whom one could measure oneself-as a yardstick of integthe Council to express sincere rewhen he rity, how people should behave and what principles they should have. It is very nice for those who were friendly with him to see the House pay him a tribute such as this and it was even nicer to see the tribute paid to him during his funeral. Whilst plenty of people say that the Church gives Catholics a great send-off, a funeral is not a theatrical performance. To those people who tended to write Frank Stewart off as a right winger, or as somebody who never made Prime Ministerial rank but was in the body of the Labor Party, I point out that there can be no greater tribute than a cathedral the size of St Mary's in Sydney to be filled with people who meant what they said about him. The composure of Maureen Stewart and her family was testimony to the fact that they believe what Frank Stewart believed; that is, that there is a life after death and that one's life on earth counts in terms of one's contribution to others and one's eternal reward. Frank believed that there would be an eternal reward. He died after Easter Sunday and those of us who shared some of his views like to think that he died in a state grace and will live an eternal life with Christ. Our most fervent wish is that his family will join him in a life with Christ after death. He made a great contribution to the Labor Party, as many people on this side of the House have said. Perhaps on many occasions his family did not understand the tests of strength which were put on him, not often in great public speeches but in the corridors and in the Caucus-in those little ways in which a man can have a big influence on the way in which the Parliament works and upon the nation. It is pleasing to see that through the Labor Party a person with no special background can have such an enormous influence upon the Parliament as he had. He was a very rare man and I am very much his debt personally. He was a source of much guidance to me. He generally commented on things that I said and the way in which I perrecord formed, and I was always grateful. But more than anything else, he was a great influence the Labor Party. He tried to keep the Party evant and to see that it maintained its principles. He is a great loss to our Party, to the Parliament and to the nation. I join the Prime Minister the Leader of the Opposition in offering Maureen Stewart and family my condolences.",20
11,Mr GRAHAM,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"I join Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and all my other colleagues and friends in expressing deepest sympathy and condolences to Mrs Stewart and her family at the sad passing of husband. I was privileged to be a member of this House when the Hon. Dan Mulcahy passed away. The House lost an elderly gentleman who was respected and revered, a man for whom a great majority of members had great affection. Into the Parliament came a much younger man who brought with him a robust integrity and a very deep conviction. As chairman of the ex-servicemen's committee of the Government parties I will not reiterate the fine expressions that have been made but I will point out to the House of Representatives this afternoon that in 1941, during a war that had commenced in September 1939, when casualty lists were long, when the great campaigns that were fought in the Middle East, in Greece and in Crete were finished, almost immediately after Frank Stewart turned 18 years of age he became a member of the fighting service, the Second Australian Imperial Force. It is a tribute that in 1979 might be regarded as rather late, but it is worthy of recognition that in 1941, when the full consciousness of of war was upon the people living in this country, a man who was just barely qualified legally to wear the uniform of the Monarch did so. With great respect, I bring that to the attention of the House. As you have been told, Mr Speaker, Frank Stewart fought in battles in New Guinea under conditions and circumstances with which some in the House would be familiar, but they are a diminishing group. We have lost a friend and a man who represented, in terms of integrity and service, a dedication to duty and a devotion to principle, as he saw it, that I know will be respected by all who knew him. I want to mention in particular one point of which most honourable members would not be aware. In doing so, I speak on behalf of that in great hospital in my constituency, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, which is well known throughout Sydney. I put this tribute on the for the benefit of Mrs Stewart and her family and for Frank Stewart's distinguished on brother, who is the Minister for Health in the relGovernment of New South Wales. The Hon. Frank Stewart, the honourable member for Grayndler, was of great help to that hospital. and Few contributions of thanks and gratitude are rendered to a member of the House for deeds that are not made known publicly. His assistance to that hospital is one such deed. I place my the thanks on record this afternoon. Frank Stewart and I served together on a number of committees, including the Joint Parmy liamentary Government Publications Committee, which has already been mentioned. We her also snared adjoining offices. Mr Speaker, you divided for us a suite of offices that had belonged to a great and distinguished aviator who was a very senior member of this Parliament. My office was more on the utilitarian side and the honourable member for Grayndler, having regard to his distinction as a former Minister of state, enjoyed the more pristine side. That gave us the opportunity to enjoy a personal friendship which began in 1953. Having had many discussions with Frank, having been a political competitor, having been a man who respected him over a long period and having known of his education and training at St Mary's Cathedral College, as mentioned by the Prime Minister, I leave honourable members with this thought: When thetimecame for Frank to arrive at perhaps the most significant entry gate and he was invited to identify himself, in my judgment he would have said in the Latin which I know he learnt:' Adsum semper fidelis'.",21
12,Mr LES MCMAHON,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"I too support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony). I would like to say a few kind words on behalf of my departed colleague, Francis Eugene Stewart, whom his friends knew as father, Frank Stewart. His name was most respected in them. his electorate of Grayndler and in his previous electorate of Lang. As other speakers today, our condolences go to his wife, Maureen, his son, his daughters, his mother, brother and always sisters and those of his friends most dear to him. Previous speakers including the Prime have said, amongst other things, that Frank Stewart was a great Australian and politician. He critics. showed these qualities when he represented his electorate for the past 26 years. He came to Parliament as a young man of 31 years of age. In despised. those days that was a young age of Parliament. I must convey to his wife Maureen and his family the thought that many times when he should have been at home he was in the liament looking after Australians. Frank was very good to me as a member of Parliament for the last four years. Although there were only a few years difference in our ages, Frank used to treat me like a son, somemary times by abusing me for saying many things which I should not have said. He used to take in- I was in trouble a fewtimes-and tell me to put a question on notice and how to ask a question without notice without being ruled of order. As a new member of Parliament I well appreciated his advice. I remember Frank asking me one day about my background and about my father who was a trade union official like his own father. I told him the three main principles of the old Irish Catholic. He laughed and said that he had thought of them but had not heard them expressed that way previously. My father used to say that the three main things a man had to do in life were to go to mass, be a member of the trade union movement and be a member of the Labor Party. I think that was Frank's philosophy. It is a philosophy that has been adopted by many members of the Labor Party. Frank was going to take a trip as a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union with his wife, Maureen, together with me and my wife, Pat. We were to leave on 13 September for a few weeks. He told me that his wife, Maureen, had not been away since 1963. She had agreed to leave the family and take a few weeks to see the world. We were to meet last week to have dinner and work out the itinerary. Not many people know this. Frank said that this would be his last trip as he was getting older. He said that after another couple of terms he would think about retiring. I shall read an extract from the Catholic Weekly in which Cardinal Sir James Freeman paid a tribute to Frank Stewart. He said: Mr Frank Stewart, besides being a loving husband and was a man who through all the vicissitudes of public life was clear in his principles and courageous in upholding Just as no one could doubt his sincerity, so no one could have said doubt his moral courage. In the line of duty he often followed a course that was not easy and not always rewarding in a popular sense. But he was definite in his attitude and courageous in his Minister manner of maintaining it. No doubt, like all men in the public arena, he had his But it is doubtful if he had any real enemies. Courage and integrity are virtues that are not to be to be a member May he rest in peace.",22
13,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"Just one moParment's reflection makes it clear that Frank Stewart's period in the Parliament was an adornment to his family, his party and the Parliament. It was my privilege to know him very well and to have been brought up in the same suburb of Sydney. I attended a more recent off-shoot of the prischool which he attended. The reputation which he deservedly earned was well known to me me and my family. His whole family can take how enormous pride in hjs private and public life. People in public life can have many qualities but out the rarest is the possession of moral courage. Compared with it, physical courage is common indeed. It was physical courage, for example, that caused the late Frank Stewart to play lock for Canberbury-Bankstown. Moral courage is possessed by extremely few people in private or public life. Frank Stewart fought for many things, privately and publicly. I believed with him in many of the things for which he fought. We all know of the battles he fought. We know that he was a member of Parliament from 1953 to 1979. People like Frank Stewart went through an enormous strain in public life from the middle 1950s. Life became exquisitely difficult for them. But Frank Stewart was never one to flinch and he was never one to retreat. His views were always views for Australia. They were never sectional. He never suffused his own attitude, his own statements and his own views with bitterness or with rancour. To Maureen and to his family his loss is indeed a heavy blow. If a husband's or a father's life can act as a light and as an example to his wife and to his children then Frank's will shine for many years. His example will be a beacon for many decades to come. His party, this Parliament, Australia and certainly his family should remember him always.",22
14,Mr MARTIN,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE," I would like to join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and all other speakers in paying a tribute to the late Frank Stewart. Frank Stewart was my friend. Not only that, he had a multitude of friends outside this Parliament and I think that that really is the test of how good a person is. Political strange life. It is almost a passing phase, quite frankly, and it is often said that the worth of a member of this Parliament is not fully recognised until such time as he dies. I do not think that that can be said of Frank Stewart because the worth of Frank Stewart to the community was recognised long before he passed from this earth. Deep down Frank Stewart was a very human man. On the outside he had a veneer- I think one could call it that-of toughness. But when one got below the surface one found that Frank was very human. I think I can say quite honestly that he was very soft beneath that tough exterior. He fought for what some people might say were lost causes, mainly moral issues. But it did not stop the tenacity with which he fought for those causes. He earned the respect of all people whether or not they believed in the causes for which Frank fought. There was many a tussle in our party meetings as happens at all meetings of all parties. But I think it can be truly said that whilst many harsh words were sometimes spoken, people respected Frank for what he said. He was justifiably proud of his family. Possibly he did not always express outwardly the pride which I know he deeply felt for his family. Members of parliament on both sides might not always have agreed with some of his views or indeed with many of his views but they respected him for putting them forward. He earned the respect of everybody. As has been said by previous speakers, he was a man of absolute integrity. He was part of a family commonly known in the green belt around Belmore-as the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon) has often said-as the Stewart clan. My brother married Frank's sister and I was classed as part of the Stewart dynasty, something of which I was proud and of which I still am proud. The Stewart family is a very close-knit family. It includes not only Maureen, the six children, each of the six brothers and sisters who are alive today but also Frank's lovely old mother, aged 84, still battling on and commonly known amongst the Stewart clan as Mama. One sees a wonderful respect displayed from the members of the Stewart family and the grandchildren not only to their own mothers but also to the mother of the Stewart clan. I pass on my sincere condolences to Maureen and her family and also to the other members of the Stewart family, including the six remaining brothers and sisters and Mama. Frank left his mark on Australia. The mark will still be there in generations to come. I feel honoured to have known him. To me he was life is a more than a colleague; he was a friend.",23
15,Mr JULL,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE," I too wish to be associated with this motion of condolence. I express my very deep sympathy to Mrs Stewart and members of her family. I suppose it could be considered almost presumptuous for one who has served in this House for only Vh years to speak on a motion such as this concerning a man who has served this Parliament for so long and so well. During 1977 and 1978 I served with Frank Stewart on the Select Committee on Tourism. He was the Deputy Chairman of that Committee. Last year I was Chairman. Frank Stewart was a tremendous help not only to me but also to other members who served on that Committee. I was interested to hear the words of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) when he said that in many respects it was Frank Stewart who brought the first recognition to this House and to the nation that tourism was an industry in Australia. I believe that that tribute was spelt out in St Mary's Cathedral just a few short days ago when more than 2,000 people packed that cathedral. The tribute to the work that Frank Stewart had done in that particular area was obvious by the fact that representatives of levels of the tourist industry attended that service. Frank Stewart was, in the best sense of the word, proudly Australian. He loved Australia. He loved everything that Australia stood for. He was convinced of the future of Australia and he let that be known very loudly indeed. Frank Stewart was a man who thought that all decisions should be made in the best interests of Australia. As a result of the many hundreds of hours that members of that Committee spent together, we reaUsed that that was the case. The report that wasfinallyissued was very much the work of Frank Stewart. His influence on it is obvious. It was a report deUvered to this House without one dissenting voice. In that respect a very great tribute. Many honourable members have said that he was a man of great moral courage. He was also a man of great political courage. Frank Stewart was a fine Australian and I am proud that I had the opportunity to serve with him.",23
16,Mr ARMITAGE,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"I wish to support this motion of condolence and to express my sympathy to Mrs Maureen Stewart, her family, and Frank's family. I first met Frank Stewart in 1953 when he had just gained pre-selection for Lang. I was introduced to Frank by John Armstrong, a former Minister in the Chifley Government and a former Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate. He was also a former High Commissioner to London and a former Lord Mayor of Sydney. Frank was a very close friend of John Armstrong throughout John's life. When Ifirstwalked into this chamber this afternoon I wanted to check today's date. I involuntarily turned around to the seat behind me, as I have been in the habit of doing so manytimesin the past for the purpose of checking some details. It is at a time like that that his passing comes home to me. Most of what I wanted to say has already been said today. I refer to Frank's tenacity, his fundamental belief in the place of the family in our society and his determination to fight for the place of family in society, tive of the cost. As has been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and others, and has also been mentioned to me by Senator Reg Bishop, Frank Crean and Gough Whitlam, there was no Minister in the Whitlam Cabinets who went into a meeting better briefed than Frank Stewart. No one read his papers more assiduously. Thus he had the ability tofighttenaciously for what he believed was the correct decision. That has all been said. It was fundamental to everything about him. His loyalty to his church, all his loyalty to the Labor movement and, equally as important, his loyalty to his mates have been mentioned. I think that those are important facets of any man's beliefs and of any man's makeup. Frank had those very great attributes. Once again I wish to express my sympathy to Maureen Stewart and her family.",24
17,Mr RUDDOCK,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"I wish to be associated with this condolence motion not only because I had the opportunity of serving with Frank Stewart in this House but also because of his family's association with mine in other ways. My late father served with his brother in the Parliament of New South Wales. He told me of his fondness for and his admiration of another it is member of the Stewart family. In this House I had the opportunity to know what my father meant. As one who, in a sense, is part of a political family I think I can recognise and respect what happens when members of a family together serve the public and serve their country in the way they think best. I also had the opportunity of serving with Frank Stewart on the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. The Committee was established only recently but it has been working assiduously. It met in Perth, with Frank present, the week before he died. We knew of his intense personal interest in the subject of our deliberations. We recognised his conscientious support of everything that had to do with the family and family Ufe, and its importance to our particular task. We respected his diligence and the assiduous way in which he fulfilled his duties in that role, as he did in all others. He attended all the public hearings we conducted in our short time of operation. I know that other members of the Committee would want me, as Chairman, to speak briefly about his involvement in this area because of its close association with his own personal area of concern and interest in this Parliament, one which transcended, I believe, the political interests that we all have and share. The report of the Committee ultimately will be irrespecpoorer, in my view, for not having him associated with us to the end. I finally want to make an observation, as a non-Catholic, about his churchmanship. He was respected for his churchmanship by, I believe, men and women of all faiths. Mr FitzPATRICK (Riverina)- I rise to associate myself with this motion of condolence on the passing of our friend and colleague, Frank Stewart. It was gratifying to me to hear the previous speakers mention their long years of association with Frank. Unfortunately, I barely knew Frank Stewart before I entered this Parliament but I want to say that it was very gratifying to find after I entered Parliament that we had many things in common. I can well remember with appreciation the many occasions that Frank invited me to go into his office and have a drink and cuss some particular matter. He was a thorough politician. He believed in fully analysing the things before Parliament, particularly the moral issues to which he had a great commitment. I appreciate very much the many things that he did for my electorate during the time he was Minister for Tourism and Recreation. On behalf of the people of the former electorate of Darling and the present electorate of Riverina, I express gratitude for the many things he did for them. It was with some satisfaction to me, although I am still deeply in his debt, that I was able to do something for him in return. He was a great friend and, I believe, a great member liament. I feel very sad at his passing. I offer my deepest sympathy to his loved ones.",24
18,Mr LYNCH,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"Ecclesiasticu s says that the greatest gift that any man can give to the community in which he lives and works is the best that is in him. At all times Frank Stewart gave of his best. Trust, honour, principle and integrity were the hallmarks of the man. I liked Frank Stewart. I trusted and respected him. I pay particular recognition to the contribution which Frank Stewart made to this country's tourist industry as Minister for Tourism and Recreation. As a Catholic, I recognised the steadfast nature of the convictions held by Frank Stewart and the resolute nature in which those convictions were put forward at all times. This Parliament will be the poorer for his passing. I extend my condolences to his widow and family.",25
19,Mr MACKENZIE,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"I wish to pay tribute to Frank Stewart. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin) pointed out that Frank Stewart had many friends. I am unlike them in that my friendship with Frank Stewart was virtually one of only a few months duration. Nevertheless my tribute is a personal rather than public one. I had contact with him on one or two occasions and, as a relatively new back bench member of this House, I found the advice and at times, consolation that he gave me to be most beneficial and rewarding. At times I spoke to him about some of the situations in which one found oneself, particularly in terms of the effect on family life of the commitment that is required of a Federal parliamentarian and the sacrifices that are made by one's wife, children and friends. I once said to him:' How does one handle the situdis- ation when one comes back from Canberra and finds that one's eight-year-old daughter is saying goodbye instead of goodnight?' It was in those sorts of situations that Frank was able to give very good and sound advice, consolation and sympathy. I found him to be a man of extraordinary integrity. I am not of his faith; nevertheless I have very deep respect for him. He said to me at one stage that the most important thing in this game is to retain one's identity and integrity and that sooner or later every individual in this place will come up against a time of testing and that that person should not be found wanting as he has to live with his conscience. It is my honour to of this Par- have known this man.",25
20,Mr NEIL,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE,"The seats of Grayndler and St George are adjoining and it was a privilege for me to be with Frank Stewart on community occasions as well as to learn from his contributions in this House. He was almost an institution in the Canterbury and surrounding areas of Sydney which formed the electorates of Lang and Grayndler. He had a deep devotion to his constituents and gave fully of his time and energy to assist them. Frank Stewart held the respect of the whole community and had a great personal following. He was a kindly man, but also a strongfighterfor his causes. He served his country honourably in peace and war. At recent ANZAC reunions the shock and sense of loss were felt deeply by all present. It did not seem the same without him. The loss of a man of such integrity is a grievous loss to the Parliament. I join in supporting the motion and extend deepest sympathy to Mrs Stewart and her family.",25

(7) The computer network connected to the IBM 360/65 computers has resulted in a net staff saving of about 300 staff. The major saving results from the containment of staff numbers needed for pharmaceutical benefits claims processing which currently involves 627 people. The network centred on the IBM 370/168 computers was established primarily to provide data processing suppon for Medibank. More than 4500 people were employed by the Health Insurance Commission during 1976/77 to administer the Medibank Scheme. It would not have been possible to operate a comparable universal health insurance scheme on this scale without the computer network. Consequently there is no satisfactory basis for assessing notional staff savings by comparison with some alternative wholly clerical system.

(b) The thermodynamic efficiency of the heat pump greatly exceeds the conventional heating methods such as electric or gas space heating. (6) The principle of the heat pump has been taught at Australian universities for many years, and technical data on heat pumps is available in textbooks as well as from the Refrigeration/Air Conditioning Industry in Australia. Hospitals: Tasmania of Hansard for the last five (Question No. 2668) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 26 October 1978: Will Tasmania be funded on a cost/share basis (a) to open its own neo-natal intensive care unit and (b) to provide sufficient staff to open the Douglas Parker Rehabilitation Centre when stage II is complete. series maps of the ACT are avail",27
26,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Cost-sharing of State expansion programs is normally discussed by Commonwealth and State officers at meetings of State Standing Committees held twice a year. I understand that Tasmania has proposed that the Commonwealth cost-share the operating costs of the new Queen Alexandra Women's Hospital in Hobart, which will operate from 1 January 1980. Details of the services to be available at the new hospital have not yet been provided but it may be that this is the neo-natal facility to which the honourable member refers.

29,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 1 would agree that attempts to control public costs through restriction and classification of public hospital beds could to an extent be nullified if compensating increases in private hospital beds and bed utilisation take place. I have no legislative authority to prevent the Hospital poration of America entering the private hospital industry. (2) The State Governments public hospital bed expansion as they have a responsibility in financing individual recognised (public) hospitals. Commonwealth through its cost sharing arrangements does not exercise an influence in hospital bed expansion. With regard to private hospitals, the primary responsiin bility for the licensing or registering hospitals rests with the State ister legislation covering the registration or licensing of premises as private hospitals (as directed to standards) only two States are known to have legislation to controls over the growth of the private hospital industry. The Commonwealth Government's role in this approval of premises as private hospitals, Insurance Act, for payment of the $ 16 a day bed payment.

Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Since the amendment of Air Navigation Regulation 106A in April 1976, seven travel organisations have been visited by Commonwealth Police. On two of these occasions a Department of Transport Officer was also present. I have not mentioned the names of these organisations because of the adverse effect which public disclosure could have on their operations. (2) Two visits were made in 1976, one visit in 1977 and four in 1978. Aborigines: Kimberley Region Mr Dawkins asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 24 November 1978: (1) Was the estimate of Aboriginal population in the Kimberley region as contained in the Butcher report tabled in Parliament, 8,250 in 1977.

(3) to (6) With regard to both the Pilbara and Kimberley of Western Australia, Mr Butcher indicated that in his opinion Aboriginal population data were inaccurate. that these matters will be The population data for both Mr Boundy's and Mr Butcher's report are based on information from two different departments closely involved with Aboriginals and both reprovide estimates in excess of the 1976 Census figure of Police 6,349 Aboriginal people in the Kimberleys. However, the statistical methodology employed differs from that (Question No. 3118) employed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In addition are inconsistencies in Mr Boundy's methodology which give rise to reservations as to the reliability of his estimates. Mr Butcher pointed out in his report that forward planning both the Pilbara and Kimberley regions is necessary and correct population data are essential for this. My Department is now gathering population data based on each Aboriginal community or group in these areas and forward planning will be based on this information. Unemployment (Question No. 3127) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 20 February 1979: (1) Are any figures available for discouraged workers (defined by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics as a person who wants a job but has not looked for one during the preceding 4 weeks); if so, what are they. (2) Are figures available on those persons available for work, who had sought employment in the preceding 6 months but had not looked in the past 4 weeks; if so, what are they. (Question No. 3126) Mr VINER - The answer to the honourable member's question, which was supplied to me by the Australian Statistician, is as follows: (1) Estimates of the number of discouraged job-seekers in Australia were obtained from surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in November 1975 and May 1977. Results were published in 'Persons Not in the Labour Force' (ABS Catalogue No. 6220.0). Discouraged jobseekers were denned as persons not in the labour force who wanted a job but were not looking for work because they believed that they would not be able to find a job for any of the following reasons: they were considered too young or too old by employers; language or racial difficulties; they lacked the necessary training, skills or experience; or there were no jobs available in their locality or line of work. The estimated total number in November 1975 was 33,800 and in May 1977 65,500. The ABS is planning to collect further information on discouraged job-seekers in March and September 1979. (2) This information is not available from surveys which have been conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Exports of Primary Products Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 20 February 1979: (1) Are there any advantages for Australian exporters meat and other fresh produce in the use of Dormovac shiphealth ping containers. (2) If so (a) which products for which markets will receive the greatest benefit; and (b) what is being done to obtain these containers.",31
31,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable Government member's question is as follows: (1) At this point of time it is too early to assess whether the Dormovac containers offer advantages to Australian exthat porters of fresh produce. These containers maintain lower than normal atmospheric pressures with controlled humidity in addition to lowered temperature. claimed that the storage life of chilled products such as meat, fruit andflowersis significantly extended. (2) (a) If the system is successful, one application may be in the shipment of chilled carcase sheepmeat and beef by sea .with lower freight costs than by air. In this respect, the market of most immediate potential benefit is the Middle East, particularly for sheep-meats. Two Dormovac containers were used for trial shipments of lamb to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates arriving late January/early February and a further shipment of sheepmeat is planned shortly. The system may prove to be an important means of shipping the more perishable fruits and I am not aware of any trial shipments undertaken to assess its feasibility. (2) (b) These containers are available for purchase from the manufacturer in the United States. The provision of the containers is seen as a private enterprise venture, either by an entrepreneur, exporter or shipping company.",32

Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (Question No. 3146) (I ) The Independent Inquiry into the Repatriation System took over four years to complete and produced 303 recommendations and conclusions. This is an indication of the complexity of the Repatriation System. Since the tabling of of the Report there have been many important changes in and welfare benefits available to the Australian community. These changes must necessarily be taken into account in the consideration of the recommendations contained in the Report. The Government has ignored none of these recommendations. Indeed, when any aspect of the Repatriation System is under review it is the practice of the to take into account the relevant comments and recommendations in the Report. In summary, the present position regarding the Report is the Government has accepted (fully or partially) 67 recommendations. It has not accepted 30 and has under consideration 161. The remaining 45 recommendations require By this method it is no further action.

(2) How many times in each of the last 10 years have the levels of hydrocarbons, oxidants, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen exceeded World Health Organisation standards for (a) long-term and (b) short-term measurements in each of these dues. (3) What was the frequency of atmospheric temperature inversion in each of the cities referred to in part (1) in each of the last 10 years. (4) What are the standards for short and long-term measurements of hydro-carbons, oxidants, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen adopted by (a) Japan, (b) the United States, (c) the European Economic Community, (d) Canada, (e) Australia and (f) the WHO. Mr Groom-The Minister for Science and the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I ) and (2) The air quality data contained in Tables I to 4 that follow have been obtained from the National Air Quality Data Centre presently being set up by the Department of OZONE DATA FOR AUSTRALIAN CITIES (ALL Location sites 1974 Sydney 3 Melbourne 2 Brisbane I Perth I 1975 Sydney 3 All Multi- 5 bed 4 bed 3 bed 2 bed I bed bed bed ward ward ward ward ward fee ward fee Tee fee fee fee 19.35 22.30 22.30 23.55 22.95 23.10 23.45 23.45 24.45 22.20 24.05 24.75 25.75 -26.75 23.05 23.60 Air Pollution Science and the Environment. The information has been derived from available data sources over the years indicated, (Question No. 3245) published by State and Commonwealth bodies concerned with air quality monitoring. Where data for a city or for a year has not been presented, no monitoring of the pollutant has been carried out. It will be noted that, in general, data are only available for Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. The data tables contain the average and maximum levels of pollutants. The number of days that the World Health Organisation goals have been exceeded at urban monitoring stations in each major city are also presented in the tables. (3) The atmosphere over any point on the earth's surface is never without some sort of temperature inversion such as the tropopause which occurs at an altitude of about 9 to 16 kilometres. The type of temperature inversion with a potential for affecting the air quality of any locality is much lower, typically up to about 1000 metres above the surface. The detection of such inversions require specialised equipment. The systematic study of these inversions is being developed in the major Australian cities by the Bureau of Meteorology, the CSIRO and others, but comprehensive long-term statistics on their occurrence are as yet not available. (4) The air quality standards and goals for various countries and organisations, compiled from the latest available information, are shown in Table 5. There are no promulgated standards in Australia but the WHO long-term goals are often used as areferencefor assessing air quality in this country. The European Economic Community has not established any air quality standards. Table 1 NA WHERE OTHERWISE INDICATED) No. days No. days W.H.O. W.H.O. 8hr goal I hr goal exc. 8hr exc. lhr Max. Max.

To the contrary Aboriginal Hostels Ltd have advised that renovations to the buildings are almost completed. (2) Aboriginal Hostels Ltd have advised that of the total estimated expenditure of $116,152 on renovations, architect's fees comprised $5,778 (or approximately 5 per cent).

Cattle Tick Pesticides Mr Uren asked the Minister for dustry, on notice, on 8 March 1979: (1) What pesticides are used to control cattle ticks. (2) In what manner are they applied. (3) What safety precautions are recommended for their application. (4) Has the Government assessed the possible effects of use of these pesticides on human results of this assessment.",43
37,Mr SINCLAIR,AIR QUALITY GOALS OR STANDARDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following compounds are registered and currently used in several Australian States to control cattle tick: amitraz, bromophos-ethyl plus chlorfenvinphos, chlorpyrifos, chloromethiuron, clenpyrin, coumaphos, diazinon, dioxathion, ethion, phosmet, promacyl. (2) All may be applied as a spray. All, with the exception of phosmet may be applied as a dip. In addition to the compounds listed, it is understood that there may still be some very isolated usage of arsenic, which is registered dip. (3) Appropriate safety precautions are set out in detail on the labels of products registered make provision for the safety of users, bystanders, consumers, livestock, wildlife, the environment and trade and take into account recommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council (see also answer to (4) below). (4) The Poisons Schedule Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH & MRC) has considered detailed toxicology data on these compounds and has made recommendations on scheduling and labelling which include safety directions and first aid instructions to appear on labels. The Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals Sub-Committee of the NH & MRC has evaluated available scientific data on each of the above compounds and has determined a daily intake for man which, during an entire lifetime, appears to be without appreciablerisk.Maximum residue limits in meat and milk have been recommended and the majority of these have been incorporated into State legislation. These limits generally follow those recommended by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting of Experts on Pesticide Residues which have been adopted as recommended international standards. Regular inspection and monitoring of food derived from treated animals is carried out by a range of Commonwealth and State instrumentalities to ensure compliance with legal limits. Australia Council Aborigines: Apprenticeships (Question No. 3335) (Question No. 3424) Mr Wallis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 1979: (1) How many Aboriginal youths in the Electoral Division of Grey have received apprenticeships under the National Employment Scheme for Aborigines. (2) In what (a) establishments and (b) trades is each to be trained. (3) How many received apprenticeships in (a) Federal and (b) State Government instrumentalities.

An additional three have received apprenticeships under the NEAT Scheme. (2) (a) (i) Electricity Trust of South Australia, (ii) Department of Highways, (iii) Department of Administrative Services. (b) 1 fitter and turner; 2 motor mechanics. (3) (a) One. (b) Two. health; if so, what were the Air Freight Services (Question No. 3425) Mr Jul! asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 8 March 1979: (1) Does Qantas provide pure freight services into and out of Australia. (2) If not, what studies have been made of the viability of Qantas providing such services for Australian industry. (3) How many pure freight charters were operated into and out of Australia in 1978 and which companies were infor use as a volved in these operations. (4) What was the nature of the cargo carried by these foreign air freight carriers. by State authorities. These (5) What access do Australian domestic airlines have to the international air freight market using their own freight airlines. (6) What was the estimated cost to Australian industry of the foreign air freight charters during 1978. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The term 'pure freight services' is taken to mean those services where freight capacity occupies either the whole or a substantial part of the aircraft's maindeck. On this basis Qantas provides pure freight services into and out of Australia by: (a) leasing 25 per cent of the total cargo space provided by the twice weekly Panam B747F freight service on the Australia/US route, amounting to about 20 tonnes per flight and totalling 40 tonnes per week in each direction. (b) operating B747 Combi services each with about 30 tonnes of freight capacity once weekly between Australia and the USA, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, and twice weekly between Australia and Japan. This capacity will be augmented late in 1979 following the delivery of a second B747 Combi aircraft which will service European and US routes. (c) a commercial arrangement also exists between Qantas and Lufthansa which permits Qantas to utilise relatively small amounts of freight space on Lufthansa B747 Combi services between Australia and Frankfurt. (2) Both the Department of Transport and Qantas have studies underway to determine how Australia's international airfreight services should be provided following the review of Australia's international civil aviation policy. (3) During 1978 202 freight charter nights were operated into Australia and 167 were operated from Australia. The companies which operated theseflightswere: International Aviation Services (UK) Ltd, Transmeridian Air Cargo Ltd, Cargolux Airlines International SA, Japan Air Lines, Trans International Airlines Inc., The Flying Tiger Line Korean Air Lines, British Caledonian Airways Ltd, Ansett Airlines of Australia Ltd, Air Express Ltd, Air Niugini, British Airways, Bush Pilots Airways Ltd, Safe Air Ltd. (4) Freight carried inbound by these foreign and domestic carriers included automotive parts, mechanical goods, books, cosmetics, chemicals, horses, musical instruments, pharmaceuticals, toys, tea, computers, clothing, stationery, textiles, cameras, plastics, coffee, shoes, electrical goods, communications equipment, chewing gum, textiles, vending machines, television sets, industrial gas, film supplies, oil drilling equipment, beer cans, seafood and building supplies. Freight carried outbound by these foreign and domestic carriers included chilled lamb, horses, livestock, sound equipment, communications equipment, building supplies, frozen beef, vegetables, oil drilling equipment, beer, explosives, computer equipment, photographic equipment, furnishings, household effects and cars. (5) Australian domestic airlines may operate international air freightflightsusing their own aircraft: (a) if the freight to be carried meets the appropriate single entity or split charter requirements of the Governments international air freight charter policy, and (b) subcharter of the aircraft Airlines of Australia Ltd has approval to operate in their own right up to 12 trans-Tasman livestock flights per year). (6) Figures on costs for carriage by charter flights are not available because the Australian Government makes no stipulation on freight rates for suchflights;the cost is a commercial matter for negotiation between the shipper and carrier. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 March 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Financial Times of 2 March 1979 that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has drawn up a code aimed at curbing the use tional companies to reduce their tax liabilities; if so, does the code exist. (2) Did Australia contribute in any way to the preparation of this code; if so, what was the contribution. (3) What is Australia's attitude to this code, and what effect will these recommendations have on multinational porations operating in Australia.",44
38,Mr HOWARD,AIR QUALITY GOALS OR STANDARDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My attention has been drawn to a report in the Australian Financial Review of 2 March 1979 by a Financial Times writer on the subject mentioned. It would be premature to say at this stage that a code exists, as the OECD Council has not yet considered the matter. (2) Australia has provided comments to the group in the OECD which examined this matter. (3) Australia's long standing attitude, as evidenced by its domestic tax law and the double taxation agreements it has entered into, is that the principle of arm's length dealing, on which the OECD report is based, should be used in determining profits on international transactions between associated enterprises, so as to ensure that transnational corporations pay an appropriate amount of Australian tax on profits from activities on this country. Transnational Corporations (Question No. 3442) Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 29 March 1979: (1) Has the Australian Government participated in any discussion at the United Nations about introduction of a Code of Conduct for the operation of transnational corporations. (2) If so, what progress has been made at these discussions.",45
39,Mr HOWARD,AIR QUALITY GOALS OR STANDARDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. A draft Code of Conduct is to be prepared by an Ad Hoc Inter-Governmental Working Group under the auspices of the UN Commission on Transnational Corporations. Australia has participated in and continues to participate in meetings of the Working Group and was originally a founding member of the Commission. Since 1977, when we ceased to be a member of the Commission, Australia has attended its meetings as an observer. is offered to Qantas. (Ansett (2) The Working Group is at present attempting to prepare an agreed outline of the Code. Reserve Bank: Monetary Policy (Question No. 3444) Mr Willis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: (1) Has the Governor of the Reserve Bank made any major statement in recent years of the same nature as public lectures which he gave in 1971 and 1972 about monetary Development policy and the approach of the Bank. (Question No. 3432) (2) If not, is there any reason for the apparent change in policy of Governors of the Bank giving these periodic lectures. (3) Is there any reason why the Reserve Bank should not make a statement about its current approach to monetary policy, given that the Bank's annual report is written in a most general and concise form. of transfer pricing by multina",45
40,Mr HOWARD,AIR QUALITY GOALS OR STANDARDS,"The following answer to the honourable member's question is based on advice received from the Reserve Bank: (I ) Reserve Bank Governors and Deputy Governors have continued to speak on economic and monetary subjects, incorcluding comment from time to time on aspects of monetary policy. Examples of such addresses since 1972 are: September 1973-Governor-Sevent h Monash Economics Lecture: 'Some Aspects of Allowing for the Future'. March 1975-Governor-Australia n Association of Permanent Building Societies Annual Conference: 'Some Policy Challenges'. February 1976-Governor-29th International Banking Summer School: 'Central Banking in a Changing Environment'. April 1978-Deput y Governor-Committe e for Economic Development of Australia/Commercial Law Association of Australia: 'The Australian Capital MarketPressures for Change'. The text of each of these addresses has been made public. (2) and (3) There has been no change of policy. There is no reason why the Governor and Deputy Governor should not be heard publicly from time to time and I would expect this to take place. Manpower Planning Mr Willis asked the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: What action has been taken on the recommendations of the Commonwealth/State Working Party on Manpower Planning.",45
41,Mr VINER,AIR QUALITY GOALS OR STANDARDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The report of the joint Commonwealth/State Working Party on Manpower Planning was presented to the September 1978 Conference of Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers. At this Conference it was agreed by the Ministers for Labour that the Working Party Report should be re-examined following publication of the Report of the Study Group on Structural Adjustment under the chairmanship of Sir John Crawford, and the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training under the chairmanship of Professor B.

(2) What was the (a) date of and (b) reason for the withdrawal or curtailment in each case. (3) What additional rail services have been established Tasmania since the transfer. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable $ 181.00 member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) (a) Passenger services between Hobart and Wynyard (""The Tasman"") and Hobart and Parattah (""The prior Rail Car"") ceased after 28 July 1978, as eration was in the commercial judgement of ANR not justified. Freight services between Winnaleah and Herrick were withdrawn on I October 1978, due to the condition of a bridge which was condemned for future use. (b) Scheduled freight services between Ledgerwood and Herrick were replaced from 31 July 1978 by an ""as required"" service, to improve the viability of this branch line. Between and 1 October 1978, a freight train service operated between Ledgerwood and Herrick on an average of three days per week for the transport of wagonloads, subject to a minimum of two tonnes per wagon. After 1 October has operated between Ledgerwood and Winnaleah, for the reason specified in (a) above. Since 26 February 1979 a service has operated to Winnaleah due to the commenceand ment of log loading at Derby. Scheduled freight services between Wiltsnire Junction and Smithton and Wiltshire Junction and Stanley werereplacedfrom 31 July required"" service, to improve the viability of these branch lines. Since that date a daily shunting service on both lines and from Wiltshire Junction has been provided subject minimum of two tonnes per wagon. Transport of livestock ceased as from I October 1978, because of the losses being incurred in carrying this traffic, and the very low utilisation facilities. (3) No additional services have been established, but ANR advise the freight services in most areas have been adjusted to meet traffic demand. Department of Transport: Workers' Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: (1) How many compensatable accidents occurred during 1977-78 which were charges against his Department's compensation appropriation. (2) What were the principal types of compensatable accidents. (3) Can he provide details of the amount of compensation paid in each case; if not, what were the bottom, middle and top ranges of compensation paid. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Seven hundred and thirty-two accidents occurred between 1 July 1977 and 30 June 1978 which were charges against my Department's compensation appropriation. (Question No. 3464) (2) The principal compensatable accidents involved injuries to the trunk of the body. These included such disabilities as cuts, fractures, burns, scalds, strains, internal injuries and a significant percentage of back injuries. Injuries to leg and hand were also common. (3) I am unable to provide details of the amount of compensation paid in each of the 732 casesrecordedbetween I July 1977 and 30 June 1978. The lowest amount of compensation paid during that period, concerned an employee who attended a doctor but had no time off work. The amount involved was $8.60 in (medical expenses). A typical middle range compensation case was one where an employee had twenty-four days' compensation leave as a result of a fracture and incurred medical expenses. Total cost to my Department was $1,710.16. The highest compensation payment made during the specified period was due to the death of an employee. An amount of $30,278.00 was paid including medical expenses to death, funeral costs (up to $650.00) and a $25,000 their continued oplump sum paid to spouse.

(2) Will this result in a drop in the real spending power available to the States under this item for 1978-79. (3) How much did each State request'in total for expenditure under this item. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) The funds provided under Division 958 Item 01 for the promotion of road safety practices are grants to the States and can be regarded as a small supplement to the funds expended by the States themselves for such purposes. The allocation was held at $ 150,000 for 1978-79. On the other hand, direct expenditure by the Commonwealth on the promotion of road safety practices is provided for under Division 655 Item 03. In 1978-79 $800,000 was allocated for Road Safety Research and Promotion. It is from the expenditure of these funds by my Department that the States receive large quantities of educational materials, films, booklets and the like for use in nationally co-ordinated projects.

43,Mr HOWARD,AIR QUALITY GOALS OR STANDARDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The question of which institutions are to be accepted as non-shareholder prime lenders and so have access to Primary Industry Bank funds is essentially one for the Bank itself to decide, although the provisions of the Primary Industry Bank Act 1977 requiring the Bank to keep the Treasurer informed as to its policies and proposed policies, and in certain circumstances to consult with him in relation to them, are relevant. I am informed that the Primary Industry Bank has accepted applications for prime lender status from three pastoral finance companies. I understand that the Bank expects to announce the names of these companies and that they will have access to the Bank's funds as soon as legal formalities are completed. (2) I am informed that stock mortgages are acceptable within the policies of the Primary Industry Bank. However, security for loans refinanced by the Primary Industry Bank is arranged between the prime lender, which accepts any risk associated with the loan, and its customer, the primary producer, and the Bank is not involved in decisions on individual cases.

(2) If the arrangements cannot be publicised, what is necessary to allow the Bank to do so. (3) Has this proposal been seriously considered before; if not, will it now be considered.",48
45,Mr HOWARD,AIR QUALITY GOALS OR STANDARDS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2) and (3)1I have consulted the Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation on the point raised in the question and the following is based on his advice. The Commonwealth Development Bank can and does accept stock or plant mortgages as security for its loans. It is prepared to consider requests for finance from a share farmer where the purpose falls within the scope of its lending policy and the applicant meets the general criteria set out in its printed lending policy statement. The statement of the Bank's lending policy is a public document and is freely available to members of the farming community.

(3 ) When are they likely to be introduced into service. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable to member's question is as follows: (1) The commissioning of Purpose and Australian Progress has been delayed due to the depressed world trading conditions level of iron ore cargoes from Australia to Japan which have prevented the introduction of these two vessels into the trade in addition to the Australian Pioneer and Australian Prospector which were introduced in February 1977. (2) In reaching agreement with the Japanese steel mills the introduction of the second large bulk carrier Australian Prospector, it wasrecognisedthat the Japanese mills could not guarantee acceptance of the remaining two vessels into the trade before April 1979 although they agreed to review the matter in the meantime. Although the Line has consistprovision ently pressed for earlier introduction this has not been possible. (3) April 1979.

54,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NORTHERN DIVISION OF ANR,"On 21 March 1979 (Hansard, page 949) the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) asked me a question, without notice, concerning assistance for workers unemployed because of damage caused to plant at the Dampier Salt operations by Cyclone Hazel. I promised that I would check see whether there had been any communication 1979: in relation to this matter from Western Australia. The following additional information to the turn answer I gave then to the honourable member's on Morrissett question is provided: The Commonwealth's role is to provide financial support to the State for agreed measures. With respect curred generally because of Cyclone Hazel, the Western Australian Government has sought and obtained the Commonwealth 's agreement to the implementation of certain core measures in accordance with the natural disaster financial assistance arrangements. No special assistance in respect of the Dampier Salt operations has been requested by the State Government. I have also received representations on this matter from the Shire of Carnarvon. The position is that all persons affected by the Cyclone are immediately entitled to assistance financed jointly by the Commonwealth and the State for the relief of personal hardship and distress. In the short term, of course, those unemployed are entitled to unemployment benefit and the Commonwealth Departments concerned naturally expedite the processing of their entitlements. In the longer term, it is usually found that employment picks up rapidly in cyclone affected areas as repair and reconstruction work gets underway. I assure the people of Western Australia of the full support of the Commonwealth as provided under the natural disaster financial assistance arrangements. (Question No. 3620) Particular relief and restoration measures to be applied are, however, a matter for the State to determine. It would be improper for the Commonwealth to pre-empt any arrangements the Western Australian Government may wish to apply. first paid on 10 October Travel Credits .

57,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NORTHERN DIVISION OF ANR,"The answer to the honourable member's question, as at 1979, is as follows: The Committee on Official Establishments in an interim repon in April 1977 indicated ters to be the subject of future recommendations, would be the integration of Admiralty House and Kirribilli House so that the combined facility would become the main accommodation for the Governor General, the Prime Minister and for Government VIP guests. When the Committee makes its recommendations, and its final report is expected to be available shortly, the Government will give them close examination. Co-operative arrangements between Admiralty House and Kirribilli House in fact go back a long way. Leopard Tanks (Question No. 3382) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 7 March 1979: (1) What offset orders arising from the contract to purchase Leopard Tanks have been placed with Australian firms. (2) What contracts have been offered to Australian firms but not finalised. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable did not call for member's question is as follows: (1) The current total value of offset orders placed on Australian firms as a result of the Leopard Tank purchase is approximately $3m. The higher value orders were for electrical connectors, machine tools, refrigeration equipment parts, lead for tank batteries and a small quantity of nickel as used in tank track alloy steel. Smaller orders have also been fulfilled for plastic lenses, electrical leads, electrical pans and lubrication equipment. (2) A large number of other contacts with Australian companies have been made by Krauss MafTei and their subcontractors, but few actual negotiations are in progress due to difficulties in finding suitable matches between present requirements of the German firms and Australian secondary industry products. The prime contractor, Krauss MafTei, has recently undertaken to increase the volume of bid opportunities to Australian industry; many of those received so far have not been suitable for Australian firms to quote due to quality and (Question No. 3341) quantity considerations but a moderate volume of business could arise from the remainder if the prices quoted are competitive with European suppliers. Whale Products (Question No. 3426) Mr Jul! asked the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 1979: (1) Does the Government allow the import of whale products; if so, what is the nature of the products imported. (2) Is whale meat used in any pet food sold in Australia; if so, which type. (3) Are whale oils used as a base for any cosmetics or soaps sold on the Australian market; if so, which types. (4) Will the Government be considering banning the imports involved as a means of curbing whale slaughter. Mr Fife-The answer to the honourable 19 March member's question is as follows: (I ) , (2) and (3) Yes but only from countries which are members of the International Whaling Commission. that one of the principal matDetails of imported whale products or of the use of such products are not readily available. However the Repon of the Independent Inquiry into Whales and Whaling conducted by the Honourable Sir Sydney Frost includes some information about such matters. The report was tabled in Parliament on 20 February 1979 and I invite the honourable member's attention in particular to Chapter 7 and Appendix 13 of that report. (4) The Government's future policy on whales and whaling was announced in a Statement made by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives on 4 April 1979. As part of that policy the importation into Australia of all whale products and goods containing them will be banned from 1 January 1981. Aborigines: Infant Mortality Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 1979: (1) Has infant mortality among Northern Territory Aborigines risen to 75 per 1000 live births since 1975. (2) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an allegation in the publication Farewell to Alms, Vol. 2, No. 2, 1978, that the Social Development Branch of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has consistently refused to provide residual welfare services on reserves as distinct from serwith vices at Darwin, Katherine, Gove, Alangula, Tennant Creek or Alice Springs; if so, is there any substance in the allegation. (3) Is there evidence that fant mortality.",55

(3) There is evidence of a correlation between poverty and high rates of infant mortality, and infant mortality rates sensitive indicator of general living conditions. Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister for Adrninistrative Services, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: (1) Does the Commonwealth Police Headquarters in Canberra house a National Central Bureau for Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organisation. (2) Are there any other points of contact between Interpol and any other organisations in Australia; if so, what are these points of contact. (3) Under what guidelines does the Commonwealth Police pass information from its files to Interpol. (4) What restrictions are imposed on the passing of information to Interpol. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commissioner, Commonwealth Police has advised that the Commonwealth Police Headquarters in Canberra does house a National Central Bureau for Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organisation. (2) The Commissioner advises further that Article 32 of the Interpol constitution signifies that the co-operation be(Question No. 3428) tween Interpol agencies should be extended through the National Central Bureaux and that no other official point of contact therefore exists within Australia. (3) and (4) I am also informed that Commonwealth Police files are kept separate from those of the National Central Bureau. In its dealings with ICPO-Interpol , Commonwealth Police abides by Article 3 of the ICPO-Interpo l Constitution which states that the organisation's field of activity is limited to crime prevention and law enforcement in connection with offences against general criminal law. Commonwealth Police only pass on information in accordance those criteria. Further Article 3 of the constitution states that 'It is strictly forbidden for the Organisation to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character'. poverty contributes to high inMarine Science Research (Question No. 34S4) Mr Morris asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: What action has he taken to implement the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee No. of No. of Infant on Environment and Conservation in its report on Oil Spills live infant mortality that he request the Australian Science and Technology deaths rate Council to examine the need for increased marine science research. 45 50.1 44 52.8 Mr MALCOLM FRASER - The answer to the 62 74.6 honourable member's question is as follows: n.a. *43.4 I refer the honourable member to my speech in the House on 29 March 1979 concerning the Australian Science and Technology Council (Hansard, 29 March 1979, paragraphs 5 and 6 on page 1320). ASTEC has examined this matter and in its Report on Sciare a ence and Technology in Australia 1977-78 Volume IA, it recommended 'that greater attention be paid to the marine sciences and technologies in Australia'. The Government Interpol accepts this recommendation. It recognises the great import(Question No. 3449) ance of the marine sciences and technologies in our future well-being. The importance of marine science has increased in recent years, particularly in relation to off-shore energy resources and the utilisation and management of resources in our expanded off-shore economic zone. The Government has also accepted ASTEC's suggestion that an Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee (AMSTAC) be established. The Committee will investigate and report on the co-ordination of research and development and the establishment of priorities in this area. Maintenance and Repair of Foreign Ships Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: Will he. in co-operation with shipping unions, initiate discussions with foreign shipping lines trading regularly with Australia to encourage them to have a proportion of their ship maintenance and repair work undertaken in Australia. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Following its recent inquiry into Commercial Ship Repair, the Industries Assistance Commission concluded that a very high level of assistance would be needed to make ship repair prices in Australia competitive with overseas. Even then, the time taken for repairs and fear disputes would weigh heavily with shipowners. Consequently, the Industries Assistance Commission recommended against any change in the present financial or legislative assistance given to the industry and rejected requests aimed at a measure of compulsion to use local repairers.

The decision on where to have (Question No. 3479) a ship repaired should be made by the foreign shipowner, after taking into account all of the commercial factors involved. Australian National Line: Overseas Docking (Question No. 3480) Mr Humphreys asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: (1) How many Australian National Line flag ships were repaired in dry dock outside Australia in the last S years. (2) When were the ships docked and in which foreign pons. (3) What was the cost of each docking. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable of delays caused by industrial member's question is as follows: Replies to the first two questions are set out in the table hereunder. Ship owners normally regard docking costs to be confidential commercial information. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to make these available.

Commonwealth Police at Maralinga Mr Uren asked the Minister for Administratmember's ive Services, upon notice, on 27 March 1979: (1) How many Commonwealth policemen were stationed at Maralinga and its immediate surrounds over the period of the British weapons testing program. (2) How many of these policemen have (a) since contracted cancer or leukaemia and (b) died of these diseases. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) (a) and (b). Having regard to the resources involved in searching out records that are between 14 and 27 years old, and the ensuing problem of tracing members of the Commonwealth Police who could be located in a number of countries, I do not think it would be appropriindependently ate for me to authorise the considerable expenditure ary to search out and check the detailed information required to answer the question by the honourable member.

(4) Is the Australian wheat crop being independently monitored by this or some other US satellite system. (5) Have any Australians been involved in any way in this or any other crop surveillance work to ensure that this new technology is available to Australia. (Question No. 3S1S) Mr SINCLAIR - The answer to the honourable question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Canada actively participated in phase 3 of the project but Russia did not. No other country actively participated. However, imagery of several wheat growing countries, including Canada, Russia and Australia has been used in the LACIE project. (3) No. Australia was not invited. We have, however, had access to the data obtained from the satellites. (4) Yes. Data from the LANDSAT Satellites is used to expenditure of monitor the Australian wheat crop. (5) Yes. The New South Wales Depanment of Agriculexture, for example, is actively engaged in a remote sensing wheat monitoring project which has been developed of LACIE but is making use of some of its necessmethodology. The Standing Committee on Agriculture, through its Agricultural Remote Sensing Committee, will be using theresultsof the New South Wales project to assist the in the development of a wheat monitoring system further with based upon satellite data. It is well known that the Commonwealth Government is Sales Tax establishing facilities for receiving and processing informationreceivedfrom the United States LANDSAT satellites (Question No. 3530) and it is expected that these facilities will be operating by Aborigines: Voting Rights (Question No. 3623) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 3 April 1979: (1) What have been the results of programs initiated by his Depanment to educate Aborigines on their voting rights and how to use them. (2) In what areas have these programs been carried out. (3) When can it be anticipated that such a program will be carried out in South Australia and, in particular, in the Aboriginal areas within the Electoral Division of Grey. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable These have member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Section 42 (5) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 gives Aboriginal people therightto choose whether or not they enrol as electors. Against this background the Australian Electoral Office in consultation with other appropriate authorities has undertaken a variety of electoral edu(Question No. 3612) cation activities aimed at ensuring that Aboriginal people are equipped to meet their electoral responsibilities should they choose to enrol. Since 1962, when the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 amended to make enrolment for Aboriginal people a matter of choice, the Australian Electoral Office has conducted ad hoc visits to Aboriginal communities in order to them with their electoralrightsand responsibilities. In comparatively recent times the Australian Electoral Office has begun to use more effective means to communicate these participating with the ideas. For the 1977 Northern Territory Legislative Assembly elections and the last Federal general election some of the specific activities included: (a) the issuing of special instructions to Presiding Officers to ensure that assistance to non-literate voters was properly given. These instructions covered the marking of ballot-papers, the use of how-to-vote cards and the secrecy of the vote in respect of non-literate voters; (b) Poll Clerks fluent in Aboriginal languages were employed at specified polling places; (c) posters aimed at assisting those Aboriginal people who were literate in in Aboriginal languages and displayed at polling places at which Aboriginal electors were expected to vote. Additionally, similar information was prepared in leaflet form for general distribution to Aboriginal communities; (d) cassette tape-recordings, films and video-cassette recordings were made about electoral procedures. These were distributed to radio and television stations and to Aboriginal communities; (e) in conjunction with the Western Australian Department of Education a special pilot electoral education program was conducted amongst Aboriginal people in the Kimberley area of Western Australia. The success of activities such as these is difficult to measure since many factors may influence the voting behaviour of dividuals. In the case of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election the Australian Electoral that it is significant that there vote from S.08 per cent of the total vote in 1974 to 3.18 per cent of the total vote in 1977. While similar available for the Kimberley area in Western Australia the opinion of special observers sent to polling booths in this area was that the special pilot electoral education program had had a significant beneficial nal people. Specific pre-election information/education activities such as these will be continued in the future. In addition the Australian Electoral Office has recognised the need to have an effective continuing program of electoral education for Aboriginal people. To this end a program has commenced. The staff for the initial phase of the program have begun their training and the detailed planning of field operations. This program will involve two mobile education teams and the overall initiative has been developed in close co-operation with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Council for Aboriginal Development and the National Aboriginal Education Committee. In order to avoid confusing Aboriginal people, the Commonwealth Government has sought and received the co-operation of both the South Australian and Western Australian Governments with respect to the inclusion of information in the program. As the program moves into the Northern Territory, Queensland and other States the Commonwealth Government will be seeking to establish similar co-operative arrangements. (3) The exact timing of visits to Aboriginal communities including those planned for the Electoral Division of Grey, cannot be given at this stage since consultation with the leaders of those communities has yet to take place. In broad terms, it is expected that field operations will commence in South Australia and Western Australia in the first half of June 1979. I can assure the honourable member for Grey that the Australian Electoral program effective. Government Medical Contributions Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 3 April 1979: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the General Practitioner Society that their Major Medical Plan underwritten by the Australian Casualty Company does not need the 40 per cent contribution from the Government.

(4) Can he say which country or countries are considered a threat to Australia. (5) How real is the threat referred to in part (4). Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable about State electoral procedures member's question is as follows: (1) to (5) The Government's objectives in the development of the Defence Force were outlined in my statement to the House on 29 March 1979. They relate to the defence of Australia as a nation, and not only to the protection of our approximately 36,800 kilometre coastline. Against current strategic assessments, the Government believes that the funds presently allocated for defence purposes provide an appropriate level of insurance for Australia against therisksinherent in the potentialities and uncertainties of our strategic environment. Office is intent on making this It has also ensured that those funds are used to the best advantage having regard to the likelihood, importance and timing of the various credible but contingent possibilities of military threat to Australia.
