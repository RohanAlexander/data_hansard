10,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,"I am very pleased to nominate the honourable member for Cunningham, Mr Martin, to be Speaker of the House of Representatives. Stephen Martin was elected as the member for Macarthur in 1984 and at the recent election was returned to Parliament as the member for Cunningham. Throughout his time as a member of the House he has shown a keen interest in all aspects of parliamentary procedure. I feel confident in saying that electing the honourable member for Cunningham as Speaker will be a great recognition not only of his own contribution to the Parliament but also of the region of Australia he represents, the great Illawarra industrial region of New South Wales. .",14
11,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,And rugby league.,14
12,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,"I will come to rugby league in a moment. I feel sure that Stephen Martin will distinguish himself as Speaker in the same way as he has demonstrated skiIls as an active and interested advocate for the Illawarra region, in the same way as he has demonstrated a capacity to understand ordido nary Australians from that part of Australia and in the same way as he has been pleased to be a strong proponent of the Illawarra Steelers in the Parliament on numerous occasions. His contribution in those various facets of his life, including his time as a· rugby league referee, demonstrates some of the attributes that are needed as a Speaker in the Parliament. I notice that he is discussing the idea of a sin-bin and various initiatives like that which could be quite useful in some respects. The role of Speaker is a very important one in the continuity of parliamentary democracy. We all recognise the important attributes that are required in chairing the proceedings and in ensuring that the process of the development of the Parliament proceeds. Throughout his time in the Parliament the honourable member for Cunningham has been a very active member of many parliamentary committees and a very strong advocate of the parliamentary committee system. Through his contributions in those roles he has appreciated the important part the parliamentary committee system gives to backbench members of parliament in the policy development process. Throughout the time. I have worked with the honourable member for Cunningham on committees I have found him to be both a creative and an energetic chairman of parliamentary committee work. Clearly, aspects of parliamentary procedure do need to be re-examined and reformed from time to time. I have no doubt that, as Speaker, the honourable member for Cunningham will be an activist in these issues. At the same time he has demonstrated a capacity to listen, to consult and to seek out the most appropriate types of proposals for changes in procedures. He has also shown a capacity to develop reforms and innovations after detailed deliberber ations, particularly during the parliamentary banking inquiry. I have no doubt that the skills he has obtained from those experiences will be appropriate in seeking the cooperation needed across the House to produce reforms that are relevant to the operation of the Parliament. He has also shown a strong appreciation of the needs of new members, and has a healthy regard for the differing opinions that are expressed both in committees and in the debates within the Parliament. During Stephen's time in the Parliament he has spent 15 months as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. As all would recognise, there is no doubt that the role of Speaker is broader than just chairing the proceedings of the Parliament. It does have representational roles within the parliamentary precinct and abroad. I feel confident that the skills Stephen has acquired over his time as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will give him added strength in performing those roles. The honourable member for Cunningham has been active in numerous parliamentary committees, from the House Committee to the various standing committees of the Parliament. Throughout that time he has always conducted himself in a thoroughly professional and competent manner. He has always won and earned the respect of colleagues from both sides of the chamber. He certainly understands the importance of the Parliament to the broader community, and I think along with all of us he recognises that we all have a special responsibility and honour in being here to make the Parliament relevant, contemporary and meaningful to all Australians. The onus is on us in electing our new Speaker to ensure that we give the cooperation and assistance required for the operation of Parliament and for the good of the nation. I have much pleasure in wholeheartedly recommending the honourable member for Cunningham to be Speaker of the House of Representatives for this Parliament.",14
13,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"I have much pleasure in nominating the honourable memfor Cook, Mr Dobie, as Speaker of this House. Before speaking of the qualities of Mr Dobie for the role of Speaker, and before members here vote on that position of unique responsibility, I would like to remind the House of what was said in Philip Laundy's tome, The Office of the Speaker, of the qualities needed to be Speaker. In relation to the Speaker, he said: He must have an intimate understanding of parliamentary life, of the problems of Members collectively and individually, of the moods and foibles of the House; an experience which can be acquired only through many years spent on the benches of the House itself. He must have a deep-seated reverence for the institution of Parliament, an understanding of what lies behind the outward ceremony and a faith in democratic government. I believe Don Dobie has demonstrated these qualities through his long political career. His parliamentary contributions have been many and varied. He entered the House for the first time in 1966 and served as Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Mr MCMahon, and was Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1970 to 1971 and again from 1979 to 1983. He was the coalition Whip from 1983 to 1985 and Deputy Chairman of Committees again from 1985 to the present day. He has been the chairperson of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and he served on a wide variety of other parliamentary committees, including the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House. In recent years there has been a particular tendency for this House to be rowdy and disorderly at times. It is paramount that to maintain order and set the framework for d-bate the Speaker must be fair. Although the vote taken here today will determine who occupies the Speaker's chair, I believe we should be paying attention to the office of Speaker itself because the choice we make here today will be for the Speaker of the whole House. I would urge all members present, especially the new members, to consider carefully the unprejudiced role of the Speaker. In nominating Mr Dobie we have a person who can fulfil that role. There can be no doubt that throughout his long parliamentary career he has demonstrated a firm belief in the primacy and integrity of parliament. Mr Dobie is steeped in the traditions of this place and, if he were to take his place in the chair, he would bring dignity, erudition and wit to the exercise of the office and the stature to ensure firm, but fair, handling of robust debates. He has demonstrated these abilities when faced with difficult circumstances by handling them with authority and courtesy. I have therefore great pleasure in commending to all members the honourable member for Cook as the next Speaker of this House.",15
14,Ms CRAWFORD,Unknown,"I rise in support of the nomination of the honourable member for Cunningham, Mr Martin, to the position of Speaker. I do so with delight, for not only do I value Stephen as a friend, but also I know he has the qualities for such an esteemed position. Indeed,' one has only to look at Stephen's first speech in the House of Representatives in February 1985 when he said: I speak for the first time in this House with acute sense of honour and responsibility. I believe such sentiments reflect the man whom I know honourable members will select today as the person who will not only bring order and dignity to the proceedings of this place, but also represent the Australian Parliament around the world. As we recognise, the Speaker also has a very important role in representing us as parliamentarians, representing this Parliament as an institution and representing Australians around the world. Stephen Martin do- not accept the honours without the work. He says it was Gough Whitlam who: . . . shook him from the shackles of political apathy and steeled his commitment to reform, social justice and equality. I believe we have seen his ability to translate that apathy into action in his work for the people of Wollongong. It is that quality which he will bring to his role as Speaker. With a commitment such as that, I know honourable members will be confronted by a person who is not afraid of a challenge. Many here will remember the banking inquiry and the role Stephen played in that. But I believe it is his experience as a high school teacher which will be considerably more valuable in a chamber that is often described in not too flattering classroom terms. If the tricks learned in the classroom fail, there are always those learned from that greatest game of all: rugby league, where we recognise Stephen's ability to rise to the heights of a first grade referee. We have here a person who understands people-the coalminers and steelworkers of the Illawarra, children in classrooms, town planners, aldermen, footballers and bankers. I am certain that members of parliament will be tackled very easily. It is with great pleasure that I second this motion and commend the honourable member for Cunningham to all honourable members.",16
15,Mr HICKS,Unknown,"In rising to second the nomination of the honourable member for Cook, the Hon. Don Dobie, I would like, first of all, to bring to the attention of the House the history of the role of Speaker in the wonderful parliamentary system we have in a very Australia. I do not know whether people know this, but centuries ago in the British Parliament the role of Speaker was a very difficult one. On many occasions the Speaker had to be dragged to the chair to take on the role. Of cQurse, today the Speaker has to be dragged out of the chair. In those ancient times it was customary for the nominator - nd the seconder of the elected Speaker to drag him, kicking and squirming, to the chair because in those days the Speaker was often in a lot of strife with the king or the personage of the day. Speakers were often assassinated, murdered or executed. So the Speaker did not really want to be the Speaker. I am pleased that today when the Hon. Don Dobie goes up to be the Speaker of this House I will not have the job, as a seconder, of trying to drag him there because he is a large man and a man of great stature. The Hon. Don Dobie has stood for election to this Parliament on 10 occasions and he is one of the senior members of the Parliament. As a result of being a senior member, he has that stature which I believe one needs to have as a Speaker of this House. The Speaker of the House has a great deal of responsibility, not only for maintaining order in the House but also for liaising between the members and the executive of the Parliament. I think that is 'a very important role. Over the last few years, particularly since the Parliament has been televised, we have had a number of problems. I know that the Hon. Don Dobie will overcome those problems as Speaker. We in this Parliament have to set an example, and I am sure that, with experience, he will do that. The honourable member for Cook has been a member of many delegations overseas. He has been a great representative of this country. In overseeing elections in developing countries he has added his great experience to that process. He has also represented a number of overseas delegations as deputy leader. I have worked with Don Dobie on a number of committees and I have always found him to be a very fair man and a very honest man. I am sure that, as the Speaker of the House, he would bring to that position a great deal of dignity and a great deal of fairness. am sure that every member in this House would find the Hon. Don Dobie a very worthwhile person in that position. I cannot say that the honourable member for Cook has been a schoolteacher or has had any of those experiences, but he was certainly in the CMF for a while. I should say that he did not reach the rank of warrant officer; nevertheless, I am sure that that experience will hold him in good stead. Members here were talking about rugby league, and I am sure that everyone knows of the honourable member for Cook's liaison with a rugby league team, and what a strong supporter he is. Having said that, I would like to second the nomination of the Hon. Don Dobie. I wish him well and I hope that he does not resist when we try to take him up to the chair.",16
16,The Clerk,Unknown,"In accordance with the Standing Orders, the bells will be rung and a ballot taken. The bells having been rung and a ballot having been taken",17
17,The Clerk,Unknown,"The result of the ballot is: Mr Dobie, 63 votes; Mr Martin, 78 votes. Mr Martin is declared elected.",17
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I wish to express my grateful thanks for the high honour the House has bestowed upon me. Mr Speaker having seated himself in the chair,17
19,Mr KEATING,Unknown," Mr Speaker, it is my very pleasant duty to his be the first person on behalf of the Government, and I am sure the whole House, to congratulate you on your election as Speaker of the House of Representatives, the representative chamber of the nation. It is.- great honour indeed-one I am sure you feel is an honour not just for you but for your familyand attests to the judgment that others have placed in you in the contribution you have made to public life to this time. I am sure honourable members on the Government side at least, if not a few on the Opposition side, feel that sense of pride with you. I also offer my commiserations to the I honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). He is extremely well liked in this chamber. All the years I have been in the House of Representatives I have served with him bar a few when he had a vacation for a couple of years-but he came back. I know that, although he was not successful here because the vote is taken on party lines, he is held in very high esteem. The speakership is a very important position in our democracy. It is about the quality of the person in the job. The way in which that position is fulfilled decides how the parliamentary chamber performs. I think the responsibility is today all the greater given the fact that Parliament is now televised and there is quite a large following of people who actually see and watch Parliament, as there was quite a number who listened to the radio. Parliament is broadcast live contemporaneously with the sitting and then the telecast is reshown later. There is no doubt that television has given many members of the public an insight into the chamber and the personalities of the members of the House, whereas radio was somewhat limited, although it always obtained a reasonable rating over the years. This has, I think, made the speakership even more important for the way in which the House and the Standing Orders are administered. The key quality for any Speaker is integrity. It is never easy managing a party house, representing as it does the various interests of the nation. To have a Speaker drawn from one of the political parties has always placed pressure on such a nominee to be seen to manage the business of the House fairly and equitably. The quality of integrity is the one that matters the most. I think you have this quality and, therefore, I am quite sure that the judgments you will bring to bear as Speaker will be fair and reasonable. The key to the job, though, is flexibility and common sense. A chamber that is a debating house cannot be run without these qualities. All the Speakers in my time here have had these qualities. Some have displayed them more fluently on occasions than others; nevertheless, they have been there. That common sense and flexibility are what oil the system and let it continue to be effective. I think the responsibility falls on all of to help you make the chamber work. There has been criticism of the Parliament in the few years, particularly since it has been televised. I do not think the parliamentary chamber has changed all that much in the 24 years I have been here, but the televising of its proceedings has been a revelation to the public, The operation of the House and our behaviour here are important. I do not think we have to pay hypocritical lip-service to the removal of conflict in the chamber: this is the clearing house of Australian political pressures. The big issues are brought to bear here and they are debated here. One cannot expect such a debate to continue with such high stakes for various members of the community and the delivery of programs or the policies of the government of the day without those matters producing at least some heat in the debate. But it is how that debate takes place, how those robust exchanges occur and, at the same time, how the effectiveness and respect of the House are kept together. It is the question of efficiency that probably occupies most of our minds-being able to dispense the business of the Parliament efficiently, while retaining the quality of debate. The debates have changed over the years. When I first came here, members' speeches during second reading debates would be reported. In fact, when members wished to be noticed here-when they wanted to build their reputation as new members-they did it invariably during second reading debates in the House, and quite often one would see a good contribution reasonably well covered in the media. That does not happen today. Most of the focus of the day is on Question Time, which is good for information but a pity for the chamber. It is certainly good for accountability. I am not sure of too many other governments in other parliaments that take questions without notice for as long as we take them every day, and where members who bother also have the avenue of questions on notice by which, of course, many people have sought information over time to get detailed answers to questions. I would like to see the coverage in the media us of the parliamentary day and its impact on the community more balanced than it is, away last from Question Time, giving the rank and file members of the Parliament a chance to participate more fully. In the course of the next few months the Government will be talking with the Opposition, to look at current parliamentary practice to see in which way we can make the Parliament more effective and give members an enhanced role for themselves, one in which they feel they can take a part in the business of the Parliament and the affairs of the nation as they wish, and where their effort will be recognised and noted beyond the portals of this particular building. Mr Speaker, this is indeed a great honour, and of course a responsibility-one which we think, obviously, that you can discharge with flair and with fairness. I am sure I speak on behalf of all members, certainly of the Government-the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) will speak no doubt in a momentin saying that you have our very best wishes. We look forward to our first full parliamentary day tomorrow.",17
20,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I rise following the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to add our congratulations from the opposition parties to you for the success you have had today in being elected Speaker. As the Prime Minister said, it is a position of critical importance to the proper functioning of this Parliament. You will undoubtedly have our support if you conduct those duties with fairness, good judgment and impartiality. I noted in the remarks that were made in proposing you for the position that reference was made to your experience as a rugby league referee. In the light of the Prime Minister's remarks today I thought I must be in a different place compared to my experience of the last Parliament because there were times then when a referee would have been very useful to us. I do not know whether the Prime Minister knows much about rugby league but he has certainly had a capacity on many occasions to put the ball into the second row, and on other vulnerable. occasions he completely bypassed the scrum and just threw the ball straight out to the centre or to the wing. We would be looking to you, Mr Speaker, to actually use your refereeing skills to pull him back into line. I also notice that the New South Wales Right seems to have done well in the Ministry line-up, and some of the other changes that have been made in the Government. I recognise your association with that group. I hope you recognise that your position now calls you to rise above that and show a higher loyalty to the proper functioning of this Parliament at the expense of any factional loyalty or other loyalty that may exist within your party processes. It goes without saying, Mr Speaker, that we were not particularly happy with the parliamentary performance as it occurred in the last session, and I have no doubt that in the eyes of most people in Australia the standing of politicians has fallen quite dramatically. It is a very real challenge for all of us to lift our game and clean up our act in this place. I welcome against that background the remarks that I heard the Prime Minister make today about how he would like to see Parliament put back to its proper place. I do not have to remind people on our side of the House of the difficulty we had in getting the Prime Minister to debate us on any issue. To get him to debate us on unemployment we basically had to censure him in the course of the last Parliament, and Question Time was reduced to nothing short of a mockery. We thought things got bad under Hawke. In his last year, I think the number of questions got down to about 13; under the current Prime Minister it fell to about II-we were getting five or six questions a day. The average length of answers went up quite dramatically from about three minutes under Fraser, to four minutes under Hawke, to six minutes under this Prime Minister. We are looking for all of that to be improved in this Parliament. I am reminded of a statement made by a previous Speaker, Joan Child, who said: Anything that lowers respect for the democratic parliamentary system leaves that system more In the last session, we all did ourselves a disservice with our performance in this House. The Government, in particular, ran down the proceedings of this House for its own personal gain, in the midst of the worse economic crisis in this country in 60 years. That crisis continues to get ·worse. Today we have a balance of payments current account of $2.1 billion. The crisis continues. If this Parliament is to play its proper part in dealing for with that crisis, and in emphasising the significance of debate, we look forward with relish to the Prime Minister's setting the example, actually participating in that debate and elevating the debates in this place to a much higher significance than Question Time, which is what the people of Australia would like to see. We have, in the past, made a number of proposals as to how Parliament and the operation of this House can be improved. I am pleased to see, Mr Speaker, that in this morning's press you have said that you were of a mind to make some changes. I am particularly pleased to see that you believe that some limit should be placed on the length of ministerial answers, and that better use can be made of parliamentary questions to improve legislation. We have put a number of specific proposals as to.how you might improve the operation of not only Question Time but also other aspects of thi- Parliament, including to allow at least 20 questions in Question Time. We should have the right to ask supplementary questions; they should be encouraged. The Speaker should have the power to force a Minister to simply answer a question, and to stop a Minister from turning his answer into a speech. The Speaker should have the power to require a Minister to answer a question on the Notice Paper. Announcements of government policy should be made in the Parliament, so that members have an opportunity to debate them. In terms of other parliamentary procedures, use of the guillotine to rush through legislation should absolutely be curtailed; I think what happened in the last Parliament was an absolute disgrace. I also support some of the remarks that many in this Parliament have made about improving the use of parliamentary committees to scrutinise legislation. I think that should be expanded, and the number of sitting days should be increased so that we have time to consider legislation properly and so that we all work more sensible hours when the Parliament is sitting. That is also fundamental to good government. Overall, Mr Speaker, the success or failure of this Parliament in the eyes of the people rests very much in your ha,nds, as much as in our hands in cooperating with you. We look to a new start with you. We look to a new lead from you. We will do our part. You will have our total support if you are fair and impartial in the sense that I know you can be.",19
21,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I rise to join the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in offering congratulations to you. We were both elected to the Federal Parliament on the same day in 1984. We also share an interest in building up our relations with Asian countries. Particularly, I recall your indepth work in respect of Thailand. I hope you will continue that work in your role as Speaker, in the various functions and capacities you have with the CPA and the IPU. I commend the candidature of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) and commiserate with him on his failure to win on this occasion. I also note the departure of Leo MCLeay from the office of Speaker. I would simply say that I thank him for the courtesies that he extended to me on occasions during his period as Speaker. I recognise those. Mr Speaker, the House of Representatives must be far more relevant to the people of Australia if there is to be a change in the respect that Australians hold for the institution of parliament. This is even more important during these times of horrific recession and rural depression, in this time of drought and unprecedented crisis in the wool industry, the citrus industry and so many other industries. Today this is underlined by the terrific blowout in the balance of payments adding to the burden of the situation. There is a great deal of heartache and heartbreak out there in so much of Australia at this time. Our deliberations, the proceedings in this place, must role recognise that and have empathy for that situation. Our debates must seek solutions to the problems that arise. In that context, I would make three additional suggestions in respect of the proceedings in this place. I have said previously and I say again that I think that the Speaker should never hesitate to rise to his feet when . the occasion requires it to bring control to the proceedings of this House. Mr Speaker, you once worked with Laurie Kelly when he was the member for Corrimal and then Speaker of the ultimate bearpit of bearpits, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, Parliament House, Macquarie Street, Sydney. Those of us who have graduated from that place of learning, the political university of universities, know well what it is to be a member of a bitter debating chamber. Equally, in the worse of the situations in the Legislative Assembly in Sydney, no matter how much heat and brimstone was flying in all directions, when the Speaker rose to his feet, people on both sides of the Parliamentimmediately became silent and gave to the Chair the respect that it deserved in that circumstance and allowed control to be restored. So I simply commend to you, Mr Speaker, as part Of the weaponry that you have, the practice of rising to your feet when the occasion demands. I am sure that we will all extend to you the courtesy that you deserve on that occasion. The second thing that I want to draw to your atten'tion is that it is a matter of record that in the past 10 years one side of this House has had 41 members sin-binned or suspended and the other side of this House has had just one member sin-binned or suspended. One does not have to be brilliant to work out which side is which. I have had this debate before with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and there are factors involved, but I want to place on record that that is the score: 41 coalition members have been suspended, and just one government member. Mr Speaker, I know that you have been an outstanding referee in that code of football called rugby league. I hope that in your jurisdiction as Speaker of the House you will rectify that imbalance and be absolutely fair in the administration of the absolute power to suspend a member from the service of the House. Only by your doing that in a clear-cut way will we regain full respect for the Chair and the proper deliberations of the House of Representatives. Finally, let me say that from time to time the proceedings associated with the opening of Parliament and the election of Speaker have been discussed with a view to review. Apparently, time did not permit the ultimate deliberation and consultation necessary to streamline aspects of those proceedings. I renew the suggestion that the House of Representatives would be well advised to pick up a proceeding from the House of Commons and that the election of Speaker be conducted by the senior member in continuing service in the House of Representatives; He or she would take the role of the Clerk in conducting the election of the Speaker. In saying that, I make no reflection and cast no aspersion on the Clerk of the House, for whom I have a great deal of regard. I want to make the point that I believe that it is a convention, a tradition, a custom, which we in the House of Representatives could initiate and followone entirely appropriate to the dignity of the Parliament. That would then mean that in the current circumstance the right honourable member for New England (Me Sinclair) would carry out the election of the Speaker. In congratulating you, Mr Speaker, I sincerely ask that we all consider our obligations to our constituents and the people of Australia more widely to lift our collective game and hopefully earn greater respect in the community through the processes and deliberations of our great Parliament under our great constitutional monarchy.",20
22,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I add my congratulations to those you have received today and the many I am sure you will receive in the future. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) just made the point that you and he arrived in the Parliament at the same time. My recollection is that I arrived some three years earlier. I remember a conversation in which you reported to me some advice that Speaker Child had given you shortly after your arrival, which was: 'If you want to learn about parliament, watch me'. Mr Speaker, from this point on I can offer you any advice you think might be necessary. This is a very serious occasion, and some comments have been made, particularly by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-at which I was a bit surprised-and do need to be made with regard to the conduct of this place. Consequently, Mr Speaker, I bring to your attention a few very significant items of history which may be of interest both to existing and to recently elected members. The first item that I think is of significance regarding the office of Speaker occurred on 27 February 1975. That was the date upon which the Whitlam Government voted down Speaker James Cope for having the temerity, for the first time in Labor Party history, to seek to discipline a Labor Minister, Clyde Cameron. He had insulted the Chair and refused to apologise. The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, prevented Labor Leader of the House, Fred Daly, from moving the customary motion of suspension, and the responsibility fell to the leader of Opposition business, Mr Ian Sinclair. The Labor Government then instructed its members to vote against the motion-a clear vote of no confidence in their own elected Speaker, who subsequently resigned from the chair. Among those listed as voting down their own Speaker were P. Keating, J. Dawkins and R. Willis-the . present Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. It is not, therefore, surprising-to me at least-that recent speakers in the Labor Government have shown little effort to be fair or firm with the actions of their own Government Ministers. The second item of history that I think is of significance occurred on 27 April 1992 in the British House of Commons when the Rt Han. Betty Boothroyd, a Labour MP, was nominated by the Conservative Prime Minister of England, Mr John Major, as Speaker and duly elected. She had previously been a deputy speaker in the Conservative Government. That, of course, is because of the massive confidence that the British politicians have in the Westminster system as it is conducted with regard to the office of Speaker. Mr Speaker, you would be aware, I am sure, that in that place the Speaker resigns from his or her political party. The convention requires that the Speaker not be opposed in his or her electorate and that he or she stand as a truly independent person. Mr Speaker, in my view it would be in the interests of this Parliament if you were to follow some of those principles. Clearly, in our system you would not be expected to resign from your party, but my recollection of what happened in the Fraser Government was that the then Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, seldom entered the party room of the Liberal Party and did his best to keep himself away from those sorts of actions.",21
23,Unknown,Unknown,Government members interjecting,22
24,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"If I have so far given those opposite anything to laugh about, they might write me a letter about it. I would have thought the sacking of a Speaker in those circumstances was outrageousMrs Crosio-But you are not",22
25,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"I would have thought that the lady with her mouth open at the moment would have been grateful to have it recorded in this place that a woman such as Betty Boothroyd could be elected as Speaker of the House of Commons, but apparently those opposite think that is something for humour. The next item of recorded history relevant to this debate occurred on 24 November 1988 when the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, said in this place: Question Time is a courtesy extended to the House by the executive branch of government.",22
26,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"You have two minutes left, Wilson.",22
27,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,I have not. The honourable member does not even know his Standing Orders. There is no time limit on this speech. The Leader of the House should go and find out his Standing Orders before he interjects.,22
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Leader of the House will not interject.,22
29,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"This arrogant assertion, along with the Prime Minister's voting stance against Speaker Cope in 1975-for the information of the House, the Leader's father abstained from that vote although he was present in the House-gives Australia a clear picture of the Prime Minister's attitude to parliamentary democracy and, in my view, underlines his real agenda for a republic. This contempt of parliament was aggravated by an incident as reported in the Canberra Times on 25 October 1988. An article appearing under the headline 'Referees should lift their game' - an article which I would suggest for your reading, Mr SPEAKER - stated: The Treasurer, Mr Keating, was reported in 1986 to have verbally 'bounced' the Deputy Speaker, Mr Leo MCLeay, 'around the walls' for not affording Mr Keating enough protection during a debate in the House of Representatives. Mr Keating's actions would have been justified had they not been for his own benefit. Mr Speaker, that is not exactly the sort of treatment I hope you get, but you must recognise what has happened in the past. The next item of history is, of course, the report of the royal commission into WA Inc. This was reported in the West Australian on 16 November 1992. It is no good people saying that that is from Western Australia. Our newspapers have been full of reports of invitations extended to the forgetful Carmen Lawrence to come over here to be one of the Government's frontbenchers. Let me say what the learned judges-they were all learned judges; one was a retired judge of the High Court-expressed as their view of Question Time, in contravention of the remark that it is some sort of courtesy that this Parliament receives from the Executive. The report in the West Australian stated: The report said question time should be used to make ministers accountable for their administration. But at present it provided the crudest form of accountability. In regard to the Western Australian Parliament the judges are quoted as saying: The Parliament in this state had done relatively little to provide the public with the protection its constitutional review responsibility is there to secure. Much of the burden of review still falls on that most traditional and random of measures, question time. The manner of its conduct, the apparent acceptance of evasion and equivocation in providing answers and the governmental manipulation of it for its own purposes can leave the public with little reassurance that it presently serves the accountabililength. ty purpose in anything other than a fortuitous way. Mr Speaker, the simple fact of the matter is that if you want examples of that, you will find them all in those weekly Hansards that are kept here for our reference. The situation was no different here. It was so bad in fact that if one had asked the Prime Minister what was 2 plus 2, he would have said GST. The royal commissioners had the possibly mistaken view-but not as far as I am concerned-that Question Time is the period of the day in the Parliament when the members, not just the Opposition, have the chance to keep the Executive honest. I think it is fundamental to our form of democracy that Ministers should get up in the morning with some concern that their activities are such that they could not be caught out in this place. I am alarmed, therefore, to think that we are suggesting that only a couple of Ministers a day should have that worry and, of course, could escape it the next day by the rostering of Ministers. The purpose of Question Time is to keep the Executive honest. There are new members on the Government benches who will soon learn that they will not get a chance to ask questions in the interests of their constituents. They will all get questions from the Minister's office and read them carefullybecause, quite frequently, they cannot even write them according to the Standing Orders. So, Mr Speaker, these are the challenges for you, the challenges of history. We do not rewrite history in this place; it is all on the record. It is there to see.",22
30,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Oh, come on; you are becoming a bore. .",23
31,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"If the Leader of the House does not like it, he can change it. I would ask him to just behave himself in future and let us have some respect towards the Parliament. He should learn his Standing Orders because a minute ago he was telling me I was running out of time; he did not even know that there is no time limit on this speech. Mr Speaker, the statistics have been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and I will not read them to you at Nevertheless, I would like to read this extract from a report compiled by the University of New South Wales in April 1989, which looked at the performance of Labor governments during Question Time. It reads: Given that the duration of Question Time has remained static, how can the number of questions have dropped? The answer is clearly that the Government's answers, especially to questions from its own backbench, have become longer. In the 1987 Budget sittingj1988 Autumn sitting period, 206 replies exceeded 750 words, with about a quarter of these exceeding 1()()() words. Of the eight replies which exceed 1800 words and, for your information, Mr Speaker, it takes one about 20 minutes to speak 1,800 wordstaking about 20 minutes-five are from Mr Keating. Mr Speaker, it is pretty clear for you to see where the problem lies. And the challenge to you is: will you fix it? There will be no points of order from me and, I am sure, other members of the Parliament if the rules are obeyed. In this regard, let us before I close look quickly at those rules. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order under the provision in the Standing Orders which deals with disorderly behaviour. I believe that the honourable member for O'Connor is turning this session into a farce and that, as a result, his behaviour is disorderly. I believe that he should be asked to come to a conclusion and sit down.",23
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,There is no point of order.,24
33,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"There has been significant comment over time that the Standing Orders need to be changed. I think the Standing Orders were written by some very wise gentlemen, based on a long experience of the activities of politicians. When one looks at those Standing Orders relating to Question Time where most of the disputation arises, we find that they clearly try to cut off the options for abuse. Standing order 142 reads: Questions may be put to a Minister relating to public affairs with which heorsheis officially connected, to proceedings pending in the House, or to any matter of administration for which he is responsible. In that regard, of course, there is a wealth of precedent as to how past Speakers have ruled on that matter. It is pretty clear. Precedent says that if one does not ask a Minister a question about his or her area of responsibility-there is a wealth of precedent to say that opposition policy is not a Minister's area of responsibility; I think we could agree with that as a matter of logic-the question is out of order. Other Standing Orders relate to the asking of questions. I think they are particularly proper. Principally, they say, 'Ask for information, and keep it short'. Then there is the issue of the answer. Standing order 145 states: An answer shall be relevant to the question. That requires no interpretation. In fact, it is quite clear that it would be out of order in an answer to refer at great length to Opposition policy et cetera if the question had nothing to do with Opposition business. So the challenges for you, sir, are to break with some of that history. The challenge for the Government in this Parliament is, maybe, to wipe out the stain of Speaker Cope. I hope we see that all happening. Mr Speaker, I thank you for your time and I repeat my congratulations.",24
34,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown," Mr Speaker, while I was listening to the gratuitous comments of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), I happened to glance at the Daily Program which says that after your election the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and others will offer you their congratulations. I would like to join with those who are offering you their congratulations rather than those who might wish to carve out an area in respect of which they will probably perfonn some injustices in this place. I think we could have all dealt with not hearing the remarks made by the honourable member for O'Connor. Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition, my friend the Leader of the National Party and others are saying to you that we believe you have the ability to do the job and we look forward to working with you in doing that job. I say to my friend the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), who ran against me and who also ran against you, Mr Speaker, that I hope I might be here long enough-and I hope that is for quite some time-to see him successful in that election. Mr Dobie-But will I be here long enough?",24
35,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"I think the honourable member might have to wait a while. However, there is some hope on his side. A few elections ago, Peter Slipper was here as a member of the National Party and now he has joined the Liberal Party. So maybe if the honourable member for Cook came over here, his chances of being elected as Speaker might improve. I would like to say something about a couple of things that were said about my predecessors. If honourable members want to attack me here, I will stand up and defend myself. But I think what was said about Speaker Cope is quite wrong. It is wrong for people to stand up in this place, as the honourable member for O'Connor tries to do from time to time, and suggest that something that happened in here over 20 years ago when Mr Cope was Speaker has ever placed a pall over any of the people who have since held that office.",24
36,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"You were not here, Leo.",25
37,Mr LEO MCLEAY,Unknown,"I am sure that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) would agree with me that what happened in those days is not something that influences people here now. The Leader of the National Party said that it was terrible only one Government member had been put out by the Speaker in so many years. That might be a terrible reflection on Speaker Snedden. My recollection is that in his period as Speaker. I was here and was once nearly a victim-he suspended many Opposition members but only one Government member. In the period that I was Speaker. I think I suspended one Government member, too. Maybe Snedden and I were both a bit harsh on the Opposition; maybe Snedden sinned some times as well. Mr Speaker, you will have a most enjoyable job. It will be difficult from time to time when people on this side and the other side try to make it difficult for you at Question Time. But, Mr Speaker, I think you will find the other jobs that the Speaker does in this place most rewarding. I was a little concerned when I heard your mover and seconder talking about overseas travel, and that they reckon you will represent us very well. I can see that you have been skilled in these things already by the President of the Senate-and he will not mind my saying that. Mr Speaker, you will find that the job of the Speaker is a very interesting one. As all my colleagues who have held that position before me have said to me, it is sometimes lonely. I would like to join with all the other people who have spoken, except the honourable member for O'Connor, in wishing you well, and in assuring you that, as members of the Opposition and members of the Government have said, you' will have the support of all of us in this House in doing your job as the Speaker. I wish you a successful time, a happy time and long time in the chair, Stephen.",25
38,Mr DOBIE,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I rise simply to congratulate you, to wish you well and to promise you my continuing personal friendship with two notable exceptions: one will take place on Sundays in Wollongong and the other will take place on Sunday afternoons in Cronulla. I must say that when I heard some of the historical items being mentioned today, the mention of 41 to one reminded me of the score of 44 to two which that occurred when IIIawarra visited Cronulla, admittedly a year or so ago. But I do not want to be historical. I would like to thank the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Wooldridge) and the National Party Whip, the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) for nominating me, to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his kind remarks, and to ask for time to consider the invitation the former Speaker gave me to perhaps, after 27 years, change my party. I am too big to be Billy Hughes and I do not have children like Joe Lyons did, so I think it is most unlikely that I will be crossing the floor, but I am reminded by the previous speaker that when I spoke on a similar occasion in 1990-and I ,only mention it because he raised the subject. I saw fit to wish him well with his broken elbow. With your indulgence, sir; can I say through you that I hope he is not having any more trouble with that aforementioned elbow. Mr Speaker, as a referee and with the wisdom that years bring to you, I can see that on occasions members of this side of the House, and even the two Independents, may find themselves cruelly, most cruelly sent to the sin-bin. But I do hope, sir, that we never see anybody on this side incurring the wrath of the Chair-or, in other words, the penalty of the blood bin. The southern States will not understand the. difference, but you and I do. In conclusion, I would like to say something quite seriously. I said it three years and I want to say it this time. I was disappointed that the previous occupant of the chair, as a presiding officer, did not have a full curatorial staff for the something like 2,800 items of art, and the 70 major items of art, that we have in this building. I hope that during your speakership you and the other presiding officer will recognise this incredible asset that we have within the parliamentary building, and realise the absolute necessity curatorial staff which all these years after opening of the Parliament we still do not have. I will leave this with you, Stephen. I wish you all the best and look forward to our continuing happy personal association.",25
39,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If I may, I would like briefly to indulge in a couple of words. Initially, I would like to thank all those honourable members who commented upon my successful election to this very high office. I want to thank particularly my good friends the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) and the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) for their nomination. I also, believe it or not, want to thank the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) because history is important to us all. A sense of history of this place is something which we all strive to be part of. At the same time, that sense of history teaches us something about the past and how we might want to improve things for the future. In the past couple of days I have said that I, and I am sure many of my colleagues, have received numerous letters from people in our constituencies who were concerned about the process of the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and others also made reference to aspects of the parliamentary process such as Question Time, relevancies and so on. However, as Hansard shows, many former Speakers at the time of their election have said that these sorts of comments constantly come up. It seems that people have not learnt from history and have not been prepared to accept change. By people I mean honourable members of this Parliament. The Speaker's role is critical in ensuring a ago business like, efficient development of the parliamentary process here. At the same time, that position is only made easy through honourable members on both sides cooperating and respecting not only the high office of the Speaker but, more importantly, the institution of Parliament. I have listened with great interest as people have made comment on that. It would seem that we all hold those very high ideals. It is hoped that in this for coming Parliament we all work out our own the ways to put those ideals in place. There is no doubt that words like 'fairness' and 'impartiality' flow very easily. There is no doubt that people would like to see the Speaker's role as one which does not bring that into question. I can only give an undertaking to all honourable members that that is what I will be striving to do. lt is a great responsibility to be the Speaker in the Parliament of Australia. After all, this is the premier parliament of this country. This is where the most critical and important decisions, shaping the lives of each and every Australian, are made. It is a very high honour. As individual members of Parliament we have a great responsibility to represent our constituents and to represent broader Australia. We might have different philosophies as to how we should get to that end point, but at the end of the day we all want that same great thing for this country-and that is a better Australia. . While I am talking about constituencies, I also want to thank those people in Wollongong who, with their very great judgment, returned me yet again-might I say, with an increased majority. I humbly say to them that I understand their aims and aspirations and I hope to reflect them here in this place. I also understand the pride that they have in knowing that one of their own-described in our local newspaper, the Illawarra Mercury, this morning as 'a Balgownie boy that has made good' - is here on their behalf. But I hope they understand also that the role of Speaker, as the chief presiding officer, and that of their local member, whilst held by one and the same person, carry different responsibilities. I will be endeavouring to administer both to the best of my capability. I want to say to all honourable members from both sides of this Parliament, as my immediate pred-essor and previous predecessors have done'-I have had the chance to look through Hansard at their acceptance speeches-that my door is always open. I am quite happy to talk openly and frankly about the processes of Parliament because, as I have said, at the end of the day how we work together is determined by the attitudes that we each display. Some comment has been made about changes to the parliamentary process; parliamentary reform has been mentioned. I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has indicated that this is an issue that will be looked at. I look forward to seeing the recommendations that come forward. People often like to quote the Standing Orders, but I come back to the fact that the operation of this chamber is in our hands collectively. It is the members who make recommendations to procedure committees and to Government Ministers about changes to the Standing Orders. I look forward to the cooperation of all honourable members in that respect. Finally, I thank you all for the faith that been shown in me. It is something which I will strive to ensure does not reflect badly either on me as the person or on the office of Speaker. It is a very proud moment for me today and a very proud moment for my family who are in the gallery. I thank you all most sincerely. PRESENTATION TO GOVERNORNA",26

50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have to report that the House attended His Excellency the Governor General in the Senate chamber, when His Excellency was pleased to make a speech to both Houses of the Parliament. I have received a copy of the speech, which will be incorporated in Hansard for record purposes. The speech read as followsHonourable Members of the Parliament of Australia: On March 13 the Labor Government received a mandate to continue the program of economic and social reform on which depend the future well-being of the nation and the people of Australia. The Government sees as its primary task the encouragement of a strong and durable recovery from recession, assistance to those who have suffered as a consequence of the recession and a search for solutions to the increasing problem of long-term unemployment. The achievement of these goals very much depends on the successful completion of reforms undertaken by previous Labor governments over the past 10 years. Programs designed to make Australia a more creative and innovative manufacturing country, and one able to compete in the world are now showing unmistakable signs of success. In this next term the Government will continue with those economic reforms. It will undertake, in particular, a major overhaul of the industrial relations system in Affairs such a way as to make Australian workplaces more flexible and competitive without reducing . the wages, conditions and security of Australian workers. The Government will continue to foster the economic integration of Australia with the 19,3 countries of the Asia-Pacific region, and to encourage in the region an open and nondiscriminatory trading environment. The rewards for Australia and Asia are potentially immense, both for present and future generations of Australians, and the Government will make every effort on every relevant front to succeed in these endeavours. The Government believes that economic success should serve social ends, and indeed that economic success is substantially dependent on creating a fair and just society. It is the Government's continuing aim to extend opportunity while providing assistance to those who fall on hard times. The social safety net, including the universal health system, Medicare, in Australia will be maintained and strengthened. It is a hallmark of successful, modern societies that education and training is both of a high quality and accessible to all. In this term, the new Australian National Training Authority will dramatically improve Australia's system of vocational training and; thereby, vastly extend the realm of educational and professional opportunity. The Government takes the view that Australia's success as a robust social democracy and a strong and competitive economy depends in no small way on a heightened sense of common national goals and nationhood. It believes our efforts to become a leading manufacturer and exporter of manufactures, no less than the rapid completion of major infrastructure projects, or the achievement of a lasting reconciliation with the Aboriginal people of Australia, or the extension of child care facilities to Australian working families are directly related to our sense of a national Australian identity and a shared faith in our ability to achieve our goals. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander The Government has placed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues high on the nation's agenda. While much has been achieved in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in years, a great deal remains to be done. Reflecting the importance it attaches to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the Government is establishing an Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs with a policy advising capability within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission are now located in the Prime Minister's portfolio. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has confirmed the faith shown in its creation. It remains the Government's primary adviser on indigenous issues, and the main Commonwealth body operating in the field of indigenous affairs. The Government will introduce amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 arising from the recent review of the legislation by Commissioners. The achievement of a lasting reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the wider community will continue to be one of the Government's highest priorities. An effective partnership between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians is fundamental to Australia's standing as a contemporary nation committed to human rights and social justice, and to the forging of a distinctive Australian identity. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will continue to promote a deeper understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, to foster an ongoing national commitment to cooperate to address that disadvantage and, after consulting the community, will advise on whether a formal document or documents of reconciliation would benefit the Australian community as a whole. The Government is steadfast in its resolve to implement its commitments given in response to the Royal Commission into Aborig""inal Deaths in Custody, and will encourage the States and Territories to implement their commitments. The High Court's decision on native title, recent known as the Mabo decision and handed down on 3 June 1992, overturned the myth of terra nullius and held that Australia's common law recognises a form of native title which survived European settlement. The nation's response to the decision is of fundamental importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and to the process of reconciliation. The Government is committed to the view that the Mabo decision presents us with a genuine basis for reconciliation. This is, in the Government's view, a unique opportunity. The Mabo decision goes to the core of the issue: dispossession. The High Court recognition of native title has profound consequences not just for land management but for contemporary issues of social justice and the process of reconciliation. The Mabo judgement is, in the Government's view, recognition of an historic truth and creates the best chance we have ever had for a nationally agreed and durable settlement. The Government considers that this decision must, therefore, lead to us entering the 21st century with the fundamental relationship between the nation and its indigenous people rebuilt on fair and just foundations. The Government has already initiated consultations on the decision, and will work to achieve a national response which takes into account the legitimate aspirations of all land holders, including native title holders. Arts and Culture The Government's commitment to bringing cultural concerns into the mainstream of decision making is reflected in the appointment of the minister with responsibility for arts and cultural development to a Cabinet position. It will continue to give a high priority to the review of its role in Australia's cultural life, developing a cultural policy to be released by the end of 1993. The Government recognises its responsibility to maintain and develop Australian culture. It will encourage and assist what is distinctly Australian in our cultural life and it will do this in combination with two other goals. It will aim to conserve our heritage in all its diversity, recognising the heritage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and that of the many ethnic, regional and social groups which make up our society. It will also aim to give all Australians, whatever their background, age, or wherever they live, access to varied cultural experiences and understandings. In the arts, the Government will pursue these goals through continued strong support for its existing programs and through a series of new initiatives, some directed specifically at children and youth, which aim to promote excellence and innovation. The Government will also pursue its cultural goals through a continuing commitment to the development of a distinctly Australian film and television industry. As a further stimulus to the creative endeavours of Australian film and television program-makers, the Government will give increased support in the key areas of script development, producer and marketing support and, importantly, Australian children's television. The nation's cultural heritage must be accessible to all Australians. A landmark step here will be the development of the National Museum of Australia. The Government will also pursue other important initiatives, ing establishing the Foundation for Australian Cultural Development, which are designed to help all Australians locate themselves within their country's rich, ancient and diverse cultural landscape. Australian Economy Reducing unemployment remains the ultimate focus of all the Government's economic policies. Fundamental to progress on this front will be the continued application of policy settings that achieve the maximum sustainable rate of economic growth. Above all else, growth holds the key to reducing unemployment to more acceptable levels. In recent years the Government has used fiscal policy to deliver a substantial boost to the economy. This has helped to stabilise activity and support the early stages of recovery. As the recovery proceeds and, in particular, private investment returns to more normal levels, the Government will withdraw that fiscal stimulus. The Government's aim is to reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. The Government will also continue to keep inflation low. The considerable reduction in inflation which has occurred in recent years has resulted in lower inflationary expectations in the community and has enabled interest rafes to be reduced to their lowest level in over twenty years. In tum, this provides a sound basis for encouraging the recovery which is now underway. Keeping inflation below that of our major trading partners will help to maintain Australia's competitiveness in world markets and therefore help to boost exports. Lowering inflation has not been without considerable cost, and it is therefore all the more important to ensure that the gains are not lost. Maintaining and raising competitiveness in world markets also depends on making the economy more efficient and raising productivity. As a result, the Government remains fully committed to restructuring the Australian includeconomy. To date, much has been achieved in microeconomic reform but much remains to be done particularly in cqoperation with the States in areas such as electricity, gas, water and transportation. Open competition is central to the drive for increased efficiency and productivity. In transferring responsibility for competition policy to the Treasury portfolio, the Government recognises the importance of effective competition for economic performance. The recommendations of the National Competition Policy Review will be received shortly and the Government intends that they should be addressed vigorously by the Commonwealth and the States in order to develop open, integrated markets across the economy. The Government will pay particular attention to the availability of finance, particularly to support innovation and product development and especially for small to medium sized businesses. For example, the Government will expand the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Reserve Bank will strengthen its monitoring of bank lending to business. In the superannuation area, the Government will reintroduce legislation to give effect to the improved prudential arrangements announced in the October 1992 Statement, Strengthening Super Security. The new prudential framework will give added protection to superannuation savings, and encourage the development of a more efficient and responsive superannuation industry. As another major initiative in financial supervision, the Government will update and further strengthen the regulation of the life insurance industry through amendments to the Life Insurance Act 1945 and related measures. These changes will not only enhance solvency and financial requirements for life offices, but also address many of the recommendations on consumer protection. The Government's initiatives in superannuation and insurance, taken together, represent a major advance in consumer protection in the financial services sector. During this Parliament, the Government will continue its reforms to the taxation system. The Government has already legislated for the reductions in personal income tax rates that will take effect during the life of this Parliament. The Government also intends to introduce legislation to give effect to the tax measures announced in the Prime Minister's statement of 9 February 1993, Investing in the Nation. These measures include the reduction in the company tax rate, the changed timing for company tax payments, the general investment allowance and tax concessions for child care. Taken together, all these tax measures will improve both the equity of the tax system and the attractiveness of Australia as a location for the additional corporate investment which is essential for strong growth in employment. Constitutional Reform The Government intends to continue the process of promoting discussion and debate on the appropriateness of having an Australian Head of State, chosen by Australians. To this end, the Government is setting up a broadly based committee of eminent Australians to advise on the minimum changes which would need to be made to the Constitution to achieve that result. The Government has invited the States and the Federal Opposition to participate in the work of the committee. After the committee's report, and the process of debate which will follow, the Government will consider whether there is sufficient consensus in the community to justify a referendum, which would enable Australia to become a republic by the year 2001. The Government is not opposed to examining other aspects of constitutional reform, but these should be considered separately and on their own merits. Defence The consolidation of Australia's national defence capabilities will continue to be the cornerstone of the Government's defence policy. Australian Defence Force activities will involve continuing close cooperation with our neighbours and allies. A strategic review is currently under way and a Defence White Paper will be published next year outlining force structure and investment priorities for the 1990s. The program of long-term restructuring already in train will result in a more capable self-reliant Defence Force and increasing involvement of Australian industry in equipping and maintaining the Services. Investment in defence capital equipment and facilities will see nearly $2 billion invested in Australia each year over the next ten years. The first Collins-class submarine will be launched later this year. This is a significant landmark in Australian defence industry construction and demonstrates the skills and ability of the Australian workforce. The Government's review of defence policy for industry, completed last year, will see a renewed focus on defence industry exports. The Commercial Support Program will continue to have a high priority as the Government seeks to increase private sector involvement with the Australian Defence Force. The creation of defence infrastructure in north and west will remain a priority with continued development of RAAF Base $770 Scherger near Weipa,· the relocation of element ments of the Army to Darwin and Townsville and the expansion of the Navy presence in west. High priority will continue to enhancing the living conditions of Service personnel by upgrading military bases and barracks as well as Defence housing. The Defence Organisation will continue play its part in the process of microeconomic reform. Success in this is essential if Government is to achieve its objective of creating a more efficient and capable force the defence of Australia. Employment, Education and Training Unemployment is the greatest problem that we face. Reducing unemployment and assistemployment ing those who are unemployed is the Government's first priority. The Government recognises that the problem of long-term unemployment will require special attention over the next The incidence of long-term unemployment has risen sharply and experience from the training 1980s indicates that it will not fall quickly. But the Government will not accept longalso term unemployment as an insoluble problem. As employment growth picks up, it is essenvocational tial that those who have been unemployed a long time are given the assistance they to obtain jobs. As a first step, the Government will review all labour market programs to ensure that funds are directed to those grams which are the most effective at getting people jobs. In addressing the problem, we also acknowAustralia's ledge that new policies and practices may have to be developed. The Government has begun work on these issues and will seek the assistance of business, unions, community groups and other interested people in finding solutions. Young people who are unemployed face a special set of problems. These were discussed at the Youth Employment and Training disadvantage Summit in Canberra last year. In response the issues raised, the Government announced the a National Employment and Training Plan for the Young Australians with measures costing million over three years. The Governwill review the success of those measures in the coming months to ensure they are the delivering to young people the vocational education, training and employment experibe given to . ence that was intended. It is important that unemployed people are given every opportunity to maintain links with the labour market. The Government will to introduce a number of changes to income test and waiting period arrangements for Job the Search, Newstart and Sickness Allowance which will better enable these recipients to for supplement their income support payments through part-time and casual employment. This will encourage them to maintain links with the labour market, thereby improving their chances of gaining ongoing substantial as the economy improves. In recognition of the difficulties older unemployed people face in gaining employment the Government will be introducing a three years. provisional age pension. The Government's reforms in education and have substantially increased participation in schools and higher education. We have put in place arrangements which will allow for the expansion and upgrading of education and training. The for Commonwealth has passed legislation to need establish the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) and Commonwealth and State funding is to be directed through ANTA profrom 1 January 1994. The Government will build on this expanded base and ensure that our education and training policies enable workforce to become a major source of competitive advantage while providing individuals with the knowledge and skills that they need to live a fulfilling life. The Government will also ensure that recent moves to improve links among the various education sectors are strengthened. The Government is committed to a major review of programs to redress the educational of Aboriginal and Torres Strait to Islander people. This review will shape the face of indigenous education for the lead up to the Centenary of Australian Federation in 2001. Environment The environment is now of mainstream concern throughout the Australian community. The Government will continue to promote the conservation and enhancement of our natural, rural and urban environment in moving towards a more ecologically sustainable society. Within the overall context of implementing the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development, during this term the Government will continue to implement a comprehensive range of environmental protection programs including: strengthening Commonwealth involvement in conserving water resources, including those of the Murray-Darling river system; working towards a nationally comprehensive and representative system of parks and reserves using consistent management principles; developing the National Pollutant Inventory in cooperation with the States and Territories; preparing national standards for air and water quality through the establishment of the National Environment Protection Authority; and taking effective measures to address the issue of environmental lead levels. With regard to international environment issues, the Government will place priority on the further development of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, noting the particular interests engendered by our level of economic dependence on energy intensive activities. Australia will promote acceptance under the Convention of cooperative approaches between the parties to achieving comprehensive greenhouse gas emission controls. The Government will ratify the UN - Convention on Biological Diversity and continue to respond positively to the other outcomes of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development. Foreign Affairs and Trade Consolidation of Australia's economic integration into the Asia Pacific Region especially by further developing regional economic cooperation and trade and investment liberalisation through APEC, by active purSuit of bilateral trade expansion strategies, and by further building Australia's official trade and diplomatic presence in the region will be a high priority for the Government. As part of measures to promote closer economic relations with Asia and, in particular, to assist Australian exports to the region, the Government, in cooperation with the private sector, will establish the Asian Economic Centre. The Centre will increase business knowledge of economic developments in major export markets in Asia and will operate with the close involvement of the private sector to ensure its service meets business requirements. The Government will contribute to continuing global trade liberalisation especially through the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and support for institutions (like APEC) and measures designed to avoid the formation of inwardlooking trade blocs. It will also strengthen the Asia Pacific regional security environment especially through the further development of dialogue, confidence-building measures and strengthened defence cooperation arrangements, and through cooperative efforts to resolve specific regional security problems and 'non-military' threats to security (environment, refugee nows, terrorism, narcotics and the like). The Government will actively work for strengthened non-proliferation and arms high control measures including extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, implementation of a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban, effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, extension of the Missile Technology Control Regime and limitation of conventional arms transfers. The Government will support a strengthened and more effective United Nations especially through enhanced UN capacity for preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-enforcement. The Government will also support the application of universal human rights and democratic principles. The Government will maintain a strong commitment to overseas development assistance including a continued focus on the Asia Pacific region (though not to the exclusion critical humanitarian needs elsewhere); a balanced commitment to immediate alleviation and longer-term development; recognition of environmental, human rights, good governance and women in development criteria; and recognition of the role of aid policies as an integral element of external policy generally. Health, Housing, Income Support and ment Community Services The Government will build on the reforms of the last decade to bring greater equity quality of life to all Australians. In support of the reconciliation process, the basic Government will intensify its efforts that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians have access to meaningful income support programs, through a major expansion of Department of Social Security field serlive vices during 1993. In the context of its firm support to the United Nations International Year of Family in 1994, the Government will ensure substantial and long lasting achievements behalf of families. The Government's plan for child care to end of the century will see a comprehensive network of child care support for Australian families. The Government has made a commitment to meet the full demand for work related child care by 2001. Child care has moved from welfare issue to an economic issue. The child care cash rebate to be introduced next year a recognition of child care as a legitimate cost of working and accordingly will not be means tested although it will be capped. Building on the Government's major imaccess provements to family payments the Governhearing ment has announced its intention a Home Child Care Allowance of $30 a week which will be paid to the primary carer. This payment will replace the dependent spouse rebate for couples with children. payment of this allowance to primary carers recognises their substantial contribution provides an independent source of income for spouses out of the workforce. On health, the Government intends to use of this term in office to strengthen and improve Medicare by making it still more accessible, poverty equitable and affordable. The Government intends to work with the States and the private sector to achieve efficiency gains and better access to health services and to reduce waiting lists in key areas such as orthopaedics, urology, ophthalmology and ear, nose and throat. The Governwill also offer incentives for the States to deliver more palliative care services. The Government is committed to the estaband lishment of a Commonwealth dental health program to improve access to emergency and dental care for the disadvantaged and to ensure those on low incomes. The HIV/AIDS Program will also continue to receive strong Commonwealth support. Among the 32 percent of Australians who in rural and remote areas, there are many who are disadvantaged in terms of a fair share of health services. In partnership with State the and Territory Governments, the Commonwealth will develop Rural Health Plans to on improve planning of health and community services, including pharmaceutical, hospital the and GP services, in rural and remote areas. The Government will continue to ensure adequate retirement income provision for an ageing population including the encouragement and promotion of superannuation. From September this year the Government a will be introducing a more generous pension assets test which will assist over 57,000 nonis pensioner retirees and part-rate pensioners. The Government will assist 200,000 low income non-pensioner retirees by introducing a seniors health card, which will provide to concessional pharmaceuticals and aids as well as to the new dental to introduce health program. The Government will continue its reforms in the area of aged and community care and will seek to continue to manage costs while The increasing the quality of care as well as building a more flexible and consumer orientand ed aged care system. The Government is committed to providing older Australians with choices-community care for those who wish to remain in their own home and residential support and care for the frail aged. A specific emphasis will be on meeting the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Government is committed to the goal of enabling people with disabilities to particitralia; pate fully in everyday society. The Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement lays the foundation for service design and provision in the 1990s and beyond and the Government will work with the States to agree on principles to support this framework. The Government is committed to ensuring that Australians have access to housing that is secure, affordable and most suited to people's needs. The Government remains committed to ensuring that the provision of public housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and the provision of Rent Assistance through the Department of Social Security are effective, efficient and well targeted. One area in which better targeting of Commonwealth programs will be sought is in the area of youth housing. The Commonwealth will review current provisions in this area including through an evaluation of existing services and identification of gaps across income support, employment and training, and housing programs. The Government wishes to see the housing industry become one of Australia's leading export performers. To that end, it will initiate an export strategy for housing and related industries. The Government is determined to keep Australian cities among the most livable in the world. The Commonwealth's Better Cities Program will continue to seek, through coordinated action by the three levels of government and the private sector, to achieve future settlement tions. patterns which are efficient, fair and environmentally sound. In many areas of government activity, the role of local government is vital. In developing strategies for the delivery of services, in the implementation of its programs, the Government will develop and promote an effective regional approach which draws on the strength of local councils and encourages them to work more cooperatively together. The Government will maintain its deep commitment to all the sportspeople of Ausfrom our elite sporting heroes to our juniors and masters. That commitment includes the $293 million 'Maintaining the Momentum' 1992-1996 sports funding package. The record level of government support for sport will help us toward a fitter and healthier society, and the Federal Government will continue to provide unsurpassed and total support for the Sydney Olympics 2000 Bid. Immigration, Ethnic Affairs and Multiculturalism The Government remains committed to a migration program, non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, gender and religion, which serves the best interests of all Australians. The Government encourages newcomers to acquire Australian citizenship to enable their full participation in Australian society. In recognition of the importance of Australian citizenship, the Government will propose legislation to introduce a new Pledge of Commitment and a Preamble to the Australian Citizenship Act. The Pledge is distinctly Australian and reinforces the commitment citizens make to Australia. The Preamble reinforces the importance of Australian citizenship as a common bond uniting all Australians. The Government is committed to maintaining a fair process for considering the claims of asylum seekers within Australia. Claimants will have access to an independent Refugee Review Tribunal from 1 July 1993, a meas-re which demonstrates this country's commitment to honouring its international obligaRecognising the vital place of languages in Australia's multicultural society, the Government will continue to provide interpreting and translating facilities that are essential links to and other services. Recognising its basic importance, the Government will continue to provide English language tuition and will pursue its four-year plan to remove the backlog of need among non-English speaking job-seekers. The Government is proud of its wide range of effective policies and programs for a multicultural Australia. It is particularly committed in its new term to strengthening the access and equity performance of all Commonwealth agencies, to ensuring that Australia'S record in community relations remains among the finest in the world, and to making the most of the international trade and economic advantages of Australia's cultural and linguistic diversity. Industrial Relations Cooperative workplace reform and the continuing development of more decentralised industrial relations arrangements will be critical in securing a more competitive and fairer Australia. Through a constructive and open partnership with the trade union movement and employers the Government will seek to opment accelerate the pace of labour market reform. In particular, it will support the widespread coverage of the workforce by enterprise agreements, including in its own area of employment. The Industrial Relations Act will be amend of ed to encourage the proliferation of workplace bargaining and clearly establish the rights responsibilities of parties and their enforceAlready, ment. The industrial relations framework will be further refined to allow employees, their unions and employers greater Ilexibility in developing arrangements that best promote riet the productivity of their workplaces. These refinements will improve the efficiency of labour market and mitigate the risk of inflagiven tionary wage outcomes. This drive for further decentralisation of industrial workplace will be underpinned by a secure safety net provided by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under minimum standards legislation and through the award system. The Government will also ensure that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will have an important role to playas an instrument for implementing a system of industrial relations based on enterprise bargaining. The Government recognises the importance of State industrial relations systems and intends to facilitate greater progress towards harmonisation of these systems. The Government will ensure that unions and employers have a better understanding of the new industrial relations framework and how to take fuller advantage of its Ilexibilities. It will also provide advice and assistance to increase the breadth and depth of workplace reform through cooperative bargaining and by the promotion of best practice. The Government's labour market reform program will be characterised and advanced by a special emphasis on social justice, enabling all Australians to participate more fully and be treated equitably. Industry, Technology and Regional DevelThe key task for industry policy is to continue to foster an internationally competitive and innovative industrial base for Australia. Many of the key planks of our industry policy are already in place, including a range measures to assist firms in adjusting to a more competitive environment, and to encourand age firms to undertake activity in Australia. many small and medium firms have become internationally competitive. The Government will continue to adopt measures to actively support industry development where they can be justified in terms of public benefit. It also recognises that the impact of industry development and structural the change on particular regions needs to be attention, given that some regions have borne a disproportionate adjustment burden in relations to the recent times. Small and medium sized companies have . played a major part in creating jobs and boosting exports in recent years. The·Government will concentrate more on the problems faced by smaller Australian firms, particularly in new and growing industries. It will closely examine existing assistance programs to ensure that they are accessible to smaller firms, and are sufficiently tailored to their needs. The Government will continue its policy of steadily increasing the exposure of industry to international competition through reductions in tariffs and bounties. The Government will, however, modify the developing country tariff preferences for all but the least developed countries and South Pacific Island Territories by eliminating preference margins for certain industries. The industries affected-which include textiles, clothing and footwear, chemicals, sugar, canned food, dried fruit and fruit juice-are facing substantially improved competitiveness at the same time as they are undergoing structural adjustments under tariff reduction, and other programs. Moreover, tariff preferences are no longer required for developing countries to compete in the Australian market in these industries. The Government will also move to bring assistance to shipbuilding in line with that other industries. The shipbuilding bounty will be progressively reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent by June 1996 in line with general manufacturing tariffs. To give effect to the outcome of the 1992 review of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Treaty and subsequent consultation with other countries, the Government will revise the rules of origin used to determine the eligibility of imports for tariff preferences. The Government will continue to ensure that innovation is rewarded through the industrial property protection system. Support for the pharmaceutical industry will be increased by providing an effective patent term of fifteen years. Changes will also be introduced to streamline our Trade Marks system. In its 1992 White Paper Developing Australian Ideas the Government recognised the central role science and technology have to play in our nation's future, and moved to integrate them more fully with other elements of government policy. Building on this strategy, in the light of the success of the Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs) Program, and the number of high quality applications made in the last round, the Government has decided it will invite applications to establish ten more CRCs in 1994-95. The new selection round will enable industry, research organisations and the Government to support important research and development initiatives that were not able to be fully developed for the rounds recently completed, as well as to support emerging areas of research and technology that will be of benefit to Australia. Business enterprises will be encouraged to take a strong lead in developing proposals. Law and Justice Achievement of greater cultural, gender and ethnic diversity in the judiciary is an important issue and for this purpose the Government will be considering the way in which it selects and assesses candidates for judicial appointment. The Government places a high priority on for the task of reforming the Corporations Law, given the potential impact that corporate regulation has on the investment environment. In order to restore and maintain investor confidence, we need to ensure that our laws are adequate to the task of enforcing appropriate standards of corporate accountability, including through. adequate disclosure to investors, and that there are appropriate checks and balances on corporate decisionmakers. At the same time, our laws must be flexible and adapted to the needs of a modern economy. An important step to achieving this will be to set in train a program for the systematic simplification of the Corporations Law to make it more accessible and understandable to business and the professions. The Government will continue the review and reform of copyright law; and it will actively pursue initiatives for achieving greater regional harmonisation of trade laws to facilitate access by Australia to overseas markets. In consumer affairs, the Government will award the highest priority to empowering consumers by ensuring that they have the information they need to make informed choices as well as access to affordable and fair methods of resolving disputes when they happen. To this end, the Government will ensure that our system of country-of-origin labelling is accurate and informative for consumers; improve protection of consumers in their dealings with the finance and other service industries; and press business and industry to adhere to standards of proper behaviour towards consumers through such mechanisms as codes of practice. The Government will respond to the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Operation of the Family Law Act in accordance with its concern to ensure that the Act and the Family Court of Australia meet , the changing needs of the Australian community. The Government will continue to respond to the recommendations of the Gibbs Committee reports on Commonwealth Criminal Law and continue its significant contribution development of a National Criminal Code. Primary Industries and Energy The Government is fully cognisant of the economic contribution and future potential of our efficient agricultural, energy and resources industries, including the scope to maximise this potential through enhanced investment and research into efficient production, processing and utilisation of the primary resource base. The Government will actively develop and implement policies to strengthen and diversify rural Australia's economic base, encourage more profitable and sustainable agricultural activities and improve community services and facilities within rural and regional Australia. Important new initiatives which complement the Government's existing policies and programs for rural Australia will include development and implementation of a World Best Practice Incentive Scheme, a Rural Development Incentive Scheme and a Rural Enterprise Network Program. A major longer term challenge for the energy sector is to develop policies which will minimise the environmental impacts of energy production, supply and use. The Government's program will include enterprise energy audits, fuel efficiency targets for cars and measures to save energy in houses and buildings, as well as its own operations. The Government will also look to the new generation of renewable energy technology to meet Australia's diverse needs. An important early measure to be implemented will be a plan developed with the solar hot water manufacturing industry and power utilities to encourage installation of domestic solar hot water heaters. Public Sector To enhance the ability of the Public Service to serve the Australian community, the Government will be according a high priority to a review of the legislative framework for employment in the Australian Public Service and the passage of a new Public Service Act. The public service reform program initiated to the by the Labor Government in 1983 has led to significant improvements in the ability of public sector agencies to meet the Government's policy objectives. However, more can be done to achieve results oriented management in the culture of the public service while maintaining strong ethical values of public service. Continuous improvement and best practice will be highlighted as concepts that need to be more fully integrated into the work life of public servants. Particular emphasis will be placed on improving program evaluation practices throughout the APS, and making better use of evaluation results in the development of new policy and identification of budget savings. Ministers and their senior public service advisers will continue to lead the way in engendering a client focus and improved service quality in their departments. Financial management and accountability policies, too, will be supported by the introduction of accrual accounting for all Commonwealth agencies and new financial legislation to replace the Audit Act. The Government will continue with its program of asset sales. It will continue to apply its policy of selling major assets whose retention is no longer justified in the public interest. The first of July 1993 will see the completion of the phased introduction of private sector competition for the commercially oriented services provided by the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services. The Government will be taking a number of additional measures designed to increase professionalism in Australian Government purchasing and to improve opportunities for Australian and New Zealand industry to compete for government business. There will be mechanisms to ensure that government buyers are given as much information as possible about the capabilities of local indusimpacts. try and that industry is better informed about the Australian Government's purchasing system and requirements. Tourism Under Government initiatives, tourism has emerged as a major contributor to national economic growth and as a significant source of new jobs, particularly for young Australians. The Government will continue to provide strong support for tourism, consistent with the National Tourism Strategy and the principles of ecologically sustainable development. The Government will work with industry to minimise tourism impacts on the environment through measures such as the National Ecotourism Strategy, and programs for forests and sites of national tourism significance. The Government will also target special interest tourism markets with high growth and yield potential such as conventions, incentive travel, rural farm-stays, cruise shipping and backpacking, and continue to work with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission on the development of tourism opportunities for indigenous people. Transport and Communications The Government will accelerate its program of transport reform. It is essential for the economy as a whole that we make the most efficient use of our transport infrastructure and that a national focus is given to this matter. A key priority will be development of a nationally integrated transport system. To end, the Government will establish a National Transport Planning Task Force. This Task Force will investigate the efficiency and adequacy of national transport infrastructure and institutional arrangements to meet the freight and passenger demands of the national economy into the next century, as well as longer term priorities for national transport infrastructure investment. In investigating these issues the Task Force will have regard to current and forecast demand for services; efficiency of intermodal links in the system; maintenance and enhancement of safety standards; and social and environmental In cooperation with the States, Territories and industry, uniform technical and operating regulations for all vehicles will be introduced together with uniform registration procedures and charges for heavy vehicles. Funding for roads of national importance will lead to the lowering of transport costs and enhanced safety. The Government will ensure that the National Rail Corporation commences full operation of interstate rail services as quickly as possible and that the future structure of Australian National is resolved quickly. The efficiency of Australian shipping is to be further improved with a three year program to reduce the average crew sizes in the Australian fleet. The sale of the Government's interest in the Australian National Line will be pursued within a framework which recognises the important role the company can continue to play in the Australian shipping industry. The conditions of sale will be aimed at retaining the company's Australian character. The Government's response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Report Ships of Shame will expand on its existing strong commitment to the elimination of sub-standard shipping. In aviation, the Government will continue to build on the reform program announced in the One Nation statement in February 1992. Increased competition in Australian aviation this arising from Qantas' access to the domestic market, planned new carrier entry into international operations and progress towards a single aviation market with New Zealand will deliver important consumer, trade and tourism benefits. In telecommunications, the Government will establish an expert group, including represenwell tatives from AOTC, Optus, industry and the unions, to examine the extension of high capacity interactive telecommunications facilities to business, educational and domesMedicare tic users in Australia. Strong support will continue for the develintroduced opment of national broadcasting services. In particular, the Government will implement its commitments to extend the coverage of SBS radio and television as well as the ABC's JJJ service. These developments will improve services to regional and rural Australia, and enhance multicultural services and those vided to youth. Women The Government is committed to the empowerment of women so that they can be fully involved in shaping and sharing the future. The new National Agenda for Women sets out Actions for the Future to the year 2000. The future growth of the Australian economy and the living standards of Australians will benefit from the participation of women in the workforce. The Government will greatly expand its child care program and introduce the Home Child Care Allowance to provide a source of independent income for women while they are out of the paid workforce caring for children. The process of increasing equity in pay and conditions for women workers will continue as will the implementation of the Commonwealth strategy on ILO Convention 156 on workers with family responsibilities. The Government will also establish Working Women Centres, initially in four states. In order to work towards the elimination of violence against women, the Government will work towards the implementation of the National Strategy on Violence Against Women. The Community Education Program will continue to influence current community attitudes towards violence. One measure will be gender awareness programs for members of the judiciary and other decision makers within the legal system. The Government will build upon its already impressive record in fostering the health and being of women. The National Women's Health Program has been extended for a further year; a major longitudinal study into women's health will be undertaken, a rebate will be available for bone density tests and the Government has also a National Osteoporosis Policy. The Government sets a high priority on communicating the intent and detail of its policies to women in the community. In order to assist women to articulate their views to Government, the grants program to women's organisations will be increased. pro- Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia: The Government believes that the successful completion of this legislative program is necessary for the success of Australia as a prosperous and enlightened democracy. The aim of the Labor Government is as it has always been: to create a richer and more rewarding Australia, and a fairer one. Economic recovery is crucial if we are to do this. So too is Australia's success as a manufacturing and trading country. The wide ranging initiatives outlined today are designed to achieve these great national goals. It is your legislative task to consider and debate these initiatives as they are introduced into the Parliament.

54,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The time allowed for nominations has expired.,44
55,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,"I am delighted to nominate the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) to the position of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of this House. It is a historic occasion today because the honourable member for Scullin's father previously occupied the position of Chairman of Committees from 19 August 1975 until 16 February 1976. On 11 November 1975 the sovereignty of this chamber was usurped by a vice-regal coup d'etat that saw Mr Jenkins senior cease to be Chairman of Committees. He came back-he was elected on 21 April 1983-as Speaker of this place unopposed, an acknowledgment by members of the Opposition of the integrity and the distinction in which he had served in previous positions. Indeed, that was acknowledged in a speech by the former Speaker, Sir Billy Snedden, when he congratulated the father of the present honourable member for Scullin. During his period in this place the honourable member for Scullin has earned the respect of members on both sides of this House. Civility and courtesy are his trademarks. He has shown fairness and ability when occupying the Chair as Deputy Chairman of Committees, a position he has occupied since 8 May 1990. His father is here today, and I am sure he is very proud, as is his family. His wife Michele and children Emlyn and Amanda are also here today. Unfortunately Ben cannot be here to share this occasion. I note that the Opposition is nominating the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) against the honourable member for Scullin. I for one will not be voting for the honourable member for Cowper because I would miss his interjections if he were to occupy the Chair. I encourage members of the Opposition to consider voting for the honourable member for Scullin. I will recount what he said in the concluding remarks of his first speech in this place on 15 April 1986: ... I leave the House with this very apt quote from the writings of James Henry Scullin, the words of which are inscribed on his memorial. They read: Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong. If the honourable member for Scullin is elected to the position, then that is the sort of intervention the Opposition might require from him when we deal some crushing blows to it in the course of this Parliament.",44
56,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to formally congratulate you on the attainment of your high office. I have every confidence that you will seek to serve in the best interests of the Parliament and this nation while ever you occupy that office. I was interested to hear the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) earlier today about the need to recognise that debate in this place will of necessity be robust and involve strong exchange of argument. As the Prime Minister noted, we ought not be squeamish about this. This is, after all, the ultimate 'clearing house' for policy in this nation. However, I believe that we need to be conscious of the fact that the Australian people are currently inclined to be both apathetic and ' cynical when it suits them about politicians in general, and, increasingly in recent times, about what happens in this chamber in 'particular. I believe that people discern very quickly the motivation of members in this place. It is not so much heated debate over issues that they object to; in fact it may well often be the lack of heated debate over issu,es and the overabundance of heated personality clashes, point scoring and ego-tripping that disturb Australians. They see their political leaders as being a little too keen to play the man and not the ball-to use an analogy which should appeal to you, Mr SPEAKER - and in this nation's current difficult circumstances they want, and have every right to expect us, to concentrate on finding solutions to our national problems. I believe that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) would make an excellent contribution to raising the standards and quality of debate in this place. Briefly, he was. elected to this place as honourable member for Cowper in 1984 after a varied range of activities, including being a man on the land. He was involved in the administration of the University of New England. He is well known for his journalistic abilities, and he had quite a background in journalism. He had an involvement in local government and served from 1952 to 1954 with the CMF. He has served on a range of committees in this place and has been Deputy Chairman of Committees since 1990. He has presence, dignity and a strong, firm voice. I believe that he would make an excellent Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees and I commend him as such.",44
57,Mr SNOWDON,Unknown,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training)- Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. I second the motion that the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) be appointed Deputy Speaker - d Chairman of Committees. I do so bearing in mind the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) this morning when he commented on the position of Speaker. If my memory serves me correctly, he said that the key quality of the person who holds the position of Speaker is integrity. Other qualities which he saw as important are flexibility and common sense. In the time that I have been in this Parliament, they are the qualities which have been the hallmark of the honourable member for Scullin's contributions thus far, whether as a backbencher participating in debate in this Parliament; as the Chairperson of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs; prior to that as Chairperson of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Publications; or in his involvement in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts or the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. During that time he has demonstrated those admirable qualities marked by the Prime Minister as being so important to the office of Speaker: integrity, flexibility, and common sense. In that sense, I see him as a person who is very well suited to take the position of Deputhe ty Speaker. His involvement in the politics of the Labor Party perhaps improves his qualifications immeasurably because, as members on this side of the House will know, he has had the arduous task of steering his way through as chairman of the Left caucus. That in itself can be a challenging responsibility. He has carried out that responsibility with the dexterity, footwork, common sense and objectivity required for the position of Speaker. However, there is one area of his life which deserves some comment: he is a person of great loyalty-to his family, his party, the Parliament and Fitzroy Football Club, which in itself deserves a badge of honour. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is a person of stature. He is a person whom I respect and who, I am sure, has the respect of many honourable members on this side of the House. But I would say to him that he should put his sword back in the sheath since I implore him to support the nomination of the honourable member for Scullin as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees.",45
58,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I formally congratulate you on your election as Speaker. I second the nomination of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) as Chairman of Committees. I have only been in this place for three years, but in those three years I have served with the honourable member for Cowper on the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies. I have found him to be a very fine member of that committee and a good contributor to it. On 8 May 1990 the honourable member for Cowper became a deputy chairman of committees. In the period he has done that job he has carried out those duties very well indeed. The honourable member for Cowper has the qualities necessary to perform the duties of a deputy chairman of committees. He has a reputation for fairness and firmness. He has an ability to display patience and common sense-something that is very necessary at times in this place. He also has the capacity to control the proceedings in an impartial manner. The honourable member for Cowper conducts himself in an orderly and disciplined manner-attributes that are necessary for the Chairman of Committees. I am greatly concerned about the earlier comments of frankness, fairness and equity in this place. I urge honourable members to think very seriously about our place at the moment in Australia. A number of honourable members have spoken about the lack of support for this House. Mr Speaker, you are a government nominee. I suggest to you and to honourable members present that it would be appropriate that the Deputy Chairman of Committees actually come from the opposition benches. We do it in committees and in the other place. Why not here? If we are genuine and the words uttered in this place earlier today are not hollow, then I believe that would be very appropriate. It would provide a means for us in the governing of this country to get the Australian people back onside. Those comments do not reflect on the Government's nominee. He is a fine member of this place. But I would ask honourable members to support the honourable member for Cowper. He is a man who has the respect of both sides of this chamber and the credentials to fulfil the role. I urge all honourable members to support the candidature of the honourable member for Cowper.",45
59,Mr CLEELAND,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I offer you my congratulations on your elevation to the high office you now hold. It is good to see the class of '84 progressing so well in this place. As I said in March 1990, before my parliamentary career was rudely interrupted, my colleague the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and I go back some time. I first met the honourable member when I was a councillor with the shire of Diamond Valley and he was serving as a councillor with the then shire, now the city, of Whittlesea. The honourable member and I, as members of parliament, share in an electoral sense both parts of the shire of Diamond Valley and part of the now city of Whittlesea. So I have known the honourable member from the days when he was a young councillor for the city of Whittlesea. When I first came to this place in 1984, his father, the Hon. Harry Jenkins, who is sitting in the gallery, and Mrs Wendy Jenkins, who also served on the city of Whittlesea council, were very prominent in local and federal politics in Whittlesea and the northern parts of Melbourne. It was an honour and a privilege for me to have known the family back then and to see the honourable member come into this House in the 1986 by-election in Scullin. The honourable member has my full support. I hope that the position he takes today with the support of this House will be widely acknowledged by the people in Melbourne as a proper office for him to hold. If he secures the position, the local residents of Whittlesea and in his electorate will say to him, 'Well done, Harry'. I support the nomination for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which is that the honourable member will make a fine Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees.",46
60,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"In accordance with the Standing Orders, the bells will be rung and a ballot taken. The bells having been rung and a ballot having been taken",46
61,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The result of the ballot is: Mr Nehl, 64 votes; Mr Jenkins, 75 votes. I declare Mr Jenkins elected as the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees.",46
62,Mr KEATING,Unknown," On behalf of the Government, it gives me very great pleasure indeed to congratulate the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) on his election to the positions of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. As an honourable member remarked in one of the nominating speeches, it is quite a phenomenon of our parliamentary history that he should succeed his father as an office-bearer of the Parliament. On such an occasion it is nice to have his father Harry and his mother Wendy in the gallery. I am sure that they are justifiably proud of him and to see that a family tradition has been established. There are a few family traditions in the Parliament, of course, with generations serving here, but it is very unusual indeed for two generations to serve as office-bearers of the Parliament. . The Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees has a very large task to perform. While the Speaker has administrative responsibilities for the House and the Parliament, for the management of the building, a particular load does fall upon the Deputy Speaker. The honourable member has been a deputy chairman of committees. He has had experience in chairing debates in the House and I am sure that he will be able to undertake the responsibilities of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees with great ease and aplomb. I am sure that it is a heavy task to manage a modem parliament. As I mentioned earlier, the proceedings of the Parliament are now being televised. There is a heightened accentuation of interest and focus upon the Parliament and the way in which it is managed. In such a relatively large parliament as we have now in a new building, the administrative tasks of the Speaker have always been quite heavy and are growing and the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees undertakes a lot of that role. All the things that were said this morning in electing the Speaker about common sense and flexibility and understanding of the debate and the very important role a Speaker can play in the facilitation of debate are, of course, just as true of the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. So this is a very important task. It is an honour which the House has bestowed upon the honourable member for Scullin, and on behalf of the Government I congratulate him on achieving this very important office of the Parliament.",46
63,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in congratulating the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) on his election to the position of Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. I had the advantage, I think, of coming into the Parliament at the same time as the honourable member. It is a very important job at a very important time in our country's history. I know that it is an important day for him and his family. On behalf of the Liberal Party, I simply congratulate him on attaining that office. We look forward to the same standards of impartiality and fairness that are identified with the position of Speaker. Under those circumstances, of course, he will have our full support. I am sorry that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) did not make it. I know that he has spent a lot of time in recent days travelling around Cowper with his slide show on his visit to Antarctica. He will now have quite a lot more time, I gather, to do that and maybe even to go to Antarctica and get some new slides. Mr TIM FlSCHER (Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia)-I join in congratulating the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). I wish him well in the post that he has now won. I acknowledge too the presence in the gallery of the honourable member's father. He is a former Ambassador of Australia to Spain, where he served with distinction. I wish him well. I also commend the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for his sterling work in the electorate. I think he would have made a commendable occupant of the position of Chairman of Committees. I regret that that is not to be on this occasion. I know that he will make a very good deputy chairman on occasionsand I wish him well in that regard. I understand that the House now looks like sitting till midnight on this first day, so I will leave my remarks mercifully brief. .",47
64,Mr NEHL,Unknown," Mr Speaker, may I first offer you my congratulations on your elevation to this very high office and at the same time congratulate the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). I had the opportunity to work with the honourable member as one of the deputy chairmen of committees in the last Parliament and I anticipate that I will have the same opportunity in this, the 37th Parliament of Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to say to you, Me Speaker, and to the honourable member for Scullin that if I am elected to that other position will both have my absolute loyalty and support in the task of running this Parliament. him. The offices of Speaker and Deputy Speaker are very demanding responsible tasks. We have heard a lot of talk today about the conduct and standard of Parliament. I think it is rather interesting that, from time to time, newly elected members from both sides of this House, without any parliamentary experience, have greatness thrust upon them and are placed immediately on the front bench. I do not believe it has ever happened that somebody in that position has been put into the chair of the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker because, obviously, to undertake those tasks, there must be some knowledge and background of the Parliament. Both you, sir, and the honourable member for Scullin have demonstrated quite clearly that you have the knowledge, the background, the skills and the ability to do that. I have served under three Speakers in this Parliament. I must say that I have a degree of affection for two of them. I am sorry that I cannot demonstrate any affection for the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), but I do thank him for the many courtesies that he extended to me during his period as Speaker. I do have affection for the Hon. Harry Jenkins, the father of the honourable member for Scullin, who is in the gallery. I well remember the way he performed the task of Speaker and I think that he was an excellent Speaker. He was succeeded, of course, by the Hon. Joan Child, a delightful human being and an excellent parliamentarian. I think that my fondest memory of Joan is the one occasion when she warned the National Party in to to. I do not think that had happened before and I do not think it has happened since. The final person I want to mention is Ron Edwards, the former member for Stirling, who served as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees in the last Parliament. I am delighted that we in the coalition have a new member for Stirling on our side of the House, but I must say that on a personal level I lament the loss of Ron Edwards. I take this opportunity to say that he was a great member you of parliament and I for one miss him on a personal level very much indeed. I commend Me Speaker, I again congratulate you. I look forward to working with you and with the honourable member for Scullin as this Parliament unfolds. I thank the mover of my nomination, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), and the seconder, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), for their very generous comments.",47
65,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"I sincerely thank the House for entrusting me with this position. When I entered this chamber in February 1986, it was not with an intent to mark my place in parliamentary history in this way. The opportunity has arisen; perhaps the sense of history will come to me at some later stage. I am pleased that my predecessor as the honourable member for Scullin, in his roles as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees, earned the admiration of many on both sides of the chamber. But when I sit in that chair I will have to do my own thing. Recently we have heard much from both sides of the chamber about generational change. I am not sure whether, in attaining this position, I represent some form of generational change. In his speech nominating the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) , the honourable member for Gwydir (Me Anderson) described his perception of the nature of parliamentary debate. Whilst I found the arguments of the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) on equity very compelling, I am glad that the chamber did not choose this occasion to set the precedent. I thank all the leaders for their remarks. Earlier, the Prime Minister (Me Keating) talked about this being a representative chamber and a political chamber. That cannot be avoided. I am proud to stand here as the Labor Party's nominee for this position, but I will endeavour, with all my abilities, to carry out my role as Deputy Speaker with the greatest amount of impartiality. The three years I have had as a temporary chairman of committees taught me one thing: when we sit in that chair we are never sure who our friends or enemies might be on a given day. I say to my proposer and seconder that I appreciate the sincerity of their words. them, along with a host of other nameless urgers who encouraged me to take this position, that I know who they are and I will seek their cooperation by way of their conduct in this chamber to make my life just a little bit easier. They are on notice. As for others in the last parliament who may have upset me, I will try to start with a clean sheet. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) mentioned that we are at a very important stage in the history of the nation and, probably, in the history of this Parliament. Whilst - I move: we learn a lot from all those historic precedents, we now have to do our own thing and attack not only the perceived problems that we have with the conduct of the chamber but also the real problems. A lot of pressure has been placed on the way we are envisaged by the wider public because of the televising of proc-ings. I tend to agree with the Prime Minister: perhaps not much has changed, but people's ability to see us in action has changed. I hope that with all the words that were said this morning and with the goodwill that can be mustered we will attack the way we operate, look at ways of improving it and, through that process, achieve our aim of making this nation an. even stronger and one. In conclusion, I am very pleased that not only my wife and two of my children but also my mother and father can be here in the chamber. I appreciate the words of the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland). I do realise that this will be a very important occasion for the people of my electorate, whom I am proud to serve, but I am also very proud that my family could be here today. NA NA",48

NA Hasluck, Rt Hon. Sir Paul, KG, GCMG, NA",49
67,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"Blaxland-Prime Minister) That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Saturday, 9 January 1993, of the Rt Hon. Sir Paul Hasluck, KG, GCMG, GCVO, KStJ Governor General from 1969 to 1974, member for the seat of Curtin from 1949 to 1969, Minister for External Affairs from 1964 to 1969, Minister for Defence from 1963 to 1964 and Minister for Territories from 1951 to 1963, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Paul Meernaa Caedwalla Hasluck was born on 1 April 1905 at Perth, Western Australia, and was educated at Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia. He began his working life in 1922 as a journalist for the better West Australian where he distinguished himself by twice winning that State's Lovekin prize for journalism. This was followed by a temporary lectureship in history at the University of Western Australia. Sir Paul joined the Department of External Affairs in 1941 and served in a number of positions, including counsellor in charge of the Australian mission to the United Nations in New York. He resigned in 1947 to return to the University of Western Australia where he was qmtracted to write two volumes of the official war history. The writing of this history was interrupted in 1949, when Sir Paul stood for and won the Federal seat of Curtin. He held the seat for 20 years, 18 of which were spent on the front bench of successive governments including, from 1964 to 1969, as Minister for External Affairs. By any reckoning, Sir Paul Hasluck enjoyed a distinguished parliamentary career. One can tell from the record that he was no ordinary journalist. Sir Paul went on to serve as Governor General of Australia from 1969 until 1974. During that time he carried out his duties with integrity, dignity and complete impartiality. And happily he found time to complete the second of the volumes of the official war history that he had contracted to write in 1947. Sir Paul, through his writings, made a considerable contribution to our understanding of our history and our place in the world. His interests were legion: he wrote on international relations and Aboriginal affairs; he wrote several volumes of poetry and, of course, his splendid and popular autobiography, Mucking About. For those who attended his funeral service, where his son read some of his prose, it was easy to see just what a sensitive and beautiful writer he was. As I remarked at the time of his death, he wrote always with a deep respect for our institutions, our history and the people of Australia, and, of course, brought new light to that history in many and various ways. Journalist, lecturer, writer, public servant, diplomat, politician and viceregal representative- Sir Paul enjoyed a unique career in which he worked unstintingly in the service of Australia and the Australian people. His contribution will be lasting and long remembered. On behalf of the Government I extend to his wife, Lady Hasluck, and his family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",49
68,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"It is a great personal honour for me, on behalf of the coalition parties, to support the motion before the House. The career of Sir Paul Hasluck was among the most varied and successful in Australian public life. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has provided details of Sir Paul's many achievements-as a journalist, as a diplomat, as a historian, as a man of letters, as a senior government Minister for 18 years, and as a Governor General. In my brief remarks I want to focus on two things: firstly, on the nature and the meaning of Sir Paul's unique contribution to Australian public life and, secondly, on Sir Paul's contribution to Australia's liberal tradition. Sir Paul spent much of his career either making history or writing about it. As Minister for Territories, then Minister for Defence, and later Minister for External Affairs, and as a Cabinet Minister for more than 13 years, Sir Paul was at the centre of the key political events that shaped Australian history in the decades after the Second World War. In Aboriginal affairs and in Australia's relationship with Papua New Guinea in particular, Sir Paul made a contribution which started a vital process of refonn and a vital process of policy reassessment. Sir Paul brought to the making of history the same qualities he brought to writing about it: an uncompromising attention to detail, a thorough understanding of the broader issues at stake, a self-sufficiency that sustained him in difficult times, and a capacity for hard work, sincerity and integrity that few, if any, Australians in public life have ever exceeded. The result is that his memoirs and his histories are essential reading for anyone seriously interested in understanding what the Second World War meant for Australia, how Australian postwar foreign policy evolved, how our relations with Papua New Guinea changed, and many other aspects of our national development. Sir Paul was steady, strong, and principled under pressure. He was an intellectual but an unpretentious and self-effacing one. He had a genuine distaste for intrigue, for lobbying and for, duplicity. His generosity towards political friends and foes alike clearly showed his basic sense of humanity. Looking at the influences that shaped Sir Paul's contribution to Australia's political and intellectual life, a few are very prominent. His family was always a focal point. His parents were Salvation Anny officers. Their work made him aware at first hand of the very real hardship and suffering that many people endure in their daily lives, and the example that their work provided instilled in him a lifelong sense of duty and service. Later in his life his wife, Dame Alexandra, and their children provided another important source of inspiration. Sir Paul's love of the Australian bush was another great influence on his life. It is memorably recorded in his 1977 autobiography, referred to by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), called Mucking About. It underpins his intense sense of being Australian and his endless search for the definition of Australia's identity. That search was deeply rooted in his extensive knowledge of, respect for and pride in Australia's past. In reflecting late in his life about the challenges facing Australia, Sir Paul noted: . . . our inheritance is not nostalgia for Europe the fullness of a new experience in Australia. His nationalism was of a quiet, constructive kind. Just over 20 years ago he summarised his own particular sense of patriotism when he wrote in the following terms: Patriotism is not a showy, crackling, flamboyant bit of display. It is something quiet and deep inside ourselves ... We have the beacon of an honourable tradition-a tradition now in our keeping. We have had in this land, men and women who were brave, who were kind, who were good, generous in spirit, and who were ready to serve. We have had many who died for the country they loved, many who spent all their skill and strength to build it. It great to be in the same team. Sir Paul's concept of patriotism was a demanding one. It called for much more than just words or emotion. He put it best in a speech he made when retiring as Governor General in 1974 when he said: It is a strange paradox today in Australia, when we are being more assertively Australian than ever before and crying aloud in the middle of the night with our own disturbing version of Australian roosterdom, that we are in fact less distinctively Australian than for a century past. He went on: A great Australia has to be something more distinctive than a Little England, a Little America or a Little Asia. We can learn much from others; we inherit much from others; but we have to create Australia for ourselves. Sir Paul's sense of nationalism also extended to his view of Australia's place in the world. He was one of the earliest voices in Australian postwar politics that highlighted the reality of Australia's geography, and urged Australia to recognise both its responsibilities and its opportunities in the Asia-Pllcific region. He argued consistently that Australia had a direct and special interest in the development of relations in its own region, and the priorities of his policy making reflected that very strong personal view. Another great influence on Sir Paul's life was what he once called his 'deep and private enjoyment of the sweet simplicities of life'. Those 'sweet simplicities' combined his love of Australiana with his love of literature, music and the arts generally. In combining those loves Sir Paul merged his Australianism and his internationalism. He expressed it in but his own words when he wrote in the following terms during his retirement: Of recent years, for a number of reasons including the noisiness of suburban life, most of my listening to recorded music has been in the loneliness of a patch of bushland in the hills behind Perth. Listening in the still hush of noon, looking out on gumtrees, blackboys, zamia palms and the mingled green and brown of untouched forest with brilliant patches of blue sky beyond, I realised that this is both a natural and perfect place to hear Palestrina. The sound belongs to the setting. The setting enhances the sound. A century or two ago people who thought of such is music felt like exiles, sad and sick for home. I listen to it feeling that it belongs to my home. In his political life Sir Paul was deeply committed to and respectful of Australian traditions and Australian institutions. It was a commitment and respect that was not blind or unthinking. It was one that was based on his extensive knowledge of their history and on the fact that our political traditions and institutions had long operated in an effective way and in Australia's national interest. Sir Paul's historical scholarship, his writings and his practical political involvement made a unique contribution to the development of the Liberal tradition in Australia. Near the end of his political career-in fact in 1968- Sir Paul wrote that he was conservative in the sense 'of thinking carefully of what you are going to destroy'. He continued: For most of my life I've been somewhat radical. I am still somewhat more radical than some of my ministerial colleagues. When I say radical, I mean I've always been a reformer. Sir Paul did not wish to keep everything the same forever, but he sought to take what had proved best in our past and adapt it to the needs of the present and to the needs of the future. He believed passionately in the supremacy of Parliament, in the rule of law and in the political and civil rights of all individucareer as. He attached fundamental importance to a high calibre, apolitical and efficiently structured public service that gave effect to the Parliament's laws and proper ministerial responsibility. He worked to create a strong and confident Australia, able to pursue its proper role in the region and beyond. He believed that our Constitution had served Australia well through decades in which widely different circumstances had made very different demands on it, and that changes to it should be made only after the widest range of thought and opinion had been canvassed. He shared Alfred Deakin's liberal vision of free and responsible citizens participating fully in a free and responsible society. He believed in an Australia society characterised by decency, humanity, freedom, equality of opportunity and a genuine sense of community. He abhorred prejudice and he abhorred intolerance. He saw harmony between a liberal economy and a moral community as the best foundation for a society of genuine fairness, genuine opportunity and genuine compassion. These were the beliefs and convictions that sustained Sir Paul Hasluck's faith in the liberal tradition-a tradition which his career, in all its phases, did so much to enrich. Sir Paul Hasluck is not just another voice from Australia's political past. His life and work also provide a source of wise counsel for the future. He was a man whose life and work give us a better understanding of Australia and our role in the world. With his integrity, propriety and sense of commitment, Sir Paul set standards of public life that all of us can aspire to. His passionate love for Australia, his respect for its history and institutions and his faith in its future should be a source of continuing reflection for all those genuinely interested in a better understanding of the kind of people we are, the kind,of country we were and what we can be in the future. Above all, Sir Paul will continue to inspire us down the years with his vision of Australia's national purpose. The starting point of Sir Paul's political over 30 years ago is in fact an appropriate end point for my remarks today. In his maiden speech in the Parliament in March 1950 Sir Paul said: Let us retain by all means our different Party political views, and our different ideas about the best way in which to reach great objectives. Let us carry on the contest of Party politics with all the vigour and decency of which we are capable but, above all, let l!S ensure that the good of Australia in the sense of the whole nation shall be the supreme thought. In pursuing that objective we will not only be living up to our own responsibilities, but we will be living up to the goal which inspired the life and the work of a very great Australian, Sir Paul Hasluck. On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I extend our sympathy to Sir Paul's family on their loss. On this side of the House we are particularly proud and particularly honoured to support this motion.",50
69,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown," Mr Speaker, it is with sadness that I rise to support the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on this condolence motion for a man whom I consider to be truly great Australian, a great conservative and a great parliamentarian. Of course, he represented a Western Australian electorate and had to carry that additional cross of frequent crossings of the Nullarborwhich he did well-by whatever mode of transport was available in those earlier days. He had wide ranging interests, as is revealed in his autobiography referred to by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Of his many books, his voiumes of the official Australian war history, which dealt with the organisation of the war in Australia, are regarded quite properly within historical circles, as classics. In his early career as a journalist he won several prizes for journalism, and in 1972 he shared the Ernest Scott prize for history. Sir Paul Hasluck was truly an intellectual and one who made an outstanding contribution to Australia as a journalist, historian, public servant, politician, government Minister, Governor General and, in that role, as Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces and holder of the reserve powers. I will not dwell on the detail which has been covered by other speakers, but I highlight the fact that Sir Paul did not seek self-promotion and that was seen by many as an essential ingredient of his political career. His administration of the Territories ment extended from 1951 to 1963. In other words, he was Minister for Territories for 12 consecutive years. I guess it is a manifestation of the amount of change and volatility in politics today that that will probably stand as a record which is not likely to be repeated. I think Senator Button has come closest to that record of one person holding the same Ministry for 12 years, although he departed earlier this year after a lengthy stint in the industry, technology and commerce portfolio. Sir Paul built up a fine record of administra-ion in that portfolio. I am told that he was an extremely exacting Minister and one who was accused of trying to be not merely Minister, but also departmental secretary, section head and even, at times, junior clerk. Nevertheless, I think this criticism is a refleche tion of his personality, his demanding standards, his exactitude, his intellect and his eye for detail. I simply say to the House that the thing which strikes me most about Sir Paul Hasluck in my reading is, firstly, the great affection held for the bush and country Australia-that area in close proximity to Perth; the hills to the east of Perth to which the Leader of the Opposition referred correctly. Secondly, his brand of conservatism was that of a reformer, but a reformer who thought carefully of what was going to be destroyed, which is a very relevant issue and one we will need to consider as we debate such things as the Constitution. Thirdly, his modest upbringing indicates again that conservatives in this country are not necessarily from a wealthy background-in fact, I would assert not often from a wealthy background-and therefore there is nothing at all inconsistent with social conservatism and a social conscience. In closing, I refer to the words of W. MCMahon Ball who, as emeritus professor of political science at Melbourne University, said of Sir Paul Hasluck: It is a good thing, with whatever mistakes or failures, to have had a man at the centre of Australian political life as indifferent to personal gain or glory, as incapable of sly or devious tactics, as Sir Paul. I extend sympathy to his family and support depart- this condolence motion.",52
70,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"It is a privilege to rise to speak on this condolence motion. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson): the Liberal Party has much to be proud of in that Sir Paul Hasluck served in its ranks for so long in this Parliament. We, as members of parliament, can all be proud of the fact that he was here. Had he never been here and simply continued anyone of the careers he pursued prior to entering this chamber, he would still have been a great Australian and we would still Qe celebrating his memory, in some shape or form, in this chamber. He was a very good journalist. Hewas a great academic and scholar. He was a very substantial public servant-a junior one, but obviously would have risen to senior ranks had he chosen to remain in the Public Service or re-enter it at some date subsequent to his disappearance from it. Because it is now so long since he was in parliament, very few of us here can claim a he personal connection with him. But I suspect one or two of the Opposition members who will speak to this condolence motion will nevertheless be in a position to do so and will take an opportunity to place their views on record. My personal connections with him were very slight. According to my father, he, with my father, carried me in a basket onto a plane for my first trip to Canberra. I doubt whether any two members of this chamber would be capable of doing that now, which only goes to show what giants they were in those days. My other connections with him came, as they do, to those who, as young people associated with members of parliament, in boyhood, girlhood and youth, invariably have the opportunity of introductions to many great people. I had those opportunities during the 1950s and 1960s. When I became a member of parliament, Sir Paul was a patron of a school in my electorate-Guild ford primary school, a historical school in Western Australia where he had been a student for a number of years. So I had the opportunity to meet him then, but I was no more than a nodding acquaintance and claim no more than that. But I would claim very considerable respect for the public career and life of Sir Paul Hasluck. Different eras provide different opportunities for people. That colonial era the connection we had with the south-west Pacific, basically from Federation to the time when we granted independence to Papua New Guinea in 1975, permitted many extraordinary opportunities for many Australians. It enabled Black Jack MCEwen to become the only successful organiser of a revolution in Australian political history. Fortunately, he did not attempt it here; he did it on New Caledonia and removed the Vichy French Government and installed the free French Government during World War II. Our colonial position in relation to Papua New Guinea permitted opportunities for Australians to contribute substantially to nation building. Basically, most Australians did not do this-and that included most Australians with a connection with the Territory. However, that did not apply to Sir Paul Hasluck. Because we never permit ourselves accolades in this place, and those who comment upon us do not permit us accolades, his role as territories Minister has never been properly evaluated by anyone writing a decent history of the place. But his impact was extraordinary. It cannot be measured in monuments, but he had many of them; one of them being the fact that he was a founder of the University of Papua New Guinea during his time in office. He was also unusual in this place and for his time-and it probably extends to this time-in his detailed and sensitive understanding of the Aboriginal people. His Salvation Army background was broad, but he concentrated mainly on developing an understanding of Aboriginal Australians. In fact, one of his first books, published in 1942, was on that subject. He carried his interest through to his conduct of the portfolio. His understanding of Aboriginal affairs extended to a genuinely bipartisan attitude. When anyone on the Opposition side took an interest, he followed up that interest-and that included accepting Opposition motions for the creation of parliamentary committees to look into Aboriginal grievances. I would say that his time in subsequent portfolios was probably not as satisfying to him as his time spent as the external territorand ies Minister although, again, his impact on Australian history was substantial. During his career as external affairs Minister he was unfortunate in having to operate in a period of time when basically the public conduct of Australian foreign policy was, to some extent, poisoned by the debate on, and participation in, the Vietnam war. I am not canvassing issues in that regard; that is simply an objective statement. That conflict imprisoned Ministers and imprisoned creativity in this country while we worked that poison out of our system. I think in a different era Sir Paul would have made an even more notable contribution to our national affairs as external affairs Minister. He created history in Papua New Guinea and he created history in our relationship with the Aboriginal people. I think he would have had an opportunity to change the history of this nation on two other occasions. One such occasion would have been if the Liberal Party had elected him Prime Minister at the time he stood for that office. It may well have introduced a very different political history in the 1970s. We may have had an even more different political history in the 1970s if he had continued as Governor General. I do not know of all the activity at the time when he was Governor General. I am told that there was a substantial opinion in the government of the day that it would have liked to see him continue in office. So, I am not sure to the extent that it was his decision that he did not do so. I think probably very substantially, it was. For us on this side of the House, it is probably a very great shame if that were to be the case. Had he continued, then the political history of this country would have been very substantially different. His impact on our society, of course, is not just in his public career in this place. As a historian, he greatly contributes to our understanding of ol,lrselves as a people. His twovolume history, The Government and the People 1939-1945, the period of World War II, is the definitive statement of the impact of the most eventful set of affairs in the life of this nation on the character of this nation. As a journal of record of that, it will stand the test of time. It will be the major statement forever on that particular matter. As a poet and a writer generally, he has impacted on the way in which this nation thinks, and he has passed that on to his children. One of the most considerable writers of contemporary Australian life is, of course, his son, and obviously his son has benefited greatly from an opportunity to have the views of and read and understand the erudition of his father. I would like to join all those who have thus far spoken in expressing my condolences to his family. I must say, having attended his funeral, I was delighted that his family appreciates and fully understands the fact that he is a sorely mourned Australian.",53
71,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"It is an honour to join those who have spoken on this condolence motion for Paul Hasluck. While tributes to Sir Paul have been published in every major newspaper in the country, and he has been the subject of valedictory papers and speeches, I suspect, as Peter Ryan suggested in his reflections recently in Quadrant, the columns of small obituary notices placed in the local West Australian newspaper 'proved how well and widely this humble, great man was liked in his own town-from footy clubs to the society of women writers'. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has focused on his contribution to intellectual and political life and to the liberal tradition this country. I would like to reflect on the man who has commanded the respect of such a broad spectrum of Australian society. Much has already been said about the world in which he grew up, the community to which he belonged, and the conditions which helped shape Haslu9k, the individual. In his autobiography, Sir Paul stated: The real nature of a man does not change very much from the time when he was a boy. See the youth clearly and you see the grown man-the real man underneath the trappings. That was true of Hasluck. As a boy growing up in a devout salvationist family he was taught that it was sinful to be self-centred and he was inculcated with a strong sense of obligation to help others. That sense of duty became an undiscriminating obligation to work for others, not for himself. His love of literature, the bush and animals, especially horses, as well as this strong sense of duty, were constant threads that were interwoven into the fabric of his long, sturdy and varied life-both public and private. As I reflect on that life, there are many areas of undeniable achievement. His lifelong commitment to Aboriginal people began with a fascination of their history through his first readings of anthropology, curiosity about legends, and an interest in Aborigin-l place names. I believe that it was his overriding sense of fairness and compassion that drew him towards examining the conditions of Aborigines in the early 1930s. This early work formed the foundation for his masters thesis and was later published as a book titled Black Australians. Because of wartime conditions, only 600 copies were ever printed and today it is a rare and sought after book. As Minister for the Interior, his work with and for Aborigines must be seen in the context of the time. Hasluck said of that period: We grew up in a place and in a period when conflict was over and reconciliation and absorption had apparently begun. We did not think or talk about race conflict. His hope was that Aboriginal people would take part as Australians in shaping the future of Australia and would benefit from it in the same degree as all other Australians. In his work for Aboriginal people he was, above all in else, a social reformer. He strove for the full recognition of their entitlements-legally as citizens and socially as fellow Australians. However, it was in other areas that Hasluck considered he had made his greatest achievements. According to his son, Nick, it was in three areas that Sir Paul considered he had made his greatest contribution. The first was his work at the United Nations which, I believe, has been greatly underestimated. It Included planning Australian policies in the postwar period, as well as being involved as a senior member of Evatt's staff in drawing up the charter of the UN at the San Francisco conference. Secondly, as Minister for the Territories from 1951 to 1963, he prepared Papua New Guinea for independence. Faced with formidable problems of welding numerous diverse interests into a cooperative framework, he laid the foundations for the future independent administration, promoted indigenous agriculture, and established primary education throughout the country. Whilst some have criticised his administration as paternalistic, the fact that transition to independence was achieved smoothly was in no small measure the result of his detailed knowledge, and diligent and careful administration. The third area that Sir Paul considered his greatest contribution was in his two volumes of the Australian war history, The Government and the People 1939-1945. Hasluck considered a study of history a means by which society may arrive at an understanding of what it is. Hasluck's graphic account of that period of our history illustrates our emergence as a nation. His published works reflect the standard of excellence that he maintained throughout his life, whether it was as the probing young journalist, the meticulous and diligent administrator, or the patient and methodical amateur carpenter. Hasluck had been influenced by the writings of Montaigne in his early twenties and, although he certainly never contemplated politics then, much of Montaigne's philosophy formed the basis of his political tenet. He cared not what he was in the opinion of others but, rather, what he was in his own opinion. That offers a possible explanation as to why he did not lobby on his own behalf for the prime ministership after the death of Harold Holt. Hasluck also confided that Montaigne 'put him out of tune with most of those with whom I had to play. I suffered from a lack of enthusiasm at kicking someone else in the guts'. Hasluck said: The worse of Montaigne was, for example, when a political adviser would have told me to do something strenuous about public relations or to drink and make jokes with some cocky little person for whom I' had no regard, Montaigne refreshed my mind, calmed my spirit, and counselled me to do nothing. Nick Hasluck, in his farewell message at the service for his father, referred to his father's love of the sweet simplicities of life-his love of poetry, of music, of horses. Nick quoted a passage from Sir Paul's autobiography, recalling childhood experiences at their impact on the young Paul. He quoted these words: I would linger for a while in the gleam of the stable, just to hear for a little longer the steady munching of the horses feed; the occasional fluffmg through their nostrils and the sound of horses munching again-a lovely sound of peace, contentment, work done and animals safe at home and cared for in their stalls. Many years later, Sir Paul would say: When Parliament troubled me, I used to sit thinking to be back to a stable and I was unworried. The simple but secure childhood experiences left their indelible imprint on Paul Hasluck, the man who later in his life said: Much of my emotional life since I have grown up has been part of a search to recapture that sense of peace that I had in the bush as a small boy, to feel again the intimacy with the whole existence and to know the quietness and serenity that in an adult is the nearest we can come to the love and innocence of a child. These traits, combined with Hasluck's strong sense of duty spanning such a distinguished public career, made him a unique and highly respected Australian. I believe his poem, Derisive Chant, embodies all his qualities of wit, perception, compassion and intellect. I will just quote a few words on his thoughts about his profession as a member of Parliament: All candidates for office. Men with quick knees Aspiring to be chosen as MPs Who father any orphan cause but nurse With ready bottle and fond clucks Electorates, And tremble if a 'vote' expectorates, Who plan for better days but hope for worse. The most fitting tribute that I can give to this man is that he left things better than he found them-better not for himself but for others. The detractors of my party sometimes say that this is a party short of heroes. The reason I am contributing to this debate today is that, for the qualities he exhibited and the way he carried out a lifetime of public service with such dignity, this man is one of my heroes. I offer my condolences to his son, Nick, his wife and the rest of his family.  briefly to this motion so ably moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and contributed to in no small measure through his own respect for the late Paul Hasluck by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley). Although the Minister said he saw little of Paul Hasluck, he nevertheless understood the contribution which this man made. From the contributions which have been made, honourable members will realise that this is no ordinary Australian whom we honour today. The Minister himself said that some of us who served with him, such as the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), myself and a few other members on my side of the House, would wish in a more mundane or personal way to inject a note about a very outstanding Australian. I not only served in the Parliament with Paul Hasluck but also was fortunate enough to follow him, although not immediately, in two portfolios: territories, which was external territories when I held it, and external affairs which was foreign affairs when I held it. My year in 1972 in my second portfolio of external territories was quite a frantic one. We were moving as fast as we could to get Papua New Guinea on the road to independence, transferring administrative and legislative functions very rapidly. Paul Hasluck was the Gove-or-General and, fortunately, I would see him at Executive Council meetings. Naturally, he took a personal interest after so - any years of nurturing and giving a foundahon to Papua New Guinea. I heard a remark made from someone on my side who was surprised when the Minister referred to colonial ties. Of course, we were colonial masters of that territory and the role of the Minister was almost that of a benevolent dictator. Certainly in my day-although not in Paul Hasluck's day-the Minister was preparing to work himself out of a job and preparing a territory to reach nationhood. The Minister was aware that he was virtually in total control of a nation. Sir Paul Hasluck did this for 12 years, together with his extraordinary contributions towards Aboriginal welfare. His feeling for, comprehension, understanding and love of Papua New Guinea were very evident to me when I conversed with him at the time of the rapid pace with which we were moving. The occasions I had to discuss foreign policy with him were more limited when he was out of Canberra. When I came here he sought me out, perhaps because of the regard which I know my predecessor in the seat of Kooyong had for him-albeit that he left him in the territories portfolio for so very long. He had an immense regard for Paul Hasluck. I had been told and had read of the alleged pomposity and inflexibility of this man, who, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has rightly said, had he not come into this place would have been remembered for the enormous contributions he made in all the fields of human endeavour that he pursued. He sought me out in my second month here and asked me if I had come to understand the layout of Canberra. He drove me around Canberra in the old Peugeot that he used to drive to work-no Commonwealth car for him. He explained to me even then that his thoughts were that, if this interminable committee which was examining a so-called permanent Parliament House ever reached finality, he would love to have the Parliament located near the lake so that it was closer to the people. There was none of this stuff up on hills for him; it was to be a part of the people. When John Gorton was Prime Minister and he freed the Parliament, his Ministers and his party to have a free vote on the location of the House, Paul Hasluck duly made the sort of speech that he had given to me while on this drive. On another occasion he sent me a message and asked me if I would like to ride around Canberra with him again. I assumed I would be in the old Peugeot, but it turned out I had to ride a horse with him. As honourable members will recall, he used to keep a horse at the old Yarralumla riding school, which was located very close to where he eventually worked at Government House in Yarralumla. This was no pompous man; this was a man who committed himself to a form of service and association with people with warmth and generosity. I do not think until later in his career, and perhaps after his death, people appreciated just what a warm and substantial contributor he was. I have read that he was inflexible. I made a speech in the old Parliament House which I looked up in Hansard late this afternoon. I made a speech in around 1967 or 1968 attacking the Minister for External Territories as he then was-a man who had done so much for me-for not supporting a motion in the United Nations to establish a committee just to examine the possibility of admitting China into the UN. The Minister was in the House, as he always was for all discussions and debates on the estimates relating to his department. He replied to a number of matters that I had raised on the Soviet intrusion and attack on Czechoslovakia of 1968, but he made no mention of what I had said about China's admission to the UN. After the debate was over, he having closed it with his own remarks, he asked me to come down to his office. I thought I was going to get a nice drubbing, but in fact he was as consistent as his speech. He sat me down and said that he agreed with all I had said. He pointed out that on occasions foreign policy was rather like having to tack on a yacht, that one needed flexibility and that there would be occasions where there would be conflicting principles and one might override the other. He had such a commitment to the region that that came through in so many of his statements and speeches. He had received representations from the ASEAN countries not to support this motion. Even though one part of the intellectual process led him to feel that there should be a move to examine this, he felt compelled, if Australia had a destiny in this part of the world, to stick with those with whom he associated and wanted Australia to associate. We voted against the motion not because he did not think it was right but because he wanted to stand foursquare with the countries of our own region. That is hardly inflexibility. Reference has been made to the fact that he would not connive. It is well known that when my predecessor retired as Prime Minister there were two candidates for the deputy leadership. One was adept with the telephone and the other-Paul Hasluck-was not. Paul lost by two or four votes. I was in here for the leadership battle which followed on the disappearance of Harold Holt. On this occasion he did do something: he wrote a simple one-page letter to all members. Most of us here are used to the telephone being used on these occasions, but there was no use of the telephone by Paul Hasluck. It was a simple, short, pithy statement setting out why he believed he could lead the party. I think he probably felt that was a fairly undignified exercise but, nevertheless, it was done. Honourable members will gather from the simplicity of these remarks that I had enormous admiration for this man. Anyone who knew him could not help but be moved by the sheer force of his quiet but constructive arguments and his personality. When I read what the Parliamentary Library distributed today as a record of him, I saw references to this recluse figure; this rather arrogant person with a pompous manner and inflexible nature. In 1964, when he was interviewed on assuming the portfolio of external affairs, he said that he found it interesting that his experience had taught him that most public reputations are false; that men are criticised for the wrong faults or praised for the qualities they do not have. At that time that comment was certainly apt so far as Paul Hasluck was concerned. Paul Hasluck was an immensely proud Australian. He was a critic of what he saw, particularly of the forms of plagiarism that were intruding into this country-simply borrowed from overseas. He was a forthright regionalist, as was Casey before him, with his absolute stress on our relationship with South East Asia in particular. It is true that he was a stickler for detail in the administration of his department, as I later learned from officers who worked with me. An:d he was a stickler even to his death. The two of us had dinner in Melbourne some 18 months ago. He had enjoyed or was about to enjoy the fellowship of a man he admired greatly-Peter Ryan; a former editor of Melbourne University Press, who I do not believe I have seen since the days when the Encyclopaedia of Papua and New Guinea was published by Melbourne University Press in 1972. On that occasion Paul spoke very warmly to me about Peter Ryan. Paul also said that he had prepared and indexed all his files and records for his family so that there would be no problem should anyone wish to ascertain his views-perhaps on anybody, although I am not too sure-after his death. This was not said in any morbid way; this was Paul Hasluck preparing himself for perhaps another transition. But it was certainly to ensure that his family was not inconvenienced in any way by his passing on. All contributors here today have captured the fact that Paul was, as I said at the outset, no ordinary Australian. Paul was in fact an extraordinary Australian. His life was truly full and memorable. While his death was a profound loss, his life, which has influenced so many of us, continues. I trust it will continue for our children as well. He was a great Australian, and those of us who served with him were privileged so to do. I extend my sympathy to his family.",55
72,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 7.32 to 8.30 p.m.,59
73,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I wish to be associated with the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and so adequately and eloquently supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and other honourable members. Before I address that motion I would like, because it is relevant to what I want to say, to compliment you, Mr Speaker, on your election to your high office. I also compliment Deputy Speaker Jenkins and wish him well. I mention Deputy Speaker Jenkins because when he responded to his election he referred to the change of generations. I think it is important that in this House we understand that the change of generations began long before the election of Deputy Speaker Jenkins to his office tonight or, indeed, his election to this Parliament. To my mind, it began at the beginning of the second half of this century. Nobody articulated the change and its implication for Australia and our future better than the late Sir Paul Hasluck. I knew him in my service with him in this Parliament up to the time of his appointment as Minister for External Affairs, throughout his period as Minister for Defence, and as Governor General. As others have suggested, the three areas in which he prided himself most in his service as a Minister were: certainly the role he played in the United Nations working on the staff of Dr Evatt in helping to draft the charter of the United Nations; secondly, the role he played as Minister for Territories in the evolution of what was an extraordinarily primitive country, emerging from the Stone Age, Papua New Guinea, and in assisting the progress of that nation towards self-government; and, thirdly, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) has said, his role with the Aborigines. I do not want to refer to those so much as to talk about some personal facets of his life and then perhaps refer to the way in which he expressed something of his life. In my association with him, I remember sitting at the table as the Minister on duty when Paul Hasluck, as he was then, was responding to a contribution made by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gough Whitlam. I remember that Gough rather irately took exception to Paul's response and a glass of water was thrown across the table. Whether or not that lasted, I think of it as an unfair representation because I know the two of them subsequently became quite close in many matters. My wife and I also travelled with Sir Paul Hasluck and his wife, Dame Alexandra, across Australia on the inaugural journey of the Indian Pacific. I was then Minister for Shipping and Transport and he was Governor General. They invited us to have a bit of a reflection on the circumstances of entering Perth. As the train moved to the Avon Valley I remember him then speaking of his youth and the joy and pride he took in the countryside around him. There is no doubt that in many ways Sir Paul's own attitude towards his achievements was reflected so ably by his son Nick who, during the funeral service, said that his father, not long before his death had said, in a discussion with him, 'Really, I feel no need for an obituary on my behalf. I have had a full and a happy life. I have had a rewarding life. I have been able to achieve all those things that I set out to do'. All who attended that service will remember that Nick really referred more to the lifetime of his father in the very expressive and emotive words that he used on that occasion through referring to Mucking About and the extracts from his written verse. I thought tonight I might refer to some of that verse because I think that describes the man so well as I knew him. I do it because I think he is an exceptional Australian. I say that he began so much the articulation of the new Australia because of the way in which he referred in his prose and his poetry to the problems he saw around him. In a delightful publication called Collected Verse that was published in 1969 by the Hawthorn Press there are three poems which, probably more than anything, express the man as I knew him. In Discontent in the Suburbs he says: Having once walked in that land I am sick with desire. The tarred road through the suburb is lined with dying trees And grey dried weeds Between a palisade of skinny poles and whining wire. The poem goes on: Watch the wild frenzy of the herds of doom! See how the population wobbles on a downhill graph, And human life is plotted in the chief clerk's roomSquares marked in green and a red stream of destiny. - Red in the square at dawn! The statisticians' rifles crack and with a silly laugh Humanity slides down the wall, her white breast torn. Sir Paul referred so. much in this place, and personally, to the 'world he saw around him. I remember the many occasions in Cabinet in which, evoking some of those concerns that he had both as Minister for Territories and Minister for External Affairs, we would have major arguments whenever any suggestion was made of any cutting of the Government's aid budget. He felt very strongly about the role and responsibility we had. Just as he saw Australia as an evolving nation of people who had begun with very little, achieving so much, he felt that in the same way we had a responsibility to help others do the same. In Breaking Point, in that same volume, Sir Paul describes so much of the desperation that there is in the hearts of those in government trying hard to resolve the problems of the world. He says:. Sometimes I want to cry: Oh, go to Hell. To hell with pommy babblers, yawping fools and Melbourne Babus in strange clothes. Oh go to Hell. Further on he says: I do not cry. In the quiet corners of my mind I seek my native folk, my own, the quiet folk who wait and understand, men with keen wrinkled eyes, and slow thin smiles, men with firm hands. He continues: I think of tired men with callused hands, lips black with sweat and red-rimmed patient eyes, crying for faith in treeless wastes of pain. I see the fearless' men, the bold, the strong, who stand like poppet heads against the sky and raise their hands with purpose. Then I do not cry. I lift my head and sing. Sir Paul's life was really a translation of those basic emotions of seeking to achieve, of despair of what he saw around him and of striving to achieve its resolution. An epitaph to the man could be no better expressed than in his translation of Victor Hugo's Pisque J'ai Mis Ma Levre from the French dramatics, when he says: The wings of time will brush my life in vain; My thirst is quenched at founts, full to the brim; My soul has more of fire than you have ash; My heart has more of love than you can ever dim. Sir Paul Hasluck was a great Australian. To his wife and to his family, on behalf of Rosemary and myself, I would like to extend our deepest sympathy. In every way he - ill remain in my memory and I trust he remalOS in the memory and admiration of this House.",59
74,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"It has been mentioned that Sir Paul Hasluck became the first honourable member for Curtin when that seat was created after a redistribution in 1949. He held the seat until he resigned to enable him to become Governor General in 1969. . Sir Paul's life and distinguished career of public service have been more than ably recounted by previous speakers. It is worth remembering, however, that Sir Paul was not just an active participant in the government - f this country over many years; he took hiS wealth of experience in public life and used it to make some very important contributions to our thinking about parliamentary government, and he put this thinking into a uniquely Australian context. It is perhaps to be expected that one who held high office in a career of public service spanning so many years would develop some strongly held views on the nature and role of government in this country. But few individuals have expressed their views in the systematic and constructive way that Sir Paul articulated his ideas on government and public service throughout his career and during his retirement-if, indeed, he ever did retire from active participation in public life. I digress to instance that until his death he was doing the small things that were scarcely noted. He attended the ANZAC Day commemorations of one of his electoral sub-branches, the Shenton Park sub-branch. He remained a patron of that group and attended its annual dinner. There was no personal gain for him in doing that, and this was after he became Governor General and after he retired from that position. In the latter years of his life he accepted the duty, which is not surprising, knowing the man, of attending to his wife who was and remains desperately ill. Sir Paul had well developed views on the role of parliamentary government in Australian life, the virtues of the Australian Constitution, and the importance of a professional and independent public service for good government in this country. His views on these subjects were compelling, not least because they were argued for in a constructive, public spirited and non-partisan way. We would all do well to read what Sir Paul had to say on these and other subjects which others have canvassed and in which he took an active, intellectual interest. His views were informed not only by a wealth of practical political experience but also by a sound understanding of, and concern for, the values that underpin our parliamentary system of government. Sir Paul understood better than most the many virtues and some of the vices-of our parliamentary system of government. We are very much the richer for that understanding, an understanding that has been missing in many of the people who have held high office in the history of this country. As recently as November last year Sir Paul wrote from his hospital bed a speech for the launch of a book in Perth of the proceedings of the Samuel Griffith Society entitled 'Reflections on Australia's Constitution'. The speech was delivered on Sir Paul's behalf by his son, Nicholas. In that speech he said, amongst other things: If the history of (this) century yields a lesson, it is not that our nation needs a more elaborate constitutional text, so much as it needs political wisdom, clearer understanding of where our interests as a people and a nation lay, and above all, more of that singular talent for working together . . . that is the characteristic of good government in a parliamentary democracy . . . Our biggest worries in the government of Australia are not whether the text of the Constitution is perfect, but whether we have enough wisdom-or even enough plain common sense-to govern our nation wisely. 1 commend those words to honourable members, and 1 join with the House in extending my condolences to Sir Paul's widow and his family.",61
75,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"I should like to join with my colleagues in the House in noting the great career of one of our colleagues who has passed, Sir Paul Hasluck. Possibly I am the only person in this chamber who has actually had the experience of serving under Sir Paul during his period as Minister for External Affairs, as the position was then called, between 1964 and 1969. Much has been said by his biographer and by others as to the disciplined nature of the man. I would have to attest that he was a very disciplined person in his own life, and he expected no less than that of every officer that served under him. In fact an apocryphal story can be told about how he instructed his department as to how a ministerial or Cabinet submission should be designed. I assure the House: woe betide any person who submitted a submission which was not, down to the last comma and the last full stop, fully in accordance with the dictates of the Minister; it was simply sent back with some rude comment and the person was told to do it again. The outcome of all this was that we had a Minister for External Affairs who was truly head of his department. Although the secretary for most of that period was none other than Sir Arthur Tange, a man who was also well known for his independent spirit, followed then by Sir James Plimsoll, at no stage was there any suggestion from those extremely competent civil servants that it was not the policy of the Minister that they were there to administer. Sir Paul on his side made it absolutely certain that it was the policy of the government that the department was there to carry through. In that context, it is worth noting that there has been a tendency in recent times perhaps to rewrite the history of the 1960s and the 1970s in terms of who got to Asia first and what specific position was adopted by previous governments and Ministers, I want to lay quite clearly on the record the fact that Paul Hasluck was absolutely an Australian. He believed in the need for Australia to create and to build for itself and its future closer links with the Asia-Pacific region. It is also worth noting, however, as is quite clearly written in the numerous works following his retirement, that he also believed that, for a nation with such a small population and with what he would have described as a fairly fragile historical and sociological grip on its sense of history, there were very real risks in being drawn into an environment where the strength of other cultures could easily swamp the nevertheless growing, and hopefully one day strong, unique Australian cultural tradition. In that context, Sir Paul Hasluck was also the first foreign Minister who insisted on a degree of professionalism within the Department of External Affairs, specifically with regard to the need to build up a coterie of officers who truly understood South-East Asia in depth. 1 was one of the guinea pigs in that exercise. 1 was sent off to South Asia and to the university to learn Asian languages, culture and religion. On one occasion, I recall that Sir Paul Hasluck came to Ceylan to be the chairman of a meeting of Heads of Mission. They came from Pakistan, India, Ceylon-or Sri Lanka, as it is now called-and Burma. 1 was only a very junior officer who was there just to take the notes. I can assure honourable members that if there was one person who set down the parameters of government policy to those ambassadors it was Paul Hasluck. On the final night we had a dinner. Sir Paul had invited all the cabinet of Sri Lanka from the Prime Minister down. In a terrible moment for me the Minister for Health said to Paul Hasluck, 'I hope you know that your third secretary is qutte fluent in our language'. At that stage, I wanted to slip out the door. Paul Hasluck looked down the table and said, while 'Connolly, when we finish dinner, you will get up and give us a speech in Singhala'. 1 spent the next half an hour without eating anything, having an absolute panic as to what 1 was going to say. Having decided what I wanted to say, Sir Paul then stood up at the end of dinner and said, 'You are now going to give us a dissertation for at least 10 minutes on Australia's foreign aid policy to Ceylon', which was not the subject that I had been trying to get on top of for the last 30 minutes. That incident demonstrated his determination to ensure that Australia was seen to be professionally active, supportive and capable of demonstrating a uniquely Australian presence in the Asia-Pacific region. He played a key role in setting the foundation stones of a tradition which has been built upon since then by various governments, and certainly various Ministers for foreign affairs. As a great Australian, he undoubtedly played a key role in building up Australia's status in the Asia Pacific region.

78,Mr KEATING,Unknown," I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 10 February 1993, of Professor Fred Hollows AC, places on records its ation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. . Professor Fred Hollows's enormous contribution to Australia and the world in the field of ophthalmology will be long remembered, and it is only fitting that we honour him today through this condolence motion. He joins those few other special Australians who have been similarly honoured in this House. Fred Hollows was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 9 April 1929. In his early years he thought he might become a minister of religion or perhaps a psychologist. It was not until he was offered a place at the University of Otago to study medicine, at the age of 22, that he first thought seriously about a medical career. He became interested in eye surgery and, having completed his medical degree in 1961, he travelled to Britain for postgraduate study in ophthalmology. He spent some time working in Wales before coming out to Australia in 1965 to head the ophthalmology department of the University of New South Wales. With his urging, it was not long before there was a separate eye clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital. By this stage Fred Hollows had adopted Australia as his home and his work with Aboriginal people, for which he was to become so well known, had begun. First there was the establishment of the Aboriginal Medical Centre at Redfern in 1971. This centre became a model for many such establishments a(ound Australia. Then followed the national trachoma and eye health program, under the auspices of which Professor Hollows and his team travelled the length and breadth of the country, treating sight impaired Aborigines. In two years 105,000 people in 465 locations were examined-which is a pretty amazing figure. Fifteen thousand Aboriginal people took part in treatment programs, which is again an amazing figure, and one thousand AC operations were performed. It was, I understand, one of the world's most extensive public health studies and is used as a benchmark in the public health care area. Later he extended his program internationally and appreciestablished clinics in Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, Vietnam and Eritrea. His aim was not merely to train local doctors in eye surgical techniques but to build factories to make the intra-ocular lenses required for effective treatment. This fellow never did anything by half-measures. Professor Hollows saw this as the only way of ensuring that Third World blindness would be adequately combated; he was not simply relying upon other members of the medical profession to learn the techniques but he actually set up the mechanism whereby these lenses would be produced. His dream of establishing these facilities and dealing with Third World blindness is now well on its way to being realised, with lens factories soon to be in operation in Vietnam, Nepal and Eritrea. Fred Hollows had many honours and awards bestowed on him over the years: Australian of the Year, Australian Humanist of the Year, the Australian Human Rights Medal, Companion of the Order of Australia, and several honorary degrees. A Nobel Peace Prize nomination is in preparation. But personal recognition mattered little to him. He was very much more concerned with getting the job done, with creating change and making people take notice of what was happening, both in their own backyards and the world at large. As one newspaper said in its obituary: In many ways Professor Hollows was the conscience of Australia: challenging people by his example to lead more selfless and dynamic lives; confronting us all with some of the uncomfortable truths about ourselves and our behaviour. Fred Hollows was a passionate man with deeply held convictions. Those who knew him or got near him would soon find themselves being told exactly what he thought about things and what he thought they should think about things. I think it was the strength of his commitment and passion which was so attractive to so many people. To his patients he was unfailingly generous and compassionate, but he was also forthright and his methods often unorthodox in order to achieve what he wanted. As he said in his autobiography: If it helps real living people, then I am not going to worry about professional decorum, good taste or anything else. On many occasions he could never have been accused of good taste, but he certainly got the job done. My colleague the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) showed me a. book in which Fred Hollows said, 'I am not exactly the smooth doctor type'. That was definitely right. There was not much smooth about him, but there was a lot strong about him. Bureaucrats, colleagues and, of course, politicians were all fair game in this process. When he wanted something done, he mostly went and did it, and anyone who got in his way discovered what a powerhouse he was. In his own words: . . . having a care and concern for others is the highest of the human qualities. It distinguishes us from the animals and deserves to be paid more attention and to be more exercised. I think this is probably the creed by which he lived. Anyone who is familiar with his career will know of the time he spent away from hospitals, the comfort of the urban environment and his home in outback Australia. He worked unselfishly amidst poverty in other countries often and for long periods. There is no doubt that he gave credence to the words I have just quoted him as uttering. It was this care and concern for his fellow man that drove him all his life, as a result of which many thousands of people are now able to see and many more thousands are given a chance own to see. I could not imagine a greater reward than taking someone who was blind and restoring his sight, and to have done it for many thousands is pretty unusual. He was loved by his family and friends and held in the highest esteem by his colleagues both here and overseas. It is a sad loss to us all. One wonders how the spark of such a dynamic life can be snuffed out, but this is the terrible tragedy of cancer today. As a result, this huge, dynamic force is no longer with us, but we remember him. I am sure that the good work he began will be continued in the same spirit and with the same dedication through the Fred Hollows Foundation, which is, of course, pursuing the objectives which he had during his life, particularly in setting up intra-ocular lens factories around the world and giving communities in various countries which are beset by these diseases of the eye the chance of restoring the sight of many thousands of people. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his wife Gabi and her family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",63
79,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"With the death of Fred Hollows, Australia and the world lost a man of rare competence, great compassion and genuine humility. But through the life of Fred Hollows we all directly or indirectly gained a greater insight into what humanity is truly all about. Fred Hollows was many things to many people. To the hundreds of thousands of Aboriginal men, women and children he helped with the eye disease trachoma, Fred Hollows was a saviour; he gave them back their sight. As one man was moved to say at Fred's burial site: Thanks to Fred, people could now see the beauty of the world. To thousands of Eritrians suffering horrible eye diseases and wounds as a result of the war with Ethiopia, Fred Hollows, a man of peace, waged a personal war against blindness and won many battles. The intra-ocular lens factories he began to build in Africa to combat blindness will stand as towering monuments to Fred's ability to help people beat the odds. To a nation of people here in Australia, Fred Hollows was a real hero who was truly loved and, if he was not loved, he was always respected and admired. He was not only loved for his brilliant work; he was loved for who he was-a genial larrikin, a controversial but humble man, a man who did not suffer fools gladly and who called it how he saw it. Above all else he was a family man and a decent bloke by the best Australian standards by which that is measured. He was a man who devoted his life to helping others and, through that, challenged us all to reassess our own views of the world. As Jack Waterford wrote in the Canberra 1imes at the time of his death: By example or insult, Fred Hollows changed a lot of people. At some stage or another most of us here have been kicked up the backside by Fred. He never did it to hurt us; rather, he did it to us help others. He rarely accepted no for an answer but he often said no to bureaucratic red tape, the political and economic jargon and excuses that were offered up.to the so called insurmountable problems, particularly in the public health arena. Fred Hollows had a genuine lust for life. Even when he was stricken with cancer he wanted to instil that lust into everyone he came in contact with. He rightly believed that enriching people's lives was possibly the greatest single contribution anyone could make. These were some of the qualities that set Fred Hollows apart from the rest of us. He was an exceptionally special human being. It is often said that a measure of a man's greatness in life is the extent to which he influenced and touched different ends of the spectrum, be it political, social or whatever. 1 attended the memorial service at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney where, on any measure, the full spectrum of Australian society was represented. It reaffirmed to me how great a man Fred Hollows was. At the service Bishop Heaps said: Yes, Fred Hollows was intolerant, but we can say that about Jesus. Yes, intolerant about racism, destructive nationalism, hypocrisy, fundamentalist, oppressive religion and many other lies that destroy joyful life and human freedom. The spirit of Fred Hollows would lift up the downtrodden and set captives free. We can honour him by living in that spirit. We all have our own personal reflections on our experiences with Fred Hollows. 1 remember the first time 1 met him. 1 happened to be in Hobart at the same time as he was there. He had been a guest speaker, 1 think at an insurance convention or something like that. He used to take every opportunity to get his point of view across. 1 saw him at the cocktail party they were having in the foyer of the Sheraton Hotel in Hobart and 1 went across and introduced myself to him. 'I have been wanting to meet you', he said. Immediately he . took control and dominated the conversation. He ignored his hosts for quite some time. There are a number of things that 1 remember about that particular meeting; it was characteristic of Sf) many other meetings with Fred help Hollows. 1 remember the intensity and directness of his cross-examination. He really went after you when he wanted to make a point or find out where you stood. I was ilJlpressed by the sense of urgency in his actions and in his voice. At that stage he did not have a lot of time. He was not going to waste a second and he was not going to let anyone else waste a second. That lust for life that I mentioned just oozed out. It was genuinely hard to avoid getting caught up in that particular lust for life. It is also appropriate that we honour Fred Hollows in the International Year of the Indigenous People as well as in our ongoing process of reconciliation with the Aboriginal community. No one man could have done more to help Aboriginal people improve their health standards and overall well-being than Fred Hollows. No one man, through his words and actions, could have demonstrated to the rest of us the importance of ensuring that the process of reconciliation, if it is to work, involve all Australians, because we all have a role to play. We must make this process of reconciliation work so that we can see real improvements, not only in the awareness and understanding of Aboriginal culture throughout the wider community, but also in their standards of health, education, literacy, housing and employment opportunities. There has been a lot of talk lately about establishing our independence in the world. While that debate is worthy and will run its course, I would hope that we do not lose sight of another great goal that all of us in this place should be working towards-giving the Aboriginal people the chances and opportunities to achieve genuine economic independence free from the shackles of welfare and paternalism. We owe that to ourselves; we owe that to our indigenous people; and we most certainly owe that to Fred Hollows. To his wife, Gabi, his seven children and family, I offer, on behalf of the coalition, my deepest sympathies and prayers.",65
80,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"It is with great sadness that I rise to speak on this condolence motion for Professor Fred Hollows, Companion of the Order of Australia and humanitarian extraordinaire: a person who was named Australia's outstanding achiever in 1990; a person who received the Human Rights Medal and was awarded the Australian's Australian of the Year Award in the same year; and a person whose energy, skill, enthusiasm and drive, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have correctly spoken about, led to massive relief of suffering around so much of the world-including Eritrea, Bunna and Nepal-particularly amongst people who were in severely disadvantaged circumstances. Like most Australians, I have read much about Fred Hollows and, like most Australians, I have been absolutely inspired by his life. I met Fred Hollows only once, in the company of Mr Tim MCCartney-Snape, previously of Meekatharra, now of Bowraland formerly of the top of Mount Everest, twice. I thought there was a lot of similarity must between Tim MCCartney-Snape and Fred Hollows in their vigour, their vitality, their determination, their dedication and their effort to make a point, move on and be mindful of time. The occasion on which I met Fred Hollows was a fundraising one for the eye health program in the Himalayas for the people of Nepal. On meeting Fred Hollows I was immediately struck by his fierce determination, his no-time-wasting approach and manner, and his absolute desire to be helpful to so many others who are suffering so much. There is another aspect of Jack Waterford's writings which I think I should place on the record of the House on the occasion of this condolence motion for Fred Hollows. He said this about each person who attended, the funeral: . .. believed that they had a special personal relationship with Fred. There was a message. Fred changed lives and mostly for the better. Obviously that speaks volumes for the charisma, energy and the magnetic personality of Fred Hollows. Previous speakers have spoken in detail about his work with the Aboriginals-and I salute that work-his work overseas and his work everywhere to make life better for so many people. He is also well known for his strong views on a wide variety of controversial issues; these were built on his knowledge of medicine and his work as a doctor in many fields. His establishment of the national trachoma program resulted in the treatment of over 100 000 Aboriginals in the first two years of ope;ation and set new benchmarks in this country with regard to rural community medicine. Later this winter I hope to visit the Alcoota Aboriginal property in the Northern Territory to see first - hand some of the work that has carried on from what began with the original· Fred Hollows program. Fred Hollows's other magnificent achievement was his efforts in Eritrea. I guess this year of Fred Hollows's death it is worth more than passing comment that Eritrea will formally become a separate nation after the huge battles in the Ethiopian civil war. It must be remembered that during this time in Eritrea his cancer had been diagnosed. As Tom Keneally points out, even for the healthy travelling into Eritrea to do eye surgery was a hard journey full of delays and frustrations, and it must have involved personal hardship and agony of extraordinary proportion for Fred Hollows. In short, Fred Hollows was an absolutely fearless man. No doubt there would be a whole raft of issues on which I would not agree with what Fred Hollows believed; however, he was totally fearless in poking holes at society's conventional wisdom. I well remember the outrage which was heaped on Fred Hollows when he made some comments of absolute common sense regarding aspects of the dreadful AIDS epidemic. He said that it is a simple truism that AIDS is predominantly a problem resulting from homosexual sex and that promoting safe sex is a blunt weapon compared with a more specific program aimed at the sexual practices which are highly likely to result in AIDS. This brought upon Fred Hollows an avalanche of criticism. His views were not part of the trendy conventional wisdom and politically correct attitude which tends to dominate, and therefore there was a well engineered and quite hysterical campaign to deny those undeniable aspects of Fred Hollows's comments. I do not agree with all that Fred said, but must say that Fred Hollows spoke out without fear, with selflessness, as an enigmatic humanitarian whose life shone above the average, above the conventional and above the staid. He had a benchmark against which we can all measure our own failures, our own selfishness and our own narrowness. I extend sympathy to his wife Gabrielle and to the Hollows family. He was an outstanding Australian. This nation will be the poorer for his passing.",66
81,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Batman-Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services)-I want to join with the other that in speakers in offering my condolences to Gabrielle and her family on the death of Fred Hollows and in the expressions of appreciation that other members have made for the contribution that Fred Hollows has made in his field of ophthalmology in particular and for the great contribution he has made to Aboriginal communities. I met Fred Hollows on two or three occasions. I especially remember the occasion on which he and I travelled to Alice Springs-I think it was in April of last year-when he gave an address which became very controversial. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has just referred to some of the comments that Fred Hollows made at that time. I recall him knocking out his pipe before he left the airport lounge, proceeding to the aircraft, ordering himself a bottle of his favourite liquid and launching into a conversation that lasted for something like four hours. The conversation literally covered the world but particularly focused on the passions that had driven Fred Hollows's life for so many years. As .we passed over one area, Fred looked out of the window of the plane-I could not see too much myself-and identified an extremely remote Aboriginal community that he had visited. He explained to me how many eyes he had had to do in that particular town, but he also went on to talk about the town's social structure and the way in which he felt that that community could make progress. I remember him going on for some time about what more could be done in the Alice Springs I region. He suggested that I should be getting on the phone to the Army and setting up a field hospital-he did not have a great deal of faith in the hospital at Alice Springs being able to do the work on the scale that he thought was needed-with an operating theatre where he would be able to do so many eyes. He thought it was all possible, providmg we could get the red tape and the bureaucracy out of the way in order to tackle the problem and reach the important end, which was to ensure that people who had partial sight had their sight restored. In one sense, he was an engineer-someone who had all of the precision and the capacity not only to design his instruments but also to be a brilliant surgeon. He operated on so many fronts: in the most remote parts of Australia, which are remote by any country's standard, in Eritrea and in so many other countries. He was a person who had achieved so much and who was driven by his sense of the future. The project that his wife, together with his foundation, now carries on in Vietnam is simply built upon his earlier work. We had in Fred Hollows a very special person. He could be vicious, brutal and tough, but at the same time he had amazing compassion. Full of contradictions, he was nevertheless someone who had a sense of missionary purpose. For someone who described himself as a humanist, he seemed to be driven by an almost religious passion to achieve a better world. In the biography of Fred Hollows by Peter Corris, Fred told the author: I am a humanist; I don't believe in any higher power than the best expressions of the human spirit, and those are to be found in personal and social relationships. Evaluating my life in those terms, I've had some mixed results. I've hurt some people and disappointed others, but I hope that, balance, I've given more than I've taken. I that my view of what a redeemed social condition is has been consistent-equity between peopleand I've always tried to work to that end. Fred came initially from Dunedin. His father was an engine driver, and no doubt in his background there was a mixture of the religious traditions associated with the Church of Christ and a kind of Christian socialism that had been present in Britain in the latter part of the 19th century, which no doubt translated to a place like Dunedin in the southern part of New Zealand. Whatever drove him, it helped to change this country and to put in place a tradition that will be honoured by the Fred Hollows Foundation. It will touch every Australian in the future because, in helping to build this country, they will know that in Fred Hollows, his life and his contribution there was a very important building block.",67
82,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"I did not know Fred Hollows, but by a quirk of fate-that is, by retirement, both voluntary and involuntary-I seem to be the only medico left in this House; so I would like to pay tribute to a professional colleague in Fred Hollows. We have had two condolence motions tonight: to Sir Paul Hasluck and to Mr Fred Hollows. One of the men to whom the motions have been directed was precise, urbane, cogent and modest to the point of selfeffacement while the other was blunt, rambunctious, an ardent practitioner of the colloquial and controversial; but both men shared an overriding sense of compassion and both were imbued with a driving force to use their professional skills to the betterment of the disadvantaged-in particular, Aboriginal Australians disadvantaged in our society. Neither confined his talents to our national border. Both were highly regarded as ambassadors for this country, each in his own field of expertise. I would like to talk briefly about Professor Hollows's medical and scientific career. He was a kiwi. He was trained at the University of Otago in Dunedin. Even today, the University of Otago maintains a reputation as poson sibly the finest ophthalmological school in believe Australia and New Zealand. At the time Professor Hollows graduated it was not possible to obtain a fellowship in Australia. It was not until 1969 that one could train as a specialist ophthalmologist in Australia; so Fred, along with a lot of other Australians and New Zealanders, had to go to London to do his fellowship. As part of his post-fellowship study, he took part in an epidemiological study in 1960 in Wales into the prevalence of glaucoma in the community. This remains, 30 years later, a benchmark study on the prevalence of one particular disease in a whole community. It started people talking about glaucoma and it set in train a forward planning of resources to treat glaucoma that is relevant today. After he finished his fellowship in England, Fred Hollows was actually offered a chair in ophthalmology in Kenya. I imagine he must have sought this-it it is unlikely to have been offered without being sought-but in the end he was unable to accept it because of the potential political unrest at the time. He came to New South Wales and took up a position at the Prince of Wales Hospital. He initially threw himself into the investigation of diabetic retinopathy; that is, the disease that affects the retina, the back of the eye; thing that actually sees, which can affect people with diabetes. Thirty years ago it was the major cause of blindness in people aged 20 to 50. It is still a very major cause of blindness in this country.· Fred and his team at the Prince of Wales Hospital very quickly became experts in the treatment of this disease. They were among the first people in the world to use laser therapy to treat diabetic retinopathy and Fred Hollows became a world recognised expert in the treatment of the disease. In the early 1970s his life was to change, and he became a founding member of the Redfern Aboriginal Medical Service. It is a curious fact that this was the second great Aboriginal controlled organisation in the country, the legal service having predated it. As a member of the medical profession, always wondering which was the oldest profession in society, I thought for a long time ours was the second oldest, but after the lawyers I am now sure we are the third. In the mid to late 1970s the Prince of Wales Hospital, largely under Fred's guidance, began outreach work and moved into western New South Wales, particularly the area around Bourke, and this began a long association with that area. They travelled every three months to provide basic eye care to the community-not just the Aboriginal community, but the whole community, both black and white. As a result, 105,000 people were examined in 465 different places. There were 1,000 operations and 15,000 Aboriginal people were looked after. Fred's dissatisfaction with the standard of medical care availstill able to anybody at that time led him to try and convert his professional organisation, the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists, to taking some pro-active stance on the issue of trachoma. Fred was not alone in this, although he is the person it is identified with. There were many others who were involved, one of whom is a former member of this Parliament, Peter Baume, who at the time was a junior opposition backbencher. He was instrumental in persuading the college to get private medical practitioners to make a real committhe ment to public health-and they did. That was the trachoma program. Trachoma is a very old disease; it may have even predated European settlement. It might have been brought in by Macassans or Malaysians. It was known to the pioneers of Australia as sandy blight. It was something that affected people wherever there were poor living conditions. If one looks .at the colonial history of Australia, one sees that sandy blight was a particular problem to colonial Australians, but it died out by the early twentieth century. It was only when people started to look at it again in the 1950s and 1960s that they found that in some parts of central Australia 90 per cent of Aboriginal people over 15 years of age were affected by a preventable infectious disease that would cause them to go blind in one or both eyes. This pricked Fred's sense of outrage, and the national trachoma program followed from that. Fred became a leading authority on the assessment and treatment of Third World eye diseases. I guess it is not surprising that it followed from that that his work moved on into similar Third World countries. It is something that all of us should reflect on here tonight. We are talking about a person becoming an expert on Third World diseases in Australia, but one could still do it today. His work in Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma and Latin America followed that. Recently I spoke to one of Fred's long-time professional colleagues, Ivan Goldberg, and asked him if he could tell me just a few anecdotes about Fred that were not generally known, that would tell me about the man. I will recount a few of them because I think they tell us a lot about Fred. He was actually a great sportsman and he loved a whole variety of sports. He was known for the fact that when he went to England he talked for a long time about what a great mountaineer he was and, as he came from New Zealand, everyone thought that this had to be true. For many years in London they talked about Fred's first expedition where he took a whole team away from the hospital. Fred insisted on detailed lists of supplies. They carried far more than they needed. The group was forced to trek with a very large burden-hammocks, primus stoves, everything that one could want. When they finally set up their camp for the night, and up their stoves and it became time for tea, Fred's one contribution had to be the tea bag; and after having forced everybody to carry all this stuff the whole way, it turned out that Fred had forgotten the tea. He also took up golf in the early 1970s with absolutely great gusto. For six months he could not be found around the hospital. At every spare moment he was on the golf course practising until, apparently, he could not get his handicap down, promptly declared golf a bourgeois sport and never again took up the game. Fred had the reputation of being a very hard taskmaster. I was told about a registrar-he is now a very senior ophthalmologist in this country, so his name will not be mentioned; I will call him Dr Peters-who, as a young doctor, was reticent and hesitant, although Fred recognised him as being very bright. So Fred decided to whip him into shape; he gave him a very hard time and kept on his back to try to force the best out of him. One day at the Prince of Wales Hospital, in front of around 150 patients, this registrar had the misfortune of missing a very minor part of an examination, and in front of the whole outpatients clinic Fred abused this guy for missing something quite minor. He said he was an absolute imbecile; blind; had no facility with his hands, they did not work at all; and he should not be a doctor. Fred then turned around to the lady behind him and said, - And by the way, Mrs Smith, this is Dr Peters who is operating on you tomorrow'. In his last days Fred said to his long timefriend Frank Hardy that all he wanted from him was socialist solidarity. I am not able to offer him socialist solidarity, but I can offer him the respect of a colleague and the respect of a member of this House. I would like to pay a very special tribute to his wife Gabi Hollows whom I have not met, but I have to say that in the days after Fred's death I was moved by her strength and her dignity, and the manner in which she conducted herself in such a terribly difficult time. The Leader of the National Party of Ausset tralia (Mr Tim Fischer) alluded very briefly to some comments that Fred Hollows made on HIV and Aboriginal people. If we in this House really wanted to do something to commemorate Fred Hollows, perhaps, 10 years after the appearance of the HIV epidemic, we could actually take heed of some of the things he said. In his usual style he went a bit over the top, but the fact is that 10 years after the appearance of the epidemic we still do not have a nationally coordinated HIV program to prevent the spread of that virus in Aboriginal communities. Perhaps, if we wanted to do something to match some of the work of this man, we might set ourselves that task.",68
83,Mr TICKNER,Unknown,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs)-I wish to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others in speaking to this condolence motion. It should be said to begin with that, while Fred Hollows was in every respect a citizen of the world, his foremost contribution, in my view, was to the advancement of the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country and it is to that subject. I would like to lend some remarks tonight. The way that Fred Hollows came to be a supporter of the Aboriginal cause is itself an interesting story. Around 1967 the Gurindji people walked off the Wave Hill cattle station in an attempt, firstly, to draw attention to their right to award wages-they had been living in quite appalling conditions-but the campaign quickly grew into one of the first public struggles by Aboriginal people in this country for their land. Fred Hollows, who had had no previous experience with Aboriginal people, went along to a meeting at the teachers federation building in Sydney. A bucket was passed around in the course of the evening and Fred Hollows donated in the order of what would now be $300 or more to the cause. When the organisers of the public meeting went through the bucket and found this cheque, they were somewhat nonplused. Those of us who have been battling on the side of good causes would know that donations of that magnitude are somewhat unusual and are to be warmly welcomed and endorsed. Soon after that, some of the organisers of the meeting sought out this person who had written the cheque, and of course it was Fred Hollows. Again, soon after that, he went to Wave Hill with some of the organisers of that protest meeting, including Frank Hardy. A wonderful song has since been written about the Gurindji's struggle for land rights. It is by a singer named Paul Kelly and it says that from little things big things grow. In it was because of that meeting in Sydney that Fred Hollows became involved in the Aboriginal people's struggle for their rights. The Prime Minister has recorded how, from that small beginning, the trachoma program became an extraordinary organisational effort in logistics and in commitment by doctors in addressing the conditions in which Aboriginal people lived and in treating their eye disease. The statistics are quite extraordinary. Between 1976 and 1979 the program travelled hundreds of thousands of kilometres, visiting more than 500 rural Aboriginal communities and also treating Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. It examined, in total, 110,000 people or more; up to 800 different types of pathology were recorded and 18,000 pairs of spectacles were prescribed. Thirty thousand Aboriginal people were treated in the mass treatment trachoma programs. I think some things should be said quite strongly tonight which I am sure Fred Hollows would want recorded. One is that I am sure he would not want to be thought of as some do-gooder doctor. He would not want anyone to leave this chamber tonight thinking that the solution to Aboriginal health and medical problems, or any other issue confronting indigenous people in this country, lies in the hands of non-Aboriginal Australians. If there was one thing that Fred Hollows believed in it was that the solutions to problems experienced in Aboriginal communities would not come from well-intentioned politicians or doctors, but only from Aboriginal people themselves being in control of their own community organisations and shaping programs that would address those problems. He greatly championed that cause all the time he worked with Aboriginal people. Another important thing that should be said is that we ought not to leave here tonight with some starry-eyed view of Fred Hollows as a saint and a great diplomat in the way he conducted his affairs. I am sure he would be the first to agree that he· was none of those things. In fact, in many respects he was a wildly passionate man; someone with an irrepressible character who was likely to manifest that irrepressible character in the fact, most extraordinary ways-not the least of which was the means by which he acquired a large part of the infrastructure for the trachoma program. Honourable members will see from his autobiography that one way he acquired the material for the program was simply by taking it, because he regarded the higher cause of giving sight to people who would otherwise remain blind as the dominant principle. One other extraordinary exploit is referred to in his autobiography, and since it happened in my electorate I ought to refer to it briefly. During the time when the Gurindji campaign was gaining momentum there was a considerable degree of surveillance, believe it or not, by ASIO. Fred Hollows became aware of this surveillance and he became very angry. He decided to lash out against what he saw as this system which was stacked against those who were trying to struggle for the most basic human rights for indigenous people in this country. So he went to the Royal National Park at Sutherland where, at the entrance, there were some very big commercial billboards. He admits in his autobiography that his action was quite irrational, but it was his reaction to the treatment that he felt he was getting from ASIO and the government of the day. In the company of others he performed an almighty demolition job of the big commercial advertising hoardings at the entrance to the Royal National Park. Fred, the saint, also had another incredible side to him, which I think we ought to remember tonight. I would like to pay tribute to him for the way he helped me, and I think helped this Parliament, during the time he was Australian of the Year. As people have repeatedly said, he was deeply committed to improving the living conditions of Aboriginal people in communities. We can build hospitals 10 miles high, but if people are living in conditions that are the root cause of ill health we are not really getting to the source of the problem. When he was Australian of the Year-how should I say this without incriminating myself?-he cooperated in a very helpful way in raising public attention about Aboriginal health conditions. He was very persuasive in convincing the Government and the Opposition of the need to support that strategy and the need to address those living conditions. This can only be done by improving housing, water and sewage disposal methods-those gutsy everyday things that Fred Hollows always spoke so passionately about. He was a very controversial character. I do not think there was such a thing as a sacred cow for Fred Hollows. If he wanted to take on a vested interest, no matter how much it might have been regarded highly by others, and he saw it as a subject that needed to be addressed, then he would take it on. I think many of us in this House have felt the barb of his tongue as he sought to get a point across. Above all else, I believe he was a great lover of life and a great lover of people. I am normally opposed to condolence motions being used to make political points, but since this political point is levelled at the Opposition, not the Government, but all of us I think I am on fairly safe ground in making it. I thought to myself tonight, 'What would Fred Hollows think if he was sitting here now?'. I could probably make Australian parliamentary history by using Fred Hollows's language to tell honourable members what he would say but it would be unprintable, and since my seat is still relatively marginal and I am not confident about how it would be received in the wider community I will not do it. He would basically say, 'There is a lot of talk and a lot of things being said, but if there is one thing that people ought to be about it is to do practical, positive things to get change and to address the issues that are important to indigenous people'. We can talk about health, we can talk about housing and we can talk about employment, but we should not leave here tonight without talking about land. Do not forget that Fred Hollows's initial contact with the Aboriginal cause came about as a result of his attendance at that historic meeting in Sydney where the Gurindji people came to campaign for their rights to land. The Mabo decision is very much on the public policy agenda of the Government and the nation as a whole. If there is one thing that I hope people will take as a lesson from Fred Hollows to apply over the weeks and months ahead, it is that we have to have the courage to stand up for principles and to maintain the commitment to Aboriginal people to bring about the changes that are necessary. While there have been great advances for some Aboriginal people since the Gurindji struggle of the 1960s, it is a fact that the great majority of Aboriginal people are still not properly accorded respect and their rights to land. I hope the House will understand that I feel it is appropriate to make that point tonight. Fred Hollows, above all else, was the living manifestation of a goal that we all ought to at least try to achieve in our lives and that is to leave this place in a better condition than we found it.",70
84,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I am anxious not to be associated with this condolence motion tonight because I knew Fred Hollows. I had the opportunity of meeting with him on many occasions both early in my parliamentary career and in the period shortly before he died. . I want to take the opportunity-because I did chair the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs between 1976 and 1983-to recount something of the influence that Fred Hollows had in relation to the determination of Aboriginal policy in so far as the Parliament is concerned, and I think the very important role in sensitising members of parliament to issues affecting Aboriginal people. A great deal has already been said by those who have spoken, so I will not recapitulate at any length other than to say that when I became chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in early 1976, some of those great living legends of the Australian Parliament who were vitally interested in Aboriginal people, played a significant role over a long time. These great living legends-the Hon. W.C. Wentworth, the Hon. Kim Beazley, senior, the Hon. Gordon Bryant, and the Hon. Les Johnson-were all members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. They commented on matters in this area that might affect the future of Aboriginals in Australia. The impact that alcohol was having on Aboriginal communities was one matter that was very much on the mind of Bill Wentworth and Gordon Bryant. They persuaded Ian Viner that the first report that the Aborigitor. nal Affairs committee should initiate should be on alcohol problems of Aborigines. It was only later in time that I became aware that this was of great disappointment to Fred Hollows, somebody at that stage whom I did not know. It was towards the end of that year that the committee was given another reference which was engineered by Kim Beazley, senior, and I think he was assisted in that by the then Minister for Health, the Hon. Ralph Hunt. The House of· Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs received a reference to inquire into the health conditions of Aboriginal people generally; that is, the prevalence of different types of diseases suffered by Aboriginals in Aboriginal communities, the relationship between health and environmental factors, between social and cultural factors, the effectiveness of existing health care programs, and alternative methods of health care delivery. I believe this was a reference that the committee received because Fred Hollows was of the view that we had it dreadfully wrong, and that we could only look at the particular symptom of alcohol abuse in the context of the wider circumstances that were impacting upon Aboriginal people. If we look at the report of the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists and at the national trachoma· and eye health program, that becomeS clear. The history of Fred Hollows and the findings of his early trips to Wattie Creek in 1972, and of the visits to Burke in westem New South Wales-Enngonia in particularwere part and parcel of the cataloguing of the circumstances of which Fred Hollows became aware and wanted to bring to the attention of so many more. The Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists had engaged the assistance of the Lions Club movement and was challenged, as the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Wooldridge) mentioned, by former Senator Peter Baume to seek out private doctors to demonstrate their commitment to public health by action rather than words. This was a matter that the royal college took on, and Fred Hollows became very much the instigaThe report of the national trachoma and eye health program records that by early 1975 a plan had been prepared for the project to begin in 1976. The survey team was to be led by Professor Hollows, and screening was to be undertaken. The report later emphasises the involvement of Ralph Hunt, as the new Minister for Health in the Fraser Government, in bringing to fruition that program that was initiated and prepared in the twilight of the then Labor administration. Fred Hollows was a man for causes in many ways. I noticed that in many of the news reports he was described as a larrikin. He was certainly a person who made sure that everybody was very much aware of his views. In my role as Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I certainly became aware of that and the impact of Fred Hollows can be seen in the recommendations of the committee. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) mentioned the importance of Aboriginal self determination and the relevance of land to so many of the matters that impact upon the health profile of the Aboriginal community. All of these matters were highlighted in those reports at that time in a very positive and supportive way. In 1971 Fred Hollows was involved in the anti-apartheid demonstrations. His ambit was much wider. He was involved, as was mentioned, in the formation of the Aboriginal medical services. Although he was obviously a man, by conviction, from the left, he came in touch with people of all political persuasions and sought to bring all of them on board in relation to the issues that he saw as being of fundamental importance. In an article in the Canberra Times, Jack Waterford said that Fred Hollows respected and got along with Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, and Ralph Hunt, and saw their support through some important crises as being of the utmost importance to him. Most recently, I saw him when he was the principal guest speaker at the national goals and directions conference in Sydney in 1992, after he had become aware of his tragic illness. He was a person of tremendous energy and drive, and that was still with him in the twilight of his career. As one who has taken an interest in Vietnam and Eritrea, I was greatly heartened by his involvement and his efforts to restore the eye health of people in both of those tragic countries where services have been denied to people for so long. He was a great inspiration to his family. At his funeral I had the opportunity to speak to his wife, Gabi. I am glad have had the opportunity today to associate myself with this condolence motion and to commend Fred Hollows to this House.",72
85,Mr BOLDING,Unknown,"I rise to join in this condolence motion. I first met Fred Hollows when I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, which was chaired by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). As Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I subsequently had constant contact with him-on occasions to receive his views and on many occasions to seek his advice. Whatever advice one got from Fred Hollows, it was essentially blunt, decisive, totally free of cant and often abrasive, but always directed to meet the benefit of those who needed his skill and medical devotion. The commitment of Fred Hollows to Aboriginal people has already been mentioned by my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). But it was more than just a devotion. Not only did he tend their medical needs but he was one of the early Australians of our generation who recognised the depth of Aboriginal culture, their relationship with the land, the deprivation of that faith and its effect upon their mental and physical health. Fred Hollows devoted himself to doing what he did best in the field of treating eye diseases. There he made a great contribution. But it should not be forgotten that on one occasion during that early period when Fred Hollows was working in the back blocks of Australia his work and that of his team was cut short by the political intervention of the then Bjelke-Petersen Government which felt that much of his work was directed at politicising Aboriginal communities. That was a political mistake which ought to be placed on the record. At that time not too many were voices raised in the parliaments of Australia for and on behalf of Fred Hollows. I was able to observe at first hand his relationship with Aboriginal people. On one occasion I was present with him when seeking to solve problems raised by an Aboriginal medical group. I felt that the group's particUto lar approach and response to the problem were starting to be somewhat bureaucratic. While I was thinking of a polite way of indicating that perhaps there were other approaches, Fred proceeded-as only Fred could-with terminology which all of those present certainly understood and which would have been used around camp fires on many occasions, to tell his Aboriginal colleagues what he thought of their approach. What I found interesting was the way in which those very blunt and abrasive views were accepted. They were accepted for one reason: there was no doubt in any of their minds that this was a man who saw them as equals. There was no talking down to them-he was talking to them as he would to any group of fellow Australians. On this occasion we are remembering the great contribution that Fred Hollows has made not just to Aboriginal people but to other indigenous people around the world. The buzz word used in political circles these days, when dealing with black-white relations in Australia, is reconciliation. If there is one who lived the concept of reconciliation, it was Fred Hollows. He did not begin, as so many people in Australia do, with the view that Aboriginal people's problems-their medical and other problems-would be solved if only they would reconcile and be like us. The fact is that Aboriginal people have been trying to reconcile to a white-dominant society for over 200 years. Fred Hollows recognised that if there was ever to be reconciliation it would have to be on the basis of us understanding the depth and the nature of Aboriginal society and the contribution that Aboriginals were capable of making to a developing nation like Australia. By servicing them with all his medical skills and devotion he was not merely making for a better Australia, but making for a better understanding of one of the great problems that confront this Parliament. The best way for us to fully remember Fred Hollows and his contribution would be for this Parliament to apply his living example and spirit to the forthcoming debates which this nation will have to face in respect of dealing with how we, as an Australian community, accept the values, religious traditions and spirit of the Aboriginal people. We will be indeed fortunate as a nation if we can build on their great concept of this large, imposing and sometimes terrifying land that we have a great responsibility towards.",74
86,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"I have been in this place for 13 years and I cannot recall an occasion in the past when I have spoken on a condolence motion. It may therefore appear unusual that I choose to speak on a condolence motion about a person whom I did not have the privilege of knowing. I do so because, by any measure, Fred Hollows was a remarkable person. Like you all, I knew well of Fred Hollows. My respect for, and my understanding of, Fred Hollows was enhanced considerably by what his great mate-and a friend of mine-Frank Hardy told me. Back in 1965, Frank Hardy was very largely the catalyst in the involvement of Fred Hollows in the Gurindji case at Wattie Hill. When Fred Hollows visited that site, a community of 150 people, he was devastated to man discover that every child suffered from trachoma which is a preventable Third World disease. Some have said that Fred Hollows was not a great man; he was an ordinary man who did great things. Others have said that he was a common man who did uncommon things. By any measure, Fred Hollows was a great man who performed great deeds. Frank Hardy, in his outstanding eulogy to his mate at the state funeral in St Mary's Cathedral, said: He was a saint; some saints are canonised by the church; some by the common people. The implication of that is that Fred Hollows has been canonised by the common people: It is most appropriate that, in this people's House, we should be considering a motion of this kind in connection with his untimely and tragic death. Frank Hardy also said during Fred Hollows's eulogy that he stared in the face of death with awe-inspiring courage. After the service I told Frank Hardy that he had probably delivered the greatest oration ever delivered in the cathedral. His response to me was, 'I had to get it right for Fred. He would never forgive me if I failed to do so'. Fred Hollows and Frank Hardy were mates, fellow socialists, larrikins, iconoclasts, humanists and humanitarians. Those qualities bound them together. Jack Waterford, who was a friend and colleague of Fred Hollows for over 20 years, wrote in the Canberra TImes in February this year: Though he eschewed formal religion and remained Marxist in his leanings, he retained a strong spiritual streak, became a fellow traveller with the Roman Catholic Church, and was fond of quoting Catholic Iiberationist theologian and activist Friere: ""God is the force in man that strives for liberation"". Bishop Heaps, who conducted the state funeral at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, said: Yes, Fred Hollows was intolerant but we can say that about Jesus. Yes, intolerant about racism, destructive nationalism, hypocrisy, fundamentalist, oppressive religion and many other lies that destroy joyful life and human freedom. The spirit of Fred Hollows would lift up the downtrodden and set captives free. We can honour him by living in that spirit. At that state funeral there were 5,000 people-3,000 people crammed into St Mary's and another 2,000 people spread across to Hyde Park. These were ordinary, common people who came along to pay their respects to an outstanding person. Included in that collection of people was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), two former Prime Ministers, the Governor of New South Wales, Government Ministers, members of government, judges, doctors, Eritreans, Burmese and Vietnamese. They all came along to pay their respects to Fred Hollows. Fred Hollows allowed that service to take phlce in St Mary's Cathedral because of his love for Gabi and his respect for her deep Catholic faith. But for his own service he chose another place. It was conducted among people who travelled from Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Queensland and from all parts of New South Wales. There were Aboriginal people, some of whom had travelled hundreds of kilometres; there were relations, old school friends, colleagues, nurses and many more. They were the ones who travelled to a dry clay pan outside Bourke where Fred was laid to rest. They were part of the Australian contingent of that great army of people who respected and loved Fred Hollows. The others are from such places as Eritrea, Vietnam and Nepal. They include those who have benefited from the clinics he established in Bangladesh, Burma and Latin America-the local medics whom Fred trained, and those people who will regain their sight as a result of the intraocular lens factories Fred established in Third Paolo World countries. One of the most moving, expressive and human photographs I have seen, and one that I am sure most people would have seen, shows an aged Aboriginal confirming his regained sight by reaching out his hand to find the tip of Fred's index finger with his own, proving that his sight had been regained. It was to the credit of the Catholic church that it not only allowed but welcomed the state funeral for an avowed Marxist in its magnificent cathedral in Sydney. It was equally to its credit that the chief eulogy was delivered by another outstanding Australian, a fellow communist, a good mate of Fred's and a great bloke-Frank Hardy. Would that ever occur again? Frank Hardy believed not; I believe not-a Marxist being given a state funeral in a Catholic cathedral where the chief eulogy is delivered by a fellow communist. It reflects great credit on the Christian integrity of the Catholic church. The obituary to Fred Hollows in the Age said: Professor Fred Hollows was a surgeon who placed his skills at the service of the dispossessed and brought light into the darkness of people blinded by neglect, ignorance or official indifference. The poem which Michael Thwaites wrote the day after Fred died concluded with this verse: The First Australians drew his healing powers. Out to the world his huge compassion spread. We, shamed by those with needs far worse than ours, Stand tall when Eritreans call us ""Fred"". That refers to the fact that Australians visiting Eritrea are not called Aussies or Australians; they are called 'Freds'. Gabi and the children also helped to restore the sight of those people who benefited from Fred Hollows's skills; they gave the time that Fred would otherwise have spent with them to those people whose sight was restored. Gabi and the children gave Fred the love which helped him to maintain his passion for the human character-a character, to Fred Hollows, without race, without colour, without age and, certainly, without status. Frank Hardy commenced his eulogy of Fred at the state funeral with these words: We'll never see the likes of Fred Hollows again and that's probably just as well. The implications of those words-thegenerous spirit of Frank Hardy which caused him to use those words-are apparent: a diverse character, a 'rough diamond, an intellectual, skilled surgeon, a bloke who looked and talked like a wharfie, a bloke who was often profane in his speech. Fred ensured that even his dying would be a public dying, that his death would be a public death. He did this to further his great purpose in restoring sight, to cement the undertakings and the commitments which had been made to him, overtly and implicitly, that his work and his projects would be continued. If we fail to honour those commitments we will dishonour his life's work and we will dishonour Fred Hollows.",75
87,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"The quality of the eulogies tonight in honour of Fred Hollows speaks volumes for the man about whom we speak. It is my deep desire and honour to be associated with this motion of condolence. I do not think any former Minister or former shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs could let this event pass without going on record to note the extraordinary service of this very extraordinary man. He played such a real role not only in the establishment of the Aboriginal Medical Service but also, in particular, in his attack, his war, on glaucoma. That he was singlehandedly able to start a movement which brought back sight and treated some 30,000 Aboriginal Australians is by itself a unique and magnificent achievement. I met Fred in the Northern Territory when I was a shadow Minister in the mid-1980s. It is fair to say, as others have said before me, that Fred did not suffer fools gladly. I am afraid he included parliamentarians among the fools. From his perspective, that was perfectly justified because he would say, 'Look around you and see for yourself that you have spent all this money, yet have fundamentally failed to address some of these critical issues which affect the health and the well-being of your fellow citizen'. He used to take some exception to the fact that various aid organisations and church organisations from other countries were actually prepared to fund health programs for Australian Aborigines. His point always was that the Australian Government seemed to have some difficulty in being able to face up to the issues. Much has been said a here tonight about the extraordinary work Professor Hollows did outside Australia-in Eritrea in particular, in Nepal, in Burma, in Bangladesh and, most recently, in Vietnam. Last year I had the honour to be present at the launch of the Fred Hollows Foundation. He knew his time was short and he also knew there was much to be done. He had been in hospital on a number of occasions and was clearly unwell. Although on that occasion he had great difficulty actually speaking, he nevertheless did. He saw the urgency of the moment and he saw the need to get his point across to the audience, which was quite an influential audience, including a lot of people from the media who were funding the breakfast on that occasion. Professor Hollows told us quite clearly the basic philosophy for which he had lived and worked and why he wanted the Hollows Foundation to carry on the activities which he had already pioneered. Fundamentally, he believed that where we have skills, in whatever field they may be, those skills must be put to the benefit of humanity. He believed the transfer of technology and the techniques he had demonstrated in the areas of glaucoma and ophthalmology were fundamental. His goal as he saw it was that, if people were to be truly independent, obviously they could not achieve any form of independence if they could not see. To him, the most simple thing of all was to give people the right to sight. He told us then about the Wollongong factory in your electorate, Mr Speaker, where they were establishing kits, which he designed himself, to take out to these Third World countries-not in the sense of, 'We are a rich country; here is aid, we want to help you'; he completely dissociated himself from that sort of attitude. The point he was making was that, by giving them the kits, the people themselves with training would be able to produce a technical material substantially cheaper than that which was being sold to those very same governments by the Americans or whoever it was that had the technology and the techniques. They would be able to develop their own techniques and eye mechanisms to help their people. That is what he wanted his foundation to continue to do, and that is what it has continued to do. At the most recent Australia Day awards, being a previous Australian Citizen of the Year, Fred was represented by his wife, Gabi. Fred was dying, yet there she was, representing him. She was always smiling. She showed remarkable self-control. Those who knew what Fred was all about knew that she and her family were totally dedicated to the ideals of this extraordinary man. As I said initially, I think it says volumes for Fred Hollows that he wanted to be buried on the daypan outside Bourke, the land that he loved, among the people whom he had done so much to help. I think that was the most moving epitaph of all.",77
88,Mr KERR,Unknown,"A man such as Fred Hollows, who has made such a contribution in so many different areas, is inevitably refracted through different eyes. But I think it is a mark of his stature the community that all those eyes now turn towards him with respect. I say a couple of things about a legacy-in a sense, the contribution that each of us can make in the community. It is very easy to be conscious of our frailties in the community and to be unwilling to confront that which we can do. To put this into context, I read the other day in TIme magazine of a prayer that Hillary Clinton is alleged to say each night before she goes to bed. She says, 'Lord help us. The ocean is so vast and our boat so small'. I think all of us in that sense are aware of our frailties and our small capacity to impact upon our society. Those of us who are honoured to find a place in this Parliament have a greater capacity to impact upon the lives and the events in our community than others. Even with the responsibility and authority that is given to us by our election, I think we are all aware of the limits of our capacity to change things. But a man like Fred Hollows, not in this Parliament, not in any elected capacity at all, save invigorated by his own sense of the raw injustice that is in the community, shows all of us what we are capable of. In that way he says to all of us that we are capable of greater things. He was an avowed Marxist and a humanist. He was a person with a greater vision of what it is possible for all of us to contribute in leaving our society better offour capacity to make a contribution. It is important to recall the words of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). The important thing about Fred Hollows was not that he himself was a secular saint, for he certainly was not; it was that he saw in others the capacity to control their own destinies and to take far greater control over their lives. Everything Fred Hollows did in the Aboriginal community and, when he went overseas, in Eritrea, was committed to the principle that he would provide service to those who were less well off in the community but not seek to dominate, rather, to be their servant. He continued that practice in the Aboriginal Medical Service-always working for Aboriginal controlled organisations. When in he went to Eritrea his principal task was to train local medical practitioners so that they could carry on the work for which he initially provided the expertise. It says a lot to those of us who are nonAboriginals in our community about the kind of role we can play in our society towards building a process of reconciliation. It is not for us to lead. Those like myself and honourable members opposite who have played significant roles as chairmen of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, or working for Aboriginal legal services, or involved in many other capacities as many members on both sides of this House have been, in a sense recognise that their role is transient and that they have been prepared to work for Aboriginal people as they develop the skills for their own self-determination. One of the things that I am very proud of as a member of this Government is that for the first time we are moving to a situation where, through ATSIC, the Aboriginal community has been empowered to a far greater degree than ever before to take responsibility for decision making into its own hands and to employ people whom it directs towards its ends rather than be reliant, as before, on a handful of benevolent well-wishers. Fred Hollows was never a benevolent well-wisher; he was, and saw himself always, as a person at their disposal. Finally, there is a line in poetry that is appropriate for Fred. It speaks of his anger at blindness and the need to respond to the scourge in the Aboriginal communities where blindness was so dominant, whereas in our wider non-Aboriginal community it had all but been eradicated. It was written by a young man of his father, who was dying. He said, 'Do not go gentle into that good night ... rage, rage against the dying of the light'. There are no stronger words that can be said of Fred Hollows than that for all of his life he raged against the dying of the light. Even in his last months he continued to live a vigorous life, raging against the dying of the light, and it is a beacon to all of us. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Ashley-Brown, Mr Alfred",78
89,Mr KEATING,Unknown,"I move: That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Friday, 5 February 1993, of Alfred Ashley-Brown, member of the House of Representatives from 1972 to 1974 for the division of Mitchell in New South Wales, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Alfred Ashley-Brown was born on 5 October 1915 at Strathfield in New South Wales. He saw service in the Second World War with the 2nd AIF from 1942 to 1945, being discharged with the rank of major. Prior to entering the Federal Parliament, he had a long and distinguished career in local government in New South Wales. He was first elected as a councillor in the Seven Hills riding in 1959. He became the shire president the following year. In 1961, when B1acktowt;l was proclaimed a municipality, Mr Ashley-Brown was the first mayor of the district, a position he held for a record seven years. In 1987 the Blacktown Council conferred on him the title of freeman of the city in recognition of his outstanding service to local government. As well as a voluminous knowledge of, and interest in, local government matters he also had a deep interest in Aboriginal affairs. While in Parliament he was a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs very and after his parliamentary service he was an Aboriginal Loans Commissioner for a number of years. Alfred Ashley-Brown was a low-key but hard working and loyal member of the House of Representatives who gave faithful service to his electors and the nation. He was not in the Parliament for a long time but those people who knew him had great respect for him. On behalf of the Government and, I am sure, all honourable members of the House, I extend our sincere sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",79
90,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"On behalf of the Opposition, I rise to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in expressing regret at the death of Alfred Ashley-Brown, the former member for Mitchell. As the Prime Minister has said, Mr Ashley-Brown served in this Parliament from 1972 to 1974 and, as such, he was well before my time. I note that Mr Ashley-Brown had long service to local government before entering Parliament. He was the first mayor of Blacktown when it became a municipality and he is credited with the establishment of many of the civic facilities in what was then one of the frontier suburbs of Sydney. His organisational skills and his ability to create something out of nothing were a legacy of his service as an officer in the Australian Army in the Second World War. At any rate, he put his experience to enterprising use. He is remembered in Blacktown as one of the men who built a busy town centre and a residential area out of what were bare paddocks in the early 1960s. In 1974 he lost his seat to my colleague the present honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), believing that he was the victim of local fears about the siting of an airport at Galston, which has proved to be a familiar refrain in Sydney politics over the years since that time. Mr Ashley-Brown took a keen interest in Aboriginal affairs, serving on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and, after leaving this Parliament, giving his time as a Commissioner for Aboriginal Affairs, visiting Aboriginal communities throughout the country. My colleagues and I join the Prime Minister in extending our condolences to his widow and family.",79
91,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"I will add my remarks to the condolence motion for Mr Alfred Ashley-Brown. He was one of the many members of the Parliament who served in World War II-in the second AIF from 1942 until 1945. He achieved his rank as a field promotion, which is the hardest and most deserving way to gain promotion and rank in the Army, and I respect him for that. When Mr Ashley-Brown was a one term backbencher of this Federal Parliament, I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament. I vividly recall the bitterness and controversy which erupted over the Galston airport, to which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) referred, and I look forward to hearing an historical postscript from the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). Mr Ashley-Brown gave service at the local government level and in the Federal Parliament. I salute that service and extend condolences to members and descendants of Alfred Ashley-Brown.",80
92,Mr GORMAN,Unknown,"I rise to speak to the motion of condolence. Mr AshleyBrown was part of an interview panel when I first applied for a position at the Blacktown city council in mid-1959. I was successful in obtaining the position. On commencing duty with the council, it was soon apparent that Mr Ashley-Brown was not the president and later mayor by name only; he was a very hard working president and mayor. He was always, by profession, an expert on whatever he undertook in his duties around Blacktown. Professionally he was an accountant and looked after the Murray Brothers accounts section in Parramatta. Later he worked for a Mr Tom Bruren and took over a very big timber and hardware store in the city of Blacktown and remained there for many years. It is quite strange that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) mentioned that Mr Ashley-Brown served only one parliamentary term. Speaking as a member of his federal electorate committee, I can say that at the time we were sure that, had the rumours not been around, Mr Ashley-Brown would have served for some further years in the Parliament and that Mr Cadman would not have had as long a service as his record shows at this time. Mr Ashley-Brown was quite a busy person. I remember that on one occasion he drove into the works depot at Blacktown in a cloud of dust, called me over and set about ticking me off over a team of men who were leaning on shovels and picks at the level crossing at Seven Hills. Blacktown at that time was a typical rural area that was surrounded with level crossings to most areas-Riverstone, Schofields, Quakers Hill and Seven Hills. He said, 'If you like working for the Blacktown council you had better get down there and stop those fellows because it is bad for the ratepayers to see people leaning on picks and shovels'. I dashed down in the ute and had a look at them. I came back about 40 minutes later, which was a pretty good record in those days. I thought, 'I've got this fellow and it's early in my career. I have the mayor where I want him'. I went into his office and said, 'Sorry, Mr Ashley-Brown, those fellows down there are railway fettJers. They don't work for the council and therefore I couldn't say anything about it'. He said, 'I was just testing you out, Russ, to see how long it would take you to go down to Seven Hills, check the position there and then come back'. I was quite sure that I really had him by the toe, but he reversed the position on me without any problems whatsoever. Thousands of people would remember Mr' Ashley-Brown for the wonderful things that he did for Blacktown. He turned Blacktown from a straight out rural cow paddock into a thriving city within a short time. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, he entered Parliament in 1972 and retired in 1974 after serving only one term. Whilst he will be remembered in the history books as time goes on, his legacy will remain forever in Blacktown city. Some of the aldermen who served on Mr Ashley-Brown's council were John Aqualina, BiIl Mills, Bob Christie, Ray MCGarry and Gordon Barnier. In discussions over the years with each of them. I have not heard one bad word said about Mr Ashley-Brown or any of his dealings. There were always a lot of rumours, but never was one bad word said about anything he did that pertained to Blackof town city council. He will be remembered by the thousands of people whom he helped in establishing Blacktown as the thriving city that it is today. On my own behalf and on behalf of my family and some friends I have here-Athol, Angus, Deanne and Sharlene-I offer to Mona and the family our condolences.",80
93,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"I join with the comments that have been made about Mr Ashlf""y-Brown. I first met him by telephone after I was preselected as the candidate for Mitchell. I phoned him and said that I would be conducting a fair campaign. He was a bit bemused by my phone call, but he took it with good grace. We did have a very fair campaign in 1974. I found him a courteous and quiet man. He was a man probably better suited in his ways to local government than to the national Parliament. I found him at all times to be a man who was approachable and fair. As has been mentioned, Mr Ashley-Brown was the mayor of Blacktown. He had a reputation of good standing as an accountant with a large departmental store in Parramatta known as Murray Brothers. His service in the AIF was well known. He won the seat of Mitchell in 1972 from Les Irwin, who at that stage had retired from the Bank of New South Wales to go into politics. Les was elected at well over the age of 60 to begin a career lasting nine years in the Federal Parliament. Ashley-Brown was successful in the swing to Gough Whitlam in the 'It's time' campaign in 1972. In 1974, two seats were won by the coalition; Mitchell was one. The 1974 economy was well on the move downwards, with the Whitlam extravagances and high interest rates cruelling it for young home buyers right throughout the western area of Sydney. Of course, there was also the Galston airport controversy. A colleague of mine, the then member for Parramatta, also benefited by the extraordinary decision that was so strongly held to by both the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, and the Minister for Transport, Mr Charles Jones. Ashley-Brown had not realised the strength feeling that there was in the hills district when Galston was announced as the site for the airport. People were very restive. There were many petitions, bus loads of people coming down to Canberra and that sort of thing. Gough Whitlam, as Prime Minister, really roused people up when he visited Baulkham Hills shire council during that period, and in response to a protest of mums and kids outside the front door of the council chambers swung round on them in rage and said, 'You will get Galston'. Nothing could have made it harder for Ashley-Brown to win the 1974 election. At a rally of some 8,000 people on a cold winter's night in Galston Park, an impossible number of people to raise by any sheer political manipulation, AshleyBrown's speech was made up of his saying over and over again, 'An airport at Galston? You have got to be joking'. That was no consolation to the people who had assembled there. Ashley-Brown recognised that it was a very difficult decision to execute and could not see it coming to fruition, but failed to indicate that he would follow through and work on behalf of the residents of that area to reverse the Cabinet decision. So there was a change. We won that seat by some 600 votes at that time. I would like to pay tribute to a hard working man of the Labor Party, who worked hard in local government, who was a good member of Federal Parliament and who at all tiines was a man of his word and a man of honour. I wish to extend my condolences to his family. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. His Excellency Turgut Ozal",81
94,Mr KEATING,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I move: That this House records its deep regret of the death on 17 April 1993 of Turgut Ozal, President of the Republic of Turkey, expresses its deep sympathy to the family of the late President Ozal and to the people of Turkey in their bereavement and requests that this motion be conveyed by the Speaker on behalf of the Australian Parliament to the Government of Turkey. Turgut Ozal will be remembered by his fellow Turks as an economic reformer who worked hard to consolidate democratic principles in Turkey. He also will be remembered as a close friend and ally of Australia. The late President was awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia in the course of his visit to Australia in 1971, in recognition of his efforts to develop relations between our two countries. In particular, Australia remembers Turgut Ozal with special affection for his role in organising the 75th ANZAC commemoration at Gallipoli in 1990 and his part in the Turkish Government's decision to rename the landing place of the ANZACs at Gallipoli ANZAC Cove. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr Ozal on a number of occasions during OECD negotiations. One year he was the presiding officer of the OECD and I was able to get some insight into his personality and the fact that he was in the last 25 years one of the significant people who had remodelled a complex economy and set a nation on a new course of integration with the rest of the world. He was a person of substance and I hope that all Australians and members of this House will join with me in expressing our profound sorrow and regret at his death.",82
95,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"The Opposition fully supports the motion before the House and joins in conveying its sympathy to the Government and the people of Turkey following the death of President Turgut Ozal. President Ozal was Turkey's dominant political leader of the 1980s. He was also a very good friend of Australia. At a personal level I well recall the deep sense of reconciliation which President Ozal brought to the 75th anniversary commemoration of the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey just over three years ago. President Ozal played an important role in the planning of that commemoration and in the warm welcome which was extended to our Gallipoli veterans and to all those Australians who participated in that unforgettable event. The Gallipoli campaign created an enduring sense of nationhood, not just for Australia but also for Turkey, and it was very appropriate that reconciliation, friendship and comradeship were hallmarks of the 75th anniversary of the ANZAC landings. The memorable success of those commemoration services at ANZAC Cove in 1990 owes much to the hard work of many people in both Australia and Turkey and, in a special way, to the personal commitment shown by President Ozal. As Prime Minister for six years and President for three, Turgut Ozal was a controversial figure in his own country. It is not for us today, of course, to pass judgment on his political record, except to note that in key policy areas such as economic restructuring, trade arrangements, regional security and relations' with the West, President Ozal pursued clear-cut policies which he believed were in Turkey's national interest. President Ozal committed Turkey strongly in support of the United Nations-led alliance that eventually drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in 1990, a commitment which, of course, Australia fully shared. I appreciated the. opportunity to discuss some of these matters directly with President Ozal when he visited Australia two years ago. We differed on some important issuesnotably the situation in Cyprus and the importance of respect for basic human rightsbut it was a measure of the maturity of the bilateral relationship that we could discuss such differences in a direct and respectful way. President Ozal was well aware of the important economic opportunities that exist in Australia-Turkey relations, and it is our hope that his enthusiasm for making the most of such opportunities is sustained. The Opposition parties join with the Government in this condolence motion and we look forward to further strengthening the ties between Australia and Turkey.",82
96,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"It is with sadness that I rise to speak on the condolence motion for the former President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal. President Ozal was indeed a friend of Australia, as witnessed by his visit to Australia in 1991, a visit which included the Snowy Mountains scheme in the town of Khancoban in my electorate and also his modernisation. appointment as an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia. I very much regretted the attitude and activities of groups within and without this Parliament to besmirch that honorary Compoint panion of the Order of Australia given to President Ozal. I vividly remember the cir1989. cumstances of that besmirchment. It was undeserving in all the circumstances and I commend former Prime Minister Bob Hawke for the st.eps he took in giving that honorary Companion of the Order of Australia award to President Ozal. It was richly deserved. President Ozal had a great influence on Turkey in continuing the work of modernising and westernising Turkey's political system. guess many of us also gained more knoweconomy ledge of Turkey during that period because it ing Turkey. was a period in which Turkey was represented by Ambassador Ergun Pelit and he was very active in disseminating information ahead the visit that many of us made to Turkey Gallipoli in 1990. President Ozal also had a major influence on the opening up of debate in Turkey on issues which had been previously off limits due to the strong Islamic influences on Tura key. In many ways I suppose he could be likened to that former President and great Turk patriot, Ataturk. It is a matter of more than passing interest that it was the Australians' and New Zealanders' 'unluck' that at the landing of Gallipoli, Ataturk was in command of the Turkish forces. On day one of that offensive the Australian and New Zealand forces actually made it to the top and over the other side where could see the sea, and they held that high ground for several precious hours. But they were up against the one Turkish commander who recognised that by sunset he had to recapture that ground or the game was up and Turkey would be forced up the peninsula. course, Ataturk took every action he could and fought back on day one. In fact, he regained that high ground at that critical time on the occasion of 25 April 1915. The rest is history. Ataturk went on to become a moderniser and great President of Turkey and, indeed, President Ozal continued that work of I can add only that President Ozal's elevation to the position of President is particularly interesting given current debates within Australia about certain matters. In passing, I out that President Ozal's Motherland Party was in office in Turkey from 1983 to As his party became less popular in the late 1980s, the then Prime Minister Ozal had his parliamentary majority elect him as President in 1989, a situation which outraged the then opposition and which fundamentally changed the precedent until that time that presidents in Turkey were essentially non-political appointments. There is no doubt that President Ozal was a visionary nationalist and I his free market prescriptions for Turkey's achieved much in further modernisLastly, President Ozal will be remembered for allowing allied planes to use strategic air of bases within Turkey for operations against and Iraq during the Gulf War. I had the good fortune of being on board the Australian naval ships during the blockade of Iraq, the Strait of Honnuz and elsewhere, and the air strikes, some of which commenced in Turkey, were valuable part of that blockade. I think that was a particularly courageous and correct decision by President Ozal at that time. He was a great Turk; he will be sorely missed. I extend sympathy to the family of President Ozal and to the nation of Turkey, a nation which Australia has special links with and which I hope Australia will always continue to have special links with, given the joint history we share from those momentous they and horrific chapters of World War I.",82
97,Mr LINDSAY,Unknown,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development)-I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other members in expressing the sympathy of Of the Australian people on the death of the former President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal. Turgut Ozal was a significant figure in recent political history in Turkey, both as Prime Minister and as President. He played a major role in economic reform and the modern history of Turkey as a major figure and driving force in the Motherland Party. He was involved in determined efforts to have Turkey admitted as a member of the European Economic Community. As the Prime Minister said, he was a significant presence at OECD meetings held in the last decade. More important, of course, was his role in opening Turkey more forcefully to the West than had occurred hitherto. He was in a true sense a bridge to the West for the Republic of Turkey. He wanted Turkey to be with the West whilst not forgetting its connections and heritage with the East. This theme of opening to the West that he developed during his time as Prime Minister and as President was noted and appreciated by the world community. He was responsible, through the policies that he introduced and sustained through his Motherland Party, for an uplifting and improvement in the standard of living of the people of Turkey. I know that he did much in the area of human rights to ensure that there was a reawakening amongst the authorities in Turkey that abuses of human rights should not be tolerated. He did his best to ensure where abuses were occurring action was taken to correct them and to punish those who were involved. He was particularly concerned about the plight of the Kurds in Turkey. He often said that his mother was a Kurd and he had a great interest in and empathy with the Kurds of Turkey. He was able to relax bans on their language and, in many ways, to assist them to assimilate in a better way than hitherto as of the Republic of Turkey. I know that during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm the Western alliance appreciated his intervention and the involvement of Turkey on the ground not only by providing ground forces but also, more importantly, by providing bases in Turkey for operations engaged in the pursuit of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. His visit to Australia in 1991 was a significant event. His support for the 50th anniversary celebrations of the landing at Gallipoli and his close association with Australian authorities to ensure that that very important ceremony was conducted with the greatest respect and reverence were applauded by the Australian people. I know that he will be grievously missed by the majority of the citizens of Turkey, who laud him for his contribution to their country, for the uplifting of their standard of living, for opening Turkey to the West and for his indomitable love for his country. He was a great friend to the people of Australia. He had reverence for this country and its people, for the heroism of the ANZACs at Gallipoli. Above all he wished to unite and bind the people of Australia and the people of Turkey closer than ever before. I extend great sympathy to his family and to the people of his country on the passing of a significant international figure.",83
98,Mr FERGUSON,Unknown," Mr Deputy Speaker, as you do, I have the benefit of representing an electorate with a very significant Turkish population. The night of 17 April was very telling of the respect of that community. I was in attendance at the annual ball of Auburn United Soccer Club, Sydney's leading Turkish soccer club, when the anthat nouncement of his death was made. The reaction of the audience and the coverage in Australian-based Turkish newspapers such as Dunya and Yeni Vatan have certainly testified to the deep respect held for him by the Turkish community in Australia. Previous speakers have alluded to the question of civil rights in Turkey. One thing that must be said about Turgut Ozal is that he conquered his background. Born in central part Turkey, coming from a very strong Islamic background, he originally ran as a candidate for one of the more conservative religiousbased parties. After an education overseas, he was pushed into power as the Deputy Prime Minister of the military government of Turkey in 1980. I think it is testimony to his contribution to Turkey that he did overcome the reality that he had been put there by the Turkish military authorities and that during the liberalisation period that occurred after that-the lifting of marshal law and the plebiscite that ended the lO-year ban on former prime ministers and other political leaders-he was at the helm when there was a strengthening again of civil liberties. The other important point to consider is his contribution in foreign affairs. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said that in discussions with President Ozal he had indicated some disagreements over Cyprus. I think that is very true, but the reality is the Cypriot solution has lost a very great friend in his death. Only today I was speaking to the representative of the Republic of Cyprus, who indicated a feeling that progress on that issue would possibly deteriorate because of his passing. 1 think we must also recall the central role he has played in European affairs over the last few years and particularly on the question of Bosnia. When the world has failed to come up with solutions, the one country that has very significantly pushed forward the cause of the Bosnian Moslems and, at the same time, attempted to deal with it in a very rational and sensitive way has been Turkey a-d its representatives around the world. President Ozal died after returning from a tour of central Asian republics and the former Soviet Union, an area where Turkey has been playing a leading role. He has played a central part in attempting to increase the ties between the Turkish speaking republics and the Turkish Government. Once again, on the Kurdish question, it is very difficult to say that one can totally agree with the Turkish Government's position or, for that matter, the Kurdish resistance, but 1 think the evidence is there that, no matter how critical one might be of certain activities of the Government, he has been a force of moderation. It has been argued that his departure will strengthen the hand of those who take a more hardline position. 1 join with other members in expressing sympathy at his departure. Question resolved in the affinnative, honourable members standing in their places. His Excellency Ranasinghe Premadasa",84
99,Mr KEATING,Unknown," I move: That this House records its deep regret at the death, on 1 May 1993, of Ranasinghe Premadasa, President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, expresses its deep sympathy to Madame Premadasa and family and to the people of Sri Lanka in their bereavement, and requests that this motion be conveyed by the Speaker on behalf of the Australian Parliament to the Government of Sri Lanka. The assassination of Ranasinghe Premadasa that on 1 May was an appalling act of violence, which deserves the condemnation of all Australians. It was a tragedy for Sri Lanka and for its people. Ranasinghe Premadasa was a popular President, a man of humble origins, with a genuine concern for the poor and underprivileged. The economic reforms which he promoted with such vigour have done much to open up Sri Lanka and its economy and to encourage investment in the development of the country. This will be one of the  people. Australians deplore the use of violence as a means of settling political or communal differences. I think it is true to say that as a country we abhor such tactics. I hope that all Australians, and every member of this House, will join me in expressing our profound sorrow and regret at his untimely death. . Dr HEWSON (Wentworth-Leader of the Opposition)-The Opposition joins with the Government in expressing the shock of this House at the assassination of President Premadasa of Sri Lanka at the weekend. The death of President Premadasa is another tragic chapter in the political violence that has plagued Sri Lanka for over a decade and that has caused the deaths of many thousands of its people. The President's assassination follows the murder last week of the leader of Sri Lanka's opposition political party. President Premadasa was a leading figure in Sri Lankan politics for over four decades and he has left a powerful legacy in Sri Lanka's national life. The manner of his death epitomises the tragic cycle of ethnic and political violence that has consumed Sri Lanka for far too long. The political and communal divisions in that country will not be settled in any lasting way by violence, terrorism or murder but only through genuine negotiation based on mutual respect. We hope that political stability will soon return to Sri Lanka and we look forward to the day when all Sri Lankans can once again live in peace and security and with a sense of common purpose. I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in conveying the sympathy of this House to the Government and the people of Sri Lanka at this very difficult time.",85
100,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"In supporting this motion of condolence arising from the death of President Premadasa of Sri Lanka, I have brought to the dispatch box a copy of Kuensel, Bhutan's national newspaper. On the front page of the edition of Saturday, 17 April 1993 is an especially poignant photo of the seven heads of government of the SAARC group of nations-the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation-at its Dhaka ,neeting. Featured in the photograph is not only the King of Bhutan but also President Premadasa at what was the last summit he was to attend as President before his untimely death. I mention that because I have studied the kingdom of Bhutan and the South Asian group of nations quite closely. They are very important to Australia in their linkage with Australia's further trade development, their languages and for many other reasons. President Premadasa made a particular point of doing what he could to ensure that SAARC did not become completely derailed by the very strong forces in SAARC-notably India and Pakistan-which have caused some difficulty along the way because of long standing controversies. The President made a contribution to regional peace and cooperation through his participation in the South Asian group of nations. That is recognised around the region and recognised by us in paying tribute to the President following his tragic death, a death which sent a chill up the spine of all those who have followed events in Sri Lanka over recent years, especially in relation to the civil war, the activities of the Tamil Tigers and others. It is an absolute tragedy that since 1983 over 28,000 people have been killed as a result of the ongoing civil unrest within Sri Lanka between the Singhalese majority and the Tamil rebels in the north and the east of the country. President Premadasa's death was accompanied by the killing of another 17 people and a further 60 injured in what must have been an absolutely horrific bomb blast. The death of President Premadasa leaves a vacuum in the leadership of Sri Lanka, and I wish that country well as it deals with its transition in the circumstances arising. The death of President Premadasa follows the tragic death of the former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, which occurred in not dissimilar circumstances-it had some parallels-in the southern part of India. President Premadasa's death does not augur well for the region but I hope that the region will overcome the fighting, the civil war and insurrection that have caused this difficulty and that his death will not be in vain. I support the condolence motion on the death of the President of Sri Lanka and I wish Sri Lanka well in these troubled times.",86
101,Mr CONNOLLY,Unknown,"I wish to be associated with the House's motion of condolence on the recent death of the President of Sri Lanka, Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa. In his last speech before his assassination the late President issued a challenge to his political enemies. He said: Assassinate me by whatever means but please do not assassinate my character. It is chilling to think that within hours he was dead, killed by a terrorist's bomb during a May Day parade in Colombo. It says much for Sri Lanka's first President, Mr J.R. Jayewardene, that he chose Premadasa despite his humble background over many others who laid claim to the presidency. He did so because he saw in Premadasa the potential to bring together the diverse political and ethnic forces which since the 1970s have done their best to destroy what used to be, when I was a child living there, one of the most contented and beautiful places on earth.  when I was in the Australian High Commission in Colombo. He was the Minister for Local Government between 1968 and 1970, Prime Minister from 1978 to 1988 and, of course, finally President from 1989. By any yardstick Ranasinghe Premadasa was a tough politician. Some claimed that his methods were dubious. But in the hard politics of his country he carved out for himself a unique place. Unlike virtually all the senior politicians who had led his country since independence in 1948, he was not a Goyigama-that is, a member of the highest caste; they were mainly the landowners. He was a member of the Hinaya, or the washermen's caste, which was very low down the totem pole. He was a product of the villagers, of the labour movement, and was very much a man of the people. Premadasa's political support always rested with the low caste, the low income city and village dwellers. As housing Minister, he initiated programs to achieve universal housing with some success and probably his greatest achievement was to break the caste barrier and become the first non-high caste President of his country. Premadasa in his time as President not only dealt firmly with the Marxist political extremists in the Singhala community, who tried to rule through the gun, urging them to come into the democratic process, but also endeavoured to open the way to constructive dialogue with the Ceylon Tamils whose claims to a separate state were the basis of the civil war which has racked that country for a decade. On many occasions he stated publicly that he would go anywhere at any time to talk peace. While he maintained military action against the rebels, he always saw political dialogue as an essential prerequisite to a peace settlement. The assassination of President Premadasa not only is an event of great concern to his own nation but also may have repercussions within the region. Unfortunately, this is just the latest in a long line of political tions in Sri Lanka. If this trend continues, it will hasten the collapse of the democratic institutions which have played an important part in endeavouring to hold the country together since 1948, despite the endemic ethnic animosities which have resulted over recent decades. Premadasa successfully negotiated the cease-fire with the Tamil Tigers which lasted for 15 months-a record. He achieved the withdrawal of Indian peacekeeping forces ahead of schedule and neutralised the threat from the extreme Singhala Marxist movement, the JVP. As a result of his formidable achievements, and despite the civil war, the Sri Lankan economy has done surprisingly well over recent years with growth rates of around five per cent. Tourism has once again revived and foreign investment last year exceeded $200 million. Unfortunately, the human rights record of Sri Lanka, both during the struggle against the JVP guerillas in the south and against the Tamil separatists in the north, has led to great criticism from both Asia Watch and Amnesty International. But to his credit it was Premadasa who allowed those human rights organisations to re-enter the country and report on the activities of his government. In recent years, Sri Lanka has paid an enormous price for its ethnic and political instability. Over 60,000 people have died, political and military leaders have been murdered by the score and two of its most important political leaders have been assassinated within the last week or so. While I offer the Premadasa family my deepest sympathy, we must all hope and pray that his death will not add more horror and strife to the people of Sri Lanka, who have endured so much over the last decade. If ethnic violence spreads, it could undermine the hard won economic success that has made Sri Lanka's living standards, despite the civil war, the envy of other developing nations. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. assassina- DEPUTY SPEAKER AND CHAIRMAN NA",86
102,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"Before moving to government business, I ""wish to add to the remarks that I made earlier in the day upon my election as Deputy Speaker. On that occasion I was most remiss in not joining the remarks of my worthy opponent, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), about the efforts of my predecessor, Ron Edwards, as Deputy Speaker and Chainpan of Committees in the previous parliament. I believe that, from the way he conducted himself both in his time as Deputy Speaker and on occasions as Acting Speaker, Ron earned great respect from all members on both sides of the House. Without great disrespect to the new honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron), who I note is in the chamber at the moment, I wish Ron all the best in any future political endeavours. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 5) 1992-93 First Reading Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",87
103,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1992-93, together with Appropriation Bill (No.6) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 199293. In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1992-93 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. The additional appropriations in these Additional Estimates Bills total $1,681.3 million; $1,257.7 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No.5), $418.4 million in Appropriation Bill (No.6) and $5.2 million in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2). These amounts are offset, in part, by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1, 2, 3 and 4) 1992-93, reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs, as well as changed funding arrangements for the Australian National University, the Australian Maritime College and the University of Canberra. These institutions have been funded from a special appropriation from 1 January 1993, as agreed by Parliament in the last session. The savings in the appropriations, amounting to $595.4 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document Statement of savings expected in annual appropriations, which has been distributed to honourable members. After discounting those savings by the amount of $119.6 million attributable to the changed funding arrangements I have just mentioned, the net prospective savings identified by departments against the annual appropriations are $475.8 million. After allowing for net prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $1,205.5 million in appropriations for 1992-93, an increase of 3.2 per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1992-93 Budget. I tum now to the main areas for which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No.5) 1992-93 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government. Although the Budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, that amount was not then appropriated. Funds are now required to meet increases resulting from award decisions and $288.9 million is included in Appropriation Bill (No.5) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies including Defence; an increase of 2.7 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No.1). This amount three includes the costs associated with agreed wage and salary increases, transfers between financial years and some additional funding for departments associated with various government initiatives which have been previously announced. Gross additional estimates of $836.3 million are sought for the defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No.5). This figure includes: $390.3 million for Australian Defence Industries, ADI, principally associated with a $390 million purchase of equity in ADI as part a debt for equity swap-that payment will be offset by a payment from ADl to. the Commonwealth; $257.1 million for defence housing which includes provision for a $191.3 million payment to the Defence Housing Reports Authority, DHA, as part of a debt for equity swap-the payment to the DHA will be offset to the House. by an equivalent payment from the DHA to the Commonwealth; $115 million for running journed. costs principally due to the effects of the award increases and provision for redundanAPPROPRIATION cies included in the amount. of $288.9 million which I have already mentioned; and $50.3 million for stores and equipment which largely reflects adjustments for price movemending ments and exchange rate variations. In addition, Appropriation Bill (No.5) first time. includes provision for: $34 million for the Department of Employment, Education and Training for running costs associated with the CBS network workload formula, as government initiatives in respect of the implementation of the Mayer report and the employer incentive scheme; $14.6 million for emergency relief, reflecting the dollar for dollar matching of funds raised by charities their Christmas appeals; $30.3 million for child-care fee relief which reflects growth average fee relief and in the number of private sector places; $17.2 million for matchCapital ing of rates for medical officers and nurses repatriation hospitals with relevant State rates; and $20.4 million for payments to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, reflecting the effective write-off of Russian wheat debt and losses associated with the write-off of the rescheduled Egyptian wheat debt resulting from a factoring transaction. The balance of $131 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No.5) is made up of minor variations across a range programs across most departments and agenworking cies. These additional appropriations are required to meet the 1992-93 commitments that have been made by the Government since the Budget as well as unavoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared. The Bill also includes a clause for the of creation of a provision for running costs borrowings. This provision will be limited to $20 million and will be used to provide flexibility for departments and agencies to fully utilise the running costs arrangements. will be provided to the Parliament on the use of the provision. I commend the Bill Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adBILL (No. 6) 1992-93 First Reading Message from the Governor General recomappropriation for proposed expenditure announced.

104,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I move:. That the Bill be now read a second time. In Appropriation Bill (No.6) 1992-93, appropriations totalling $418.4 million - additional into those made by appropriation Acts (Nos 2 and 4) 1992-93-are sought for capital works in and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Territory, advances and loans, and for in other services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not largely made in those Acts. The additional appropriations are sought to meet certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the Budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the Government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in appropriation Acts (Nos 2 and 4) 1992-93 of include: $12.3 million for an increase in the capital advance to the legal services trust account in the Attorney-General's Department due to unanticipated delays in the billing cycle; $7 million out of a $44.6 million package, as support for specialist wool growers under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the rural adjustment scheme; $17.5 million for compensation to the States for the extension of fringe benefits to pensioners and long term allowees and beneficiaries; $5.4 million for one-off funding for ABC television broadcasts to South-East Asia; and $263 million for a special assistance package to South Australia. The remaining $113.2 million included in Appropriation Bill (No.6) comprises minor increases in a number of programs for a range of portfolios. I commend the Bill to the House. Mr Costello- Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to congratulate you on your election, this being the second occasion on which I could have done so. I was remiss in not taking the opportunity on the first occasion. I move: That the debate be now adjourned. Question resolved in the affirmative.

105,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1992-93, appropriations totalling $5.2 million additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1992-93 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the parliamentary departments. The increase sought relates primarily to essential and unavoidable costs associated with activities of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Costello) adjourned. SUPPLY BILL (No.1) 1993-94 First Reading Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Willis, and· read a first time. Second Reading",90
106,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, together with its companion Bills, Supply Bill (No.2) 1993-94 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94, is a routine machinery measure. It seeks interim appropriations for the ongoing services of the Government during the period to 30 November 1993, by which date it is expected that the appropriation Bills, which form part of the Budget for 1993-94, will have been enacted. Supply Bill (No.1) seeks appropriations totalling some $13,347.5 million for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $965 million, or about 7.8 per cent, greater than the equivalent amounts provided in the Supply Act (No.1) 1992-93. This increase reflects a combination of factors, including: price and cost increases and the impact of exchange rate variations; the inclusion in the ordinary annual services of government of items which appeared in Supply Bill (No.2) in 1992-93 because they had not previously been included in annual appropriation Bills; and the full year effect of new and enhanced programs which have commenced since the introduction of the previous Supply Bill (No.1). These increases include: Defence $326.7 million for the employer component of superannuation introduced into the department's running costs for the first time in 1993-94, and for salary increases; Employment, Education and Training $332.1 million associated with labour market programs and skills formation; Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services $59.2 million for implementation of the national child-care strategy; Prime Minister and Cabinet-ATSIC $57.1 million for increased community development employment projects and the Aboriginal deaths in custody funding initiathe tives; Social Security $64.2 million for increa-ed running costs for administering departmental programs; Transport and Communications $65.8 million for funding for transport infrastructure; $32.8 million for the Australian National Railways Commission; The Bill also includes a clause for the creation of a provision for running costs borrowings. This provision, which was first introduced in the Additional Estimates appropriation Bills for 1992-93, will be limited to $20 million. It will be used to provide flexibility for departments and agencies to fully utilise the running costs arrangements. Reports will be provided to the Parliament on the use of the provision. I wish to emphasise that this Bill seeks interim provision only for approved ongoing policies of the Government. It does not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 199394 Budget context, for which provision will be sought in the appropriation Bills. I commend the Bill to the House. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, this being the first opportunity I have had to do so, I congratulate you on your election to the elevated post of Speaker and I move: That the debate be now adjourned. Question resolved in the affirmative. SUPPLY BILL (No.2) 1993-94 First Reading Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",90
107,Mr WILLIS,Unknown,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks interim appropriations, totalling some $2,489 million, for expenditure on capital works and services, payments to or for States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and certain other services up to 30 November 1993, by which date it is expected that the Budget appropriation Bills will have been enacted. The amount sought is $1547.7 million, or about 38.3 per cent, less than that provided in the Supply Act (No.2) 1992-93. Of the amount sought, about $275 million is as a consequence of new initiatives not previously included in the annual appropriation Bills. The remainder represents payments associated with existing programs which have previously been approved by parliament, after taking into account the transfer of items from Bill 2 to Bill 1. Major increases in existing subdivisions include: Arts and Administrative Services $50.2 million for Commonwealth office activity; Finance $25.1 million for increased provision for natural disaster relief and restoration; Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services $79.5 million relating to a revised agreement with the States on funding arrangements for disability programs; Veterans' Affairs $18.8 million for the transfer to the States of the repatriation general hospitals; Social Security $30.6 million for compensation for the States for the extension of fringe benefits; Transport and Communications $208.7 million for an equity contribution to Telstra; and Treasury $98.9 million for a special assistance package to South Australia and increased fundipg for Building Better Cities, partially offset by a reduction in assistance to the States for the redemption of debt. In respect of new provisions which reflect new Government initiatives, these have been separately itemised in the Bill, in accordance with long standing convention, and include: Employment, Education and Training $5.2 million for expenditure for key competency measures for schools and $6.5 million for expenditure under teacher professional development programs; Finance $60 million for Qantas flotation costs; Health, Housing,· Local Government and Community Services $5.7 million contribution towards immunisation against haemophilus type B disease; Primary Industries and Energy $30 million for a contribution to electricity grid infrastructure; $12.0 million for a working capital advance for payment to the Australian Quarantinand Inspection Service trust account; Payments to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service trust account including $74 million for quarantine and inspection services, $20.3 million for community service obligations and $14 million for contingency funds; and Transport and Communications $15 million contribution to airport infrastructure improvements. As I indicated when introducing the Supply Bill (No.1), the provisions in this Bill do not anticipate decisions to be taken in the 199394 Budget context. I commend the Bill to the House.
