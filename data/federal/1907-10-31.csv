Mr HENRY WILLIS presented a petition from Helena Molyneux Parkes, Minister president of a public meeting held in Sydney on the..14th October, embodying its resolutions, and praying the House not to pass into law the high duties proposed in the Tariff. Petition received and read. DUTY ON POTATO FLOUR.",14
1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I have received the following letterIn the Argus of this morning we notice you moved that potato flour should be reduced from 3d. to £d. per lb., which was the old duty. We note the Minister struck the item out. Not 'quite understanding how we stood, inquiries were made at the Customs House this morning, .nnd we now find that potato flour is included as ""starch flours, dutiable at a j d . per l b . "" Therefore, the position is worse than ever, the former Government proposal of 200 per cent, having been practically increased to 250. We would point out that this potato flour is used for manufacturing purposes only, as far as we know. I wish to know by whose authority duty is now being collected on potato flour, seeing that that item was last night struck out of the Tariff, and, although starch .flours are dutiable, there is no authority for the collection of duties on potato flour at the rate fixed for starch flours.",14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I told the Committee, when we were' dealing with, the proposed'duty on potato flour, that I was willing to permit the item to be struck out, so that when we had under consideration the duty on other starch flours * we might deal with tbem all together, as in the Kingston Tariff.

3,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"When will the Senate's amendments of the Bounties^Bill be"" submitted for discussion?",14
4,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"There are two measures - the Excise' Procedure Bill and the Australian Industries Preservation Bill-whic h are more urgent than the Bounties Bill, but it is the 'desire of the Government to pass the latter as soon as possible, if it can be done without unduly delaying the . consideration of the Tariff.",14
5,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Tlh e consideration of the Senate's amendments should not take more than an hour or two.,14
6,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I do not think that it will take very long. The amendments made, by the Senate are not very extensive. MAIL SERVICE TO EUROPE.",14

8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I doubt that I can do so tomorrow, but hope to do so on Tues? day or Wednesday.",15
9,Mr EDWARDS,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister trying to provide that Brisbane shall be a, port of call for steamers under the new mail contract?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"When tenders were invited tenderers were given the widest scope for suggesting additions to the service which would render it more useful to Australia, and were asked to state the terms upon which they could be made. _ Full advantage has been taken of that invitation, and a number of contingencies are provided for which are now under consideration.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - In view of the fact that the Victorian Government has declared Tuesday next-Cu p Day- a public holiday, that the occasion is a great ore for the gathering of Christians from all parts of Australia, and that most members, being Christians, desire to attend, will the Prime Minister arrange for the meeting of the House then at half-past 7 instead of at half-past 2 p.m.? If he does .he will be sure of a auorum.",15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The arrangement made the year before last, when we agreed that Mr Speaker should take the chair at half past 2, and, if a quorum were not then present, resume it again at half-past 7 p.m., was regarded as .satisfactory. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It was not a fair arrangement.",15
14,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"We ought to agree either to meet at the usual hour or not to do so. - In my opinion, we should meet at 2.30 ..p.m. as usual.",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The circumstances under which we are now sitting do not permit us to weigh this proposal as we might in an ordinary year, when we might, be inclined to alter our hour of sitting. Any delay in dealing with the Tariff would be so serious that we cannot afford to lose even a few hours.. IMPERIAL CONFERENCES.",15
16,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Prime Minister upon noticeIn the representation of the Commonwealth in future Imperial Conferences, will he endeavour to arrange-so as to place these gatherings upon ademocratic and permanent basis-that those members, additional to its Prime Minister, representing Australia shall be chosen by popular election?",15
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as f o l l o w s The late Conference widened the representation so as to include Ministers generally whenever questions affecting their Departments are under consideration. The next Conference summoned upon the same principle will assemble four years hence. It will rest with the .Commonwealth Government of that period to submit its proposals for any changes in the construction of the Conference which it may ""desy-e. These', if approved, would, of course, be subject to ratification by the Parliaments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions. OVERTIME : SYDNEY GENERAL POST OFFICE.",15

Are any officers required to work from 8.30 a.m., or .9 a.m., until 9, 10, and i r p.m., with no time off except three-quarters of an hour for dinner and one hour for tea? 2. What is the highest amount of overtime worked by any individual officer in any one day? 3. In connection with a recent examination for two testing officers, Professional Division, were officers in the Electrical Branch refused time off after the teahour for a few weeks in order to study for such examination, although willing to work from 9 a.m.'until the tea hour, 6 p.m. ? 4. Is it a fact that one officer who was refused such time off after tea'was further refused-the right of appeal to. the Public Service Commissioner.

30,Mr FULLER,Unknown,That is the position inNew South Wales at the present time.,17
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is uselessto argue this question with honourable members who represent large centres of population.,17
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But what is thepoint ?,17
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The point is: that one State came to the assistance of"" another, and that the duties paid on imporand' tations of hay and chaff during the last drought did not aggregate a very large sum.  able member knows that a big deputation waited on the right honourable member Adelaide, when he was Minister of Trade and Customs, and appealed to him to in Sussex-street. suspend the fodder duties.",17
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have quoted an absolutely correct return as to the portations of chaff and hay for the three years during which the drought prevailed. It shows that the total duty paid was about j£,3>3°oI have put the plain facts beder fore honourable members, and do not inyears tend to argue the question.",18
35,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The return is the absence of information as to what the consumption was. We do not know to what extent stock-owners, for want of grown produce. fodder, had to suffer losses of sheep and C£lttl6» Sir'WILLIAM LYNE - That is a falconcessions lacious argument. The States where the drought was most severely felt obtained most of their fodder from other parts of the. Commonwealth. I was informed last night by a farmer from Tasmania that i the rainfall is - not.too heavy, this season will be one of the best that has ever experienced in that State. A good season is also anticipated in South . Australia, Western Australia., and in the south of Victoria. I do not think that there should the .very much discussion on this question. The present drought is not nearly so severe as was that experienced in 1901-2-3, and during which only about ,£3,300 was paid by way of duty on importations of hay and chaff.",18
36,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Illawarra) [2.55] have.listened with a great deal of surprise to the Treasurer's statement. His attiobject tude is only in keeping with that which' the Government have taken up in regard to..the farmers throughout the consideraout 'tion of the Tariff. Five or six years ago., when _ the. drought was . at its*, worse, moved that the fodder duties be suspended in order that the stock-owners of Queensfault, land, New South Wales, and other parts of New South Wales -' 'pf the Commonwealth where stock was dying for want of food, should have opportunity to obtain supplies for their Parliament! Starvingflocksand herds. That motion was rejected, and we are told lo-day by the Treasurer that it is absolutely absurd discuss this question. What is the p.osiamendment' tidn? In many parts of New South Wales Queensland there is a great scarcity of fodder, and many stock-owners there prefer to allow their sheep and cattle to rather than pay the extravagant prices that are being demanded by the Sussexfor street produce merchants.",18
37,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,There is a bit of a ring,18
38,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Under the fodder duties there has sprung up-in Sydney and imMelbourne more particularly- a large ring which is charging extravagant prices for fodder. The Minister knows perfectly well that when the suspension of the fodduties was refused some five or six ago the merchants of Sussex-street were making large sums of money out of useless in the unfortunate farmers.,18
39,Mr STORRER,Unknown,They do the same with the imported as they do with the locally,18
40,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Whils t the Government are prepared to grant all sorts of to manufacturers on the banks of the Yarra, and in other large centres of population, they refuse to make even a slight concession to the very men who are keeping our large cities going. Some conf sideration ought certainly to be extended to the stock-owners in the drought-stricken been areas of the Commonwealth. Whilst we are all glad that one State is able to come to the assistance of another which is suffering a drought, we-must recognise that the existence of these duties enables the dealers, in fodder to raise the price to the con-, sumer. In the Illawarra district, which is one of the most favoured parts of New South Wales, the price of fodder is practically prohibitive, and many farmers therfe are allowing their stock to die. I do I not blame people for trying to get as much as they can for their produce; but I do. to the people inTasmania, or else: where, attempting to make large, fortunes of our present distress, when, as a Federation,' we ought to be helping one another. I - Mr ATKINSON - They are not makinglarge fortunes, and the drought is not their but the fault ""of'the rotten climate' - .'",18
41,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"That is a nice, expresan sion to come from a member of"" a Federal Last' night the honourable member for Franklin,; so far from taking the same view asthat taken by the honorto able member for Wilmot, gave notice of an to suspend the fodder duties'' 1 for twelve months; and I should like to' show from some newspaper extracts what are the conditions - prevailing in some of the best parts of New South Wales. The Sydney Morning Herald, in the column "" On the Soil,"" refers to'the Camden and Pictoh districts, which are amongst the most favoured so far as rainfall is concerned. These articles are written by a special reporter ; and I quote the followingThe whole of the country embraced in the Camden electorate, extending from the mean angle to Liverpool, is experiencing the rigours of an exceptionally severe drought. respects, it is asserted that the districts have never previously passed through such a time of tribulation as is now being endured'. . . Mr. F. W. A. Downes, M . L . A ., who has had' years of experience as a farmer on an extensive scale at Brownlow Hill , unhesitatingly pronounces the present as the worse season during that period. His carefully-kept rain records for the last twenty years are especially interesting just now, and they may be accepted as a criterion for the whole electorate. They show that the last succession of good years terminated in 1894, in which year there was a total of 35-22 inches, while the average for that and tfie previous four years was about 40 inches. have only been two good years in the last period of 1900 and 1904, when the rainfall amounted to 39 and 35.8 inches respectively. In 1905 there is a record of 20.25, and in 1906 it f e l l to 18.08. This year to date only 10 inches have been vouchsafed, and of this only 1 inch has fallen during the past four months. A very serious aspect of this continued absence of adequate replenishing supplies of moisture is that the ground has never been thoroughly saturated for three years, and the water supply has generally become more and more limited. The creeks upon which farmers away from the river frontages have been dependent have stopped running, and in most instances the large holes in the teds of these' watercourses have also dried up. . . . The dairy cows and other stock, as a general thing, look better than might be, expected. This is entirely owing to the careful way they have been nursed by their owners. It has entailed great expense"", but hand-feeding has been followed without intermission practically the whole of the year, and, generally speaking, the stock have not been allowed to get into hopelessly low condition. How much longer this can be kept up is the problem. Many previously prosperous farmers, who have done a good deal to make the district what it was at its best, have exhausted their resources and their credit. The immediate future for such looks dark indeed. - I should now like to direct attention South Coast district, in - regard to which the special reporter saysMost doleful news come from the South Each item tells a more distressing tale than last, and the farmer one meets in the city is almost unable to describe the condition of affairs in his district. At sales of fodder every day South Coast farmers are regular buyers, and they are called upon to pay high prices for very poor stuff. Mr Fuller. I do not know whether that was Tasmanian - fodder, but I know from experience that some of the stuff offered forsale is very poor indeed. Last, week' prices as high as j£6 ios. per ton were paid in Sussex-street> Sydney; and it will be admitted that that is a pretty high price. If they do not buy, their good cattle must starve to death, and it is an open question as to which policy is likely to result in the greatest loss. In several In other worjds, the question is whether the greater loss is involved in buying fodder or in allowing the cattle to die. Honourable members 'know that in the South Coast and Camden districts was originated what has proved to be a great national industry in New South Wales and parts of Queensland. The finest herds of dairying cattle' in the world at the present time have been gathered together there; and those herds are now in danger owing to dairy farmers not being in a position to pay the high prices asked for fodder. There",18
42,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,They must be very valuable herds if they are not worth buying fodder for !,19
43,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The honourable member is one of those Victorian representatives who have not the slightest .appreciation of what a real drought is. The honourable member, and others who live in the Western District of Victoria, have no idea what a country becomes when there is no grass with which to feed the cattle. The Government ought to be alive to the national importance of. the position, and do their best to assist the farmers and others under the present distressing circumstances. Time after time in France, Germany, and other highly-protected countries, duties have been suspended in national emergencies; and we ought to remember that our flocks and herds - the basis of one of our great primary industries-hav e made Australia what she is at the present time. We must remember that the manufactures of Melbourne, Sydney, and other places are not responsible for Australia's greatness.",19
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"How wil l this little to the duty hurt the primarv industries? ' Mr FULLER - An honourable member, with the vast experience of the honourable Coast. member for Swan, asks how the absence of the fodder will hurt the primary industries. .",19
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We . never import anv fodder, or, at any rate, very little.",19
46,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"How can fodder be im* ported, when, in addition to the cost of freight,' there isa duty of £ 1 per ton ?",19
47,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Surely Australia can grow enough hay and chaff for its own needs ?,20
48,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"In New Zealand, from which I suppose our supplies would largely come, there is great scarcity.; and I contend that, in a time of stress such as the present, the world's markets ought to be open to us. I sincerely trust that the Committee will see their way clear to give our producers an opportunity to obtain fodder at the cheapest possible rate.",20
49,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [3.10]. - We all sympathize with the unfortunate producers who are suffering from the drought; and I quite agree with the honourable member for Illawarra that, having entered Federation, it is Our duty to help one another. But there is quite enough fodder in Australia at the present time to supply all the requirements of the Commonwealth. Honourable members who are opposed to these duties would prefer the outsider to get the money rather than that the enhanced prices should benefit those within Australia.",20
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is an absurd statement, in which there is not a tittle truth.",20

54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall do so in two minutes after the honourable member has we must do so for every section. concluded.,20
55,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No evidence has been brought before us to show that Auswho, tralia cannot supply its own requirements in this respect. I regret that prices are so high; but I remind honourable members that if fodder be brought from same prices will have to be paid to the same ring referred to by the honourable member for Illawarra. I am tired of hypocritical sentimentalism honourable members like the honourable member for Franklin. Only yesterday that honourable member voted for a duty on potatoes ; and yet, in one mining district alone in South Australia, 1,400 miners have been dismissed, in addition to many hundreds of men formerly employed by the Tasmanian Mining Company, who carry on operations in the same State. Surely we ought to have as much consideration for starving miners as we have for those who did so well up to the time of the drought, and who should now be able to afford to pay better prices for fodder. I am assured that in the Wimmera District ios. a head was received for lambs this season; and those who sell at such a price ought to be able to pay a little more than formerly for their-food stuffs.  see what the price of lambs was yesterday ?",20
56,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The question is not the price of lambs, but whether sheep and cattle can be fed. I am sorry that sheep should be sold at such an enormous sacrifice as at present, but, at the same time, I cannot see how the suspension of of the duty would help in this matter. We have only a partial drought now, but we may have a complete drought in the followI ing year, while under the suggestion of the sughonorable member for Franklin the duties be suspended for only one year from",20
57,Mr REID,Unknown,But there could be a susthe farmer pension for another vear.,20
58,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We might suspend the duties for twelve months, as suggested, and find the following year quite a one; and we should then hear the what the farmers would have to say about the abolition of protection from outside competition. The duty is a mere bagatelle, as proved by the figures quoted by Treasurer, and it will not affect the suffering producer. If we suspended the duties for one section of the community The first we ought to protect are men like miners, who live from hand to mouth, and whether seasons be good or bad, cannot save a single shilling.",20
59,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The honourable member is all the time clapping duties on the comabroad, the modities used by the miners. Mr HUTCHISON! - Exact]v , and I do so for the benefit of the miners, who the have shown that they know protection is indulged in by for their good.",20
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not agree withdid. that.,21
61,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The miners of Western Australia have passed resolutions in favour of protection, because they know it is better to employ our own people than toemploy other people. I desire to be a real friend of the farmer; and I contend that we ought not, simply because there is a partial and slight drought, taking the Commonwealth as a whole, to abolish a duty which has ""been a vast advantage to him in the past.  thousands of people.",21
62,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The honourable member has not shown that taking off the duty will have the effect he anticipates.  not shown that the retention of the duty will help these people.,21
63,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I have done so. I have stated that the duty, in good times, gives enormous benefit to the producer. A majority of this Parliament would never have been induced to impose the duty unless it would be of benefit. I object to this attempt to deal with the producer in a different way from that in which other sections of the community are dealt with. Some honourable members appear to forget that when the producers experience bad t-imes the manufacturers also feel them. Yet no proposal is made to help the latter class. So long as our primary industries receive all sorts of concessions it seems that our secondary industries may go to the wall. °",21
64,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member ought to be ashamed of himself to talk like that.,21
65,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Of course, I recognise that, in endeavouring to get this duty remitted, the honourable member for Illawarra is acting quite consistently. is endeavouring to mislead the farmer mere sentiment.",21
66,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"If the honourable member visited the drought-stricken areas, he would not say that my objection to the duty was based upon sentiment.",21
67,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I have just as imported' much sympathy with the farmer as has the' honourable member, but until it has been proved that we do not grow sufficient fodthat der for our own stock requirements we ought not to interfere with the operation of this duty. Referencehas been made, to the formation of a ring in fodder. am sorry to say that it is only because not get sufficient support from honourable members upon the opposite side of the chamber that the existence of rings in the Commonwealth is permitted.",21
68,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable member's party is giving them a show all the time.,21
69,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That is the opinion of the right honourable member. The difference between honourable members upon the other side of the chamber and myself is that I prefer to assist a ring which is inside the Commonwealth to one which is outside of it, whereas they are content to support, rings both inside andoutside the Commonwealth. I am satisfied that the Committee will insist upon the retention of this duty.",21

In a deEate of this character, honourable members ought not to attribute all sorts of callousand unworthy motives to those who occupy seats upon the opposite side of the chamber, las the honourable member for Hindmarsh has done.

72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member did. He declared that we were willing to allow the manufacturers to go to the wall so long as the interests of the primary producers were safeguarded. I make bold to say that there is more genuine . sympathy with the bond fide manufacturer to be found upon this side of the chamber than there is to be found upon the other side.,21

74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable He member has spoken' with so much confiby dence because he has only viewed one side of this question. In the same way the Treasurer has regarded'"" .this supremely important matter to Australia from only one aspect. He has quoted figures to show that during times of drought we have not very much fodder, but that during such periods there have been large Inter-State transfers of fodder. He has argued we have no need to remit the proposed duty, because we have sufficient fodder to meet all our requirements. If his statement be accurate, how is it that, we have F witnessed such, a positive holocaust upon we the bare and barren fields of Australia? I could understand the Treasurer's argument had we been able to keep all our stock alive. But the fact is that after we have exhausted our supplies, after we have imported all that we can afford to purchase, .millions of sheep have perished for want of fodder. Their owners were unable to purchase it at a price which would permit of the stock being kept alive. Does - not the Treasurer see that the moment fodder touches an unreasonable price our stock must die? That is the point. It is not a question of what movements of an Inter-State character may have taken place during times of drought in the matter of fodder or grain supplies. pends upon the price which has to be paid for these supplies, and whether it has paid the stock-owners to keep their starving stock alive. The figures of Coghlan tell their own sad tale of what the price of fodder must have been in those years. Treasurer desired to present the Committee with a complete statement of the case, he would have told us what were the average prices which ruled for fodder during the drought years. We should then have been able to draw our own inferences. statistics Coghlan points out that during the ten years prior to 1903 there had been more or less of drought conditions obtaining in Australia. Owing to the difficulty experienced in feeding our live stock, there was a decrease in the number of our sheep from 1.06,000,000 to 55,000,000.. In other words, half our sheep died during those years. That is the answer to all the twaddle which is talked about there being sufficient fodder in Australia to keep our starving stock alive.",21
75,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"If fodder had been sheep alone. only half the price, the stock would still - have died. - Mr WATSON - A lot of stock would not were operative? have been saved if fodder had been at the lowest possible price upon the coast.",22
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"^I am .not suggesting that all of the stock which perished would have been' saved, but I do say that the death-roll would have been very less if cheap fodder instead of dear der had been obtainable.",22
77,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Where would the honourable member get cheap fodder ?,22
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member said just' now that we had plenty of fodder for all our stock requirements Australia. ' I have quoted figures . that during the ten years prior t more than half our sheep died. If we had all those sheep today we should be millions sterling richer than we are. Is it not-strange that those honourable members who are most demonstrative in this debate represent portions of Australia which are particularly well off in the matter of fodder for stock? The honourable member for Hindmarsh hails from a State which is enjoying most favourable conditions just now. The honourable member for Wannon, who has just left the chamber, and who has been interjecting that it is unnecessary to remit the proposed duty upon fodder, represents one of the most favoured conEverything de- stituencies in Australia, where, I believe, at the present time the. cattle are nearlyhidden in the fulness of the growth which obtains.",22

But the fact remains that in the remote portions of the continent there exists a state of drought and disaster.

112,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Riverina) [3.40] When last this question was discussed in a former Parliament, the circumstances were different from those which at present exist; the Tariff having been passed, and Parliament having no right, by remitting duties, to discriminate between the States. South Wales asked for the remission of the duties, and the Prime Minister did all he could to persuade the authorities of the other States to agree to their suspension for a certain period; but three or four of them refused to do so. To-day, however, Parliament is engaged in framing a new Tariff, and can determine whether the proposed duty should be agreed to, and, if so, when it should come into force. I am not in favour of entirely removing the duty on hay and chaff, nor do I think it necessary to suspend it for twelve months; I think that its suspension for six months would be sufficient. According to a New South Wales official of high repute, who has given great attention to the cycle theory, we 'shall next year enter upon a really first-class season, to be followed by several others. who know the central parts of that Statethe Riverina district-ar e aware that rain, to be of value, must f all at certain periods of the year. Just now, unless it were excessively heavy, and were to be followed by slight showers a few days later, it would be worse than useless. I plead with the representatives of the States which are more fortunately situated at the present time than are New South Wales and Queensland.  should plead with the Minister.",24
113,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I plead with him, too; but he is in the hands ofr the ComThe mittee, which must decide this matter. I ask honourable members to consider the special circumstances of the case. No one can deny the seriousness of the present drought. During the last drought the loss of stock-was enormous. No doubt some loss was inevitable, but a great deal more stock would have been saved had fodder been easily obtainable.",24
114,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Whenc e could fodder be imported ?,24
115,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Chiefl y from New Zealand. According to the Minister's statement, the revenue paid on importations I of hay and chaff amounted to only^3,67o. During the last drought, although hay and chaff were exceedingly dear, as they are now, cereals were much cheaper than they are at present, and were used-whea t especially-for keeping animals alive, so many ounces or pounds being allowed p.er animal. As the Committee has agreed to the duty on cereals, we can give relief only by suspending the operation of the proposed duty on hay and chaff. I ask the representaNew tives of South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania to remember that the drought will affect not only the large pastoralists; farmers are also suffering. Surely the farmers in the more favoured parts of the Commonwealth should be prepared to forego this protection for a time, in order that, their less fortunate brothers in the drought-stricken areas may be benefited. The honourable member for Parramatta quoted from Coghlan figures showing that as the result of the last drought the sheep of New South Wales were reduced from 63,000,000 to about 30,000,000. After the breaking up of that drought the difficulty of obtaining stock was so great that small farmers had to pay as much as 25s. and 30s. per head for breeding ewes. At the present time, in Those consequence of the dry season, ewes which four or five months ago were selling at 25s. per head in Riverina are now being sacrificed at 2s. per head in the Melbourne market, because of the inability of their owners to obtain fodder for them. In this connection the farmers are not producers but consumers; many of them are compelled to purchase hay - and chaff to keep alive not only their sheep and cattle but the horses which they must employ to put in another crop. Their position is very serious, and since we now have an opportunity to come to their assistance we might fairly agree to a suspension of» this duty. But instead of suspending it, as proposed by the honourable member for Franklin, for twelve months, I think it would be better to move that the suspension should extend until ist May, 1908. I am hopeful that a further suspension will not be necessary, but if at the end. of the period I have mentioned the drought has not broken up we shall be able to take a more drastic step. The honourable member for Parramatta, when referring to the high prices of hay and chaff, forgot to mention that those prices are being obtained not by the producers but by some merchants who have cornered our fodder supplies. As a matter of fact, chaff in Adelaide is selling at from £ 3 5s. to £ 3 ios. per ton, whereas in Sydney those prices have been nearly doubled. This shows that a corner has been formed in New South Wales. T should like to aim a blow at the Combine.' There is no warrant whatever for anything like the prices now being demanded. A few men have manipulated the market, and, having cornered chaff and hay, say in effect to the purchaser, ""These are our prices, and you must pay them.""",24
116,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I doubt whether free imports would correct the trouble.,25
117,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"They would not entirely correct the trouble, but they would tend to minimize it.",25
118,Mr WATSON,Unknown,During the last big drought cargoes of grain stuff entering Sydney Harbor could not find a purchaser except at the ring's prices.,25
119,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"That is so, but if the duties were suspended it would be possible for farmers to obtain supplies direct from other places. On the occasion of the last drought many stock-owners in the drought-stricken areas of New South Wales were able to shift their flocks to the eastern part of that State, where good supplies of grass were obtainable at a fair price. _ At the same time those in the drought-stricken areas of Victoria removed their flocks to the southern part of the State', where grass lands could be leased at a reasonable rate. But on this occasion even the grass has been cornered, and exorbitant prices are being levied. I know of a case in which 30s. per acre is being paid for a six: months' lease of grass land. Such a pricecould be paid only in respect of a certain, class of stock. It would be impossible to lease land at so high a rate for the grazing of ordinary flocks. In the Deniliquin district, where stock-owners have been paying highprices for breeding ewes in order to raisetheir flocks to a normal level, we have today the sorry spectacle of thousands of sheep being driven to the freezing works to be boiled down for the little tallow Obtainable from their carcasses. This has to be done because fodder cannot be obtained at a reasonable price. It' is a national calamity that such a state of affairs should prevail. I intend at the proper time to move that the duty shall be suspended! until ist Mav, 1908.",25
120,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [3.53] - A few moments ago I said, by way of interjection, that the present high prices of fodder were due to the rotten climate of New South Wales rather than to this duty. That was an unfortunate expression, and lest it should be taken to indicate on my part a want of sympathy for the stock-owners of the States where the drought is being severely felt, I wish to explain that my desire was simply to point out that the present high prices were not due to this duty. The duty of is. per cwt. has very little effect on the price.",25
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It increases it to the extent of is. per cwt.,25
122,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I think-I. can show that it does not. The unfortunate occurrence of a drought, and not the mere imposition of this duty, has been responsible for the increase in prices. When hay and chaff are selling at £ 6 per ton in Sydney, there is nothing to prevent prices being regulated by importations from New Zealand or any other country having' surplus supplies. No one recognises more fully thanI do the deplorable effects of a drought on the people generally. I intend to vote for this duty for the reason that I assigned for the vote which I cast yesterday in favour of a duty on potatoes. When Federation was established, it was understood that the farmers would receive some protection, and, as I told the electors that I should support-the existing duties', I intend to do so. This duty is not of much assistance to the farmer, but since he con'siders that he is entitled to it, he can have it so far as I am concerned. In normal seasons it may protect our producers against importations from New Zealand. Instead of suspending the duty for twelve months, I think it would be better to give the Minister power to suspend it when occasion arises. No advantage would be gained by suspending the duty for six months if a drought extended over three years. In some circumstances, if we had to wait for Parliament to suspend the duty, all the sheep in New South Wales might die before action could be taken.  think it would be fair to place such a responsibility upon the Minister? If Tasmania were enjoying a good season while the other States were suffering' from drought, the suspension of the duty would be received with a howl of indignation on the part of the farmers of the island State.",25
123,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I do not think that the Minister would hesitate in such circumstances to suspend the duty. He would know that he would be fully justified in taking that action if the price of chaff went up, as it has done, to £ 6 or £ 1 a ton. The duty could be re-imposed as soon as the price fell to about £ 4 . per ton. We have heard a great deal about the existence of a ring in New South Wales.",26
124,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"There was such a ring in existence during the last drought, and it has never been removed.",26
125,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I am sorry to hear it, but that is no reason why the farmer should be penalized. I have been charged with inconsistency, and ""my attitude may afford another opportunity for the honourable member for West Sydney to play the part of Satan reproving sin. I feel, however, that I am perfectly consistent in voting for this duty, because I am acting in accordance with my electioneering platform, and, at any rate, in accordance with what I consider to be the dictates of justice.",26
126,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling). [4.0] - It is a recognised fact that a considerable portion of Australia is very frequently in a condition of drought, and, therefore, it is of no use making any arrangement merely to meet the circumstancesof the present year. In New South Wales alone, sheep were reduced by the last drought from about 61,000,000 head to about 28,000,000 head. that that loss extended over several years ; but in one year the loss was about 18,000,000 sheep, and if we value these at £ 1 per head, we get some idea of the tremendous loss, not only to the owners, but to the community generally. Doubtless by making fodder more accessible some sheep might be saved in time of drought, but, ' as a matter of fact, owners who are beyond the railway service do not attempt feeding, removing their stock, if - possible,, to districts' where there is grass. Indeed, there are owners of millions of sheep who have decided that in times of drought they will not attempt feeding, but will, depend on moving them, if it be possible, by railway, the State allowing a rebate of 75 per cent, on the ordinary freight I know that in the past some stock-owners, instead of taking their stock by railway, have moved them by road, and carted hay - for feeding; but much ir* that way cannot.be done, unless, of course, hay is at a very reasonable price. Those who do attempt feeding stock in times of drought are mainly those within 300 miles of the coast; and in those districts where smaller areas are held. Some honourable members seem to think that the farmers most affected are those who produce grain for sale; but, as a matter of fact, the stock-owners and wool-growers-no t big squatters with capital at their backs, but men in a small wayfeel more acutely any shortage in the supply of fodder. During the last drought these people made great efforts to feed their stock, seeing that they could not do much in the way of moving them 'about, owing to the prices charged for pasturage in more favoured districts. We have been informed today that as much as 25s. or 30s. an acre for six months was paid for paddocks leased for the purpose of feeding starving stock. Those who are fortunate enough to have such paddocks are now following the example of the ring of which we have heard, and are taking advantage of other people's sufferings in order to make profit for themselves. In my own electorate I find great extremes; there are places with very good pasture, and other .places with less pasture than could be found in Bourke-street, and any spare grass is eaten up by grasshoppers. I wish to emphasize the point that, unless some relief is given, either by a remission of the duty or the empowering of the Government to suspend it, stock-owners do not intend to attempt much feeding during I know the coming drought. ",26
127,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Quite so; but experience of the high prices charged during the last drought has' caused. stock-owners to determine, as a policy, that they will not again attempt feeding during drought. Many who did make, some attempt to preserve their stock during the last drought lost everything, not having sufficient capital behind their backs to cany them successfully through. We ought to remember that all over the world there is a threatened shortage of cereal supplies; and here, in the antipodes, our situation may be worse than that of other countries, seeing that in a time of great scarcity we"" should have to depend on ourselves, or,- it may be, on New Zealand. Our local supplv is sufficient under normal conditions, but,unfortunately, there is no great demand until what may be called a universal scarcity arises. So long as stock-owners can shift their stock to grass country near the coast they will not buy fodder, and, only a few weeks ago, when I was in my electorate, I found that the whole of the available railway trucks had been engaged for the purpose of removal. Only on rare occasions does a drought extend to the coastal districts; and the people of Victoria, as compared with the people of New South Wales, do not know what a drought is. In Victoria, a farmer, who has a tank capable of holding a four weeks' supply, thinks there is a drought if there is no rain for a month; but in New South Wales it may not rain for four months, and at one place there was no rain for seven years.",26
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There has been very little rain for seven years on the coast near Sydney!,27
129,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Jus t so. Leaving the western district, I should like deal with the circumstances of those who have dairy herds in the coastal districts. Here, the animals are of greater value, and feeding is resorted to:",27
130,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Where is the fodder got from ?,27
131,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am pointing outthat when a drought reaches those districts, it is a very serious calamity for the whole country; and the question arises whether the local supply of fodder is sufficient, and whether some means should not be devised for obtaining fodder supplies from outside. Our only chance in this respect is, I think, in New Zealand. .",27
132,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The prices in.New Zealand are as high as they are here, owing to the drought there.",27
133,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I have already said that our present prices are not due to Tariff influences, but to a world-wide shortage of supply; and I am afraid that we shall not be able to rely on New Zealand if the drought is going to .be as severe as some people suppose. In dealing with this Tariff we are, I suppose, legislating tor a number of years ahead, and doubtless a suspension o.f this duty might afford some slight help, though I am afraid it would not 'reduce prices very much. But although prices for stock were extremely', high (some time a.go, they are rapidly falling. The price of fodder is increasing, whilst that .of stock is decreasing, owing to the fact that the small owners are being compelled to dispose of their stock to prevent them dying of starvation. The position is a very serious one. A great deal has recently been said in reference to the establishment of rings and combines. But it seems to me that such organizations are inevitable under the social conditions under which we live. What is the complaint of the producer today? Is it not that the middlemansecures the major portion of the profit? Irrespective of whether or not a duty is levied upon fodder, a combination will endeavour to make all that it can out of that conunoditv. I should like the Treasurer to recall what happened when the memorable drought of iqo2 was in progress. Upon that occasion practically everybodv, with the exception of the Commonwealth Parliament, did what they could to assist our stock-owners. The Railways Commissioners carried fodder at freights which ' involved them into aloss, and moved starving stock from place to place at very low rates, whilst the Commonwealth Government collected"" from the stock-owners £500,000 by way of Customs duties.",27
134,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The States received most of that money back again.,27
135,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I am quite aware of that. It is our duty to assist the stock-owners in time of disaster, and to make the burden imposed upon them as light as possible. In mv judgment, the best way out of this difficulty is to place fodder upon the free list. If that course is notadopted we ought to vest in the Executive the power to suspend the operation of this duty. The latter mav nnt be avery workable plan, and I think that Parliament will be veryi loth to adopt it. Nevertheless our stork-owners ought to know definitely what is to be done, so that they may make their arrangements accordingly. I repeat that fodder should be placed upon the free list, but if it is not, the Executive should be given power to suspend the operation of the duty.",27
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.23] - The honourable member for Parramatta has made some observations as to the losses sustained by New South Wales during the great drought of 1901-2-3. I wish that he had referred to figures for years further back. I intend to show the Committee the losses of stock sustained by New South Wales when there was no fodder duty operative in that State. In 1891 New South Wales possessed the largest number of sheep that she has ever had, namely, 62,000,000. Bad seasons were experienced, and, as a result, in 1894, the number of her sheep had been reduced to 56,000,000; in 1898 it had declined to 41,000,000; and in 1899, to 36,000,000. Honourable members will observe that these losses were sustained before the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff. It will thus be seen that the number of her sheep was reduced by 26,000,000 at a time when the stock-owners were at liberty to buy their supplies anywhere, conclusively proving that the absence, of a duty had no effect in the saving of stock.",28
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I did not say it had.,28
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am merely emphasizing the point which I made previously. New South Wales has not since sustained such a big loss, in sheep. The operation of the duty upon fodder has had no effect whatever in that direction.",28
139,Mr JOSEPH CQOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [4.27] - In quoting the figures which he did regarding the losses of sheep sustained in New South Wales, the Treasurer attempted to convey an entirely wrong impression of my remarks upon this subject. What I said was that the losses in sheep were sustained in spite either of the .duty upon fodder or of the supplies which were available in Australia. I declared that stock died simply because there was not sufficient fodder to keep them alive. When sheep .are perishing by millions, it is absurd to impose a duty upon fodder merely for the purpose of making it dearer, and consequently more difficult to obtain.",28
140,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [4.28] - I think that the honourable member for Darling suggested the proper method of dealing with this item, namely, the placing of upon the free list. The suggestion that operation of the duty should be suspended is open to all sorts of objections. In the first place, it would really amount to an intimation to persons in advance of what the duty would be upon a certain date, a course of procedure which is opposed to all rules of Customs administration. Then, in the absence of a settled policy, there would always' exist in some of the States a feeling that an injustice had been done to them. We had an illustration of that feeling a few years ago, when a strong remonstrance was entered by those States which possessed fair supplies of fodder against the proposed suspension of the duty upon that commodity, whilst others were suffering acutely from drought. I would also point out that contracts have already been entered into upon the assumption that we should have a continuity of policy, and that, if the operation of the duty upon fodder be suspended, these contracts will be unduly disturbed. I hope that the Committee will remit the proposed duty. The Treasurer has quoted figures with a view to showing that under Inter-State free-trade we are making the abundance of one State minister to the scarcity of another. If that be so, casual suspension is destructive of the very object of Inter-State free-trade. But it seemed to me that he failed to that prove his case by the statistics which he cited. He mentioned that, in 1902-3, 6,065,000 cwt. of hay and chaff were imported into New South Wales. The local production was 4,866,000 cwt., making the supply in that lean year -10,913,000 cwt. In the previous year, which was a much better one, the local production of New South Wales was 9,452,000 cwt., but it and the importation amounted to 1,000,000 cwt. less than in 1902-3. What do those figures show?",28
141,Mr STORRER,Unknown,That there was less grass in the later year.,28
142,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Yes ; a larger quantitv of hay. and chaff having to be purchased by some of those hard pressed, to take the place of grass. A true comparison could be made only by showing how the supply of grass was affected in any two periods.",28
143,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"New England) [4.33] In listening to the debate, I have come to several conclusions. In the first place, has it is evident that no one could tell the Committee, with the expectation of being it believed, that the fact that millions of the sheep, and thousands of the cattle, are in danger of perishing, and that the primary industries of New South Wales are engaged' in a struggle which means life or death, is unimportant. But is it wise to be hvsterical on the subject, and to paint the condition of the State in such colours that the representative of another State was led to interject, "" It is on account of the rotten climate "" ? We are trying to induce white people to come to this country; but if .some of the speeches which have been made today get into the press of the world, persons abroad will regard Australia as a magnificent place, to keep away from. One of our newspapers, which is very Australian in spirit, has gone so far as to brand certain persons who have besmudged the Commonwealth as the ""stinking-fish "" party. I do not say that there, are any members of that party in the Committee, but I deprecate hysteria in this matter. Would it not be better to calmly face the facts? Western Australia is sending chaff to the eastern States; South Australia. has had a good rainfall, and has plenty of grass ; Tasmania has plenty of grass, and a large part of the continent is in splendid condition. But many of the speeches which have been made this afternoon might lead persons to believe that Australia is an abominable place. It is because of similar speeches in the past that the tide of immigration - has flowed so strongly to Canada, although no member of Parliament, notwithstanding that the country, for several months of the year, is covered with ice and snow, so that stock have to be fed, thinks of drawing attention to the circumstance. T consider that those, who have been fighting for the suspension of the proposed duty have wasted time. I belong to a party which stands for Australia first and always.",28
144,Mr REID,Unknown,Neve r for Foster?,29
145,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I am for fostering the native industries of Australia all the time. Honourable members have spoken of the fodder which, if it were not for the duty, would come from New Zealand to save our starving stock. But, on the 25-th. of this month, in Wellington, prime oaten sheaf chaff was selling at £ 6 5s. a ton, and could be bought in Melbourne for £ 6 a ton, whileprime chaff was selling at £ 6 15s.",29
146,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Everythin g is high in New Zealand because of the price of labour. - Mr Foster - Does the honourable member wish us to believe that, if the farmers of New Zealand had an immense surplus of. chaff tp sell, they would be gettin? these high prices? The high price of labour in New Zealand has enabled them to get better prices, but not famine prices. There would be something in the contention of those who ask for the suspension of the proposed duty, if we could get large supplies of cheap produce from New Zearland; but under present circumstances there is not much justification for it. Still, I should be willing to empower the Government to remit this and other duties if exorbitant prices were being charged by those whom tHey protected. I have no sympathy with those who charge the Australian public too much. I believe in protection because, by increasing production and creating competition, it tends to reduce prices.",29
147,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot produce rain. - Mr Foster - I am not like the honourable member for. Franklin, who voted for a duty of £ 1 a ton on potatoes and now asks for the suspension of the duty on chaff. If he were sincere, he would have taken similar action in regard to the potato duty, because he knows that potatoes are a good food for starving stock.",29

151,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I was not speaking for myself.,29
152,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Althoug h honourable members have spoken of the high prices of produce now reigning, and of them being due to the' existenceof a ring, they have not done anything to prevent the formation of such rings. . During the last drought a ring increased prices, and honourable members who were in Parliament at the time knew that that was so, yet, when the partu to which,I belong has tried to deal with rings and trusts, by nationalization if necessary, they have opposed it.",29

I shall vote for the proposed duty because, in my opinion, will not. affect prices. It will operate the advantage of our farmers only when prices are very low, and I object suspension for a long period. I would, however, urge the Ministry to suspend the duty if prices were unduly raised, and hope that later on, when we are considering measures for the new protection, or other means for preventing extortion, honourable members will assist us to make such legisAustralia lation effective.",30

Districts. of Queensland and produce in Queensland enough fodder supply the wants of the whole Commonis wealth, and are sometimes glad to obtain £ 1 a ton for it. When we have a good son the duty is inoperative. The honourable member for New England has referred to the existence of a ring. During the drought of 1901-2-3 I had the painful experience of seeing the incomes of the dairymen the Moreton district dwindle away from £20,000 per month to the vanishing point, whilst during the same time their outlay fodder amounted to something like £20,000 or £30,000 per month. We obtained a considerable proportion of our fodder from Victoria and South Australia, and although in. the first-named State it was selling at his fodder. £ 6 per ton, the stock-owners of Queensdrought land, owing to the action of the shipmeant owners, who favoured the produce merder chants, were unable to obtain it at less than extent. £ 1 4 a ton. The result was that we had to draw largely upon supplies.obtained from the Argentine and other countries. honourable member for South Sydney and ' the Minister of Trade and Customs drew a harrowing picture of the loss of millions of sheep in New South Wales in 1897, when certain stage. there was no duty on fodder. Do they wish to add to the enormous losses of a stock-owners by taxing them to the extent of £ 1 per ton'in respect of all the fodder",30

I hope that the Committee, in its .wisdom, will determine to suspend this duty.  greatly amused by the statement of the in Treasurer, who shed crocodile tears over the unfortunate lot of the pastoralists in 1 to New South Wales. No honourable member more familiar than he is with the difficulties by which farmers and pastoralists seaare assailed; but it appears that..because, 'he .has "" soured "" against the settlers in the country, he wishes to penalize the country which has penalized him. Even' sheep in the Commonwealth is a national asset, since in it creates work for manv people. Those who have been engaged in the pastoral industry alone know the value of each of our on sheep to Australia. During the existence of the last drought the Commonwealth Government, instead of coming to the assistance of the principal primary producer in Australia, slapped heavy 'duties upon My experience during the was that the duty of £ 1 per ton that the price of every ton of fodthat I had to buv was increased to that - Mr ATKINSON - What did the honorThe able member have to pay for his fodder? ",30
164,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"The duty becomes inoperative after the price goes beyond a '  the on every ton of fodder that we imported* from the Argentine. I hope that honourable members will endeavour moment to place themselves in the position of the men on the Iand_ who are struggling to save their flocks and herds, and that they will be prepared to extend to them the same consideration that most of them are always ready to give to the manufacturers in our big cities.  honourable member for Angas and a number of other free-traders have declared their intention of voting for the remission of this duty. As a protectionist, I assert that as long as protection is the settled policv of the country every person in the community should enjoy to the greatest possible extent the advantage of that system. The Government propose to continue the old duty of £ 1 per ton on hay and chaff, and I am prepared to support that proposition, because it is in accordance with the settled policy of Australia. At the same time, I recognise that there are peculiar circumstances of which we must not lose sight in imposing this duty. It has been proposed by the honourable member for Franklin that the impost shall be suspended for a period of twelve months, but the honourable member for Riverina has urged that a six months' suspension would be sufficient. As a matter of fact, it may be found necessary to suspend the duty for two years in order to meet the exigencies - of a drought. Our desire is to pass a Tariff that will stand for a number of years, but' we must not lose sight of the fact that after the Tariff has been passed we shall not be in the same position as we are today to make special provision to meet the exigencies of a drought.",30
165,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"We could next year, if necessary, extend the proposed suspension.  could do that. The Treasurer, a few moments ago, quoted figures whichi showed that, even under free-trade in New South Wales, there had been enormous losses of stock owing to drought. That is admitted; but, nevertheless, it is obviously the duty of Parliament, in a matter of such great national concern, to minimize the loss as much as possible. I shall vote for the duty proposed; but, at the proper stage, I shall move the addition of the following provisoProvided that when the wholesale value rises iabove £ 6 per ton at the chief ports of entry any State, the duty shall be remitted.",31
166,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The duty could for a not be remitted in one State and not in another.  any remission ought to be so made as to automatically apply where the necessity arises. I see no insurmountable difficulties, though, of course, there may be some in regard to details. The interests involved are vast; andwe should do our utmost to make conditions as easy as possible under the present drought, and any similar visitation in the future.",31
167,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [5.4] - It seems to me to be straining the principles of protection to endeavour to apply those principles to staple products, of which, as a general rule, we - have large surpluses, and the prices of which are regulated entirely at Mark-lane or in the markets of the world. As a general rule, any measure of protection cannot apply to such products; the only time at which a duty does apply is during a shortage, and when that shortage is naturally being taken advantage of by the shipping ring and produce merchants to regulate prices. I am prepared to admit that those to whom I have just referred will regulate prices whether there be a duty or not j but because they choose to make the necessities of Australia their opportunity that does not justify the Government in asking for £ 1 per ton out of the proceeds of the exploitation. I should like some measure enacted to check, such exploitation; but I confess I cannot conceive of any on the spur of the moment. I realise that the ring will be only too pleased tq place on the Government the responsibility for any increase in prices. I , for one, decline to take any share in that responsibility, although I admit that our action will not materially affect prices. I am prepared .to believe that the prices will be high whether or not there be a duty; but I decline to join in robbing the public. I believe in protection which stimulates industries and is accompanied by a measure to prevent the exploitation of the public, but I do not belive in a duty which enables the Government to assist in that exploitation. Mr HANS' IRVINE (Grampians) [5.7]. - I have heard some honourable members express sympathy with the farmer ;- but, so far, no such sympathy has. been shown by the Government. I am a fanner myself, of - and largely interested in farming pursuits; and I am quite satisfied that the farming community do not desire any duty on fodder.",31
168,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,Perhaps not honourable member's neighbourhood.,32
169,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"I do not think that the farming community in any part of Australia desire a duty on fodder. Australia is large enough, and sufficiently self-contained, to enable the farmers to put aside any such selfish desire for spoon feeding. I speak as a protectionist when I_.say that I do not think that any protection is required in the case of fodder. I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Franklin that the duty, if imposed, shall be suspended for twelve months, and I ask the Treasurer to adopt the suggestion.",32
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Neve r !,32
171,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"The proposal qf the honourable member for Franklin is in the interests of Australia generally. Who will benefit by such a duty as that proposed ? Certainly not the farmers, who, on the contrary, will have to pay an increased price in consequence of its imposition. The honourable member for Maranoa told us that if this duty be imposed he will have to pay an extra £ 1 per ton for his fodder. It is all very well to pose as the protectors of the farming industry, but who are suffering from the present drought? honourable members seem to fail l o recognise that there is a drought; but I can say that all through my district sheep are being sold from the shears down to is. per head, owing to there being no grass; while at the same time farmers have to pay £ 7 per ton for adulterated hay-chaff.",32
172,Mr HARPER,Unknown,"To whom is that price paid""? To other farmers.",32
173,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"It is paid to Melbourne produce merchants; farmers who, two or three months ago, sold hay for £ 2 or £ 3 per ton, have now to pay £ j for it in an adulterated state. In my opinion, this duty is not a protectionist proposal ;- because protection ought to mean protection to each and every one of .us. The duty is neither more nor less than a tax on the primary producer, and I am certain that the farmers do not' desire it .",32
174,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [5.10] - I am not surprised at free-traders opposing this duty, but I am surprised that farmers' representatives should desire to penalize all farmers because certain farmers in their own districts are suffering from drought.",32
175,Mr REID,Unknown,""" Penalize "" ! Then the duty does make a difference? in the Mr STORRER - Yes . If there is one thing that we require, it is some fixed policy in regard to protection. When Federation was adopted, it was on the understanding that all the States would benefit in some direction or another. We in Tasmania were told by the advocates of Federation that the Union would form an outlet for our produce on the mainland, especially in times of shortage. Now, however, when there is a shortage-for which we are all sorry-it is suggested that the duty should be removed, and that the produce which South Australia, Western Australia,^ and Tasmania have for sale must compete with proauce allowed in free of duty from other parts of the world. That, to my mind, is a very one-sided kind of policy. The undertaking in regard to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta survey has been carried out, and I contend that the equally binding promise in regard fo protection to Tasmanian industries should be respected. The honourable member for Franklin used very strong language when he described this duty as blood money, and asserted that Tasmanian producers were living on the mis J fortunes of others. The honourable member should be more careful about the lanMany guage which he uses. Farmers resemble other traders in this respect-the y sell in the best market for the best prices they can secure. I suppose that if a man had his house burnt down, and had to have it rebuilt, the honourable member for Franklin would call the money paid for the rebuilding blood money?",32
176,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I do not see the parallel.,32
177,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Perhaps not, but that and - may be because the honourable member looks at these matters from a different point of view. The honourable member for Parramatta told us that a large number of sheep died during the last drought; but that loss, I contend, was due to the difficulties encountered in conveying fodder to where the stock were located. I know that many people, in Queensland, for instance,, lost thousands of sheep because they were hundreds of miles from any railway, and if they could have got fodder for nothing in Melbourne or Sydney it would have been of no use to them. The honourable member for Illawarra suggested to us that' a number of valuable sheep and cattle in New South Wales would be allowed to die if this duty were imposed. stock be so good as represented, I am sure they will not be permitted to die because of such an. impost",32
178,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Has the honourable member ever f e d stock for an extended period?,33
179,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"I was brought up in the country, nnd know something of stock; and I am convinced that a duty of :is. per cwt. will not cause owners to allow valuable stock to die. We have not heard - honourable members complain very much about the ring which charges for fodder, a great deal more than is. per cwt. profit ; and I do not think so much noise should be made about the small duty proposed by. the Government .time of drought like this it is the small farmer who receives the greatest benefit, because he usually keeps two or three stacks from, one year to another, and is thus enabled at such a time as the present to sell at - an enhanced price. case we ought to consider the small farmer in Tasmania, who experiences great difficulty in earning a livelihood during moderate seasons, whilst his competitors upon the mainland are making fortunes. We know that large squatters upon the mainland make thousands of pounds annually ""during good seasons. Of course they sustain losses during bad seasons; but they can better afford to submit to a loss than can the small farmer, who has to struggle for an existence from year to year. opinion, if the small farmers were to combine, just as do the merchants, their position' would be greatly improved.",33
180,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [5.1.6] - I am sure that the honourable member for Bass in the course of his remarks made it very obvious to the Committee that he was really speaking against the better instincts of his generous disposition. After the way in which I stood by Tasmania upon the question of paraffine wax I am very sorry that my honourable friend does - not see his way to meet me in the same - spirit upon a much more important matter. As sympathy appears to be going round the 'Chamber, at no expense to anybody, I quite sympathize with one aspect of the case which has been presented in opposition to the reduction of the proposed duty. At first sight, it seems very fair to say that fodder duties are very seldom of anv service to the farming industry of Australia.",33
181,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"O r to the Government. But if the Mr Reid - O r to the Government. Therefore, it seems only right that when they would be of some service to the farmers the latter ought to get the benefit of them. There is a certain amount of truth in that statement. It is only some very large and pressing consideration that would induce one to pass it by. It is a melancholy fact that the primary industries-althoug h some of themare supposed to be protected-ver y rarely derive the slightest benefit: from protective duties. Mr TILLEY 'BROWN, - Because farmers are exporters.",33
182,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes . The moment the bucket overflows, it is: all ocean, and there In a is no protection, sof a r as the farmer is concerned. That has been the experience of farmers generally, and I quite sympathize with those, representatives of constituencies in which plenty of fodder is being grown, who say ""Year after year we In this have derived no benefit from a protective Tariff, although we have been subjected to the burdens which it has imposed. Now that a good time has come why should we not get the advantage of it ? "" If we could study the interests of our primary producers at the expense of all other i nterests we should say, "" By all means enjoy the advantage."" But we have to recollect that the drought conditions which obtain are so severe that they extend even to New Zealand. In my",33
183,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Ninety-five per cent, of the fodder in the Commonwealth was sold to hay and corn dealers long ago.",33
184,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable member for Indi ought to know a good deal about that matter. I should like to know if the statement is correct.,33
185,Mr TILLEYBROWN,Unknown,A good deal of it has been sold.,33
186,Mr REID,Unknown,"What I wish to say to the farmers, who naturally desire to get some benefit out of a protective policy, is that the state of drought which obtains is so severe that in dealing with this duty in the way proposed we know that we shall not deprive them of any legitimate advantage. Why ? Because the"" drought conditions have had the effect of raising prices by 100 per cent.",33
187,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"B y more than that. . Mr Reid - I want to put the position as moderately as possible. In dealing with this duty we shall not rob the farmers of any legitimate advantage to which they are entitled, because they will get the benefit of an advance of 100 per cent, upon normal prices,, and most farmers-whe n their brethren are suffering under such abnormal conditions as now obtain-wil l be content with that.",33
188,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,-How wil l they get the advantage of an increase of 100 per cent. ?,34

We must not take the Melbourne price of fodder - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The prices which have been quoted today were those which obtain in the metropolis. . Mr Reid - I am aware of that. That is quite a fair course to adopt in reference to importations. The farmers who .have hay to sell will enjoy a great advantage by reason of the drought conditions which obtain. I wish the honourable member for Wimmera to recollect the kind of man that the farmeris wben his brother farmer is in distress. When the farmers) in the Wimmera district were suffering from a terrific drought, the Gippsland farmers provided their stock with grass free of charge. That is the way in which one farmer treats another in time of adversity. learned of this incident today, and I am glad to be able to publish it throughout Australia as one of the best things of which I have heard, displaying, as it does, a real brotherly spirit.",34
191,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Is the honourable member talking of the farmers of Gippsland or of the graziers, because I know that the latter exacted a very heavy toll ?",34
192,Mr REID,Unknown,"I use the word ""farmers."" The generosity underlying their action is so splendid that it deserves to be published broadcast. Then, in the course of time, the settlers of Gippsland were overwhelmed by a series of disastrous fires, and immediately the farmers of Wimmera came to their rescue and acted in a spirit of similar generosity.",34
193,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,That is the real fanners' spirit.,34
194,Mr REID,Unknown,Such conduct might well be held up to general admiration. ,34
195,Mr REID,Unknown,"If a man is a Christian he is called a Socialist nowadays. What I wish to point out is that the farmers who have hay or chaff to sell will obtain a magnificent return by reason of the normal price of these commodities being doubled. Consequently, they are not being unfairly treated. With regard to the effect of the duty upon the owners of starving stock, do honourable members 'recollect the nights that we spent in discussing the welfare of the 800 young ladies who are employed in a only realized cigarette factory ? I remember that the honourable member for Hunter told us what a beautiful factory they had to work in , and of the admirable healthy conditions which obtain there. As a result we were induced to raise the Tariff in the interests of these female operatives. May I add that the lot of artisans in our big cities under a protective policy is, to say the least .of it, a much more enviable one than is that of those settlers in the country who have to battle with the adversities of nature, who are beset with pests upon every side, and who, just as they have a prospect of securing a splendid harvest, - sometimes find almost every blade of wheat destroyed. Surely we can exhibit as much sympathy with these persons as we extend to those who have a comfortable roof under which to work, and who are never afflicted with bad times, because people will always smoke. I suggest that the present affords us an opportunity to show a certain amount of practical sympathy with a great struggling I only industry. Letus suppose that a great catastrophe occurred to the manufacturing industries of Australia. Surely protectionists would come to their rescue, and assist to tide them over the crisis. I think that even free-traders might do the same without any sacrifice of principle, because calamities ought to wipe out all fiscal distinctions. I repeat that we have an opportunity of showing our sympathy with the producers in a practical way. Even if our action does not confer ""any good upon those who are - suffering, it cannot do one bit of harm. We have been told that if the duty be suspended we cannot secure chaff from any other portion of the world. In that case the suspension will do no harm, but it may possibly help the selectors and dairymen all over Australia. At present they are. suffering from a double loss. They are suffering from a lost harvest 'and from drought conditions which result in starving stock, even in parts of New South Wales which generally enjoy splendid seasons. But I am not thinking so much of the settlers in those districts as I am of the settlers in areas which are frequently afflicted with droughts. These are the persons to whom we ought to extend some consideration, and I would certainly suggest that the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin might fairly be adopted.",34

Furthermore, ask the Treasurer how is he going to apDly his new protection theories in this case. Is he going to impose an Excise duty of £ 4 a ton on the farmers who sell at £ a ton? I know that he has a large heart, effected a corner. and I ask him, therefore, to remember position of the wretched people who are struggling against the drought, and to bear in mind the disaster which will ensue i the splendid herds referred to by the orable member for Illawarra are decimated. Such herds cannot be built up in a lifetime. In my opinion, it will be a reasonable compromise to consent, to suspend the tations. operation of the duty for twelve months.",35

231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I knew that I could noi carry the proposed rate.,36
232,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"This is what the Svdney Morning Herald says about the as position of affairs in New South WalesThe condition of things caused by the want of rain has made it necessary to invoke the aid of the Railway Commissioners once more. We have heard much about the demand for more trucks lately, but in that respect the department appears to be hampered by its limited supplies of rolling stock. There is thus a difficulty in meeting the immediate demand for assistance, at any rate to a satisfactory extent. But in another direction the Commissioners have shown themselves not unmindful of the requirements of starving stocky and not slow to amend their regulations in special cases. One of these regulations says that the reduced rates fixed for this emergency shall not apply to places within 100 miles of Sydney, and it is obvious at once that there are excellent grounds for that limitation. In ordinary circumstances, when the country is visited by drought,- the parts within that radius of Sydney have no reason to ask foT special concessions. This is especially the case on the South Coast, which has been in the habit of getting a very fair supply of rainfall. But just now and for some time past this rule does not apply. The drought is exceptionally severe there, and we had a pitifu l tale to report the other day about the straits to which the Dapto dairy farmers were reduced. Dapto is on the south coast, about 60 miles from Sydney. The cost of hand-feeding is so high that they find it less costly to let their stock perish, hoping to buy more when the season changes and the rain comes. It looks like a cold-blooded calculation, but we are bound to believe that such a resolution would not be come to except under pressure of the direst necessity. If honourable members had the same opportunity as I have, to know the class of stock thatr is being allowed to perish in this way they would readily understand my feeling in this matter. In these circumstances the Railway Commissioners have seen fit to adapt themselves to the requirements of the occasion, and amend their 100-mile regulation. 'They are applying their reduced rates to districts within 25 miles of Darling Harbor, to bring the afflicted Illawarra and Camden.'districts witfiin the reach of succour. That step evidences the liberal .spirit in which the Commissioners construe their duty to the State and to the public. They are pledged to run the railwavs on a sound basis as acommercial concern, and free from political and local influence. But they are broad-minded enough to recognise that the .showing of a large credit balance at the end of the financial year, especially in these days of railway prosperity, is not the be-all and end-all of railway management. The whole community is made up of stockholders in our railways. They aTe meant primarily for the public Service, for facilitating settlement, and for helping the primary producer, who pays-the expense of running them. It is the Tevenue derived from him and the money he puts into circulation that - gives us our returns from traffic and passenger trade. aTe good with him everything is satisfactory.. But when the seasons are adverse it is but right that he should get all the assistance the railways can legitimately afford him. That is the position taken up by the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales, and in the circumstances I submit that if the Treasurer recognises how necessary it is that those engaged in the dairying and Mr Fuller pastoral industries-tw o of the great primary industries that are keeping the Commonwealth going at the present timeshould be supplied with fodder at a reasonable price, he will at least accept the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin, and agree to the suspension of the duty for twelve months.",36
233,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [5^49]-- I was very much surprised by the statement of the honourable member for Laanecoorie that we have in Australia enough fodder to tide us over the next twelve months. I think that we are face to face with one of the worse droughts that we have ever experienced. Even in some of the best parts of the Western District, where the rainfall is usually generous, the effects of the long spell of dry weather are being felt, and it is idle for any one to assert that we have in Australia a twelve months' supply of fodder.",37
234,Mr SALMON,Unknown,What supply have we?,37
235,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"We have not one-fourth of the quantity necessary for our flocks and herds. Those who live in Melbourne and other large cities, where there are beautiful parks and gardens that are freely watered and always look green and refreshing, have no idea of the state of the country. One has only to travel between Melbourne and Sydney to realise how severely the people on the land are suffering.",37
236,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"O r to travel between Melbourne and Bacchus Marsh. Mr WYNNE.^Quite so. The - settlers who recently acquired from the Government land in the Melton district, near Bacchus Marsh, will not obtain this year any return from their properties. They will have no crop, and they have not enough feed for a - donkey. I do not regard this as a protectionist duty; we might just as well impose a duty on wool or coal as levy a duty on hay and cha'ff. As a matter of fact, except during a drought, we export large quantities of produce. Are we not trying at the present time to open a market in England for compressed fodder? Have we not exported compressed fodder to Manila and the Cape ? It is only during When times a drought that we need to import a little fodder, and the farmers in the more favoured districts, who are obtaining £ 7 and j£8 per ton for their hayi, should be prepared to extend some consideration to their suffering brethren in the drought-stricken areas of the Commonwealth. We have to remember that this is a matter which applies not merely to the pastoralist but to the small farmer.",37
237,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Where shall we obtain supplies of hay even if we remit the duty ; Mr WYNNE - I do not know. As a matter of fact, we are sadly in need of oats and ought really to have removed the duty on grain. We shall be able to obtain - some hay from Newi Zealand and lucerne from other countries, and I do not think it is worthwhile insisting on the imposition of this duty for, at all events, twelve months. Mr THOMAS BROWN. C5-5 ]--When the drought has broken 3 and. the farmer has been freed from the anxiety which it entails, he will probably lhave time to glance at the records of - House, and will be very, much surprised to find how many friends he has in it. He will also be astonished to learn how many of. his so-called friends in this Chamber have any knowledge of the actual condisome tions under which he labours. If we could only send some honourable members to the drought-stricken areas in order that they might obtain a little practical experience the disadvantages under which the man the land is labouring, the probabilities that the farmers would have a few more real friends in this Parliament than they have at present. Unfortunately, we are - subject to periodic visitations of drought, and we can only hope that human ingenuity and intelligence will enable us to some tent to counteract their effect. Progress already being made in that direction, we cannot expect to accomplish everything in a day. The farmers are learning by bitter experience the conditions which they .must be prepared to meet from time to time; a very large expenditure of capital and labour is necessary to enable them successfully cope with them. We have in this connection a national problem to face. Until the States Governments provide large national reservoirs on the tablelands, the man way-back will be able to do little minimize the effects of a drought. During this debate we have heard some honourable members inquire why the farmer has sorted to irrigation in order to secure supplies of fodder. But those who talk in cellent advertisement that way do not realise that during a long drought, such as we experienced in 1902-3, and such as we seem to again have or ammediatelv before us, the water necessary cultural . produce. for irrigation purposes is not available. Our natural sources of supply are dried up, and it will be necessary for the States :vernrrienrs to take steps for the conservalocal tion of water in good seasons in order the severity of the effects of a drought may ? be minimized. Such an undertaking would be so gigantic that noindividual could think of entering upon it. It is a task which the States Governments must take up, and I am glad to say that they are beginning to see that water conservation is just as much a national work, as is the construction of a railway. The Government of New South Wales, in the construction of the Barren Jack reservoir, have launched a large water conservation scheme, which (Calare) involves great engineering skill and the emup ployment of a vast amount of labour. I refer to that fact only as indicating the difficulties with which the farmers have to the contend, and in support of my contention that' those who object to the remission of this duty on the plea that the farmers and graziers should provide themselves with supplies to carry them over a drought, need little practical experience. The effects of a drought visitation are intensified by the rabbit and grasshopper pests. Unfortunately, the rabbit pest is. ever present. of It is with us in good seasons and in bad. on But the grasshopper pest, by which we are are assailed from time to time, has again assumed serious proportions in New South Wales. Although by the exercise of forethought and the expenditure of a large sum of money a farmer may think that he has exmade sure of a certain return from his is land, even in good seasons he is brought but face to face with a pest which often deprives him very largely, if not completely, of the whole results of his work. Yet in face of all the disadvantages under which the men on the land labour, some honourable members tell us that the losses of stock to which they are now suffering are due to their indifference and. failure to secure themselves against the ravages of drought. The Government practically say to the man on the soil, ."" We ask you to grant protecto tion by way of high duties to the manufacturers in the cities, and we compensate you by placing high duties on the fodder not rewhich in dry seasons you have to ample import."" In this item we have an exof the benefits which protection confers on the farmer ! We might as well impose a duty on wool minerals as on fodder or any other agriSuch a duty never operates except in times of drought andshortage, when it is necessary to call for Gooutside supplies in order to make up the deficiency; and it means artificial that and increased prices. So far from being of benefit to the farmer, dairyman, and small agriculturist generally, it is a detriment; and the only advantage gained is in the shape of increased revenue by already wealthy States. So far as we can judge, there is bound to be a shortage in grass and fodder, unless we are favoured with an abnormally wet summer. The Treasurer has been very liberal in quoting figures showing the large decrease of stock in New South Wales prior to the imposition of a Tariff; but the honourable gentleman did not tell us that that decrease was brought about by the rabbits, which practically - drove the stock from the western district, and which are now operating in the central district where, fifteen years ago, its presence in Australia was not regarded as of much consequence. A further reason for the decrease is the discovery by stock-owners that it is not a good principle to overstock-that wealth is not to be computed by number but by quality. There has been a large expenditure in the direction of perfecting the sheep and dairy and other herds, and the animals, though smaller in number, are of considerably tetter quality. It would not pay, therefore, to permit them to perish in a drought season. Perfection has been gained only after long and expensive experiment; and if losses are occasioned by drought, they cannot be replaced as previously by merely breeding up numbers. Sir George Turner, when Treasurer, stated in his Budget speech, after the imposition of the former Tariff, that the whole of the financial arrangements with the States for 1902-3 had, to a certain extent, been upset, because of the large amount of revenue received in consequence of the fodder duties. In a list which is published in Hansard, Vol. XV., 2621, Sir George Turner showed that the increases under this head were, in New South Wales, £272,409; in £148,884; in Queensland, £68,530; South Australia, £5,584; Australia, £17,164; and in Tasmania,' £6,575- From these figures it will be seen that the fodder duties operated not only in New South Wales and Victoria, but over the whole of the Commonwealth, owing to the importations that were then found necessary because of the drought. There is no reason,, unfortunately, to suppose that such a duty will never operate again; the probability is that it will operate, and very speedily. In order to show that this is a revenue duty, I. have only lo refer honourable members to theBudget Mr Thomas Brown. Papers laid before us by the Treasurer himself when he made his Budget statement for the current year. I there find figures showing that the revenue derived from the grain and fodder duties in 1902-3 for the whole of the Commonwealth totalled £ 5 9 7 , 7 1 9 ; and in 1903-4 it was £ 2 6 5 , 2 1 9 . Then, with the recurrence of good seasons in 1904-5, the revenue sunk to £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 , while in 1905-6 it was £ 3 1 , 0 0 0 , and in 1906-7 £ 2 2 , 0 0 0 . Under normal conditions, the Treasurer expects to receive something like £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 from this source; and such a reduction, as compared with the receipts for 1902-3, shows the character of this taxation. If I cannot appeal to the Treasurer, who is so thoroughly imbued with protectionist principles that apparently he is prepared to ride them to death, I may, I think, appeal to some of my brother Labour representatives who are protectionists, but who, I hope, will regard this question from a sensible point of view. Is it reasonable that the whole of the community, and particularly the toiling small farmer and dairyman, or the man with only his horse and cart, should bear this heavy impost under exceptionally trying conditions? In good seasons, possibly, these men would not mind bearing an additional charge, if the duty then operated, but, as I have already. shown, that is just the time when the duty does not operate. It is flying in the face of facts to contend that the duty does not operate in time of drought, and that it is not a charge which falls very heavily on people who are ill-prepared to bear it .",38
238,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"Where is imported fodder to come from ? page Mr THOMAS BROWN - That is a matter for consideration; at any rate, this duty will operate as against importations. Victoria, I remind the honourable member that a in serious proposal was made to the State Goin Western vernment of New South Wales, by those who call themselves Socialists, that, under severe conditions such as prevailed in 1902-3, it is the duty of the Government to import fodder for the purpose of helping people who cannot help themselves.",39

240,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"The honourable member may know more of the matter, than do a number of us; but I think it will be discovered that there are sources of supply : otherwise it will be unfortunate for Australia. The Treasurer claimed that prices are not being affected by present conditions; but 1I have here an extract from the Sydney Daily Telegraph, which shows .Foxton, Colonel that in 1904, after the break-up of the big Smith, - drought, chaff was selling in Sydney, on Johnson; W.

275,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [8.15] - I oppose this duty on general principles, but I think it just as well to give a few details in justification of my opposition. The duty has been increased beyond the recommendation of i£d. per lb. by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and is £d. more than the duty imposed under the Tariff of 1902. In 1906, the cash value of the importations of jams and jellies was £8,270 odd, of which £8,125 represented the importations from the United Kingdom Right through this debate we have paid much attention to the products of the Old Country, and it has been urged that it is the foreigner whom we are to tax. It appears from the figures, however, that we have little to fear from the foreigner, so far as jams and jellies are concerned; and, in my opinion, no matter what duty we impose, practically the same quantity will be imported from the United. Kingdom, because the importations consist of special brands, for which a certain section of the public are always prepared to pay the higher PAIRS. price. We are told by experts that jams consist Of 50 per cent, of sugar; and jam manufacturers may, therefore, complain that they have to pay' an Excise duty of 3s. per cwt. My own opinion is that a duty of id. per lb. is quite sufficient, but I am content to revert to the old duty of i j d . I should like to hear some reason from the Treasurer why it is proposed to increase the duty on jams and jellies by 33$ per cent., considering that, according to the information we have received, sugar has decreased in price. So far as honey is concerned, I - regard the duty as a sham one. Honey is largely exported from Australia, and I suppose that in no part of the world is a larger quantity produced. The imports of honey during 1906 amounted to only £ 2 7 in value, whereas the value of the exports amounted to over'£1,000. I move That the words "" and on and after ist November, 1907, per lb., i i d . , "" be added.",43

280,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The importations under this head amounted to 381,747 lbs. last year.

294,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [8.43] - The proposed duty upon this article represents an enormous increase in the old rate. Under the former Tariff, the duty levied upon matches was 6d. per - gross of boxes, whereas the proposed duty is is. 6d. per gross of boxes upon the product of the United Kingdom, and is. 90"". per gross of boxes upon matches of foreign - origin. I would remind the Committee that there was a Chancellor of the Exchequer in a British Government who ' lost his office as the result of proposing a much smaller tax upon matches than that' under consideration. I think that the very' strongest reasons should be advanced before we agree to any increase whatever in the old rate of duty. I need scarcely point out that matches are used quite as freely by the poor as by the rich, and that the proposed taxation upon them would, '.in the aggregate, represent an 'enormous sum. Under the old Tariff, the revenue collected upon matches totalled £41,000 annually. I do not suggest for a moment that under the proposed rate the revenue would be increased in a corresponding ratio with the increase of the duty. If it did, £120,000 would be taken out of the pockets of the people of Australia every year. The probability is, however, that more matches will be made locally, and fewer imported, and I have made an' ! allowance for that, though I cannot say , what the difference between the present and future importations will be. I do not speak of my own knowledge, but I have if on good authority, from persons engaged in purchasing matches wholesale, that there is an arrangement of the London makers, General of whose establishment the local factoryTariff - U . K . is a branch, that only a certain output shall be allowed to Australia, and that for locally-made matches prices must be charged approximating, the selling prices of ... is. gd. 'is. 6d. imported matches duty paid. If that is so, the local output is not likely to greatly increase, while buyers will be charged higher prices if the duties are raised. I ...3s. 6d. 3s. do not know why the Minister has proposed an increase in these duties.",45
295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is recommended by the A section of the .Tariff Commission.,45
296,Mr FULLER,Unknown,No evidence was given in - support of the recommendation.,45
297,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The only evidence given was that of a Western Australia lawyer, who^ogposed an increase. 7d. 6d.",45
298,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No evidence was given by the trade in support of an increase, the only witness examined on the subject being a Western Australian who, according to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, is a lawyer. He pointed out that, under the old Tariff, the people of Western Australia, in 1904, paid £4,971 to encourage the manufacture of matches elsewhere, But that only £ 1 9 worth of our output had been sent to that State. Tfie proposed duties are really much higher than' they appear to be. The old duty was equivalent to 25 per cent, ad valorem, and the cost of importation to 15 per cent., the total being 40 per cent.; whereas the proposed rate is equivalent to 75 per cent., and the protection, adding 15 per cent, for the cost 'of importation, to 90 per cent. But it must be remembered that the boxes generally contain only between forty-five and fifty matches, and each box is-charged as if it contained 100 matches.",45
299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Eac h box contains on the average between eighty and ninety matches.,45
300,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"No ; from forty-five to fifty. It may be asked why do not importers increase the size of theii boxes? I believe that that has been tried, but that the public willnot buy the larger boxes,' finding them inconvenient. Therefore the duty, while nominally is. 6d. per 100 gross of matches, is really .equal to 3s. per ioo gross. ] Sir WILLIAM - LYNE,-The duty is less than one-tenth pf a penny per box.",45
301,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That comes to a good deal when multiplied the number of boxes imported. As I have pointed out, the output from the Australian, factory is not likely to be large, and no circumstances could it reach gigantic proportions. The wages average only about 14s. 6d. per head, which is perhaps not low, seeing that the employees mostly girls; but the total amount paid so little that it would be cheaper for community to support the employees than to pay the high rate of duty proposed.for the protection of the industry. that the. Committee will not agree to this proposal. .",46
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member is making an enormous fuss about a very small matter.,46
303,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"At the present rate of importation the higher duties will mean increased taxation to amount of £80,000 per annum.",46
304,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,The working man' will have to pay most of that.,46
305,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"He will feel it especially. We are asked to tax community to this amount to support . an industry which has notasked for tional protection, although the Tariff Comboxes ?' mission advertised that it was ready to hear the complaints of all manufacturers did not think themselves justly treated under the old Tariff. I move That after the figures "" is. pd."" in A, the words ""and on and after ist November, 1907 (General Tariff), per gross, 9d.,"". be indo. serted. I intend, later on, to move to make duty on matches imported from the United Kingdom 6d., which will leave the rate preference that which the Government pose. If my amendment be carried, rate against matches imported from foreign countries will be increased by 3d. per gross, while that against .those imported from Great Britain will - remain what under the Kingston Tariff. :  orable member for North Sydney has stated the case in a nutshell. The posed duties will bear more heavily on masses than any other in the Tariff. cannot understand why the Treasurer has proposed an increase. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Thes e rates are based on the recommendation of the Tariff Commission. ' Mr FULLER - Whic h there was no evidence to support.  by Tariff Commission only when it suits him. If all the duties were based on the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, the under' Tariff could be passed through Parliament within a week. Although the Tariff Commission advertised throughout the Commonwealth that it was prepared to listen to the are complaints of manufacturers, those inis terested in the making of matches did not the think it worthwhile to come before it.""",46
306,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"The only evidence was in I hope opposition to the duty.  the duty should not be increased. The duty on a large box of wax matches is exactly the same as is the duty on a small box such as tobacconists give away with a plug of tobacco. In Queensland and the western parts of New South Wales tin the boxes of matches are used. These come either from 'England or Belgium. Then we have the flat boxes designed for carrying in the pocket, which contain the same quantity of wax vestas as are to be found the in the large boxes. Can the Treasurer explain why the duty oh the small flat addiboxes is the same as that on the large who Mr DUGALD THOMSON - If the honourable member wishes to move an amendment in the direction indicated by him, I am prepared to withdraw mine.  Under the old Tariff the duty was 6d. per gross of boxes, whilst we have now the a duty of IS. 6d. per gross of boxes on imports from the United Kingdom, and of of IS. 9d. on imports from foreign countries. pro The Treasurer has not explained why he the has increased the duty.",46
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I have already said that I have increased it because of the recommendation of the protectionist section it was of the Tariff Commission.  and I fail to understand why a duty should probe imposed upon them. I have here a the statement of the case which should prove I of interest to honourable membersVestas are sold in the following three styles of boxes:Round plaid, containing an average of 45 vestas.

Matches used in Queensland and in the western districts of Wales are not manufactured within the Commonwealth, The consumption runs almost' entirely on the round plaid, save in the case of Queensland, where a fair proportion of the oval tin box is used-, owing to its.being 'a safeguard to the contents against the moisture of. the climate. .

The letter continuesAs the duty is levied on the basis of 100 vestas to the box,. and the round plaid boxes contain only 45 vestas, the duty, whatever fixed, is actually more than double the protection to the local manufacturers which it appears to be.

I ask the treasurer whether he, even as ai protectionist, can assert that this is a desir- 1 able industry to encourage in Australia? There are, however, other grounds onl which I may appeal to honourable members.' We have heard a great deal'in the courser of the Tariff ' discussions about combines ;1 and' the match, industry is in the peculiar position of .being a combine which is in; ' ' operation notonly outside Australia, but the inside Australia. Messrs. Bell and Com-, : pany, of London, conduct - the only locali - '- match factory in Victoria, and that firm is in combination with Messrs. Bryant andi May, not - only for the production of matches in Great Britain, but also, on .the t Continent of Europe. Here is strong evidence that the public of Australia have to pay according to. the duty. If a duty of .is. 9d. be (imposed, imported matches will be is. 9d. per gross dearer; while the same manufacturers will be able to sell the locally produced article at i d . per gross cheaper, so that the Australian people will have to bear a burden equal to is. 8d. per gross.",48
318,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Has the price of the locally manufactured article been increased since the imposition of the duty? ' Mr Wilks - No ; but the manufacturers have done worse, inasmuch as they have ceased to take orders, only completing those taken prior to the introduction of the Tariff.

321,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Where did the honourable member get it?,49
322,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No man would be more annoyed than the Treasurer if every time he read a speech in this chamber he was asked where he obtained his information. At times the honourable gentleman throws on the table compilations of facts and figures relating to, it may be, preferential trade; and I may say that, although I have a shrewd suspicion where his preferential trade arguments are manufactured, I have never been rude enough to question him on. the point. What I desire to .read is information supplied, not by any free trader, but by a Victorian Tariff Commission in 1895, ho, w m It will be remembered that when safety matches were made free of duty, the tax was left on wax matches, neither for revenue nor protective purposes., but to discourage their use, as it was considered that in this country, they were a. source of danger. It will be seen that the duty was proposed, not to protect Ihe industry, but to discourage the use of wax matches in Victoria. But fashion has overridden legislation; and. notwithstanding any danger which may attach to their use, the public insist on being supplied with wax matches. The report from which I have quoted says furtherThe result of the duty has been to encourage the establishment of a local factory. A well known firm of British makers has found it more profitable to manufacture in the Colony than to pay the Victorian duty. The tax has, therefore, had a wholly unlooked-for effect. It must, however, be stated that, apart from the establishment of this factory, the tax has failed as a prohibitory measure, wax vestas being so generally in demand that large quantities were imported notwithstanding the heavy duty. Again, let me emphasize that these are not statements - of importers, but of full blooded protectionists on the loyal soil of Victoria. Again' Taking all the circumstances of this industry into consideration, we do not think it is of sufficient value to the country to warrant the large loss of revenue which will follow its development; but we cannot overlook the fact that the duty has remained on vestas for a long period, and that directly it is proposed to take advantage of the protection afforded an outcry is raised for its repeal. In face of all this information, does the Treasurer really think that he has anything to fight for? Is the industry a desirable one for Australian women? Sir WILLIAM LYNE.^- I have already made a suggestion, meeting honourable I members half way.",49
323,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Unde r ordinary circumstances, the Treasurer's offer would be a very fair one. I understand it to be that the duty shall be reduced to is. and 6d. That is a very fair offer upon its face. The honourable member for North Sydney has made out a very strong case in favour of a reduction of the duty upon this commodity. He pointed out that the Government propose an increase in the old rate of more than 300 per cent. I ask the Treasurer whether he would like to see the women of Australia engaged in this industry ? Undoubtedly it is one that. we ought not to encourage. Under ordinary circumstances, the honourable member for Yarra, who is a strong protectionist, would have risen to their report, say- defend the duty proposed.",49
324,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I intend to do so.,49
325,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I am surprised to hear the honourable member's statement. Under ordinary circumstances he is opposed* to combines, especially if they are located upon the"" other side of the world. In the present instance there is a Match Combine operating both inside and outside the Commonwealth. Messrs. Bryant and May form the Combine in the United Kingdom, and they own the factory which is conducted by Messrs. Belt and Co. in Australia. The honourable member for North Sydney, who is a cautious man of business, has estimated that under the operation of a duty of is. gd. per gross of boxes, the Commonwealth will take about £ 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 annually but of the pockets of the people. But after making a most liberal allowance, it is clear that the amount of taxation involved would be at least £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . In view of that fact, I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment which has been submitted.",49

327,Mr COON,Unknown,"The honourable member read a statement from an importer, who protested against the imposition of the proposed duty. Then he declared that the match industry was not a desirable one to establish in Australia. He also asked: "" How can any Labour representative support the proposed increase duty ?"" I ask him : "" How can any Labour representative support the admission into the Commonwealth of cheap matches, seeing that the boxes containing them are manufactured by women who receive only 2 j d . per gross ?

328,Mr COON,Unknown,"No . Under our Factories Act such conditions could not obtain. At the London Exhibition held last year, ..women were seen manufacturing match boxes- a trade in which many thousands are employed. These boxes were rendered so limp with Daste that they had to be dried before a fire, the cost of which was deducted from the earnings of the women. I am satisfied that the masses of Australia do not to sweat operatives in other parts of the world in order that they may obtain cheap matches. What we require to do is to establish our own industry.  by giving them "" phossy "" jaw.",50

330,Mr COON,Unknown,"I want to remind the Committee that about two years ago Mr R. J. Jeffrey visited Australia to inquire into the conditions oftrade with the United Kingdom. He reported that Great Britain was losing its trade with Australia so far as matches were concerned, because foreign countries were coming into competition with her. In the match industry in Australia wages are so high that it will be impossible for it to become firmly established in the absence of an adequate measure of protection.",50
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If the industry is of a deleterious character, it ought not to be established here. . Mr COON - During the past five years no less than £ 6 5 0 , 0 0 0 worth of matches have been imported into the Commonwealth. If the Government will adhere to their proposals in connection with this item I will support them, but I will not support the imposition of duties merely for revenue purposes. In the United Kingdom the wages paid to operatives in the match industry average only 16s. per week, whereas the wages paid to adult males in Messrs. Bell and Co.'s factory average 35s. 5d. per week, females receiving 16s. per week. In of the Old Country, a woman, working in the industry in conjunction with her four children, is able to earn only about n d . per day. If we.are going to establish the industry here, let us accord it a fair measure of protection. I trust that the Ministry will insist upon obtaining the highest possible duty.",50

338,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"A l t h o u g h the Treasurer has complained that we are not get- ting on quickly enough, his interjections only cause delay. I shall oppose strongly the proposed increases* The honourable member for Maranoa has' very forcibly presented most of the arguments against the Ministerial proposal, having left me, therefore, nothing to say; but I should like to ask the Minister why he wishes the duties increased. He has told us that the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended an increase. No doubt if the Chairman of the Commission were present he Could give us a reason for the recommendation; but I cannot find any in the report or minutes of evidence. The only witness examined on the subject of matches was a gentleman who, from his name, I suppose to be of French extraction-Ceci l John Reginald Le Mesurier-wh o was also examined in regard to the duties on sugar, cocoa, coffee, bacon and hams, biscuits, butter and cheese, candles and soap, milk,, jams, pickles, sauces, rice, and other things. Apart from his evidence-and he opposed any increase-ther e is only this bare recommendationMATCHES AND VESTAS. We recommend the following duties :For each 100 matches or vestas, or part thereofA. Wax, per gross, is. 6d. D.. Wood, or other, per gross, is. 6d. The higher duties will particularly affect the working men of Australia, who use matches so largely. We have already increased the price of tobacco byimposing higher duties on it , so that tobacconists now no longer give away matches to purchasers of plugs, and the effect of these duties, if carried, will be to make matches dearer. Match-making is such a dirty and unhealthy trade that we should be well content to leave it to the people of Norway, .Germany, and other countries.",51

351,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am in favour of sing such legislation as will prevent the in this country of articles made by sweated labour.

352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Can . we prevent industry from being an unhealthy one? : Mr TUDOR - Yes . There ""has never been a case of "" phossy "" jaw in Australia, and the Inspector Of Factories has never reported adversely upon the local industry. It is said that for the sake of a small dustry we propose, to impose a heavy tax upon the working man. I do not suppose thatjthe average man uses more than one box of matches a day, but assuming that he does, a duty of is. per gross of boxes would mean a tax upon him of 2s. 6d. annum.  would the honourable member call upon him to pay if he had his way?",52
353,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I seek to find employin ment for workers in Australia, whereas gross. the honourable member says to the Comtorian mittee, "" Do not let us make matches here. Let them be made in Great Britain."" I intend to vote for the encouragement industries in Australia, where the condiployment tions of labour can be fixed. I am sorry that the Treasurer has consented to a duction of the duty. For my own part II - should absolutely prohibit the importation of the products of the sweated labour other countries. I d!» not think ithe people desire us to take advantage of - extremely poor conditions of labour - other countries. Why should we not make an effort to establish industries in tralia where fair conditions of employment can be.insisted upon?",52
354,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [10.5]-When the first Federal Tariff was under consideration in 1901 I moved that the proposed duty on matches of is. per gross of boxes be reduced, and intimated that I intended propose an Excise duty of 3d. per gross. The Committee reduced the duty to 6d. per gross, and the proposition that an Excise duty be imposed was lost by only five votes. Those facts constitute a fairly strong case against the imposition'of the increased duty. In order that there might for be no misapprehension, between the date on which I moved that the import duty be pasreduced and that on which I moved for use the imposition of an Excise duty, I saw some of the representatives of Bell and AusCompany, and endeavoured to put a view of their case before the Committee. Had the Excise duty of 3d. per gross been imposed the protection would have been reduced to only 3d. per gross. In these circumstances I do not think that the offer of the Treasurer is good enough for the free-trade secthe tion of the Committee. It has been mentioned by the honourable member for Bktman that a good deal of sweating takes place in connection with this industry in other countries. It is a curious fact, however, that in 1900, under the Victorian duty of inis. per gross, the wage paid in the local factory was 18s. 8d.' to the male employees, and 14s. 1 id - to the female employee's, or an average of about 16s. per week, whereas the honourable member for Batman tells us that under the lower Federal duty the per female employees are receiving 16s. per week, whilst the male employees receive so r 34Sper week. If labour has been protected under the reduced duty imposed by us, surely it will be hereafter protected the same way by a duty of 6d. per Evidence given before the VicTariff Commission in 1895, by, if I remember rightly, a representative of the local factory, was to the effect that a very of slight addition to the plant, and the emof thirty or forty additional hands, would enable it to supply the whole of the rerequirements of Australia. If that be so, fail to see that the imposition of the increased duty proposed by the Government of would give much more employment in Australia. The evidence was that at a total the wages cost of less than £3,000 per anin num the whole of the demand for matches in Australia could be met. In 1901 only Ausabout ninety-three hands, of whom sixtysix were women and twenty-seven men, were employed in the Victorian factory. If we prohibit imports we shall not help to abolish sweating in the industry in the Old Country. As a matter of fact, the sweating which takes, place there is not a to bit worse than was the sweating in the industry here in 1901. I trust that in the circumstances the Minister will have a little more consideration, for the revenue, which would be affected by the imposition of a lower duty.  there is one item in the Tariff that is more absurd than another it is this. There is no evidence to support it , and no attempt has been made by the Minister to justify it. For the sake of this industry, which at the best is a bad one, giving employment to only a limited number of hands, at an average wage of about 14s. 3d. per week, we are asked to impose a duty equivalent to i j d . per dozen boxes of matches - Last year, there was paid by way of duty on safety matches £ 1 8 , 0 0 0, or £ 4 1 , 0 0 0 on the combined imports of wax and safety matches. It may be argued by some honourable members that the local industry has tended to reduce prices. I have quotations showing, however, that from the outset the price of the local matches has been just below the margin of the duty. An increased price, therefore, has been clearly paid by the users. If I had my way, I should make the manufacture! of matches a prison industry. It seems absurd to tax the whole of the community to the extent proposed by the Government in order to encourage an industry which is chiefly carried on by girls, and which must ultimately have a detrimental effect on the health of those engaged in it. I shouldcertainly be prepared to prohibit the introduction of wax matches into Australia, since they are highly dangerous ; I could point to cases where lives have been lost as the result of the striking of a wax match. The old duty afforded substantial protection to the industry. The report of the Chief Inspector of Factories of Victoria deals with the number of hands engaged - in the Richmond factory, where match-making, as well as the manufacture' of fire-kindlers, is carried on. It is difficult to ascertain the number of hands actually employed in each branch, but I find that in the combined industries there were, on the male side, two employees receiving a wage of n s . 3d. per week, seven employed at 7s. 8d. per week, five at 8s. i d . , one at 17s., three at 15s. 8d., one at 16s., ""one at 20s., and seventeen at 35s. sd., or a total of thirty-seven. The female employees are as follow :-On e at 7s. per week, eleven at 7s. i o d . , thirty at 1 os. 7d., twenty-three at 12s. 3d., twentysix at. 13s. 4d., twelve at 13s., twelve at 13s. i o d . , and twenty-three at 16s. n d . ; (Meats, &c). or a total of 138. I arS anxious to know what the Treasurer's proposal is.

Surely we can produce enough pigs to supply our ment is madeown requirements. I am aware that the honourable member for Balaclava, although the representative of a city constituency, has large country interests. He knows that Messrs. Farmer and Company, baconreport curers of Ballarat, take prizes for their products all over Australia. But if we allow chilled legs to come in duty shall deprive a number of small farmers, who rear pigs which they hope to sell to report bacon factories, of the opportunity to make low. ready money out of their animals.",56

385,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"I think that there is doubt about the soundness of the meat. I Commission. have my information on the subject from' Melbourne bacon-curers, not from any one in Ballarat.

389,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [11.3] The Western District of Victoria produces that more pork than does any other part of AusWhat the honourable member for Balaclava has said on this question is correct. The firms who use these pork hams secure them in time for the Christmas trade each year, and they are our biggest buyers. Their representatives visit Koroit, Warrnainibool, Terang, Colac, and other centres where pigs are sold, and buy enormous quantities. They buy all we can produce, and give us a good price for them.",56
390,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Then the settlers should produce more.,57
391,Mr WILSON,Unknown,They cannot do so. Pig-raising is such a profitable'industry in the Western District that the settlers produce every pig they can.,57

"" Mr WILSON - I shall be willing to face it, and at the same time Ministers and their partisan newspaper. These preserved hams are introduced from New Zealand, where the inspection is more careful than it is in Victoria, only as the raw material required by the producers of bacon and hams for the Christmas trade, and no harm can arise to the pig^raisingindustry in the Commonwealth through these goods being admitted^ free. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has in this matter cast a slur upon those engaged in the production of bacon and hams in the Commonwealth, in saying that they are produced by a process that is injurious to health. They are not so produced. The hams produced by J. CHutton and Farmer and Company are as good as any produced-in any part, of the world.",57

402,Mr WILSON,Unknown,"There is no necessity for. that. The duty under the old Tariff was satisfactory, and we have to consider here merely the question of giving our manufacturers of bacon and hams an opportunity to procure the raw material they require for the Christmas trade.

I say that we uphold them, and are willing at all times to advance them. I shall not allow any man to decry a Victorian industry without contradiction. We produce as fine an article in this industry as is produced in any part of the world, and the remission of this particular duty would assist us to increase our output.",57
405,Mrs SALMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [ n . 8 ] - I am very loth to again address the Committee on this item. But in view of the amount of indignation which the honourable member for Corangamite has pumped up, some statement is due from me. The honourable member for Balaclava stated that during the. summer it was the custom of persons engaged in this industry to import from New Zealand a certain quantity of legs of pork which bad been treated by the cold process for the purpose of turning them into hams for the Christmas trade. I said that if pork legs were imported here during the summer they could not be turned into, hams for the Christmas trade, except by .what is known as the quick process, which consists of pumping pyrogallic acid intothem. If the honourable member for Corangamite chooses to . say that that is an. aspersion on the local manufacturers of hams he is welcome to do so. Every other member of the Committee will agree that I did not cast any aspersion upon f"" those engaged in this industry - If,Jsowever, the manufacturers, of. bacon-and'hamswishto be allowed to import i.pork free of duty, I say that'they are not entitled to a high : duty on the finished product, seeing that they are careless of the interests of those engaged in producing the raw material in Australia.",57
406,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,New England) [11.9] I wish to challenge the assertion of the honourable member for Corangamite that pig-raising cannot be profitably carried on unless the pigs are fed on milk.,58

408,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,"I do not wish the honourable member to mislead the Committee. Thousands of pigs are reared on the northern Dividing Range in New South Wales, and driven down to the maize fields to be fattened, and they are turned into excellent bacon.

432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,PaTramatta) [11.26] - As the Treasurer has agreed to postpone the consideration of the itemsand they are really the debatable items in the division-it occurs to me that we might reasonably pass the other items without undue debate.

433,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No .,59
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I can assure the Minister that half-a-dozen members on this side feel very strongly on the item.,59
435,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It is not debatable. Let us take a division.,59
436,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [11.28] - I believe that both sides have come to a fair understanding with a view to facilitate business.

437,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [11.29] - We should not go to a division without a discussion, on the item. It involves a great principle, and that is, whether we can produce the articles. There is evidence that we do not produce the kind of article which it is proposed to tax. We export to Germany the heavier article, which is made from the entrails of sheep. But the-class of casing which the Australian prefers is the lighter pig casing, which is imported from the United States. The imports and exports are fairly evenly balanced. The imports were worth £41,925, and the exports from Australia £42,915, of which £34,728 went to Germany. This duty will penalize the Australian butcher. It was proposed in the Kingston Tariff to impose a duty of 2d.",59
438,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,We will make it free now if we go to a vote at once.,59
439,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [11.31] - The burning protectionists are anxious to admit sausage skins free. According to them, Australia can produce electrical machinery the most complicated in the world, but cannot make an ordinary sausage skin. Throughout the Tariff there are duties up to 40 per cent, on the ordinary commodities of life, but the protectionists make the farcical admission that Australia cannot make sausage skins. 1 can understand the Treasurer, as a protectionist, being annoyed with his friends.",59
440,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The casing is not made. It is taken from the entrails, cured, and sent away, and a manufactured casing containing a good deal of impure matter is brought back.",59
441,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The protectionists in this House now admit that Australia cannot undertake the process of curing and preparing the skins. In the last Parliament, Sir John Quick and Sir William MCMillan agreed to the article being placed on the free list. During the discussion at that time, I suggested to protectionists a "" sausage rampant,"" or a "" sausage in the summer season,"" as a coat of arms. I shall vote for placing this item on the free list, but the Treasurer or Minister of Trade and Customs ought to rise and apply the whip most powerfully to the protectionists, ih this case are going back on their professo sions. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [11.36] If anybody ought to know whether there is an ample supply of pork skins for sausages obtainable in Australia, it is butchers of the country. I have here a document, signed by thirty butchering in Brisbane, who state, as do other butchers in country towns, that the local article very much inferior to the imported article.",59
442,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is not true.,60

445,Colonel FOXTON,Unknown,"As I am not a butcher, the honourable member probably knows more about it than 1 do, but I am voicing the opinions of men who understand a great deal more about it than the honourable member does. I have evidence that the men who are most interested in Archer, producing a palatable article protest most Batchelor, E. L . strongly against the proposed duty as tendBowden, E.

446,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea , Fuller, G. W. surer) [11.40] - The honourable member for Liddell, Brisbane has challenged my statement. I say that the imported sausage casings are not manufactured from the best material, and are very injurious. Butchers may say Coon, J. "" what they like, but we export the natural Crouch, R.

I have had to do practically with the Thomas, J. business, and I know exactly what casings they are.

449,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [11.42] I regard this as one of the irritating items in the Tariff. In the first place, imported skins can always command upwards of 3d. who per lb. more than do the colonial skins, that there is no competition. What the Treasurer has said about our sending away . the natural skin is hardly correct, because what we export is the entrails of the sheep, which the German and other people like the for the bigger classes of sausage. The butchers use all the skins that can be profirms duced in Australia, and are glad to get imported skins, even at a cost of 3d. or 4d. is per lb. more.

477,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [12.13] - IP that the Minister will not agree to the amendment. The packet tea comes chiefly from India, where it is put up by cheap labour, in packets manufactured by and covered with labels printed by cheap labour. If we deal in this way with packet tea, it will be necessary, to be consistent, to deal similarly with other items. Mr HUTCHISON [12.14] - I should like to see the importation of packet tea prohibited. Surely we can put up into packets the tea that we require. But little supervision can be exercised over tea imported in packets, whereas tea imported in bulk can be easily examined. Prior to Federation tea which was allowed to enter the free ports of New South Wales was not permitted to enter South Australian ports, being considered unfit for human consumption.",63
478,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The importation of such tea is prevented by the Commonwealth Customs Act.,63
479,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"When the amendment is disposed of, I intend to move' to prohibit the importation of packet tea.",63
480,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,If the amendment be carried the honourable member will not be able to do that.,63
481,Mr LIDDE LL,Unknown,"Hunter)' [12.16] - The honourable member for Hindmarsh contends that packet tea should be prohibited from coming here, because it is put up by coloured labour, but to be consistent he should refuse to drink tea, because it is all the product of coloured labour.",63
482,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Nepean) [12.17] - Some of the best tea that comes into this market is imported in 10 and 20-lb. packages. I do not think that we should put a duty upon it.,63
483,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [12.18] - I think thattea should be brought to Australia in bulk, and packed here. It is undoubtedly easier to supervise the importation of bulk than of packet tea, while we have persons who are trained in the art of blending, which needs special professional skill. The duty will not be. a tax on tea, but it will create employment.

484,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [12.25] -' I move That the following words be inserted after the figure "" i d . , "" in paragraph A :- "" and on and after ist November, 1907, tea in packets not exceeding iolbs., prohibited."" Honourable members will understand that this is not in any sense a prohibition of the import of tea,' but is intended to afford employment to our own people in putting up tea in packets, and in the printing of the wrappers and labels. In addition to giving employment to labour, the effect of the proposal would be to secure a better supervision of the tea consumed in Australia. I think it is unnecessary that I should say anything further in support of the amendment.",63
485,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I should to know if the honourable member for Hindmarsh is in order in moving this difference of i d . amendment. The original resolution submitted wasThat duties of Customs and Excise be imposed according to the following' Tariff, to come operation on the 8th August, 1907, at 4 p.m. Victorian time. I do. not think that prohibition or absobuyer lute exclusion of an article of import covered by that resolution. In the cirferior cumstances, I do not think the amendment' is in order.",64
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I submit that the in prices. honourable member for Hindmarsh is proposing a prohibition of trade, whilst the Tariff has been framed, not with the intention of prohibiting trade, but for the purpose of regulating and controlling it.",64
487,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Unde r the Customs Act, we can prohibit the importation of any article.",64
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In dealing with the Tariff, I think the honourable-member cannot accomplish his object in the way proposes, though he might do so by proposing that the duty on packet tea should be is., is. 6d., or zs. per lb., and reach prohibition of the article in that way. Mr FISHER.^- I suggest that the honourable member should notpress, his amendment in this form. Even if it can be so submitted, there should be some consider a-' tion for those who .have shipments of packet tea in transit. I am sure it is not the honourable member's intention that they should be compelled to send that tea back whence it came. in order that the packets may be opened, and the tea re-shipped in another form. In my opinion, the proposition is not in order.",64
489,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"It appears to me that to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh would be to open the door to the insertion of amendments of all kinds in these columns, and that there would be no finality to the debate. In the circumstances, I rule that the amendment is out of order.",64
490,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I might be able' to effect the purpose I have in view by moving to substitute "" 2 02."" for "" 20 lbs."" I>94]",64
491,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That would not have the desired effect.,64
492,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We should also have to omit the word "" not "" Since the Government are not disposed to support my proposal, and there seems to be some difficulty in the way of its acceptance, I shall like very reluctantly abandon it.",64
493,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,There is the ,64
494,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We ought, to br able to put up more packet tea than we have been doing, and an increase in that into direction would involve a great deal of printing, which is now lost to the. Commonwealth. Unfortunately, the average of tea has not the slightest idea of is whether he is obtaining a good or an inarticle, and the statement is made again and again that since the removal of the duty on tea there has been no reduction",64
