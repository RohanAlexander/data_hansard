20,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Hunter) [2.44] - The reporting of progress last night caused a welcome calm to follow the storm which had prevailed all the evening. mere words and bluster, and the roarings of a lion, were argument, the question of the duty on wire-netting would have been settled by the speech of the Treasurer. Fortunately mere force of delivery does not constitute argument. I am pleased that preference has been given to the consideration of the item of wire-netting, since it affords us a striking illustration of the difference between the two systems of protection and free-trade-the difference between the system of protecting our primary industries as against that of protecting our secondary industries. Notwithstanding the great importance of this question, we find that only two witnesses were examined in regard to it by the Tariff Commission. ' One of these was a representative of the employees in the wire-netting industry, whilst the other was a pastoralist representing employers in one of our chief primary industries. It is singular that where such large interests apparently were at stake, only an employee in the wire netting industry came forward to give evidence. During the progress of this debate the president of the company concerned has been in the galleries, but when the costly Commission sat in Sydney no representative of the employers appeared before it. The employee who gave evidence certainly presented a written statement, which put his case clearly and concisely, but as soon as his evidence was submitted to the crucial test of cross-examination his arguments fell to the ground. Speaking 011 behalf of the employees, he complained that he was working only half-time, that he was making not more than £ 2 2s. per week, and that, as a matter of fact, all the workers in the industry were sadly underpaid. Nevertheless, he would not admit that any employ^ was earning less than 30s. per week. We have been told during this debate that there are between 500 and 600 employees in the industry, and the amount which the Treasurer said last night was paid in wages by the company would not provide for an average wage of more than 28s. per week. It is impossible to reconcile the statement of the employ^ with that made by the Treasurer.",17
21,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Was it not said last night that there were 400, not 600, employees in the industry ? Mr - LIDDELL - I think that an honoiable member of the Labour Party said that there were something like 600 employed.",17
22,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The Treasurer said If there were 400.,17
23,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Eve n if that be so, the amount said to be distributed by way of wages by the company would not be sufficient to provide all these employees with what the honourable member would describe as a living wage.",17
24,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Quite so, but how could more be paid under free-trade?",17
25,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"There is no reason why the company should not succeed under free-trade conditions. How could a business concern expect to succeed when it entered the market bearing a burden in the - shape of a liability of .£100,000 to be paid off? In such circumstances, how could we expect its employees to be properly treated, and the industry to be satisfactorily carried on ? I think that the business must have been badly managed.",17
26,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The fact that the company lost ,£100,600 under free-trade conditions does not suggest that it could carry on under free-trade.",17
27,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I claim that the losses .incurred by the company were not due to the fact that free-trade prevailed in New South Wales. Is it not a fact that industries in that State had gone ahead by leaps and bounds? The country is so rich that it can nourish industries without the assistance, df protection. The suggestion made by the Treasurer that the position of this isolated company i l lustrates the evil of free-trade will not bear a moment's consideration. In a country like this the outlet for wire-netting is-so extensive that any company properly managed should be able, with the greatest of ease, to produce netting in open competition with the foreign manufacturer. Although manufacturers of wire-netting in Germany arev encouraged by the Government, we are told, by means of a bounty of 15 percent - althoug h their goods are carried over the railways at specially low rates, and shipping companies are subsidized to convey them to Sydney at a cost of something like ios. 6d. per ton, whereas the cost of conveying wire-netting from Sydney to other Inter-State ports ranges from 15s. to 22s. 6d. per ton-the y are unable to compete with the English manufacturers. It is absolutely vital to the interests of Australia - that wire-netting should be produced as cheaply as possible. The Treasurer claims that, as the result of the imposition of a high protective duty, prices will f all , and that, as a matter of"" fact, Lysaght Brothers have already made - a reduction of £ 1 per ton in their selling rates. That, however, is a very , small concession, having regard to the fact that the duty originally proposed by the Government is equivalent to -£6 per ton. It was urged last, night that farmers and settlers are not interested in this question - that it is a question affecting only the pastoralist, and that he can well afford to pay a little more for the use of his land. That is an entirely erroneous assumption. We know that the farmers and settlers, equally with the pastoralists, fear the inroads of the rabbit. I have before me a letter signed by Mr J. R. Fulton, secretary of the Farmers and Settlers' Association at Underbank, near Dung°g",17
28,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Is he a farmer or agent ?,18
29,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"He is a dairy farmer, and he writesHad there been sufficient time not only our Farmers and Settlers' Association, but the whole district, would have signed it to a man. The reference is to a petition praying the House not to agree to these excessive duties. The letter continuesRabbits have been lately seen in this district, and their serious menace to the whole State,"" with . the depreciation of holdings or ruin, they bring to all settlers, should be sumcient in itself to have this item put on the free list.",18
30,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,There are no rabbits at Dungog..,18
31,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I have the greatest respect for Mr Fulton, and believe every word that he writes. He states distinctly, as a representative of the association, that the farmers and settlers of the district fear the inroads of the rabbits.",18
32,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,But they have not yet reached the north coast district.,18
33,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I have seen rabbits in the district referred to. There may be only a few there at the present time, but it cannot be denied that the great army of rabbits is gradually approaching the district. If the large land-holders do not have an opportunity to erect rabbit-proof boundary fences and to resort to poisoning and trapping in order to keep the pest in check there will [159] be nothing to prevent the rabbits extending beyond the larger areas, and, more particularly in bad seasons, raiding the dairy farms and the holdings of the small settlers. The. Labour Party are always crying out for closer settlement, but it seems to me that they are doing little to encourage it.",18
34,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,We are willing to encourage it if the land is made available.,18
35,Mr REID,Unknown,Any excuse.,18
36,Mr WATSON,Unknown,No land monopoly.,18
37,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,The honourable member must be aware that there are in New South Wales and Victoria thousands of acres available for settlement.,18
38,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Where ? - There are hundreds of applicants for one block.,18
39,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"That is the fault of the system, and a matter that rests entirely with the States.",18
40,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Who is responsible for that system ?,18
41,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"At present I am dealing with the question of who is responsible for this iniquitous tax. Unless the rabbits an on the large areas are kept in check, they must gradually encroach on the holdings of the small settlers, and until we have closer settlement they will always be a menace to the farmer as well as to the,pastoralist. The wire-netting industry at present is a small one, but even if it were an extensive industry, capable of supplying all the wire-netting required in Australia, it would be insignificant when compared with the great pastoral and farming industries. Let us take a glance at the value of the product of the pastoral industry. The value of the wool exported from Australia since 1851 has reached the enormous sum of £6ro,ooo,ooo .",18
42,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Then it will not ruin the pastoralists if they are called upon to purchase a little wire-netting?,18
43,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"Does not the honourable member realise that every additional tax is felt by those who have to bear it? If he were a farmer and has land were burdened with an additional tax of £ 5 per annum, I am sure that when he came to make up his accounts at the end of the year, and reflected that every article which he had used was also taxed, he would ask himself the question, "" Can I afford to bear these heavy imposts?"" Australia has always been noted for its wonderful gold production. Yet the value of the wool exported from 'the Commonwealth since 1851 has actually exceeded that of the gold exported by £230,000,000. In 1903 the value of the sheep in Australia was £50,439,000. Let honourable memliers reflect for a moment upon the employment which is provided by the pastoral and the dairying industries. I would commend this aspect of the matter to the notice of the jocular leader of the Labour Party, whose members are always complaining that huge estates employ only half-adozen hands. In 1903 there were 69,000 hands employed in the pastoral industry, and 43>9^4 in the dairying industry, a total of, approximately, 113,000 hands. Since then the dairying industry has progressed by leaps and bounds, but, unfortunately-owin g to' dilatoriness on the part of the Government-n o statistics are available to enable me to bring the figures up to date. Upon this question I claim that I am in a position to speak impartially. Last night the Treasurer taunted the leader of the Opposition with the fact that he represents a city constituency. The honourable gentleman also declared that for 27 years his constituents had been satisfied with him as their representative, and that he represented a district whose interests were almost entirely pastoral.",18
44,Mr REID,Unknown,Until the last election it was the big land-owners who backed him every time.,19
45,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I think that I am in a position to take a broad-minded view of this question, because I am not the representative of any particular class of the community. In my electorate is Cockle Creek, from which supplies of spelter are obtained. The district also embraces extensive mining interests which employ a large number of workmen, and large areas which are occupied by settlers and pastoralists. In a young country like Australia, whose population is crowded into the larger cities on our coast, we should do all that we can to encourage our primary industries. The way to encourage them is not by imposing a duty upon wire-netting, but by allowing that article to be admitted free. I intend to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Illawarra. From the printed schedule in the hands of honourable members, it appears that the recommendation of the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission was that a 5 per cent, duty should be levied upon wire netting, that is somewhat of a misrepresentation, because I am given to understand that the duty in question was recommended in connection with a scheme which included a number of other duties. Unless this scheme could be adopted in its entirety, the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission declared that no duty should be imposed upon wire-netting. Mr JH CATTS.'-They recommended a duty of 5 per cent.",19
46,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"They recommended that the material should be admitted free. The position was explained very thoroughly by the honourable member for Illawarra , yesterday. Last night the Treasurer stated that the small farmers and agriculturists did not fear the rabbits, and that the remedy for this pest. was to be found in the subdivision of the large estates and in the closer settlement of-the country. I think I have shown that his statement is entirely inaccurate, and that the small settlers equally with the large land-holders dread the inroads of the rabbits. I also desire to take exception to the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney last evening. He spoke with a good deal of heat, and with a certain amount of ill nature. If any member of this House was ever a, free-trader certainly the honourable member used to be one. What he is now I do not know. But I do say that for him to affirm that the present Tariff is the result of the action of the leader of the Opposition is nothing more nor less than a most despicable misrepresentation. The party which is responsible for the introduction of the Tariff is that which is commonly known in this Chamber as the Labour Partv, and which is known outside of it as the ""Socialistic"" party.",19
47,Mr REID,Unknown,"The fiscal piebald partythe ""yes-no"" party.",19
48,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"We know very well that this wretched remnant of the Government could not live for an hour if it were not for the support of members who are supposed to represent the labouring classes of Australia. For the members of that party to declare that the leader of the Opposition is responsible for the Tariff is absolutely ridiculous. I am very glad that the honourable member for West Sydney has entered the chamber, because I do not like to attack a person when he is absent. For the honourable member to make the remark to which I refer last evening was beneath the dignity even of a member of the Labour Party. I have nothing more to say upon this matter. I do hope that as the result of the protests which have been presented to Parliament by those who feel the hardship of being compelled to pay a. duty upon wire-netting the item will' te placed upon the free list.",19
49,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Werriwa) [3.12] - I am loath to add to the length of the present debate, which has' already extended far beyond the limits to which we expected it to be confined. But honourable members, I am sure, will bear testimony to the fact that I have not delayed the settlement of the Tariff question by any speeches which I have delivered upon it. The Government are asking this Committee to vote for a protective duty upon wire-netting, and therefore I take it that we are entitled to consider the extent of the disadvantage under which the factory of Messrs. Lysaght Brothers has to work by reason of the increased wages which it'has to pav in comparison with those which are paid in other parts of the world. Wherever I see any Australian industry placed at a disadvantage by reason of its being called upon to pay higher wages than those which obtain - in other countries, I am prepared to extend to it such a measure of protection as will at least _ equalize matters or incline the balance in favour of our own people.",20
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How will prices be kept down for .the consumer?,20
51,Mr HALL,Unknown,I think that the new protection scheme will do that.,20
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Where scheme? When is it going to be brought forward ?,20
53,Mr HALL,Unknown,I do not suppose that it masters very much where the scheme originates so long as it proves to be a good one. We might be prepared to accept even a scheme of the deputy leader of the Opposition if it were a good one.,20
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,When is it to brought forward?,20
55,Mr HALL,Unknown,That depends largely upon the ability of the leader of the Opposition in persuading the honourable member to adopt his reasonable methods in dealing with the Tariff. I ask the Committee to consider the wages which are paid in the wire-netting industry with a view to ascertaining what duty will fairly meet the case. We were told last nieht by the Treasurer that £ 7 0 0 per week is disbursed amongst the employees in the wire-netting industry. That is the total amount of the payments. We have also been told that Messrs. Lvsaght Brothers' factory is producing miles of netting weekly.,20
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The ' average pro.duction is 300 miles per - week. [i59]- 2,20
57,Mr HALL,Unknown,This wire-netting sells for at least £ 3 0 a mile.,20
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No ; some wire netting of a different type is sold at a much lower price.,20
59,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I am aware of that f a c t ; but I also know that some wire-netting is sold at even a higher price. The firm turn out 33S miles of wire-netting per week, which, sold at £ 3 0 per mile, means over £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 ; and it is a fact that they are also engaged in manufacturing other commodities. For the production of that wire netting, , £ 7 0 0 in wages is paid; so that, if there is a difficulty in competing with the cheaper article from abroad, it cannot arise, to any great extent, from any difference in wages - If the wire-netting workers of Germany worked for nothing, the firm would be at a disadvantage of only some. £ 7 0 0 , which could be covered by a duty of 7 per cent. Mr J o s EPH COOK - Four-fifth s of the wire-netting comes from Great Britain.",20
60,Mr HALL,Unknown,"If the labour in Germany and in England were ever so much cheaper - eve n if it were procured for nothingI contend that the firm will be at a disadvantage of only some 7 per cent. But seeing that the workers in England and Germany arepaid a certain wage, I venis this ture to think that a duty of 5 per cent, would more than compensate for any difference - If we impose a duty qf 5 per cent, on English wire-netting, and, if desired, an extra 5 per cent, on foreign wire-netting-and I am prepared to support a preference-w e shall be treating this firm handsomely, and doing all that is necessary to equalize conditions in the manufacture. Can the Treasurer see his way be to accept a suggestion to that effect? *A duty of 5 per cent, may be regarded as not very much; but it amounts to a great deal when we consider the value of the output; and I think that in view of the fact that Lysaght Brothers have carried on their business for some years without any protection, they will be able to do very well under such a' duty as I have indicated. On the output of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 a week, a 5 per cent, duty means placing outside - com- petitors at a disadvantage of £ 5 0 0 - a week. Honourable members who represent oountry constituencies are aware that the local article enjoys a natural protection which must amount to fully 5 per cent, at present. Wire-netting from England and Germany is rolled up by machinery into small, tight parcels, with the result that the handling in erecting it costs 25s. or 30s. per mile more than in the case of the local article. The first question asked by the workman when a wire-netting contract is under discussion is whether the netting is Australian or imported; and the price, in the case of the latter, is higher for the reason I have stated - We ought,",20
61,Mr WILSON,Unknown,That has not been my experience.,21
62,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I am assured that it is the experience of users of wire-netting, throughout New South Wales, and I appeal to the honourable member for Calare to support my statement.",21
63,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Australia n wire netting is preferred to imported.,21
64,Mr HALL,Unknown,"As I have said this gives a natural protection to the Australian industry amounting to at least 5 per cent.; and I intend to move, I hope with the approval, of the Treasurer, that the duty be fixed at 5 per cent, against the British article, and 10 per cent, against the foreign article. In doing this, I am not so much - concerned about the wire-netting workers .in Sydney, because I regard this as an industry which is not of much value to the - community. Those who carry on the industry engage a large number of boys for five or six years at wages ranging from 25s. to 35s. a week; and, when those boys grow up and require men's wages, they are - turned out to compete in the unskilled labour market. Such an industry is not. in 'my opinion, worth any great sacrifice. If it could be shown that Lysaght Brothers could maintain the existing competition without a duty, I should feel disposed to place wire-netting on the free list ; but I am not sure that the industry will not go to the wall unless it be afforded some protection, however small.",21
65,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The industry has not "" gone to the wall "" all these years.",21
66,Mr HALL,Unknown,"That may be so, but I understand that this enterprise has changed hands once or twice since it was initiated. I make no appeal for Lysaght Brothers or their 400 workers, most of whom are juniors; but I am satisfied that if this factory be closed, it will not be long before the importing ring will proceed to rob the selectors as they have done in the past. Almost every day we have some new experience in this connection. Only yesterday we were informed how importers had combined to rob the people in the matter of infants' foods and other commodities sold in chemists' shops; and certainly the importing ring misses no opportunity of the kind. We have a chance to prevent such practices by affording such protection as may be necessary to maintain this industry, and give the people on the land the advantages of competition.",21
67,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Flinders) [3.28]. as far as possible, I think, to endeavour to restrain ourselves within the limits of ordinary Committee debate, or I am afraid we shall never conclude the difficult task before us. Although I should like to say much on the subject under discussion, I shall confine myself to one or two important questions which seem not to have been full y touched on! First, what is the relation which this proposed duty holds to the new schedule in divisions VIA . and VIB . ? If we place a duty on wire-netting at this stage, and we subsequently adopt the provisions of division VI A, and place a duty of i 2 | per cent, on the raw material, wire, there will be a very strong case on the part of the wire-' netting manufacturer for an additional compensating duty of at least 8 or 10 per cent. I ask the Treasurer whether it is intended to press the proposed duty of 12 J per cent, on wire? I do not ask the honourable gentleman to commit himself to any definite course at the present stage; but, without that information, it is almost impossible to estimate what is a fair or adequate duty on wire-netting.",21
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"In reference to wire, I should not like to speak positively; but my inclination is to think that the duty ought to be lowered or . removed.",21
69,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,I am glad to hear that.,21
70,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If the duty on wire-netting is lowered to the rate suggested, we shall have to do something in regard to the duty on wire.",21
71,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"The difficulty I feel is that we are really beginning with the wrong end first. I - do not blame the Government for that, because the item has been brought forward by the Committee out of its order. I am strongly in favour of encouraging the production of iron and iron industries in Australia, and am disposed to support the propositions of the Government to that end, whether by the granting - of a bounty-thoug h I do not know where the money necessary for a sufficiently large bounty is to come from-o r by the imposition of a duty. I am strongly disposed to support the giving of substantial encouragement for the production of iron and manufactures of iron, or, at any rate, of comparatively simple manufactures of iron products for which there is a large demand, and which can be profitably made in Australia. But if we put a duty of, say, 12 J per cent, on bar iron, iron wire, and similar manufactures of iron, in order to encourage the local industry, we must undoubtedly increase the duty-op wire-netting and barbedwire. Neither article is mentioned in division VIB .",21
72,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The duties set in schedule VIB . are conditional.,22
73,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"If division VIA is carried, the compensating' duties vided for in division VIB . will into operation.",22
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The estimated instand that. crease is 2 per cent.,22
75,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"It will be much greater in some cases. In connection with chaff-cutting and other machines, the value of the finished article is vastly greater than the value of the raw material, and an increase of 2J per cent, might be sufEon. wire. cient to compensate for the duty on the raw material. But the .difference between the value of the raw material and that the finished article is much less in nexion with such things as rails and fishhave plates, bolts, tie-plates, rods, switches, so on, mentioned in item 181.",22
76,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is not likely that rails will be rolled at places distant from iron furnaces.,22
77,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Probably the cost of the black wire used in the making of wire-netting is equal to half the cost of namely, 10 and 5 per cent. the finished article. In regard to the articles mentioned in item 181, it is provided that, if a duty is placed on the raw material, the general rate applying to them be increased by 10 per cent., or from 12J to 22\ per cent. At the present time there is no duty on importations from Great Britain, but under schedule VIB . there subject. will be a duty of 17J per cent. Taking when Prime Minister, appointed the what is proposed in the case of the articles mentioned in item 181 as a general indiof cation of what would be a fair compentries, sating duty in regard to wire-netting, think it may be fairly assumed that, should a duty be placed on its raw material, duty on netting should be .increased by or 10 per cent. Therefore, I should like a definite statement from the Government as to what is proposed.",22
78,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Unde r item 226 wire n.e.i. is admitted free.,22
79,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I do not know that that is the wire used for the making of wire-ntetting; the matter should be explained. If the raw material from which wire-netting is made is not admitted subject to a very low rate of duty, or free, we . must put a heavy compensating ' duty on wire-netting. It seems to me that the wire-making industry is one which will reasonably claim a fair measure of protection when we come to deal with manuout factures of iron.",22
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If the duty on . wire is taken off, I shall attempt to enprocourage its production by providing for be brought the granting of bounties.",22
81,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I quite underI believe that wire-making is one of the easiest and most fundamental applications of the iron industry, which we ought to endeavour to protect if we intend to encourage that industry, and in dealing with wire-netting we should bear in mind the possibility of the imposition of a duty If we adopt the suggestion to place duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on wire-netting, we must afterwards increase of the rates by 8 or 10 per cent, if we subconsequently adopt division VIB . I should preferred to deal with the duty on and barbed wire and wire-netting in connection with the consideration of a general scheme for encouraging iron production and manupigfacture. But under the existing circumstances, what seems to me best to meet the case is the adoption of the rate suggested by several honourable members,, It would be very satisfactory to the Committee if , before coming to a vote, we had a definite statement by the Minister in regard to the shall matters to which I have referred.",22
82,Mr COON,Unknown,"Batman) [3.39] - I .have listened with great pleasure to many of the speeches delivered on this important The leader of the Opposition, - Tariff Commission to inquire into the conditions what were said to the strangled indusnot only in Victoria, but also in I New South Wales and other States. On 3rd March, 1904, a petition was presented the to this Parliament-whic h I have here8 signed by 200 men employed in the wire netting industry of New South Wales, asking for the imposition of a duty on that article.",22
83,Mr REID,Unknown,Were there only 200 then?,23
84,Mr COON,Unknown,"Tw o hundred signed the petition; there may have been 400 employed. As a Victorian protectionist I shall vote to protect the industries of New South Wales.. The rigbt honourable member, speaiking on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the speech of the Governor General, said-Hansard , page 98When the Tariff is projected on protectionist lines, I hope that the industries of every part of Australia will receive the same attention. If we are to have protection, we are entitled to see that New South Wales, with some of her great industries, secures a fair degree of it. ' .. Despite that statement, the members of the Opposition arenow saying that they do not desire protection for this industry. The honourable member for; Dalley said that the protectionists sitting on this side of the Chamber would be afraid to vote protection for New South Wales industries; but I am prepared to vote the highest protection. Giving evidence before the Tariff Commission last year, Mr Boug, who stated that he appeared as the representative of the workers, gave this ""evidence.What prospect have you of obtaining hip'' rates of wages if a duty be imposed ?-In that event, we should average more time, and should have a better case to go before the country. At present, we do not work full time. year, from the ioth April, we were put on halftime, working week off and week on.  rate of wages paid to the employees in the industry was equivalent to 23s. 6d. per mile.",23
85,Mr COON,Unknown,"He said that he was receiving £ 2 2S. a week, and that wire netting was ' being sent into the country from Germany and elsewhere which should be made in New South Wales. The workers in the industry have asked for protection, and the Government proposes to give it to them. The workers of New South Wales have asked for generous all round protection, and yet, in connection with one of the very first items, we are called-upon to deal with, we find that most of the representatives of New South Wales are opposed to any duty.",23
86,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Shocking . Mr COON. - In the circumstances it is. Honourable members opposite are prepared to allow wire-netting made in Germany by men who work from twelve to fourteen hours a day for a wage of 3s. 3d., to come into unrestricted competition with the wire netting produced in New South Wales.",23
87,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Is not the honourable member aware that - the bulk of our imports of wire-netting come from Great Britain?,23
88,Mr COON,Unknown,"A large quantity of. the wire-netting exported from Great Britain, comes originally from Germany. Great, Britain last year re-exported no less than> £70,000,000 worth of goods. What proportion of that sum represents exports of: wife-netting ? Mr JOHNSON* - None. It is locallymade.",23
89,Mr COON,Unknown,The honourable member is in error.,23
90,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Why does the honourable member object to imports of wire-netting from Germany?,23
91,Mr COON,Unknown,"I object to the unrestricted importation of any goods which come into competition with the product of Australian labour, since the conditions of labour prevailing here are different from> those of other lands.",23
92,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Does the honourable membefr object to such impiorts whether British or foreign?,23
93,Mr COON,Unknown,"I do. The Tariff Commission had before it the evidence of th£ worker to whom I have referred, whilst on the other side it had the testimony of Last a witness representing the pastoral indus-v try. The leader of the Opposition last night pleaded for the small settler, urging that we should be prepared - to dosomething to assist him in his effort to - free his land from pests. As a matter of fact, the only representative, pf the users of this netting who was examined by the Commission was a Mr Jowett,! grazier, of Queensland, who stated that he owned nine stations. He said that he desired to keep the rabbits off his land,. and that he did not favour any duty on wire-netting. He admitted, however, that' even if the wire-netting industry in New South Wales were able to supply local requirements,, competition would lead to a reduction in prices. The evidence given before the Commission was in favour of a higher duty, and the protectionist section of - that Commission recommended the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent. Surely that recommendation should receive some attention. Are honourable members aware that the Commission appointed by Mr. Chamberlain recommended that a duty of 7J per cent, should be imposed on wire netting, and that in its report it was stated, that Germany was .dumping netting into the United Kingdom at £ 2 per ton less than it costs to produce it in other countries. We .have a protectionist Ministry, and the great bulk of honourable members of this House were returned as protectionists. Some honourable members of the Opposition corner have signified their willingness to follow the - recommendations of the protectionist secltion of the Tariff Commission, and yet we - now find many of them prepared to dis-regard the recommendation of that section that a duty of 25 per cent, be imposed upon this commodity.",23
94,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Eve n the Ministry have departed from that recommendation ,24
95,Mr COON,Unknown,"I am not responsible for 4he action of the Treasurer. I am simply pointing out that honourable members of the Opposition corner were returned as protectionists, and that some of them are premember pared to place wire-netting on the free",24

97,Mr COON,Unknown,"I know that the honourable anember was. Had he not stood as a progow, tectionist he would not have been returned. I know also, that he said he was prepared to follow the recommendations of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission. What has caused him to depart from that decibounty sion ? Why should the Opposition corner nbt be prepared in this case to follow the recommendation of the protectionist section - of the Commissiqn?",24
98,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Where did honourable members of the Opposition corner they would accept the recommendations of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission?,24
99,Mr COON,Unknown,I am sure that not one - of them will deny the correctness of my assertion.,24
100,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,"I , for one, deny i",24
101,Mr COON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Indi is now prepared to place wire-netting - on the free list. Protection has made toria, and we wish it to make New South Wales. I think that even the leader of Opposition will admit that every country that adopts a protective Tariff is benefited by it.",24
102,Mr REID,Unknown,It means paying' too for the benefit received.,24
103,Mr COON,Unknown,"I trust that the Ministry will stand by their proposals and throw upon those who were returned as protecshould tionists the responsibility for voting against them. A candidate for the representation of a Victorian constituency would have no chance of being returned if he. were not prepared to advocate an effective protective Tariff. Every honourable member in the Opposition corner was ready last December to vote for such a T a r if f; but we find that some of them today are prepared to pull down the protective barriers. Not one of them would be prepared to say that he favours a revenue Tariff, and I trust that as the workers of New South Wales in this case are asking for protection, and since we can make wire-netting equal to, and in some cases superior to, the imported article, we shall yield to their request. I shall vote for the highest duty that I can secure in connection with not only the wire netting industry, but every industry to which the Tariff relates.  vote for a heavy duty on glucose? list - Mr COON:-In order that our manufacturers may be encouraged, I shall be to support the free admission of raw material which we cannot make here. A short time ago we were invited to inspect the magnificent iron works at Lithand I think I may safely say that some, honourable members of the Opposition will not vote free-trade wheh we are called upon to deal with the Government proposals to place a duty on iron or to grant a on its production in Australia. I hope that the Government will go for the higher duties, and in future stand by their original proposals, throwing upon honoraible members who Were returned to vote protection the responsibility for any reducsay that tions that may be made.",24
104,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Fawkner) [3.58] I should like to congratulate the leader of the Opposition on the splendid way in which he spoke up last night for the man on the land. Those who enjoy the comt . . forts of city life are apt to forget the hardships endured by those on the soil, who are doing the work of Australia. Although Vicwe have here a magnificent suburban railway service, the State Government contemthe plates an expenditure of some millions of pounds on the electrification of the system in order that we may be able to reach our luxurious homes a few minutes earlier than muchwe can now do. That project is likelv to be carried out, and yet the unfortunate settler in Gippsland in many cases has great difficulty in reaching his home. The position be seriously considered. I do not regard this question in the same light as does the honourable member for Batman. To my mind, in this instance the fiscal issue is not a.t stake. We expect from the direct supporters of the Government some assistance in our efforts to pass a really workable Tariff, but they aTe always jeering at the unfortunate members of the Opposition corner. I should be glad if they would permit us to look after our own affairs. It seems to me, however, that they are drunk with protection.",24
105,Mr WISE,Unknown,And so was the honourable member when on the election platform.,25
106,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I was not; I . am quite prepared to stand by my election pledges. The honourable member for Batman has been attacking us, and now the Wise man of the east and the other Magi sitting behind the Government are joining in the attack.",25
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Canad a must very drumk with protection if we in Australia are.,25
108,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"The Government wish to make us drunk with protection, but we decline to allow them to do so. desire of honourable members in the Opposition corner is to deal with these questions on business lines, and to secure the granting of. a good measure of protection : for the people of Australia. When we reach other items relating to the industries of Australia, it will ' probably be found that there is not much difference of opinion between the Government and the members of the Opposition corner. But a question of this sort involves the prosperity of Australia as a whole. For a long time we have been confronted with the problem of what steps are best calculated to enable us to cope with the rabbit invasion, and I think that this item is, therefore, not in the same category as many others in the Tariff. I should like to read a short extract from The Commonwealth of Australia, by Professor Harrison Moore, with a view to showing what a long time the rabbit has been with us. This book, I may mention, has been kindly placed in my hands by the honourable member for Parkes. page 34 I find the following:It was not until the conference of 1SS1 that the matter passed beyond the stage of a discussion and a Bill was agreed to, which, saving the Prerogative, provided for an Australian Court of Appeal. But it was entirely in accordance with custom that the matter should end there. The Tariff as a subject pf conference had been already considered ; and the other principal matters suggested for joint action were the regulation of Chinese immigration, and the suppression of another "" undesirable immigrant,"" the rabbit. That was as far back as 1881, but we arestill fighting the rabbit pest.  monopolist in our midst.",25
109,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Yes . The rabbit will displace, not only the land monopolist, but the farmer, and everybody else connected with the land. I have seen rabbitsin country which was covered with snow io feet deep. I recollect that at one time it was urged that rabbits would not live in Gippsland.' But the fact remains that today that country is threatened with an invasion of the pest. I look upon this question as an extra-fiscal one, and I say that it ought not to be dealt with from a fiscal stand-point. I am one of those who favour the establishment of local industries, and, be in order that we may place a check upon our importers by insuring healthy competition, and thus allow the users of wire-netting to obtain that material as cheaply as possible, we ought to impose a fair duty - upon it. By that means we shall preserve The the industry, which has already been established in our midst. With that object m view, I think that we might levy a duty of IO per cent, upon netting of foreign manufacture and of 5 per cent, upon netting of British origin. That would be a fair thing.",25
110,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What is the difference between the manufacturers of Great Britain and foreign manufacturers? Canada would be treated as a foreigner.,25
111,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"If Canada chose to - enter into a reciprocal agreement with the Commonwealth we should be able to extend the same preference to her that we offer to Gteat Britain. But the fact remains that Great Britain is the mother country, from which we obtain most of these manufactures.",25
112,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"But from a protectionist stand-point, what is the difference between British manufacturers and foreign manufacturers ?",25
113,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"We are quite wilOn ling to extend to any part of the Empire which produces upon the same lines as ourselves the facilities that we accord to the old country. But as a preferential trader, I do not think that it is necessary for me to discuss that question/ at the present time, because, so far, no wire-netting has been imported from Canada) nor does there seem any likelihood of any being so imported. I think that the Government would! be acting wisely if they agreed to levy a duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture and 5 per cent, upon netting of British origin.",25
114,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member think that 5 per cent, would be any protection at all?",26
115,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"- I really do not think that the industry requires any protection. The duty is merely a revenue duty. I know.that a little protection very frequently has the effect of imposing a healthy check upon importers, and of thus allowing the consumer to purchase commodities cheaper than he would be able to get them if no duty were operative. Further, in the absence of any duty, rings and combines are likely to be established. I believe that such a thing is not unknown even in labour circles. The general experience is that directly a local industry has been established, clown comes the price of the imported article. I do not blame importers for endeavouring to get as much as they can out of the consumers. I am a business man, and I always try to get as much as I can for my money, and I know that others endeavour to get as much as they can out of me. I have no desire to detain the Committee at greater length. A duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture, and of 5 per cent, upon netting of British origin, over and above the cost of the raw material, would, I think, represent a fair compromise. The actual cost of the raw material has not yet been stated. Any impost upon that material must necessarily increase the price of the locally-manufactured article. I repeat that, in my opinion, the duties should be 10 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively in excess of the duty which may be levied upon the . wire. That would leave our manufacturers a clear protection of 10 per cent, in the case of wire-netting of foreign manufacture, ancl of 5 per cent, in the case of netting of British origin. The users of this material would then be able to purchase it as cheaply as possible, and that would be a consideration to those upon the land, who are really building up this great country.",26
116,Mr JOHNS ON,Unknown,"Lang) [4.8] - It is rather a pity that the Treasurer was not in his place yesterday when the honourable member for Calare addressed the Committee. The latter gave honourable members a graphic description of the labour conditions which prevail in the factory of Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, Sydney. Had the Treasurer heard the honourable member's speech, he would have derived a great deal of information, which, I venture to say, was not - proffered to him by those who were instrumental in persuading him to propose this particular duty for their especial benefit. What I am surprised at is that a large number of honourable members, who claim to directly represent labour, should be found supporting a proposal to encourage the wire-netting industry by means of a protective duty after they have heard the deliverance of the honourable member for Calare. Just now, we had a most impassioned deliverance from the honourable member for Batman, who is a staunch protectionist. Of course, we can all admire his loyalty to thecause which he advocates and the fervour with which he advances his views, although we may disagree with his conduct in' arrogating to himself the position of lecturer-general to the Committee.",26
117,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,I thought .that the honourable member occupied that position.,26
118,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"It has been chiefly assumed by new members who occupy seats upon the Ministerial side of the Chamber,, or in the Labour ""corner. In horrified terms, the honourable member for Batman referred to the immense importation of wire-netting from Germany. He said that he was not only prepared to protect Australian industry against the competition of foreigners, but that he was so ardent a protectionist that he did not care twopence for the preferential sentiments which are supposed to permeate the Ministry he was elected to support. He declared his willingness to increase the Tariff against both British and foreign manufactures. VVe hear so much from the Treasurer and his followers in regard to the importation of wire-netting from Germany that any one who did not know better might be pardoned for believing that the great bulk of the netting imported into the Commonwealth is of German manufacture. But, as a matter of fact, it is of British manufacture. The value in d origin of the imports of this material „-ari be ascertained from the Customs returns, i com those returns I find that the total importations in 1905 were valued at ^ 3 3 5 > ° i of which £ 2 2 0 , 0 0 0 worth0 o or about two-thirds-cam e fr->m the United Kingdom. Last year, the figures were even more striking. During that, period, the total importation of wire-netting was valued at ; £ 5 > 7 5 * of which £ 3 8 2 , 8 7 2 worth 2I 8 came from Great Britain. Consequently, there has been an advance from two-thirds to three-fourths in the total of our importation of wire-netting which comes from Great Britain. Yet the Treasurer and - his supporters speak of this importation as if . it were of foreign origin. It is perfectly clear that Great Britain does not require a preference in this connection. She already enjoys a natural preferenceprobably because the British article is superior to the German. Perhaps those who advocate the imposition of a high protective duty upon wire-netting are not aware that they are desirous of subsidizing an industry which employs chiefly boy labour, and which, from its very nature,, can never do' anything else. I think that the proportion of boys to men engaged in the industry is as four to one. It is certain, however, that boys are mostly employed. The process of wire-netting manufacture is not one that involves any specially skilled labour, except in regard to the fixing of the mesh and the width. The netting is woven on a power frame, and, after the frame has been set to the mesh and the width, the labour required is simply that of feeding, which is done by boys, who are engaged at comparatively small wages. The honourable member for Calare told us yesterday that the most skilled workman, who was supposed to be an expert, received no more than £ 2 2s. a week, and we may well wonder what the boys are paid, if that is the remuneration of an expert.  with the firm for ten years !",26
119,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That is so. We are also informed that the labour cost per mile is something like 23s. 6d., while the price charged for the netting runs from £ 2 7 to £ 3 7 per mile, in some cases, perhaps more; and yet we are asked to afford enormous protection to the industry. What is to become of the boys when they become too old for this class of work? They will drift into the world, with the best years of their lives, which should be devoted to learning some trade, absolutely wasted on work the knowledge of which is of no utility in their future. ' Only a small proportion of those boys, even if they do become skilled workmen, can be employed in this or any other factory of the kind. On these grounds alone/ from the labour point of view, the . duty proposed by the Minister, or the proposal of the honourable member for Riverina, is most, undesirable. Something has been said about the reduction in the price of wire-netting, and the Treasurer informed us that if the duty proposed be passed, the manufacturers in Australia are prepared to give a bond not to increasetheir present charges. It will be interesting to consider the question of cost. Theprices I am about to quote were sent by Messrs. Gibbs, Bright, and Company, the. Melbourne agents of Lysaght Brothers, toone of the principal hardware merchantsin Melbourne on the 3rd bf this month. For imported wire-netting f.o.b the cost per mile in June last was £18 19s. gA. r for wire-netting 36 inches wide by if-in., mesh, and 17-in. gauge. The import expenses amounted to £2 3s. ud., made up> of freight, insurance, commission, exchange,, wharfage, cartage, and stacking. The total cost of the imported wire netting in the Melbourne store thus amounted to» £21 3s. 8d. r",27
120,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That type of wire isbelow the standard.,27
121,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"If we take Lysaghts': price for the same article, we shall get a fair comparison. Lysaghts' price for the-same article delivered, net cash, was£ 2 7 2s. 6d.; so that it will be seen that thelocally-madearticle already commands a. higher price, and that there is no necessity for' imposing a duty in order to raise the imported price.",27
122,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Will the honourable member quote the price for Lysaghts' standard 1 wire-netting 42 inches by 1 j inch ?,27
123,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The quotation I have is for wire 42 inches by inch, and the price is ,£37 per mile. Another quality of imported wire-netting is 36 inches by i j - in. mesh by 17-in. gauge. The cost per mile, f.o.b., was £ 2 7 16s. 2d., and importing expenses £ 2 18s. pd., or a total of £ 3 ° 4Sn d . I",27
124,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That wire-netting is only 36 inches wide.,27
125,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The importer's price for wire-netting, 42 inches wide, if incn mesh, and 17 inches gauge f.o.b. was, ira June last, £ 2 0 ns. 3d. per mile. The importing expenses amounted to £ 2 us. 9d., making the cost in the Mel-- ' bourne store .£23 3s. The price for wire netting of the same standard, supplied by Lysaght Brothers, was £ 3 1 . Now, let us'see how those figures work out uncier the influence of the proposed duty. In the case of the wire-netting which cost f.o.b.. £ 1 8 18s. 9d., the duty at 10 per cent, would amount to £ 1 18s., or a total of £ 2 0 17s. 9<i.; while a duty of 25 per cent, would amount to £ 5 4s. sd., which, with import expenses at £ 2 3s. n d . , would make the landed and duty paid cost are £ 2 8 6s. i d . The price of Lysaght Broa thers for a similar article is £ 2 7 2s. 6d., while, as the figures show, the effect of the duty would be to increase the price of the imported article from £ 2 1 3s. 8d. to produced £ 2 8 6s. i d . In the case of the wire-netper - ting 42 inches wide, the duty at 10 per cent, would amount to £ 2 is. i | d . , making a total of £ 2 2 12s. 4^d.; while a of 25 per - cent, would amount £ 5 13s. i d . , which, with import expenses at £ 2 n s . 9d., would make the netting landed, duty paid, cost £ 3 0 17s. 2^d., against £ 2 3 3s. without the duty. The price of Lysaght Brothers, for a similar article, is £ 3 1 , so that the firm still natural advantage even with - the rate duty I have calculated. I have here some correspondence, from which I learn that natural protection which Lysaght Brothers «njoy amounts to something like 10 per cent - in the shape of freight, insurance, and other charges of importation, which gives them a natural protection of 10 cent, in the advanced price they are able command.",27
126,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Is that because cf the superior quality of their wire-netting? . Mr JOHNSON - It is a natural protection given by the cost of importation, as I have shown; but there is also a preference shown for the local wire-netting, partly because of its superior quality and partly from the fact that it is loosely rolled, thus affords to the consumers a convenience for which they are willing to pay the extra afford to sell cheaper. price. ""Under the circumstances, Lysaght Brothers enjoy a substantial natural tection without any of the proposed - Mr WATSON - On the honourable member's own showing the natural protection everything. is only 10 ner cent. 1",28
127,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The advantage in the - shape of freight, insurance, and other port charges amounts to 10 per cent., - there is' the further advantage, equal from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent., in vanced price which the local article com: mands. -- Mr WATSON - Does not the honourable, member see that the better quality involves greater cost of production ? ' - Mr JOHNSO)* - That I do not deny, but I am merely pointing Brothers are in such a favourable position that they could really command the market if they could meet the supply. As a matter of fact-and this is the trouble-the firm are not able to meet the supply, and not likely tofoeable to meet it for many long day. That is the reason why, notwithstanding the preference for the local article^ it is necessary to import such immense quantities. The wire-netting locally is worth something like £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 annum, and the quantity imported is of similar value, so that, altogether, about £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of wire-netting is used duty every year in Australia. No matter how to high the duty may be, the importation will continue until the local manufacturer is able to overtake the demand. We have as heard much about the lowering of the price of wire-netting, but it will be seen from the figures already quoted that the Treasurer has had his leg pulled very successfully has a ancl very vigorously by the gentlemen conof nected with the industry. It is evident, from the prices I have quoted, that full the - advantage of the duty has already been taken by local manufacturers. According to a letter quoted by the leader of the Opposition _ yesterday, from Noyes arid Company, it appears very clear that if no per duty be imposed, it will only be a short to time before the price of wire-netting will be reduced, not by £ 1 , but by £ 5 or £ 7 : I am speaking, of course, of imported wire netting.",28

132,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"He would not do such an insane thing-; but, if he did, I should vote against him. The Treasurer has introduced this Tariff knowing the Opinions of those who support him. If the members of the Labour Party desired to cut down duties, to lessen the burdens of the wage-earners, it would be done at once on an intimation of that desire to the Treasurer. But if no such action is taken, we shall probably be engaged in the discussion of the Tariff until June next. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Government would resign rather than be dictated to in that manner.",28
133,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The Government is being dictated to now, and could not exist without the support of the Labour Party, which is dictating to it all the time. I hope that the leader of the party will intimate to the Treasurer that the Tariff is not satisfactory, because it presses heavily on the masses of the people, who are complaining loudly. He has only to say the word and it will be thrown under the table immediately.",29
134,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [4-35]-- I have listened with a great deal of interest to a number of the speeches which have been delivered. Although the discussion has been long, I ' do not think that the time has been wasted. As has been observed by several speakers, the item before us is one of the most important in the schedule. But its discussion has involved some rather comical elements. We find that some of those who in the past have proclaimed protection from the housetops are now going to vote for free-trade, whilst others who have preached free-trade all their lives are now going to vote protection. I listened with a great deal of interest and profit to the pathetic and eloquent appeal of the leader of the Opposition on behalf of those who are suffering from the rabbit pest. But some of the grounds on which he based it I regarded as very faulty. Taking, up the schedule, he pointedout that the duties collected, on machinery used in hat and woollen mills are to be refunded to the manufacturers, and he asked why the farmers should nof be similarly treated. If it were a right thing to return the duties that I speak of, it might also be a right thing to return the duty on wire-netting; but I say, emphatically, that it is not right, and being wrong in one connection, it is wrong in both. I am going to be consistent in this matter, and shall therefore do my best to remove the exemption in favour of the manufacturers of Jiats and woollens. But I do not think that a case has been made out for admitting wire-netting free of duty. I have tried to ascertain how the proposed duty will affect the farmers. For many years I lived in a farming community, and a number - of small farmers are my personal friends, so that I kno\v exactly the diffi: culties with which they are faced in rabbit infested country. But those difficulties have been exaggerated. It is those who hold large tracts of country who find the rabbit pest most serious. In a sense thispest is likely to prove a blessing rather than a curse, because it will bring about the cutting up of large holdings and the increase of small settlers.",29
135,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"If the number of holdings is increased, a larger quantity of wire-netting will be needed.",29
136,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Where there is closer settlement, the rabbit pest is. a less serious thing than where the holdings are large. I admit that where closer settlement is confined to a small area, and is; surrounded by a large area of practically unoccupied land, the position is different; but where there is a large extent of close settlement, the land being divided up into small blocks, the farmers have little trouble in keeping down the rabbits, with the aid of their children and a few sporting dogs.",29
137,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"How can there be close settlement in the western district of New South Wales, where a man cannot make a living on 50,000 acres? The rabbitcannot live there half it.s time.",29
138,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Then there is no wire-netting problem there.  acre block there for almost nothing.,29
139,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Calare said that on inquiring the price of wire-netting, he was told that it was £ 4 0 a mile, or per ton, to the consumer, whereas the manufacturers sell it for £ 3 0 , and the imported article is brought in at about £ 2 6 ios. He pointed out that the farmers are, therefore, called upon to pay £ 1 4 a ton for the expenses of retailing. But I do not think that we are called upon to safeguard the farmer when he has at hand the means of studying his own interests. In many cases the farmers have gone in largely for cooperation, and, by joining associations, are able to purchase wire-netting and other requirements at wholesale prices. Therefore, they have a remedy in their own hands. To ascertain the probable effect of a duty of 15 per cent., I have worked out its apeither. plication to the wire-netting of a 640-acre, or square mile, block. Four miles 42-in. wire-netting, of in. mesh, £ 2 6 ios. per mile-the contract price of tion to my constituents. the New South Wales Government-woul cost £ 1 0 6 , on which a 15 per cent, duty would be „ £ is 18s.

141,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,Is not a special paration used to preserve it?,30
142,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I am satisfied take the assurance of a practical farmer that a wire-netted fence will last for twenty years. The sum of £ 1 5 18s., spread over twenty years, would mean annual cost of 15s. That is what farmer will have to pay, assuming that he pays the duty.",30

I do not look upon either fiscal policy as the great cure-all of the ills of humanity, and, therefore, do not advocate In dealing with the proposals of the Government, I shall vote as a case is of made out for or against them, and I shall at be prepared subsequently to justify my acI have tried to d correctly weigh the evidence for and against the proposed duties on wire-netting. of the duty have not been able as to adduce any facts which would warrant me in voting against it. If the farmers had to pay a 10 per cent, duty-the preference proposal-the holder of a 640 acre block would incur a liability of £ 1 0 12s., and under the arrangement premade by the Government of New South ' Wales he would have twenty years within to which to pay that amount. This is assuming that the local price is raised to the extent of the duty. The Government of New South Wales are importing wire-netting for distribution amongst an the farmers, and as three-fourths of the the duty is returnable to the State in which it is collected, they are calling upon the farmers whom they supply to pay only be one-fourth of the total impost. The duty in that case therefore would work out at I am less than 4 per cent., or spread over 20 years-the l if e of a wire fence-at less than 1-5th per cent, straight out. It is open imto the Governments of the other States to He follow the example of New South Wales. In these circumstances there is no justification for the outcry that has been raised in Butmuch regard to these duties, or for the tearful and eloquent appeals made by some honorwithable members, who imagine that their speeches will be scattered broadcast, and on lead the farmers to believe that they alone a huge are mindful of their interests.",30
149,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Then the honourable member admits that the farmers will have to pay the duty. Mr J, H . CATTS - I do not. I am could dealing with the assumption that they would have to pay the duty, and showing even in that event, the holder of a 640 acre block would not be in such .a iba<3 position as some honourable members would have us believe. honourable Mr Reid - There are thousands of selectors who must have much larger areas.",30
150,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Eve n the holder of a 1,280 acre block would not have to pay 25s. a. year in the circumstances I have mentioned.",30
151,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Would he have to pay any more for his wire-netting if we imposed a protective duty ?,30
152,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If it could be shown that these duties would-seriously injure the small farmer I should not be Dre pared to support them. I find, however, that the land monopolists will be chiefly affected by them. Thousands and thousands of acres on some of our best rivers are carrying only a sheep or half-a-sheep to the acre.",31
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I suppose that the holders of such areas lawfully obtained them ?,31
154,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Perhaps so, but it is not a good thing for the country that some of our best river frontages, comprising rich black soil, should be carrying only a sheep or half-a-sheep to the acre.",31
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Would the honour the able member do an injustice to the of such areas who had lawfully obtained them ?,31
156,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"No . To my mind, however, such.men are perpetrating justice upon the whole community. I seen huge areas of land, comprising some of our best river frontages, overrun with rabbits. It is almost a crime that such areas should be carrying only half-a-sheep to the acre, and that practically no labour should be employed upon them, whilst thousands of farmers' sons are forced compete with each other for positions the Public Service, because of their in that ability to secure land on which to settle. Manv' young men trained as farmers, finding ing it impossible to secure blocks of land for themselves, seek employment in our clamour, cities, or are compelled to go to Canada or commendations; New Zealand, where a more reasonable being only part and lancl policy is in operation. I am not conclassification. cerned with the financial institutions who own vast areas of land and want the Government to come to their aid they may run a sheep or two to the acre. I do not think that there are many freegress traders, but some honourable. members who so describe themselves",31
157,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Did not the honourable member at one time describe himself as a free-trader ?,31
158,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I have never stood on a public platform and asked for support on the ground that I was a free-trader.,31
159,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,That is not an answer to my question.,31
160,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member for Lang used to .be a land-taxer and a Labour man. Mr JOHNSON;- I am more of a Labour man than are some who claim to be the : direct representatives of labour.,31
161,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I sbould be pleased if the honourable member would point to any case where I stated that I was a protectionist or a free-trader.,31
162,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I shall do so.»,31
163,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Then I shall be glad to reply. The honourable member for Parramatta. the other day suggested that he could make a damaging statement in regard to myself, but he war, not prepared to indicate what it was. When he does, I shall be very happy to deal with it. The honourable member for Illawarra has submitted an amendment that wire-netting be placed on the free list, yet the section of Tariff Commission to which he belonged holders recommended a duty of 5 per cent.",31

If they did, we should then know they were sincere in their professions.

168,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"But the free-trade section of the Commission is not prepared to stand by their conclusion. They went on to reportOn the other hand, there is evidence that a duty would be a direct tax upon rural industries and would seriously militate against the success-, f u l occupancy of large areas of Australia: That is all very well as a conclusion, but what did this section of the Commission recommend? Turning to page 31 of the report, we find, under the heading of "" Recomendations,"" the following statement- .

So far we have dealt with only a few items in the Tariff, and there is absolutely no warrant for their forcombines. saking the general classification deliberately recommended by them. rather accept a recommendation, made by them at a time when they were able to calmly consider the evidence before them than adopt a proposal made by one of them after an outcry has been raised by a tion of the press against the Government proposition.",32
173,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Does the honourable memthat ber say that he adopts the recommendaand tions of the free-trade section of the mission?,32
174,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I am not adopting them. I am simply pointing out the inconsistency of the free-trade members of the Tariff Comniission. The honourable member for Boothby said that although a protectionist he would vote against the duty on wire-netting, because the industry was not of any magnitude. As a matter of fact, over £500,000 worth of wire-netting was imported last year, and the honorof able member for Lang estimates that the Tariff quantity manufactured locallv was of In other words, something like £1,000,000 worth of wire netting was used in Australia last year, the manufacture of such a larce quantity of netting would provide employfor many men.

If the experiments that we now contemplate are not successful we shall resort to another expedient The leader of the Opposition has told us that it is possible to control trusts and I would do Mr Reid - I have said that we ought to our best to control, them. Mr JH . CATTS - The honourable member has practically jeered at the inability of the United States - of America secto control combines. He has said, "" What about this mighty nation? Can it not control these trusts and combines?"" The inference to be drawn from his remarks was it was a simple matter to control trusts, yet when we talk of controlling manuComfacturers under the new protection some of the right honourable member's followers declare that it is impossible to do so.",32

178,Mr REID,Unknown,We talk of freedom,32
179,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I quite agree under present conditions freedom is possible. Those who cry out for it to know that "" freedom"" as understood by many, people, simply means the right a man to sweat and grind his employees.",33

181,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"We believe that this industry can be effectively controlled, but should experience demonstrate that they cannot be so controlled we shall be able to come forward with a scheme for their nationalization. If the manufac20 turers absolutely refuse to submit to trol in the interests of the people insist upon having a free hand to sweat their employees, we shall be compelled nationalize the industries in which they are engaged. One of the reasons why I favour the new protection is that if the scheme should prove effective it will accomplish a vast amount of good. It will mitigate clusion many of the disabilities under which the operatives and the consumers alike at present labour. But should it fail in its for that. object we can then give effect to a scheme for the nationalization of such industries, with a view to insuring fair treatment the employees and to consumers. As the leader of the Opposition said at Toogress woomba, if we are going to have protection why not establish industries of our own in which proper wages will be paid and connection. proper hours worked? There would be no one to sweat then, because there would no one to make a profit. Last honourable member for Swan exhibited great sympathy with the large land monopolists. He desired to put wire-netting on the free list, notwithstanding that he was returned to this Parliament as a Minister pledged to support a protectionist Administration.",33
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Was not the honourable member for Adelaide a protectionist, and did he not put wire-netting upon free list?",33

185,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"After the honourable member's change of front we scarcely know whether he would be prepared to the Labour Party. that support the payment of a bonus to the imwire-netting industry if such a proposal ought were put forward. He did not manifest such great concern for the primary indusof tries .when the first Commonwealth Tariff was under consideration. Eor example, I find that on the 16th January, 1902, It is when it was proposed to levy a duty of 25 got a per cent, upon engines, boilers, and pumps, and an amendment was moved to place the item upon the free list, the honourable member paired against the amendment, and the motion was lost by thirty votes to nineteen. Again, on the 9th April, 1902, he then voted against a proposal to reduce the duty upon mining machinery, n.e.i., from to 15 per cent.

193,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Mr Bent is doing that now.,34
194,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I hold in my hand an estimate, of Mr Bent's undertaking, which sets out the capital required to start the manufacture of wire-netting. The only difference between the amount that would be needed under his scheme-which , by the way, does not commend itself to meand that required under a proper scheme for its nationalization would be accounted for by the fact that he would get his labour for nothing, whereas we should have to pay for it. Mr Martin, the Secretary of the Public Works Department of Victoria, estimates that the erection of a plant, including house, machinery, and appliances, would be £7,000. This plant would be .capable of turning out sixteen miles of 42-in. width 17-gauge netting per week-, equal to 22.2-5 to n s this netting weighs 28 cwt., of which 24 - cwt. consists of wire, and 4 cwt. of zinc {galvanizing). The cost of wire delivered is £ 1 4 ios. per ton, and of zinc £ 3 1 12s. per ton. Mr Martin considers that the cost of a week's operations, resulting in the production of 22.2-5 tons of wire-netting, would be as follows:-Ra w materials, wire and zinc, £379 ios.; labour, one exipert at £ 4 ios., and thirty men at an average wage of £ 2 , £ 6 4 ios.; allowance for wear and tear, and depreciation in value of plant, at 10 per cent, per annum, £ 1 3 9s. 4d. j or a total of £457 9s. 4d. That represents the cost of manufacturing 22.2-5 tons, so that the cost per ton would average £ 2 0 8s. 5d. If we add to that, interest on capital at 5 per cent, per annum per ton of output, it would represent 5s. 6d., and 2 per cent, as office and selling costs would represent 8s. 2d. ; so that the estimated cost of placing one ton of wire-netting upon the market would be £ 2 1 2s. rod.  Lysaght Brothers charge? Mr J, H . CATTS - About £ 2 6 .  .£30 a ton for rabbit-proof netting. Mr J. H. CATTS - Thei r quotation for 36-in. wire of i j - in. mesh is £ 2 6 ios. per ton. The cost of the 42-in. wire is set down at £ 3 1 per ton, or £ 3 0 ios. upon trucks. The Treasurer stated that, at the present time, Messrs. Lysaght Brothers were selling wire-netting, 42 inches wide, with i£-in. mesh, at £ 3 0 ios. per ton. He added that they had agreed to alwayskeep the price down to £ 1 per ton less than that charged for the imported article.",34
195,Mr REID,Unknown,He did not say that.,34
196,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Mr Martin statesI have endeavoured to make liberal allowance . for all costs, and I calculate that the annual profit on outlay, including plant, material, labour, allowance for wear and tear, and selling cost, would be 7.15 per cent. Mr WILSON,-Does the estimate which the honourable member has quoted refer to the Pentridge factory ?",34
197,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Yes .,34
198,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Will the union label be placed upon the wire-netting manufactured there ?,34

Mr Martin continues- A mile of This is on a very small scale of operations. A larger plant would, perhaps, return quite 8 per cent, per annum. In England raw material would cost less; labour would also be cheaper. Against these are c.i.f. charges, which would amount to about £ 2 per ton. I say, again, that if , under the new protection scheme, we cannot control the manufacturers of wire-netting-if we cannot insure that the consumer shall be called upon to pay only a fair price for this material, and that the operatives engaged in the industry shall receive a living wagethe State should establish its own works. I am sure that if the industry were nationalized it would be able to produce quite as good, if not a better, article than that manufactured by private enterprise, and any profit that might accrue from the undertaking would find its way into the Treasury.",34

206,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [5.16] - I am sorry that some remarks of the honourable member for Cook compel me to take up a little time in reply. I refer, of course, to the honourable member's accusation against the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission of departing from their own recommendations as regards this classification. I haye no doubt that I shall have to return to this subject many times before debate is ended, because every protectionist member, who may have been absent when I explained the position, will probably find their classification a very useful means of attack. The position that the free-trade members of the Tariff Commission occupy in connection with - this classification is so simple, and, at the time, so sound, that I have no hesitation whatever in explaining it as often as it may be necessary for the benefit of the Committee. The honourable member for - Flinders today pointed out to the Government the serious disability under which honourable members labour in considering this particular recommendation. That honourable member, with a great deal of force, urged that we were beginning at the wrong end in the consideration of the item of netting-that there were other matters which ought to have been dealt with before we fix the duty on this commodity. It was exactly such a consideration as' that which caused the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission to draw up a classification;, in a friendly attitude towards the Government, whom it would have enabled, in our opinion, to place before the House a Tariff which would have been scientific in its incidence, and which would probably have been disposed of at a much earlier date than is possible under present circumstances. Under the system suggested by the free-trade section of the Commission, the Tariff could have been made either moderately protective, highly protective, or merely a revenue Tariff; whatever rates of duties might, have been selected, the Government would have found a method by which to build up a Tariff containing none of the anomalies and absurdities which, I feel bound to say, will be found in the present Tariff when it is completed. It is true that in the classification of the free-trade section of. the Tariff Commission, wire-netting was subject to a duty of 5 per cent, j and we have been twitted"" with the fact that most of those free-trade members intend to vote that the commodity shall be'placed on the free list. The position is like that .which would arise if the Government had taken a - brick out of a house that I had built, and, having put it into an> erection of their own, asked me to come along and approve of the latter as my owrt building. The Government have taken a brick out of the erection of the free-trade section of the Commission, and put it in> the their own building, saying, "" There you. are, gentlemen; there is a building that' contains one brick of yours, and you ought: to admire the structure."" But we decline very respectfully to do anything of the sort. However, I say, in reply to the honourable member for Cook that, if the Government, or any one else who desires tosame see a scientific Tariff, are prepared toadopt our systemi of classification in its' entirety, I shall, although there are several1 anomalies in it, and several duties which I should not be prepared to support individually, vote for every particular item as it stands.",35
207,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It is a great idea for a free-trader to talk about a revenue Tariff with this enthusiasm!,35
208,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"The honourable memwireber knows that I am now a strong advocate for the new protection, and that I can even claim to have led the Government into the right path by. some amendments which I proposed in the anti-trust legislation of last year. Although I am here as a Labour representative, I must say I am getting somewhat tired of listening to this claptrap about the necessity of protecting the worker in this particular industry by a. high duty. It has been shown this afternoon, that even if Germany-to the competition of which members like the honourable member for Batman so much object-di d this work for nothing, 7 per cent, would more than equalize the difference as represented by the wages.",35
209,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Something more could be said on that point.,35
210,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I dare say that if there had been anything more to say, the honor-' able member would have said it ; but I take it that he dealt with the subject, from his own stand-point, in the most effective way of which he was capable. At any rate, considering that 7 per cent, would cover the whole cost of labour, I fail to see any necessity, in the interests of the workers, for any higher duties. Honourable members who talk of a higher duty must be thinking of some other interests than those of the - workers. . Mr JH CATTS - The duty now proposed is only 10 per cent, against Great Britain, and the honourable member for Lang says that the bulk of the wire-netting - comes from there. ' Mr FOWLER- I agree with the honourable member for Lang on that point; but it issingular that we hear so little in this squatters. connection from those who talk of a higherduty. On the contrary, it is the foreigner whom those honourable members desire to keep out of the market, and not the manufacturers of Great Britain. The preference scheme amounts, according to a confession by one protectionist before the Tariff Commission, to a prohibitive wall against Great Britain, and an ornamental - coping on the top against the foreigner. I ask honourable members, who hesitate about placing the white workers of Australia in competition with the workers of Germany, whether they intend free men in Australia to work in .competition with unfortunate prisoners in Pentridge gaol? Is that the idea? There is no doubt that the Government of Victoria intend to establish this industry in the principal gaol of the State, and I , for one, do not desire to see free, honest men in competition with those engaged in what the State Government intends to make the occupation of criminals. In view of other facts that have been placed before honourable members, showing that' there is much.more labour involved in the erection of wire-netting, if it can be obtained at reasonable cost, than in its mere manufacture, I believe that, if there is any virtue in protection, the policy' ought to be applied to the greatest number. _ If protectionists are true to their own principles, they will follow the example of the honourable member for Batman, who, having a large confectionery establishment in his electorate, voted for the introduction of glucose free of duty. That is undoubtedly common-sense protection; and yet a good many protectionist members gird at the free-traders as being more or less inconsistent. I expect I shall have an opportunity to retort on some of those protectionists more than once before the Tariff is disposed of. The honourable member for Cook thinks that the rabbits might be allowed to run the squatters out of the country. I have strong objection to the man who takes up an area of land which might be occupied by many more human beings - with advantage to themselves and to the country. But I believe in changing the present conditions, from which Australia undoubtedly suffers, by an honest and straightforward method. I hold the opinion that even a squatter ought to be treated according to the rules of ordinary justice.  times more small farmers than it does",35
211,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"But even assuming this to be altogether a squatters' question, I say,_ in regard to the evil of squarterdom, that we have no right to create conditions which would enable the rabbits to do what we cannot honestly and straightforwardly do for ourselves: But I do not agree with those who say that this is merely a squatters' question. It is. unfortunate that many honourable members have addressed themselves to this subject from a very local point of view; but, seeing that they have clone so, it is necessary for me to add more local colour, so that by-ana-by we may have a general blend applicable to the whole of the Commonwealth. I come from Western Australia, the whole.of the southwestern portion of which, with very few exceptions, is being taken up in comparatively small areas. Although there are no rabbits in that part of Western Australia, the settlers there suffer from the dingo pest, and many of them are compelled to wire-net their holdings. The honourable member for Cook says that the imposition of the duty will impose a tax of only £ 1 5 on the farmer who has 640 acres to wirenet.",36
212,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,If he pavs the duty.,36
213,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,I think that the local manufacturers will see that the price is increased to not very much below the duty.,36
214,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,What about the new protection ?,36
215,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It will benefit the workers in protected industries, but I doubt if it will reach the farmers in the interior of Western Australia.",36
216,Mr SALMON,Unknown,What is the height of & dingo-proof fence?,36
217,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I do not know; but it. is a fact that selectors in Western Australia have to erect netting to keep the dingoes off their land. Is it any satisfaction to a man who,, because of the duty, has had to P £ * 5 more to wire-net 640 acres, to be av told that that is only 15s. a year if spread over a term of twentv years? Is the honourable member prepared to recoup the amount to any of these unfortunate selectors, seeing that to do so would mean very little if the payments were spread over a long time? Mr J. H. CATTS - In New Wales, the Government is spreading the payments over a period of ten years.",36
218,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"In Western Australia, which I think the honourable member will acknowledge as part'of the Commonwealth, no such concessions are given by the Government, and the settlers there have a right to expect that this proposal will be considered on its merits.",37
219,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Messrs . Lysaght Brothers will not give any such concession.,37
220,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"It is a most ineffective argument to say that the tax, if spread over a number of years, will amount to only a few shillings per annum. These people cannot spread it over a number of years, and many of them have to look at every £ i they spend, because their capital is very limited, so that an addition of £ 1 5 to the cost of their wire-netting will be a very serious thing to them. No doubt, the effect of the duty will be that many persons will be prevented from using wire-netting, and thus settlement may be retarded. However, as the debate has been so fengthv, I shall not say more on the subject. I do not think that votes are changed by the speeches which are made in this Chamber) and I am becoming very cynical as to the effect on the views of members of parliamentary discussions. In my opinion, they might be curtailed with great advantage to the country. . Mr BAMFORD (Herbert) [5.34]-- I agree with the honourable member for Perth that 'nothing that may be said is likely to influence votes, but it is necessary that members should, on occasions, state their reasons for voting in a certain direction. I shall vote for the highest duty on wire-netting that I can get. I am sorry that the Government has agreed to a reduction of the original rates proposed. With regard to what has been said about the making of wire-netting in a Victorian prison, I think that the Minister would be well advised to propose an Excise duty, which would enable the Commonwealth to control these operations. Mr ""HUTCHISON - Why not give the farmers the benefit of them?",37
221,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It may be urged that the competition of the wire-netting produced in Pentridge will cause Messrs. Lysaght Brothers to reduce their prices, to the consequent benefit of the farmer.. But as this Parliament has enacted that goods made in prisons abroad shall under no circumstances be ""admitted into AusSouth tralia, I am opposed to the making of goods in Australian prisons. If an Excise duty were imposed on wire-netting, and the Government of Victoria desired! to have it made in the prisons of this State,, it would be compelled to pay the regulation rates of wages. The speeches of members of the Opposition must lead a stranger to conclude that those who support the Ministry desire to prevent the farmers from getting wire-netting cheap ;but, as one who has the interests of our settlers at heart, I say that we shall bedoing them the best service by imposing, a high duty on wire-netting, because that will _ cheapen its cost. When the first Commonwealth Tariff was under consideration, the honourable member for Adelaideproposed a duty on cement of is. per cwt., or about 3s. per cask, which Parliament in its wisdom or unwisdom reduced too,d. per cwt., or about 2s. 6d. per cask. Theprice of cement at the time was 13s - 6d. per cask, and it was argued that the pricewould be increased by the amount of the duty, which would have brought it up ta 16s. a cask. But what has happened?"" I take the facts which I am about to relate from the Sydney Morning Herald, afree-trade newspaper. In an article published in that journal a short time ago, it was stated that the Portland CementCompany of New South Wales paid 13s 6d. a cask for the cement which it used' in establishing its works, and that it is now supplying better cement at ios. a cask. The writer also states that the. Governmentof the State has saved £30,000 by using local cement in the construction of theCataract dam.  the honourable member has to nurse.",37
222,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It-is a real good,, healthy baby, and a credit to its parents.",37
223,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,A similar result has; followed the imposition of a duty on plough shares.  the duty on harvesters ?,37
224,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Many similar examples could be given, but none more conclusive than that which I have mentioned.. * It is admitted on all hands that the result of the duty on cement has been todecrease the price of that article, and asimilar result will follow the imposition* of a duty on wire-netting. The honourable member for Boothby stated last night that the New South Wales industry has grown to its present proportions without the assistance of protected duties, but, according to the Statistical Register of New South Wales there was a duty of 5 per cent, on wire-netting in 1887 or 1888 when the industry was established. The JenningsDibbs Government was then in office, but the previous P.arkes Government- a free trade Administration-ha d imposed a duty of 20s. per ton on wire work. Besides, those who are conversant with the affairs of New South Wales must know that differential railway rates in favour of locally manufactured articles, such as wire-netting and galvanized iron, ruled there even when the - present leader of the Opposition was in office. I am sorry that the Government has suggested a reduction of these duties. I shall vote for a rate of 15 per cent, against all imports, abolishing the preference, and if that be not carried, I shall vote for the highest rate that I can get. hope that the Treasurer will stiffen his back as regards this duty, and that he will also take into consideration my suggestion to impose an Excise on wire-netting, to enable the Commonwealth to control prison manufacture.",37
225,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Darling) [5.45] - I do not think that the solution of the whole social problem is involved in this question, or that the position of the States in regard to closer settlement will be seriously affected whether we impose a duty on wire netting or place it on the free list. In any event, we must have closer settlement. When the first Federal Tariff was under consideration, the principle which guided us in determining the rates of duty to be imposed was that some protection should be given to industries already in existence which needed assistance, but that the requirements of the people on the land should be absolutely free. Wire-netting was therefore placed on the free list, and I have heard nothing during this debate to satisfy me that we should depart from the decision then arrived at. Even if the wire netting industry is a going concern, we have to consider whether it really needs protection, and whether, in the absence of a protective duty, it would be crushed out. ' As a matter of fact, the wire-netting industry was in existence in New South Wales when the first Federal Tariff was under consideration; but we then heard nothing about it . It is a remarkable fact that Lysaght Brothers did not see fit to give evidence before the Tariff Commission. The Commission visited Sydney and other cities, and invited every one concerned to appear before it, yet no representative of the company in question saw fit to go before it and submit himself for cross examination. I do not believe in attaching much importance to ex - parte statements by those who have neglected an opportunity to give evidence 'before a ""body of men who could submit them to the test of cross-examination. It is true that one of the company's experts, receiving the remarkably high wage of 42s. per week, went before the Commission, but he could say nothing as to the profits of the company or the lines upon which it conducted its business. We are now asked to impose a duty in favour of a company which has enjoyed a monopoly, and which' has not been paying extravagant wages.",38
226,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,How could it pay I high wages?,38
227,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member ought to know that wages have no relation to profits. Some companies, making very large profits, pay very low wages. Apparently Lysaght Brothers were so well satisfied with existing conditions that they did not think it necessary to go before a Commission specially appointed to inquire into the conditions of Australian industries to ask for a duty. One honourable member seems to think that it is undesirable to allow wire-netting to be used for rabbitproof fencing purposes. He spoke of the rabbits as being a good thing, and a source of profit. If he paid a visit to my electorate, he would have his eyes opened to the true position. I happen to have within my constituency the greatest number of persons directly interested in this question. They comprise, not big pastoralists, but the smaller men, who are entitled to expect the support of the Labour Party. These . men carry on operations in the western part of the Central Division of New South Wales, and their holdings are within the drought area. The Government subdivided the land in that part of the district into blocks of 2,560 acres, and a little further on they offered blocks of from 5,000 to 10,oooacres to settlers. Those holdings have been settled. A number of Victorian farmers, who were sturdy protectionists, and whose knowledge of farming could not be gainsaid, took up land in the neighbourhood of the Bogan River. Every one of them went there with plenty of money, yet today they are practically down to their last copper. Their losses have been due, not to want of skill or - enterprise, but to purely adverse conditions. I suppose that the 2,560-acre blocks were intended for mixed farming; yet I know of holders of such blocks who have not had a hoof on their land for five years. I wish to appeal to the Committee on 'behalf of these people. Representatives of metropolitan constituencies seem to know nothing of the actual situation in rural districts. The erstwhile Victorian farmers to whom I have referred, although stout protectionists, are crying out against this impost. I have received letters from every Farmers' and Settlers' Association in my electorate, and have presented to the House a petition from fifty-four shire councils in New South Wales, praying that these duties be removed. The farmers and settlers are absolutely unanimous in their opposition to the duties on wire-nettirig. I suppose that the men to whom I have referred, on an average, do not enjoy more than three good - seasons out of ten. When they do have the good fortune to be blessed with a good season,, and secure some grass, the rabbit comes along and eats it up. I have just returned from the Trangie district, where the farmers just now have, to combat, not only rabbits, but a plague of - grasshoppers. One could pick up bucketfuls of grasshoppers from the ruts along the road. Imagine the position of men who put in a crop, not"" knowing whether they are likely to have any rain, or when theiT work may be destroyed by rabbits or grasshoppers. It may be true that some years ago wire-netting was used mostly by the pastoralist. The Australian rabbit, however, is more enterprising than any of his brothers in other lands. It has been said that he can climb trees and get over a wire fence. He has, at all events, worked his way from the pastoral areas into the farming districts. Last year I saw magnificent crops being destroyed by rabbits, and t-he pest is working its way from the wheat growing centre of Naromine right down to Bathurst. In these circumstances, therefore, the bond fide farmer has been forced to buy wire-netting. As a matter of fact, in the trans-Darling, wire-netting is not of . much use in combating the pest. There sand-drifts are formed by the wind, and bury the fences. I have driven over a - stock-yard 'fence entirely covered with sand, and, on some runs, have seen sand ridges as high as the homestead. . I have also Mr Spence. seen a place wheTe a wire fence was buried in the sand within three years of its erection, and another fence erected on top of it. What nonsense it is to talk of this item being one that affects only the big man. The smaller settler also needs wire-netting, and must have it. The Victorian farmers found that in the Bogan River district the soil was rich, and paid no heed to the big pastoralists, who told them that the rainfall was insufficient. They were inclined to believe that the pastoralists, as they sometimes do, simply desired to discourage them from taking up the land, but they have since found that the statement was absolutely justified. The Government of New South Wales let a contract for the supply of 4,000 miles of wire-netting, and Mr Ashton,. ex-Minister of Lands in New South Wales, states that applications have been received by the Government for 9,000 miles of netting. No private firm could give the farmers wire-netting on the easy terms upon'which the Government are able to supply it. The advance of socialistic thought in New South Wales has led the Government to come to the assistance ot the settlers. A practical man, writing to the Stock and Station Journal, gives an estimate of the cost of enclosing with wire netting a small area. Taking-the case of a farmer who desires to enclose an area of 40 acres, he estimates that the cost of the wire-netting which he would requireplus the duty originally proposed by the Government-woul d be £ 5 0 ; that the cost of the fence to carry the netting would be £ 1 5 ; and'the cost of the wire about £ 7 ; or a total of £ 7 2 , equal to 36s. per acre. In the Bogan River district a man cannot make a living on a 5,000-acre block, and yet it is said that, it would be nothing to ask holders of such blocks, many of whom are in an impoverished condition, to pay these duties. Something like 16,000 of my electors require wire-netting, whilst, on the other hand, only 400 persons are employed . in the wire-netting industry. Are we to have no regard for the iC,ooo farmers and settlers? Is all tlv; considerationto be extended to the 400 men and boys engaged in this industry ? I should like honourable members to recollect the principle which guided us in framing the first Commonwealth Tariff. I notice that the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommend the imposition of duties upon such - articles as bags, sacks, tents, tarpaulins, hessian, and wire netting. They even recommend the taxation of the working man's regalia, of the pipes of organs such as are used in churches, and of brass instruments which are used in town bands. I should like the honourable member for Lang to recollect this fact, because, when he twitted the Labour Party with supporting the present Government he did not say a word about the only alternative which confronts us. When the Kingston Tariff was under review in 1902, a good deal of agricultural machinery which was not manufactured in Australia was placed upon the free list, so that the user might obtain it as cheaply as possible. If we do not assist those who are already settled upon the land, a number of the holders of small areas will be driven off them. We shall then find ourselves in this position: We shall have established a wire-netting industry, but there will be. nobody to purchase that material. I am speaking from personal knowledge of the circumstances of a large number of settlers.. I have had an opportunity of learning their exact condition, and I say, without hesitation, that they ought to receive first consideration at our hands. Unless we do our best for them, they will disappear from the land entirely. In my opinion, the wire-netting Industry can be encouraged far better by the payment of a bonus than it can by the imposition of a protective duty. At the present time there is only one firm engaged in the industry, and it is paying its operatives very low wages. if it is unable to successfully carry on when it possesses a monopoly of the trade, I do not thinlc that a duty of 5 per cent, upon wire-netting will help it very materially. If we had the absolute facts before us, it would probably be found that the industry can get along without any assistance whatever. It is scarcely fair to. charge the Premier of Victoria witn being a competitor in this industry. understand that he intends to supply the farmers of this State with cheap wire-netting, but it is not to be inferred for a moment that he intends to enter into competition with the manufacturers of that article in the open market. I hold that to have a monopoly is worth a great deal to any firm.",38
228,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Messrs. Brothers are not to have a monopoly, because a factory is about to start in South Australia.",40
229,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,It is all very well to say that a factory is about to start. The statement of the honourable member reminds me of that of the man who had millions of pounds in his pocket.,40
230,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Barbed-wir e is being, manufactdred in South' Australia at the present time, and the building for the manufacture of wire-netting is in course of erection.",40
231,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"0 1 course, if we i m -. pose a sufficiently high protective duty we shall encourage other competitors to enter the field. I contend that if we - promote closer settlement the rabbit pest can be easily dealt with. It stands to reason; therefore, that after a time the demand for wire-netting will probably diminish. Consequently that article can hardly be in cluded in the same category as other Australian productions which we desire to encourage. The wire-netting industry is not one which will grow with the increase of population, as will most industries. The new protection scheme puts a different complexion on the Tariff generally, and if I thought that there was any real danger of the wire-netting industry Being destroyed,, my view upon this question would be very materially .modified. But I see nothing to justify the belief that it cannot live and succeed under similar conditions to those which have existed since Federation was accomplished.",40
232,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Does not the honourable member want it to expand?,40
233,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"It is expanding. Iir would be cheaper to buy Messrs. Lysaght Brothers out and to pay thetr hands £ 5 a week for being idle than to impose a high duty upon wire-netting. Mr HUTCHISON"" - The same argument would apply to three-fourths of our industries.",40
234,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,I cannot conceive that J the industry will be seriously affected by placing wire-netting upon the free list.. The evidence available to us is that it has lived and thrived,40
235,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"And lost £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",40
236,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"I have never heard of that. I cannot accept ex - parte statements. Why did not the principals in the industryappear before the Tariff Commission, and give evidence to that effect? I take no Lysaght notice of these wild statements. I attach as much importance to them as I do to the statement of the man who declared that he intended to withdraw £10,000,00 0 from Australia because of the influence of the Labour Party in politics. We all know that it does not require a very large .amount of capital to embark upon the wire-netting industry, and the increased demand offers a fair return for investment. - Mr THOM AS (Barrier) [6.15'] - I confess that I am in somewhat of a dilemma as to how to vote on this item, in view of the Government proposal to reduce the duty. If the Government had attempted to press the duty they first proposed, I should have had no hesitation in voting for placing wire-netting on the free list. But the. Government have consented to make a big reduction; and, before casting my vote, I should like to know from .the Treasurer whether a duty of 10 per cent., as against Great Britain, and 15 per cent., as against foreign countries, is regarded by him as protective, or merely as revenue producing. If the reduced duty is regarded as sufficiently protective to enable the manufacture to be carried on in Australia, it was, in my opinion, unfair, and, I might say, almost idiotic to, in the first instance, propose a duty of 25 per cent, and 30 per cent. I am not prepared to support a duty which is merely revenue producing, on wire-netting, or commodity. At any rate, it would be scandalous to impose a revenue duty on wire-netting; and, before we go further, I should like an answer to the question I have asked. If I ami told by the Treasurer that the lower duty now suggested is sufficiently protective, I shall not object to its being imposed. The only justification for the existence of the present Ministry, is their protectionist policy.",40
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Before the discussion closes on this item; I shall answer the question of the honourable member.,41
238,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"There may possibly be some advantage in having wire-netting locally manufactured, and, therefore, if a 10 per cent, duty will assist to that end, it shall have my support. I take it that the Government now regard a duty of 10 per cent, as sufficient to enable the wire-netting industry to be carried on in Australia, because, otherwise, it was for the Treasurer to adhere to the original proposal.",41
239,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The inference is that the Government have given up their protectionist policy in regard to this item.,41
240,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I want to know whether that is so or not. It may be that the Government have obtained some further information which indicates that a duty of 10 per cent, is sufficiently protective; if not, they should have proposed a higher duty. Whether I should support the Government in imposing a higher duty is, of course, another question. I am opposed to anv preference being given under this Tariff, because, in my opinion, whatever duties are imposed ought to. apply all round. Although I am not a protectionist, I am prepared, under this Tariff, to give fair and reasonable protection in the case of commodities which can be manufactured in Australia, but, in the case of commodities which cannot be manufactured here, I shall vote for their being placed on the free list, no matter from what country they come.",41
241,Mr REID,Unknown,Anythin g can be manufactured here.,41
242,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I spoke of reasonable protection; I "" am to be the judge of what is reasonable, and I think I may say the Government will not find me too exacting. The Treasurer, when in England, talked a great deal in favour of preferential trade; but I do not know whether he made it clear, as he did after his return to Australia, that he is anxious that everything possible shall be manufactured in Australia. any other Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I made that clear enough in England.",41
243,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Treasurer does not desire wire-netting to be imported.,41
244,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I take it that the Treasurer does not desire wire-netting to be imported, even from England.",41
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If wire-netting has to Le imported, I would ratheT it came from England than from any other country.",41
246,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I think honourable members are of the same opinion; and I take it that the honourable gentleman's policy, and the policy of the majority of honourable members, is that everything that can be reasonably made in Australia, shall be made here. If a duty of only 5 per cent, were imposed, there would be no necessity for preference, because it would be only a revenue duty. Under all the circumstances, I shall vote against any preference in regard to this or any other item, simply supporting those duties which I am assured wil l enable manufactures to be carried on in Australia. Sitting susfended from 6.30 to 7-45 f-m.",41
247,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [7.45]-- I do not intend to add to what has been said in regard to the proposed duties on wire-netting, but as, if we'let the item pass as proposed to be amended by the honourable member for Riverina, our action will amount to an admission of the advisability of the adoption of the principle of preference, I intend, as one who is opposed to that course, to state my views on the subject as shortly as possible. The matter, affecting as it does our Imperial relations, is one of the most important which can come under our attention. The preferences given last year applied to only £1,473,189 worth of British imports, {he total imports from the United Kingdom, in 1905, being £23,074,717; and of those affected, only £790,607 compete with foreign imports. Therefore, what was then agreed to was merely a petty modification of the principle of protection in favour of one of the biggest consumers of our exports, even if it were not the country, which, with real significance, we continue to refer to in the language of affection as "" Home."" The principle of reciprocal commercial concessions is now proposed to be substituted for the ties of affection and blood which have withstood every strain of Empire so well. I intend to state my objections to this recognition of Chamberlainism with as much effect as I can, while curtailing my remarks to an extent that the necessities of expedition justify. Honourable members will bear in mind that the question was raised in a speech made by Mr Chamberlain in, I think, May, 1903, in which he laid it down that preference must become the basic principle of Empire; that the Empire would fall to pieces unless it becamecommercially self-contained; that, in fact, unless we went, through reciprocal preferences, to an intermediate stage of free-trade between British possessions, and ultimate political union, the days of the Empire would be numbered. On the 8th December, 1904, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth took up the tune, and in a series of resolutions declared, in effect, that the proposals of the then Secretary of State for the Colonies must increase the unity and power of the Empire I am pleased that some months ago the House of Commons absolutely repudiated the principle of preference as having anything to do withour continued Imperial integrity. If one had to rely merely upon expert authority as to the unwisdom of preference, I could quote several in support of my position. Let me first refer to Mulhall. He says thatAny attempt at an Imperial zollverein between Great Britain ancl her Colonies would be ruinous to the latter, and would ultimately break up the Empire. . In an article in the Spectator it is said that anything of the sort "" would act as a destructive force, and nothing else."" Lord. Rosebery, speaking on the 13th December, 1903, said that the return to protection through the preferential duties advocated by Mr Chamberlain was "" a blow which must be fatal to the majestic structure of our commerce, ancl of our Empire."" If we require proofs for those statements we mav find them in English experience. Great Britain recognized preferences up to sixty years ago, when they were abolished. In 1842, speaking on one of the first motions for their abolition, Lord Grey made a declaration which is applicable to the present momentIndustry should cease to be diverted from its natural channels, and a useless burden imposed on the consumer by different duties levied for the purpose of favoring colonial produce in our markets and our produce in the markets of the world. England abolished preferences in i860, while France and other countries have continued to grant them to their colonies; but the condemnation of the system is to be found in the fact that the external trade of British possessions is about ten times that of those of France. In 1842 a duty of 3s. a quarter was imposed on wheat imported from the United States into Great Britain, and a duty of is. on that imported from Canada, a preference of 2s. in favour of the Dominion. In 1846, when the corn laws were repealed, that preference, of course, ceased. The Canadians strongly remonstrated, and almost talked of secession, so that Mr. Gladstone was obliged to mention in a despatch, dated 3rd June, 1846That it would be a source of the greatest pain to Her Majesty's Government if they could share in the impression that the connection between this country and Canada derived its vitality from no other source than the exchange of commercial preference. It seems to me that, when the real force fails upon which the unity of the Empire depends, when the subtle, magnetic, and attractive influences of race, tradition, and common destiny, which operate among nations as the domestic affections do among families, begin to wane, then, and not until then, need we feel anxiety as to the stability of the Imperial framework, or fear that the greatest alliance of self governing communities which the world has ever known, is approaching its dissolution. When sentiment fails, it will be idle to think that Acts of Parliament, or the power of purse can do anything to check the inevitable disintegration. The bane at present is that everything is measured by the mercantile standard. Let me refer to a resolution-on e of a class passed each year by this body-agree d to iby the Chamber of Commerce at its meeting in London on the 9th July, 1906. The members of that bodv then affirmed that the bonds of union would be strengthened by preferences. This reliance upon commercial preferences for the continued integrity of the Empire is expressed by bodies whose members have a direct pecuniary interest in the policy which they say they regard as the true nexus of Empire. Happily, the nation is not altogether imbued with the shop-keeping spirit and sentiment, and at the last elections it rejected, by an overwhelming majority, the declaration of the basic principle of connection contained in the resolution just referred to. In an article in the North American Review of last year, a Canadian protectionist writesIn Canada they want not to abolish the British preference or even reduce the percentage of preference, but to raise the general Tariff so high that when the preference is allowed the minimum Tariff will be high enough to set off the greater cost of labour and higher rates of interest, thus placing the Canadian manufacturer - on an equality with the British competitor. That was. the explanation of the protectionist policy of ' Canada given by a leading protectionist at a time when, I believe, the Canadian Minister of Customs was introducing a change from a 33^ per cent, preference to the present system of differentiating according to the item, which is the principle which we"" are asked to adopt. The best of the British writers at the present time condemn the principle of preference. Let me give an extract from an article dealing with the result of the Imperial Conference which was published in the Edinburgh Review of July, 1907To our thinking the safest condition of that magniticent and unique political entity called the British Empire,, is that it should remain as Amorphous as possible, and that it is best described and will be most safely maintained as a number of practically independent States, acknowledging one sovereign, bound together by - unembarrassing ties of blood and origin, and of - consequent affection, filial and parental. There is no doubt that if the political goal which is the objective of Mr Chamberlain and those who follow him is ever attained, in. the matters delegated we shall lose our independence of judgment and decision. It means the submission of questions in relation to which we now have an absolute Mr Glynn. voice to the majority vote of a body in which we shall ultimately have representation in 'proportion to ' population. Might I remind honourable members that just before the opening of the last Imperial Conference a very strong series of articles appeared in the London Times, declaring the true objective of those advocating prefer 7 ence. In an article on the Conference and Imperial unity which appeared in*the issue of 12th April, 1907, a writer dwelt particularly upon the great burden of the defence vote, which is practically borne entirely by the Imperial power. After an elaboration of the position as regards what he considered to be the true nexus of Empire and the necessity of the dependencies of the Crown and its Colonial possessions recognising their liability for a more eauitable contribution towards naval defence, he continued The whole position is an impossible one, and cannot last. Some solution of the difficulty must be found. The one is separation, the other Imperial partnership. The colonies must become absolutely independent States, conducting the whole of their external affairs without interference and without help, or else they must become equal nartners in a united Empire, based upon the principle of mutual support and joint responsibility. There can be no final solution which stops short of the two alternative conclusions. I merely give this as a statement of what is in view in connection with the policy of preference. It is the deliberate pronouncement of the leading organ of public opinion in England, so far as the press can be assumed to be an organ of public opinion. What is meant, supposing that' we are brought into the political net of Mr Chamberlain and the Times? The naval expenditure of the United Kingdom is 15s. 5^d. per head of its population, and the average per head of the seven colonies is 6d., and that of the Commonwealth is. 3jd. If , as the Times probably desires, our contribution to naval defence were upon a per capita contribution of the white citizens of the Empire, instead of being is"". 3jd. it would be us. or 12s. per head.",41
248,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"That would mean equal control, or in other words a control equal to our contribution.",43
249,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"We should have, as I have just said, whatever control we were entitled to, either on the basis of wealth and' population or on that of population alone. The corollary of that would be that we should have, on the subject matters in relation to which we now speak with the independent voice of Australia, to submit ourselves to the rule of the majority. Let us consider for a moment the position of the mother country. It is a country of vast responsibilities. If the politics of any of its dependencies give rise to international troubles, the burden of the responsibility has to be. borne by the home country. Wo all remember the tremendous outlay- I think it was £235,060,000-in curred by England in connection with the Boer war. That was a colonial war, in which she had no direct interest; but up to the present she has practically borne every penny of the direct outlay, represented by payments out of revenue, and the debt incurred. I believe that the responsibility as to £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 which was to be undertaken by the new self-governing colonies of South Africa is still merely a 'possibility, rather than a real burden shifted from the Imperial taxpayers to the Colonies in question.",43
250,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,If we granted Great Britain this preference we should net increase her burdens.,44
251,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"This means the beginning of a systemadvocated by Mr Chamberlain. It is not for us to embarrass the Liberal Party at Home by giving Mr . Chamberlain and his party an opportunity to say that we have made a specific offer of preference to the mother land. If we do, we shall put the Conservatives, in a strong position when they attempt to renew the agitation for reciprocal preference. The position is that France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Japan, during the last twenty or thirty years, nave become powerful competitors with the United Kingdom for the trade of the' world. Nevertheless, Great Britain has 38 per cent, of the total external' trade of France, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom. That being so, we are not galled upon to make any petty preference for the purpose of strengthening her sogalled waning supremacy. The imports of Great Britain in 1906 were of the value of £607,000,000 , and 76.6 per cent, of those imports came from foreign countries, only 23.4 per cent, coming from British Possessions. If we glance at the comparison of percentages of imports from 1854 to 1906, we find that they are practically constant, and therefore, as being, apparently, natural commercial relations, ought not to be disturbed by any new system. In addition to that, the effects of the unfettered policy of the mother country justify a continuance of the old system. The exports of the United Kingdom, deducting re-exports, are equal to £ 8 15s. per head, those of Germany to£ 5 2s. i d . per head, France £ 5 3s. 6d. per head, and America £ 4 12s. 4d. per head* of the population. That is very strong evidence that there is no necessity to make any petty concessions in favour of the mother country. Let us take the positions of Australia. It was said during the disr cussion at - the Imperial Conference early this year that Great Britain's trade with Australia was gradually diminishing. I think that the present Federal Treasurer, in a speech extending from page 325 to P ge 330 of the Minutes of the Proceeda ings, gave a rather doleful description ot the position of the mother country, in so far as her exports to her possessions were concerned, The burden of his tale was that, unless some system of reciprocal preference were instituted, the mother country would go to the wall.",44
252,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Did he say that her exports were diminishing, or that the relative increase in them was not being maintained ?",44
253,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have not the exact > words used by the Treasurer, but the effect of his speech was that the exports of B r i tish products-and I think he was dealing with manufactured products-to British. Possessions, and especially to Australia, were gradually diminishing.",44
254,Mr SALMON,Unknown,That would be an incorrect statement.,44
255,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I repeat that I have not at hand a report of the exact words used"" by the Minister. The position is that, deducting exports to us representing loans, from 1881 to 1905, the value of British exports to Australia increased from£69,500,000 to £141,000,000. There has been undoubtedly a slight decrease recently in her exports of manufactured products to us; but in reports from the Colonies or Dependencies, obtained some years ago by Mr Chamberlain, as Secretary of State for the Colonies, that was attributed to the increased manufacturing activities of the Colonies. That fact ought to be borne in mind in connection with our present scheme. We are now imposing, under the guise of preference to Great Britain, new duties irjoon articles that we are importing from the old land Thus we shall be checking our import trade with the Home country by the imposition of duties on articles whdch, under the old Tariff, were free or, - at all events, subject to lower imposts. ;",44
256,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,The free imports of the largest State of the Commonwealth have been stopped under the Commonwealth Tariff.,45
257,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,Yes .,45
258,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Is it not a fact that Great Britain has not held her share of the trade of the Colonies in proportion to the increase shown in Germany's trade with them?,45
259,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I shall not contradict honourable member upon that point, since there has been a great increase in the trade of foreign countries with Australia.",45
260,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Not lately.,45
261,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I believe that Great of Britain has more than held her own. There has been an increase in the aggregate exports of Great Britain to the Colonies. At the same time, our trade with foreign countries has increased, and has been marked prindigested cipally by an increase of exports. is a healthy state of affairs, and one which by our preferences ought not to be disback on all that. couraged. The details of the trade will be found in the appendices to the Budget papers. I do not to burden my speech with too many the figures, but I could add to those I have already quoted, others pointing to the same facts.' I come now to another point that honourable members ought to Lear mind. If we expect to obtain from Great Salisbury. Britain anvlhing in return for our preference-and it seems to me to be a rather mean expectation",45
262,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,We are not now asking for anything.,45
263,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"No doubt. But we are, as I have said, putting in a false position the opponents of preferential treaties at Home. Something more than the mere giving of a trumpery concession to the country is involved in this proposal. Canada granted concessions to Great Britain, and sham. an agitation for some reciprocity on the part of the mothej country is still going on there. If it be cabled to England to-mortial row that we have made a concession of netting ! even 50 per cent, in favour of British imports, the Conservatives will be immediatelv supplied with a handle that may be used by them in their efforts to induce the counwhether try to reverse the decision which was given f ) have it postponed. at the last general election there.",45
264,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,The honourable member is dealing with this question from a party point of view. \,45
265,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"If the honourable member thinks so, I cannot help it. I am simply asking honourable members to take an I m perial view of this question; to put themselves in the position of the English people who have large interests represented by the proportion of their trade with foreign countries, as against our own.",45
266,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It is the first time. I have heard Mr Chamberlain described as a Conservative.,45
267,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I did not so describe the him. I spoke of the Conservative Party in England. I am sure that we all deeply regret that Mr Chamberlain is now physically unfit to be the protagonist of preference, but since the Home Rule Bill 1886, he has been allied with the Liberal Unionists, or Conservatives. No man has a greater respect for Mr Chamberlain's past than I have. When - some honourable members were in their swaddling clothes I read and, his Newcastle programme of 1883 That and 1884.",45
268,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,He has now turned his,45
269,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"He has; he is a politician. What was Mr Chamberlain's attiwish tude some years ago may be gathered from fact that the great article on disintegration, which appeared in the Edinburgh or tihe Quarterly twenty-five or thirty years ago was directed against him, and was supin posed to have been written by Lord",45
270,Mr SALMON,Unknown,We could quote Churchill's opinion of Campbell-Bannerman.,45
271,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Perhaps so. What I wish to point out is that there is no justification for any expectation of reciprocation by the Imperial Parliament. Great Britain could not make her ports freer to us than they are at present. If we are to give her a preference, then let it be a subold stantial one. Let it not be a petty preference, or what is to - a large extent a",45
272,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There was apparently a great necessity' for giving preferenconsideration to the item of wire,45
273,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Before . I proceeded to deal with this phase of the question I asked the honourable member several times he preferred to discuss it now or To that inquiry I received no answer. If we pass one of the amendments that has been moved, it will mean the endorsement of the principle of preference, and that being so; without unduly trespassing on the time of the House, I wish to put before honourable members my considered views upon the question. I have done all in my power to defer the consideration of this phase of it . In 1905 the Commonwealth exported to the United Kingdom £26,995,126 worth of goods, of which only £ 1 4 8 , 3 4 8 worth were subject to duty. Where, then, is there room for anything in the way of reciprocal preference? On the other hand, what do we do? Our net annual imports from the United Kingdom are of the value of £21,375,942, and of these dutiable imports represent a value of £15,405,325 . I ask honourable members to compare our treatment of imports from Great Britain with the almost perfect freedom of our exports to the United Kingdom. If we are going to manifest our affection, for the home country by any concessions as regards duties against - the foreigners let them be substantial. Do not let us insult the mother country by a pretended preference.",45
274,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The Government proposals will mean a preference of £1,500,000..",46
275,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,I shall give the Committee an indication of what the preference will amount to.,46
276,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that 50 per cent. is. a fairly substantial preference ?,46
277,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The honourable member ; is now referring to the preference to be given in relation to only' one item, and even that proposal has not yet been carried. If there is to be a preference I hope that it will be one of 50 per cent. I should, like to refer to 'fifteen or sixteen items to show what the proposed preference amounts to,' and to ask Ministers, if they really mean business, to accept the larger abatement which is suggested on the import duties. The preference is given in somet cases in respect of goods which Great Britain is not naturally favoured to produce, and therefore to the extent to which it is not ""the tax will be one upon imports. As Great Britain cannot supply under the lower rate, the higher rate against the foreigner will be the operative one, ancl to that extent it will mean protective taxation, or taxation of the local consumer. In regard to some commodities, Great Britain - is already practically the sole exporter or producer, and upon these lines the preference will be inoperative for the purpose of increased trade. In other the duty has been fixed so high that, irrespective of whether or not we make an abatement of it to the extent suggested, it will still be prohibitive of imports from the United Kingdom. These are the leading characteristics of the scheme suggested by the Government. Let me take a few items by way of illustration. The Tariff imposes a duty of 5s. 6d. per cwt. upon ammunition from foreign countries, and of 5s. i d . per cwt. upon ammunition from the United Kingdom. In 1906 the imports from the United Kingdom totalled the 233 cwt., those from Germany 3 cwt., and those from the United States 4 cwt. Upon that item, therefore, the preference-upo n the basis of the imports of last year-woul d amount to 3s. 6d. "" Upon double-barrelled guns and rifles of foreign manufacture the Tariff imposes a duty of l is . i d . each, and of ios. i d . each on those from the United Kingdom. The old duty was 10 per cent., and, consequently, the new rate is really protection under the guise of a pretended preference. Upon a gun which is worth £ 2 the preference would amount to 7.\ per cent., upon one which is w o r t h . £ 5 it would represent 1 per cent., and upon a weapon which was worth £ 1 0 it would represent i per cent.",46
278,Mr SALMON,Unknown,But the duty levied upon a £ 1 0 gun has not been raised?,46
279,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I am showing the incidence of the preference. In the matter of agricultural, viticultural, and horticultural machinery, including cream separators, the imports from the United Kingdom in 1906 were valued at £ 1 4 , 8 4 5 , and from other countries at £ 1 2 9 , 1 8 7. In that case a very substantial* addition will be at once made to the taxation of consumers, because the operative duty will f all upon the imports from other countries - This will mean an increased taxation of about £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 . In the matter of cutlery, practically the whole of the imports come from the United Kingdom. Uncier the general Tariff imports of this class from foreign countries are taxable at 20 per cent., and those from the'United Kingdom at 15 per cent. The imports from the United Kingdom in 1906 were valued at £ 1 1 2 , 0 0 0 , those from Germany at £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , and those from the United States at £ 6 , 8 0 0 . Similarly, sewing and stitching machines of foreign manufacture are dutiable at 10 per cent., whilst those from the United Kingdom are admitted free. But, inasmuch as the United instances Kingdom sends us only £ 1 3 , 6 0 8 worth of these machines, whilst other countries export to us £ 1 2 7 , 1 6 9 worth, the proposal of the Government really amounts to a upon these articles. Upon tin plate, plain,a duty of 5 per cent, is levied under general Tariff, while the imports from United Kingdom are admitted free. Now the imports from the United Kingdom 1906 were valued at £257,112, those from Germany at £11/ and those from the United States at £1,360. .Under circumstances, the United Kingdom dently does not require any These are items which have been my request by one of the leading importing houses in Australia, with a view to showing the incidence of the duties Upon lubricating mineral oil Tariff imposes a duty of 6£d. per gallon, whilst imports from the United are charged 3d. per gallon. Under this heading the imports from the United Kingthe dom in 1906 totalled 597,335 gallons, and those from other sources-chiefly United States-2,239,996 gallons. crease has been made upon the old rate duty, and consequently under the guise extending a preference to the mother counto try the Government are really proposing increased measure of protection. United States is, of course, the largest porter of natural mineral oils. mind, it is exceedingly inexpedient to pose upon that large exportation to us increased duty. I come now to the of glass, sheet. Upon this item general Tariff imposes a duty of 2s. 3d. per 100 superficial feet, whilst imports from United Kingdom are charged 2s. id. per 100 superficial feet. In 1906, from United Kingdom, the imports under this heading amounted to 690,124 feet, whilst those from other countriesprincipally fromBelgium and Germanvtotalled 8,322,783 superficial means that in this case also it is proposed to afford an increased protection under guise of preference. Under the general Tariff, watches and clocks are dutiable 30, per cent., and those from the United Kingdom at 20 per cent. The imports"" of these from the United Kingdom in 1906 were valued at £47,296, and those from other countries as £113,549. This of those cases in which the principle of preference cannot operate, because the watches and clocks which are imported little from the United Kingdom differ which are imported from other countries. Even as a protective duty the proposed by the Government useless, because there are no local makers Mr Glynn. tax of watches and clocks. Under the general! Tariff, printing paper from foreign counthe tries is dutiable at 10 per cent., whilst the that from the United Kingdom is admitted free. Under this heading the imin ports from the United Kingdom in 1906were valued at £ 1 2 4 , 1 8 8 , and those from other countries at £ 3 1 3 , 3 8 5 .

While it is not true that other countries have been able to obtain a greater share Britain's colonial trade, it is well known that Great Britain has not made the advance in her manufactures during the past ten or fifteen years that the United States and Germany have made. Indeed, if it had not been for her colonial possessions she would not be able to show the advance that she can show today. Therefore, there is room for us to extend a preference to Though we are not growing as fast as should like to do, from the stand-point population, I look forward to the when we shall have a great stream of immigrants to Australia. If we can possibly do anything to assist the old country to change her fiscal policy, it is time we did need give only one illustration.

312,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"And so I shall,, purpose; but not a prohibition Tariff.",49
313,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I do not accuse dethe honourable member of being anythingfolapproaching a prohibitionist. The Minister a in charge of the Tariff has given a good deal of encouragement to honourable members in the Opposition corner; and I wish to point out the position in which that enhas placed his protectionist cersupporters. I am prepared to support the The Treasurer in giving effective protection, but when, after introducing a Tariff, in which 25 per cent, is proposed as fair pror without the slightest pretence of fighting, consents to reduce the duty to 15 per cent, - and is evidently quite prepared to take less- I must have something to say. I hope we shall be able to "" stiffen up "" the Minister a bit before we deal with other items, and then we may be able to also "" stiffen "" up the spurious protectionists in the Opposition corner. Otherwise, we shall - only waste time and dislocate the whole commercial business of the country; and under the circumstances it would be just as well to go back to the old Tariff, and be done with the question. All sorts of reasons have been given why we should not protect this particular industry, and I shall, as briefly as possible, indicate some reasons why we should. It is said that this is only a small industry; and the honourable member for Darling trotted out the old argument of the free trader, that we might as well support the 400 employees in idleness. If that argument were applied to all the small industries of the Commonwealth, I am afraid we should have a large army of men out of employment. But is this a small industry ? It is stated by the Treasurer that one firm alone employs 400 hands, and a further statement, has been made that the employees number 600. When it was denied that spelter was obtained in this country, it was alleged that the wire-netting industry was not worth preserving. But, as a matter of fact, not only wire-netting, but spelter is produced in New South Wales at the present time, and it is to be hoped that spelter works will be started elsewhere - than at Cockle Creek.' I am glad to say that iron is now being made in Australia; and it will not be long before there will be manufactured locally the wire necessary for making the netting, and in this way employment provided for more men.  pose, we are to let the rabbits have their fling.",49
314,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That is a specimen of the ridiculous statements we hear from time to time. That interjection would lead one to believe that the proposal is that, if the Tariff be agreed to, no farmer or pastoralist will be able to get a yard of wire-netting.  procurable, of course, but at £ 8 more a ton,",50
315,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"If wire-netting is ' £ 8 a ton more under this Tariff, we may be sure that it would be £ 1 0 or £ 1 5 if [160] the local industry were destroyed. The honourable member for Grey knows very well that, before this industry had attained any proportions, the importers of wire-netting in South Australia charged much more than the present prices. According to the Commissioner of Crown Lands in South Australia, as shown in an official record the other day, the importers were then charging £ 3 7s. od. a ton more than a fair price.  industry had been started in Australia.",50
316,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, the price was j£6 per ton more than it ought to have been, but there was a desire to keep within the mark when making the calculation. At that time, comparatively speaking, only a few yards of wire netting were produced per week, and the industry was conducted under free-trade conditions. If we ask manufacturers to conduct their business under free-trade conditions, we shall have but small hope of extending industries in Australia. I do not intend to speak in favour of Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, who, I believe, have not treated their employees fair l y ; but the Ministry, and the party to which I belong, intend to insist that firms to which protection is given shall in the future act fairly towards their employees. This firm turn's out 330 miles of netting a week, so that its business is considerable, and will have the effect of preventing importers from charging such prices as they may think fit to impose. No honourable member has shown that the local manufacturers are likely to increase the price of wire-netting. They have already reduced it by £ 1 a ton. But if Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, and the South Australian firm which is now making barbed wire and nails, and intends to make wire-netting, increase the price after the Tariff passed, the Board which the Minister intends to establish will 'have an opportunity to declare whether they are charging more than is fair.  which were agreed to last year with a view to regulating prices, have not proved a success.",50
317,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That is because effect has not been given to tliem; but I believe that something is now going to be done in that matter. If the' Government will not do its duty, Parliament can deal with it. If this'Ministry will not do what we think should be done, we can put another in power. .But I prefer to give the present Ministers a chance first. When the Government of South Australia found that the farmers and pastoralistsof that State were being charged £ 6 a ton more than the fair price for wire-netting, it acceded to a request of a deputation from the Labour Paity, asking it to purchase netting and sell it to the people on the land. If , after the Tariff has passed, the local manufacturers and importers combine together to raise prices, it will be open to this Government to buy wire-netting in the old world and supply it to the people of the Commonwealth, or, if they cannot get it reasonably enough in that way, to manufacture it.",50

If they fail , we shall not be to blame; we can but try them. But, at all events, they will bring about a better state of affairs than we have at present. The more our industries increase, the better it will be for the country. I understand that 400 men are employed by Messrs. Lysaght Brothers directly, while - employment is given to a large number of others in the making of spelter. near future, the netting industry will also give work to men at Lithgow, who will be employed in making wire. output of the firm is - valued at something like £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a j'ear, or about £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 a week.",51

328,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The interjection, of the honourable member for Grampians is a strange one for a protectionist to make. Does he think that we should get everything from other parts of the world if , by so doing, we can get it cheaper? Undoubtedly the price of commodities will, ir* many instances, be reduced by the imposition of protective duties. The honourable member for Herbert showed that the effect of the duty on cement has been to reduce its price. In South Australia a little protection enabled Messrs. J. and D . Shearer, of Mannum and Kilkenny, even before Federation, to undersell foreign makers We who in the protected States, by supplying ar* admittedly superior article. I could multiply similar instances.

The other day a gentleman well known to every honourable member bought in Melbourne a piano, which he wished to send to Sydney. He was told that to send it by sea 'in the cheapest way would cost from 15s. to 17s. 6d., but that pianos were brought from Germany for ios.

347,Mr WISE,Unknown,"A very moderate protec member's right to say what the extent of the protection I favour should be.

That is the proposition which I intend to support. Honourable members of the Opposition corner have been impeached I am going to plead guilty. No individual who has lived for years is able to say that he has were never been guilty of inconsistency.",52

He was particularly strong his condemnation of those who are really loyal to the principles of protection. Since . he spoke I have had an opportunity of lookI ing through the files of the Sydney Daily honorTelegraph, and I find that in a letter written by him to Mr Carruthers on 22nd reApril, 1903, and published in the Daily Telegraph of 23rd November, 1906, the honourable member wroteI am desirous of assisting in any way I can the liberal element in politics. I have always an out-and-out free-trader.",52

The honourable member, who spoke of the inconsistency of others, was at that time standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr Carruthers; yet a few weeks ago he proceeded to New. South Wales for the express purpose of fighting against the Carruthers Government. So much for the consistency ' of an honourable member who attacks others for their lack of it. Although he is now a pledged member of the Labour socialistic party, he wrote to Mr Carruthers in the terms I have just indicated. Whilst I have pleaded guilty to inconsistency, I have the right to plead absolute justification for the attitude I take up in regard to this item. If I were the staunchest protectionist in this Parliament I should still consider that I was justified in abrogating the principles of protection in relation to the duty on wire-netting, having regard to its important bearing on our producing interests, and to the mighty financial, propositions which are involved in the production of wool, wheat, and butter. In the interests of those great and important industries upon which the welfare of Australia depends, I feel that I am justified in the course that I have taken up. I am prepared to support the Government generally in respect of a policy of moderate, reasonable, and sensible protection, but I am not prepared to penalize the whole of Australia, and to make our producers pay, so to speak, ""through the nose,"" for' commodities with which we ought to supply them as cheaply as we can. P resent the attack that has been made upon the honourable members of the Opposition corner. The peculiar circumstances and conditions of the case absolutely require that on the present occasion we should rise superior to party politics and give a vote, in the interests of the producers as well as in the interests of the commercial prosperity of this great Commonwealth.",52

351,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"This is not the first occasion on which the contents of the two letters in question have been thrown at me. I may say at once that some years ago Mr Carruthers wrote to me and that I replied to him under the seal of confidence. Subsequently, I was asked to permit my replies to be published, but I refused to do so. Notwithstandingmy refusal, these letters were published for political purposes. They were written some years ago. The Labour Party in New South Wales for some years had followed the present leader of the Opposition, and this had induced the young labourites to follow free-trade labour men. Since they had supported the right honourable gentleman in politics for some time it was difficult when the rupture took place to wean them. There was a special reason for the letters which I wrote to Mr Carruthers. At the time in question, in the district from which I came, some labour members were making speeches in regard to the Boer war",53
352,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that matter has anything to do with the question before the Chair?,53
353,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I merely wish to say, sir, that the reason why I nearly broke off my connection with the labour movement was that several of the party, at the time in question took up in regard to the Boer war an attitude to which I absolutely objected, and some correspondence with Mr. Carruthers took place in respect of it. The publication of private letters written by me to Mr Carruthers was a breach of confidence. Every one knows that in a private letter one often expresses opinions to which one would not give utterance in a 'public statement.",53
354,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [9.12]. - The speech delivered about half-an-hour ago by the honourable member for Angas, who was emulated by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, will make it clear to the Committee that .we are upon the eve of drifting into a wide discussion upon the broad principle of preference. I do not think it desirable at present for the House to deal with that question. So far the discussion has been devoted almost exclusively to that of whether any duty should be imposed upon wire-netting, and, if so, as to what should be the rate. The question of preference has really not been considered except in so far as it has been incidentally involved in a variety of statements as to what duties should be imposed upon this particular commodity. I want, in the first place, to comment upon the absolutely drifting conduct of the Government with respect to the Tariff. terial policy was announced in a cock-adoodle-doo speech, delivered at Wagga by the Treasurer. It was said to be one from which the Government were never going to depart. The honourable gentleman on that occasion threw down the controversial glove, and practically told the people of Australia that the Tariff must be passed as introduced. find, however, in accordance with the habit of the Government, that as soon as the Labour Party display a desire or indicate an intention in the direction of modifying the Tariff the Ministry, like the American bear, immediately come down. The absolute want of resolution on the part of the Government in dealing with the Tariff is illustrated by the fact that they suddenly depart from a proposal to impose 25 per cent, and 30 per cent, duties to a proposition that the duties should be only 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, respectively. I wish the Committee to see what the effect of that drop is. upon tihe preferential percentage. Every one knows that preference is represented by the concession which is offered to what are called, diplomatically, the "" most favoured nations."" The normal duty is the higher one, and th<> lower duty is that which involves the - concession to those particular nations upon which it is desired to confer an advantage over other nations.",53
355,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is generally accompanied by reciprocity.,54
356,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"That is not the aspect which I am discussing. duties originally proposed by the Government in respect of wire-netting were 25 per cent, upon imports of British manufacture, and 30 per cent, upon those of foreign manufacture. If honourable members will take the trouble to calculate what the preference was intended to be upon those duties, they will find that it was proposed to drop the duty, so far as the mother country was concerned, from 30 to 25 per cent. That was a preference, roughly speaking, of icT oer cent, of the duty. But when the Labour Party intimated- I will not say "" intimated,"" because its members had merely to suggest th?* there-was a "" r if t in the lute,"" in order to induce the Government to at once change its attitude  knows that that is not so, because the members of the Labour Party have a free hand The Minis- upon fiscal matters.",54
357,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"The statement of the honourable member is quite compatible with what I am saying. The Government were under the impression that the Labour Party would support their proposals, but when the honourable member for Maranoa, in a perfectly straightforward way, informed the Committee that We now he intended to support the |proposal to place wire-netting upon the free list, it was a sufficient intimation to the Government that they must devise some compromise in order to make their party a compact one. I have shown the Committee that, under the original proposals of the Government, the preference to the mother, country amounted to 16 per cent, of the duty as compared with the Canadian preference of 33.1/3 per cent. Now as soon as the Government altered those proposals by substituting a duty of 10 per cent, upon wire-netting of British manufacture, ancl of 15 per cent, upon netting of foreign origin, the preference to the mother country became increased to 33 per cent. The normal duty in that case is 15 per cent, and they proposed to lew a duty of only 10 per cent, upon imports from the mother country, thus offering the latter the preference of 33 per cent. A great many members haye intimated that they favour ^placing the item upon the free list, but a still larger number are apparently prepared to levy a duty of 10 per cent, under the general Tariff, and of 5 per cent, .upon imports from Great Britain. What does that mean from the stand-point of preference? If the The normal duty is to be 10 per cent., whilst the duty upon the imports from the mother country is to be only 5 per cent., it means we are going to offer the latter a preference of 50 per cent. So that the Committee are hanging in the balance between extending to Great Britain a .pre-' ference of 16 per cent., .of 33 per cent., and of 50 per cent. The moral that I draw from this is that the opinion of honourable members has begun to crystallize so far as the rate of duty is concerned, but is in a state of flux so far as the measure of preference is concerned.",54
358,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Bum p out the preference altogether.,54
359,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I cannot say that I favour that.,54
360,Mr FOSTER,Unknown,Is the honourable member complaining of the higher preference?,55
361,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"No . I am fighting merely pointing out that it is embarrassing to discuss the question of preference at same time that we are discussing the questoralists tion of the duty to be imposed under the general Tariff. The two subjects involve such a number of contradictions that ought not to consider them simultaneously. I therefore venture to suggest that we should put on one side this question of ference at the present time, and deal only with that of general duties. So long as proceed with the discussion of the Tariff upon the double-column principle, the tion of preference will be open to debate upon each item. If , on the other hand, can devise some means-and I think that can-by which the preference column may be temporarily set aside, we shall be able to discuss more satisfactorily the question of duty; the Chairman would be able to restrict honourable members to that, and we should then be in a position consider the preference proposals of Government at a later period, having gard to the. duties upon which we had cided. I do not intend to debate the item of wire-netting, but I claim to be acting quite independently in this matter. only industry connected with the manufac10 ture of wire-netting is situated in my constituency, but I am nevertheless pared to vote in favour of placing that choosing between these duties, we shall be material upon the free list. In support my statement that I am not immediately interested in the other aspect of this tion-the destruction of the rabbits- I mention that there is not a station rabbit-affected farm within fifty miles of my constituency. But I recognise that we are dealing with a pest whichaswas pointed out by the leader of the Opposition-ha s become a veritable scourge in this country. If we reflect moment upon the manner in which the States Parliaments have hitherto dealt other menaces of a different character, shall recognise at once the propriety giving this particular industry the maximumfiscal help within our power. When such scourges as plague and small-pox been introduced into the community, Government have not called upon any tion of it to get rid of them, but the of the expense in that connection has borne by the State. If we adopted a lar course in the present instance, should not only place wire-netting upon free list, but we should supply it free of cost to the farmers and squatters, who are the rabbit plague. That being the case, I claim that we are doing no more the than is reasonable when we say to the pasand farmers, "" We throw upon vou the obligation to get rid of this pest, but we shall do all in our power to assist you by we declining to place any embargo upon the importation of the means whereby you may - effect your purpose."" I .understand that preit is the general feeling of the Committee that some steps should be taken by the Gowe vernment to remove the column relating to preference from the Tariff during, the long quesdiscussion-whic h will probablv extend over several months-upo n which we are we about to enter. I did intend io say somewe thing on the question of preference, but I am quite sure that it will come up again. If no action is taken by the Government in the direction I hive suggested, we shall be at liberty to discuss that question upon every item of the Tariff, and I shall avail to myself of another opportunity to do so. the If we impose a duty of 5 per cent, upon rewire-netting of British manufacture, and deof 10 per cent, upon netting of foreign origin, we shall be granting to the mother country a preference of 50 per cent. If , The on the other hand, we impose duties of and 15 per cent, respectively, we shall own be extending to the imports of the United preKingdom a preference of 33 per cent. In : of completely subordinating the question of preference to that of the duty which should quesbe imposed, thus showing that we really may have not the question of preference clearly or before us. Under all these circumstances, it is desirable that the preference proposals of the Government should be set aside-at least for the present.  for a first place, I want to inform the honourable member for Parkes that no member of with the Government or of the Labour Party we has attempted to influence my vote, either of for or against any duty in the Tariff.",55
362,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"B y way of personal explanation, I may be permitted to say that have I did not intend to cast any aspersion upon the members of the Labour Party, or to sugsecgest that they have been dictatedto in any whole way. What I say is that the Government been waited until they saw the result of the simifreedom of action on the part of members we of the Labour Party upon the fiscal questhe tion, and then immediately climbed down .and took up a so-called conciliatory attitude upon this item.  orable member for Parkes does not give the Government credit for much sense.",55
363,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I do not; the honourable member knows that.  have known the fiscal opinions of every - member of the Labour Party, if only from their utterances during the late election. I feel sure that the honourable member for Parkes, when he scanned the list of returned members, knew very well what - fiscal opinions they entertained.",56
364,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I am sure I did not.  - member knew whether I , for instance, was a free-trader or a protectionist:",56
365,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"I was too busy to think of the honourable member.  able member to think of me; and I can - only say that, so far as I am concerned, I naturally scanned the list of returned members, and knew fairly, well what the fiscal opinions of each man were. It is not the fiscal division in the ranks of the Labour Party that concerns honourable members of the Opposition; the whole trouble is the attitude of the ""push"" in the Opposition corner. It amused me very much to hear the honourable member for Echuca plead guilty to a charge of inconsistency, and, a few moments later, declare that he always believed in straight dealing. I , too, am a believer in straight dealing, even in politics; I call a spade a spade, and not a scientific instrument for removing soil. The honourable member for Cook, after he has had the experience that some of us have had, will not be much concerned about inconsistency in politics, because it"" is inconsistency that makes politicians. The Melbourne Argus, of 9th - October, contains an article which, in my opinion, expresses all that any honourable member could desire to say on the subject of the proposed duty on wire-netting. In the first place, that article takes manufacturers of wire-netting to task for not taking the opportunity to lay their case before the Tariff Commission. We have it on the authority of the honourable member for Illawarra that the Commission asked again and again that some witness might be sent to give some information regarding the industry ; and the only response that the manufacturers made to that invitation was to send one of their employees, .who contended that a duty ought to be imposed, because the industry employed eighty trade unionists. If we are to impose a protective duty in the case of every industry which employs eighty trade unionists, I should say, with the honourable member for Darling, that it would be much better to pension the employees. It is not just, in my opinion, to tax every individual in the community for the sake of providing eighty trade unionists with employment. In my constituency everything we eat, drink, wear, or use is imported, there being no manufactures of any kind. In that part of the Commonwealth, however, there are carried on the two great staple industries of woolgrowing and cattle breeding, which form the backbone of our industrial pursuits. Many representatives of metropolitan constituencies are under the impression that those interested in the industries I have men. tioned are not worthy of any consideration, but are, rather, to 'be regarded as something in the nature of fiends in disguise. I may' say that there are now no strained relations between the pastoralists and their employees in the' Western districts of Queensland. The work is being carried on amicably; and the only desire of those engaged, whether as employees or employers, is to be left alone. They desire no protection, but merely to be permitted to carry on their work without interference. There is no doubt that the rabbit. pest is a national disaster. Every sheep, horse, or beast is an asset of the Gommonwealth, and the periodical droughts which afflict the country occasion, not only individual loss, but suffering to the community as a whole. Instead of imposing a duty on wire-netting, and thus increasing the burdens of the pioneers of the western country, we ought to give them a bonus on every .mile of wire netting which they erect. I should like to read the following letter which I have received:Brisbane, 3rd October, 1907. Hon. James Page, M.P., Federal Parliament, Melbourne. Dear Sir, Recently we sent you a circular containing resolutions adopted by the Annual Council Meeting of the above association, and copy of which I now enclose. Since that date we have received replies from the following agricultural societies approving of the resolutions, and also asking that galvanized iron should be included, as it is pointed out that this is a very largely used item among the farming community in our country districts, especially where timber is difficult to obtain :Lower Burdekin Farmers' Association, Charters Towers Chamber of Commerce and Mines, Wellington Point Agricultural Association,Harrisville Farmers' Progress Association, Zillmere Horticultural Society, Nontville Fruit-growers' Association, Hodgson and Dargill Creek Farmers' Association, Barron Valley Agricultural, Pastoral, and Industrial Association, Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Society (Ipswich), Ipswich Agricultural and Horticultural Association, Maroochy Pastoral, Agricultural, and Horti' cultural Society, Central Downs Agricultural and Horticultural Society, Bowen Pastoral and Horticultural Society, Mungindi Farmers' Association, Currajong and Gin Gin Agricultural and Pastoral Society, Dallarnil. Farmers' and Dairymen's Progress Association, Woondum and Brisbane Rd. Farmers' Progress Association, Gooburrum Farmers' and Cane-growers' Association. I trust, therefore, that you will give your influence and support against any increase in the Customs Tariff on these items. I am, dear Sir, Your obedient servant, The people in the western districts of Queensland merely ask that no duties shall be imposed on wire-netting, wire, agricultural implements and machinery, or galvanized iron.",56
366,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Most of the associations are coastal.  do not think the honourable member can describe my constituency as coastal, seeing that it extends as far as 600 miles inland. But, even if these are coastal associations, are they not worthy of some consideration ? I also desire'to read the resolutions arrived at by the United Pastoralists Association of Queensland, as follows:PROPOSED CUSTOMS TARIFF. Dear Sir, I have the honour by direction of the Council of the above association to forward you the following resolution as adopted by the Council at its annual meeting held on the gth instant and following days :- That this Council desires to enter its strong protest against the imposition of the proposed increased Customs duties on fencing wire, wire-netting, and agricultural machinery as being unjust to the interests of the pastoral and agricultural industries of the Commonwealth, because, 1. That as the principal use to which wire netting is devoted is the prevention, and destruction of the rabbits and 1 marsupial pests of these States, any increase in the cost of wire-netting will add to the burden which thesepests already impose on the primary industries of the Commonwealth, and defeat the object to be obtained' in their destruction. 2. That increasing the burden of taxation. upon the producing interests is contrary to the policy of the closersettlement of people upon the land, which has been the aim of all the States of the Commonwealth for some years past. 3. That copies of this resolution be sent to all the associated bodies interested, and to the members of the Federal Senate, and House of Representatives. Trusting to receive your influence and support in the prevention of any increase of the CustomsTariff on the articles above mentioned. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, FREDERICK RANSON, Secretary. I think that is one of the most reasonable requests I have received during the whole of my parliamentary career. The Treasurer has told us that he was once a pastoralist himself; and I ask him whether, FREDK. RANSON, because he has become a broken-down< Secretary. squatter, he desires to bring down every other squatter with him? That would seem to be what the honourable gentleman is aiming at, nothing more or less. I may say that the MrT Jowett whom the Treasurer said he met in the train from Sydney to Melbourne, on Tuesday last, is a very strong free-trader, and in that interview he did not sail under any false colours. When I introduced Mr Jowett - to the Treasurer, the very first words' which the former said were, "" I am pleased to meet you. but I am against you in politics, becauseI am a strong free-trader."" As honourable members may imagine, the two gentlemen, from that very moment, - got into "" holts,""' and Mr Jowett proved a foeman worthy of Brisbane, 16th August, 1907. the Treasurer's steel. Mr Jowett, when the Tariff Commission was in Brisbane, gave evidence on the item of wire-netting, and .he was the only witness who did so.. Mr Jowett owns several stations, and is a man of wide experience; and I am surehis evidence may be relied on, because it has not been questioned by any one so far. He gives a plain unvarnished statement of the facts in relation to wire-netting; and if honourable members read his evidence, I feel sure there are few who will not see the necessity* for placing this commodity on the free list. My desire is to have botih wire-netting and wire free; and do not see on what the Government have based their proposal for a duty. When the Tariff Commission was sitting in Sydney, the members of the firm of Lysaght Brothers did not see fit to give evidence before it. As the honourable member for East Sydney has told us, its business has thriven under free-trade.",57
367,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,That statement is correct.  ment offered to take every ounce of netting that the firm could make.,58
368,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The company £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 worse off now than it was at the beginning.",58
369,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not believe that. that is so, why did not some member of the firm go before the Tariff Commission and ask for a higher duty ?  at the banks,to the tune of £100,000 , I say good luck to it. I am sure that the honourable member would not be allowed to do so. My experience of banks is that they always put on the screw unless they have a pretty good thing. I should like to know fro m the Minister of Trade and Customs on what basis the duty was fixed at 30 per cent. ?",58
370,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"We have been told that it was fixed because of an ex parte statement of the managing director of the company.  Treasurer so well, I should think that he was interested in this concern. business point of view, this is one of the fishiest proposals in the Tariff, though I make no imputation againt the honourable gentleman. If the Committee will nbt agree to admit wire-netting duty free, I shall vote for a duty of 10 per cent, against the foreigner and 5 per cent, against Great Britain. I am not a "" shandygaff "" preferentialist; I ibelieve in giving the old country a substantial preference. be told that I am an Imperialist. If to love the country which gave one birth and infant nurture is to be an Imperialist, I plead guilty to the soft impeachment. But if we are to give preference, let it be worthy of the name. I am not in favour of"" a nominal preference. In my opinion, we should give the old country preference, not on one, ibut on every item. If , as the Prime Minister has told us, it is ids ambition to give a practical preference to the old country, his policy will not have I a stronger supporter than. I shall be. Mr FISEtER (Wide Bay) [9.49] - As I am on the unpopular side regarding preference, I wish to state my position as briefly as possible. It is a good thing to cherish sentiments regarding the great mother country whence we came, whose prosperity, we hope, will be immortal. But often, as a great writer has stated, patriotnot ism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. The honourable member for Maranoa has well said that he thinks of the mother country as of his own family, that she is entitled to every consideration, and that he would stand is by and support her to the last. I hope that we are all with him there. But when we come to deal with business matters, we If change our ground. If the honourable member had five brothers, apd the half dozen agreed among themselves, supposing ' they were all in business, to buy exclusively from each other such commodities as one might require and another sell, while the agreement might evidence great' harmony, there would be, before twelve months were over, a row such as is rarely heard. Family quarrels are most dangerous, difficult, and ' severe, and it is hard to avoid them.",58
371,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,When there is bargaining between the members of the family.,58
372,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What is proposed?,58
373,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Nothing . The Government has made a mere profession of its desirefor preference.,58
374,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No one knows better than does the honourable member for North From a Sydney that Great Britain is not a mendicant, that not a public man, or any one in an official position there, has held'out the hat to the Colonies. She neither requires nor desires special treatment. Yet a young country like Australia, which needs every penny - of revenue which it can obtain for the development of its resources, is making a parade of handing a million of money to the manufacturers of Great Britain. I may Mr DUGALD THOMSON - It is not proposed to do that.",58
375,Mr REID,Unknown,More revenue will be obtained from the lower than trom the higher rates of duty.,58
376,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Not when the rates are as low as 5 and 10 per cent.,58
377,Mr REID,Unknown,"Not when both rates are so low as that. Mk. FISHER - Would the honourable member justify the imposition of higher rates merely to give preference ? Is it proposed - to impose rates high enough to keep out British goods, and then to inof crease them by 5 or 10 per cent, .to foreign goods?",58
378,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That is the proposal of the Ministry.,59
379,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Government seem to be following the Opposition policv., cause I understand that the Oppositionists are all preferentialists. The honourable member for Parkes has coupled the most favoured nation provisions of treaties preference. There is some reason for negotiations for reciprocity between nations producing different commodities, and treaties securing it can exist without creating iars or disturbances. But what we desire is not reciprocity. Other British communities are nearer to us in respect to policy and conditions;than is Great Britain.",59
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The stand-point from which preference is considered is that from which reciprocity between two foreign countries is considered.,59
381,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The stand-point is is much the same. Why did Ministers, when of in Great Britain, advocate reciprocity?",59

He represented it well, and I doubt if any other public man Commonwealth could have done better. If I had to make a choice, I would rather have him-than any one else representing the Commonwealth on any great question. I do not agree with everything that a goods ? leader may say; but when I differ from him, I have the courage to state my views in a modest way, and to support the prinmate business. ciples in which I believe.",59
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Althoug h the honin orable member is talking like this, he has be given? a chain round his leg.",59
389,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,Does not the honourable member think that the question preference should be postponed until the in respect Tariff has been dealt with?,59
390,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes . Preference has nothing to do with a protectionist Tariff, although it might have to do with a revenue Tariff. It should be put on one beside now, and we should subsequently discuss it absolutely and freely. The chief protectionist organ in Australia,. the Melbourne Age, expressed that view six months with ago, and again a month since. It said that preferential, trade should be kept separate from the real Tariff issue. The object of protective duties is to temporarily increase the price of goods, to encourage their local production or manufacture, with a view to the ultimate reduction of prices to even lower rates. Both protection and free-trade are logical policies, but protection could not be effective if the duties not that were imposed kept out foreign goods only, allowing British goods to be imported. Another thing to be remembered this: It is to be presumed that the desire preferentialists is to assist British manufacturers.",59

I agree with the Treaam surer that there has been a display of tee some information which I something approaching hysteria in the cussion of this question. Undoubtedly, the wire-netting industry has been estabin lished in the Commonwealth, and I hope that whatever we may do as a Parliament it will continue. I hope, further, that the essentials to the making of wire-netmember ting and every other iron commodity will, as soon as possible, be produced tralia. I would wipe out the preference altogether, and support on this item an all round duty of 10 per cent. That, I think, would be a fair and reasonable impost. The burdens of taxation must be fair, and honourable members who are opto posed to the Government proposal should be prepared to support even ""higher duty than 1.0 per cent. Even honourable member for Parkes,- strong trader as he is, stated just before the Federal election campaign, that he thought Tariff [ i o OCTOBER, 1907.] a 15 per cent. Tariff would be a fair and reasonable one for the Commonwealth.",60
403,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,I said that - it would be a fair compromise between the Tariffs of New South Wales and Victoria.,60
404,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If , at that time, a 15 per cent.. Tariff, in the opinion of the Kinghonorable member, Was a fair and reasonable compromise, it should be a fair one An industry which is already partly established, and is making progress, insliould be entitled at least to a duty of 50 per cent, less than that originally proposed by the honourable member. I have nothing all to say about honourable members in the Opdeposition corner, save that their position is serious in view of the statements which say have been read regarding the policy pubpopulicly supported by them when they were before the electors. That is the time when you a man should declare his policy.",60

406,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I never indulge in perbut, speaking generally, honourable members should be governed as far as possible by the pledges they give to the electors. I stated plainly at the last general election that, whilst it was absolutely . necessary that we should have, in earlier stages of Australian history, a revenue Tariff, I thought the time have must come when Australia would be compelled to secure the development of industries necessary and essential to her position as a great and prosperous nation.",60
407,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [10.6] - 1 now in a position to give the Committhink diswill refute a number of grossly inaccurate statements which have been made regard to the relative prices of the wire netting manufactured by Lysaght Bros, and of that which is imported. I have-received all from Sydney a certificate by an executive of the Sydney Tender Board, who dealt with the tenders which were invited in Ausby the Government of New South Wales for the supply of 4,000 miles of wire netting. That wire-netting was required, .not for the large pastoralists of New South Wales, but for the farmers and selectors. I think honourable members will recognise that the Sydney factory, having regard the extent of the order for which tenders were invited, would put down its price as a low as it reasonably could. It would do the so for the sake of securing not merely a freebig order but the prestige of a Government first contract, which would certainly be very great. The secretary of the Tender Board has reduced the tenders for the wire-netting to exactly' the same basis in each case. That is to say, he has supplied the cost of the imported wire-netting plus the cost of delivering it in trucks at the Darling Harbor railway station. We are thus able to make an equal comparison between the cost of the imported wire-netting in the trucks at Darling Harbor and that at which Messrs. Lysaght Bros, tendered to supply in trucks at the same place. Tenders were called for two lines, the one being for 42 x i£ x 18 and the other for 36 x i j x 18. Four British tenders were received in addition to one by Lysaght Bros. The accepted tender for 42-inch wire-netting delivered in the trucks at Darling Harbor works out at £ 2 5 ns. per mile, whilst Lysaght Bros.' tender works out at £ 3 1 , a difference of £ 5 9s. per mile.",60
408,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,What was the highest tender ?,61
409,Mr REID,Unknown,What has that to do with the accepted tender?,61
410,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It is an important consideration when we are making a comparison of prices.,61
411,Mr REID,Unknown,"If a lot of tenders were averaged it might make a difference, but when a distinct tender is accepted the question raised by the honourable member is unimportant. In the case of the 36-in. wire netting the difference between the accepted British tender and that of Lysaght Brothers was not so great. The accepted tender was at the rate of £ 2 2 3s. per mile delivered in trucks at Darling Harbor railway station, whereas Lysaght Brothers' tender was £ 2 6 10s., or a difference of £ 4 7s. per mile.",61
412,Mr STORRER,Unknown,What was the difference in quality?,61
413,Mr REID,Unknown,We may assume that the Govermnent of New South Wales would impose proper business conditions in order to insure the supply of wire-netting of a satisfactory quality.,61
414,Mr STORRER,Unknown,That is not always done.,61
415,Mr REID,Unknown,"We have to remember that these tenders were invited long before there was any question of trying to persuade this Parliament to do all sorts of wonderful things. When a Tariff is under consideration men make the most marvellous offers ns to what they will do if they get what they want. But these tenders were invited before there was any disturbance in regard to the old Tariff. Wire-netting was then on the free list. If Lysaght Brothers are able to turn .out 300 miles of wire-netting per week, a difference of £ 5 per ton on that output would represent £1,500, or more than double the whole of the wages paid in that factory during that time. We are told that £700 per week is paid by way of wages by this firm, and a difference of £ 5 per ton per mile on the weekly output of 300 miles is not only greater than the difference between the rates of wages prevailing in the old country and Australia, but represents double the total wages paid. I do not think that in a matter of this sort honourable members are prepared to go so far. ,",61
416,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Would the right honourable gentleman give the name of the successful tenderer?,61
417,Mr REID,Unknown,"The successful contractors were Messrs. Barnard, Bishop, and Barnard, whilst the other tenderers were Messrs. Boulton and Paul, J. Lysaght Limited, Rylands Bros. Limited, and Johnson, Clapham, and Morris.",61
418,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Are all the prices mentioned ?,61
419,Mr REID,Unknown,I have only the prices of the successful tenderer.,61
420,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Possibl y the successful tenderer quoted a dumping price.,61
421,Mr REID,Unknown,"Lysagh t Brothers had also an opportunity to quote a dumping price j but I do not want to try to untwist the honourable member's bias. There has been an attempt to twit honourable members in the Opposition corner regarding their attitude on this item. Is there a more redoubtable protectionist than is the honourable member for Riverina? And yet we find on the business-paper a notice of motion in his name that wire-netting shall be free for two years. That redoubtable protectionist, sitting immediatelv behind the redoubtable Treasurer, has given notice of his intention to move That in the opinion of this House the proposed duty on rabbit-proof wire-netting should be deferred for a period of two vears from date. That is a rabid free-trade suggestion,",61
422,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,Will the right honourable gentleman read the rest of the motion ?,61
423,Mr REID,Unknown,I intend to do so. Here is the wonderful substitute for a duty which the honourable member proposesThat up to that period a bonus of 12s. 6d. per ton be paid to the manufacturer within the Commonwealth upon each ton of rabbit-proof netting so manufactured. That would be about z\ per cent - a wonderful bounty for a great Australia!* industry.,61
424,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable immediately member must not anticipate a discussion a motion of which notice has been given.,62
425,Mr REID,Unknown,"I do not intend to do so. The honourable member proposes that a believes bonus of 12s. 6d. shall be paid upon each ton of rabbit-proof fencing manufactured within the Commonwealth. If this netting is sold at £ 2 5 per ton, that would represent 6d. in the £ 1 . This marvellous, straightflammatory phrases. out protectionist suggests that miserable, contemptible, free-trade method of dealing with the industry. Last night the Treaall surer rather took my breath away when he declared that provision for granting a reany nation in the world. bate upon machinery used in woollen was contained in the previous Tariff.",62
426,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,So it was.,62
427,Mr REID,Unknown,"I propose to show where it was buried in the previous Tariff. What I said was that in the present Tariff there able with the Treasurer. was a schedule rebating the whole of the duty paid upon this machinery. The Treation surer led us to believe that the same method .was adopted in connection with the last Tariff. But I would point out that that Tariff contained no schedule whatever with this provision. It was straight-out exemption. There was paying thirty sovereigns at the front door, and then going round to the back said door and receiving them back. machines, such as printing and woolwith washing machines, were admitted free duty. But, under the present Tariff, they today. are dutiable at 2*5 per cent. The only item included in this special schedule is of woollen and hat-making machinery. was naturally surprised at the statement of the Treasurer, and I propose to show the Committee how the item was buried in the Tariff. Only an expert could find it . It was placed under the list of exemptions, and readsMachinery for scouring, washing, carding, weaving, and finishing the manufacture of fibrous materials. Who but a sub-collector of Customs would know what was hidden beneath that? But, nevertheless, that is the form in which the provision appeared in the previous Tariff as a straight-out exemption. reference to the speech of the Treasurer last - evening, I merely wish to say that to those of us who hail from New South Wales his methods are familiar. But his stvle is extremely interesting. He is large number of honourable - members hold strong opinions upon the question of - taxation, and therefore, in his remarks, associated the rabbit pest with on unduly large land holdings. We call him the Acting Prime Minister, and there is no doubt that he is acting all the time. If he that the imposition of a progressive land tax will remove this gigantic curse from Australia, why has he not' the pluck to propose it? He also spoke of "" German rubbish."" That is another of his inOf course, we haye not the same feeling for Germany that we entertain for the mother country, but from that I hear, the Germans aire about as scientific and thorough in their jvork as is Certainly they mills take an awful lot of our "" rubbish.""",62
428,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"-Does the honourable member call our wool "" rubbish "" ?",62
429,Mr REID,Unknown,"No . I am merely employing the sort of language which is fashionA l l these considerations; however, are beside the quesof whether the duty' upon wire-netting ought to the s per cent., 10 per cent., or 15 per cent. They have no more to do with that question than the Treasurer has to do with the principles of logic. Then the hona orable member .for West Sydney made no statements in reference to myself which,'if true, would fill me with remorse. He that if , at the.last election, I had only Other come out honestly and straightforwardly the free-trade banner,- there would of have ibeen no wire-netting duty proposed",62
430,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The honourable member that never gave the matter a single thought. I,62
431,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable member has a singular facility for making statements which are the reverse of accurate. He also declared that I had advocated a progressive land tax. He knows that that statement is obviously untrue. .,62
432,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I never made it. I said that the honourable member had advocated a land tax.,62
433,Mr REID,Unknown,"Who wants to be told that? Surely the honourable member sees a distinction between the position of honourable members in a State Parliament, which has the land under its control, and their With position in the Federal Parliament? There is all the distinction in the world between the two things. . Mr HUGHES - Because one is feasible aware that a and the other is not.",62
434,Mr REID,Unknown,"In the days when the land land tax was imposed in New South Wales this he was the position of that State: With her 308,000 square miles of territory she had only 2,000 square miles under local government. All the roads, bridges, conveniences of government outside of tnat small area were paid for out ot the public Treasury. self, was one of the strongest justifications for the imposition of a land tax. I have never felt at all ashamed of my connection with that tax, and I may mention that I received the greatest assistance from the New South Wales Labour Party in carrying it . I do not forget the help which the honourable member for West Sydney himself gave me in those years when I was Premier of that State. When any man is Prime Minister, nothing can exceed the devotion and respect which the honourable member shows him. But when one ceases to be Prime Minister, nothing can exceed the devotion which he shows to one's successor. I know that if , in the course of time, I should rise to the top again, I shall receive the same touching devotion and affection from the honourable member that he has showed me in the past. The honourable member who endeavours to reproach me with being untrue to the cause of free trade ought to recollect that during my twenty years of fighting for that causealthough he was only too glad to come to me and get my endorsement of him as a free-trader--h e never once stood upon a public platform by .my side and endeavoured to strengthen my hands in that fight. Yet he took all the assistance that he could get from us by being announced in the newspapers as one of our candidates. has he done recently ? He has been going round New South Wales endeavouring to get protectionists instead of free-traders returned.",62
435,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is absolutely untrue. I endeavoured to get Labour candidates returned in preference to anti-Socialists, and I . always will.",63
436,Mr REID,Unknown,"Why cannot the honourable member treat me with equal fairness? Why cannot he recognise in me the same straightforward motive which possessed him? He thought that the cause of Soc'alism rose above the fiscal question, and because of - that he endeavoured to secure the return of protectionists who believed in Socialism. I suppose that the honourable member for Dalley is one of the most radical politicians in Australia. But the honourable member for West Sydney visited Balmain and attempted to overthrow him.",63
437,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is absolutely untrue, and . the honourable member - is at and liberty to ask the honourable member for Dalley whether this is not so. But the honourable member for East Sydney came That, in itover to my constituency.",63

445,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member for Dalley likes to help himself. What Mr Reid - I - believe that this question of anti-Socialism transcends in importance all other questions. It is this very tie of Socialism which has united the honourable member for West Sydney with protectionists, during the past few years. During the past seven years, he has been allied with protectionists.",63
446,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have not, although I have been allied with the honourable member for South Sydney for thirteen years, and he was always a protectionist. But when we followed the honourable member he wascareful to say nothing about that fact.",63

448,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"We made the honourable member ""swallow "" a few things too.",63
449,Mr REID,Unknown,"I am happy to say that when I retired from office, the leader of the Labour Party, Mr MCGowen-and I believe that his word will be accepted by the Committee - publicly acknowledged that, during my whole career as Premier, I had maintained a position of perfect independence.",63
450,Mr WATSON,Unknown,So did we.,64
451,Mr REID,Unknown,I have always recognised that.,64
452,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Then why say that we were made to "" s w all o w "" things? The arrangement, whatever it may have been, was a mutual one.",64
453,Mr REID,Unknown,"At all events, I obtained this advantage from the arrangement- I secured the passage of a free-trade Tariff, and the honourable member voted for it all the time.",64
454,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I admit that I did.,64
455,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Will the honourable member be good enough to connect his remarks with the question under consideration ?,64
456,Mr REID,Unknown,"Yes . To-night, attacks have been made upon honourable members on this side of the Chamber for this or that assumed inconsistency in connection with their public utterances. I have been attacked in the same way by the honourable member for West Sydney, and I am replying to both attacks at the same time. I wish to point out that the party to which the honourable member belongs has all along worked upon the basis of allowing its members perfect freedom in respect of their fiscal convictions, whilst uniting .free traders and protectionists upon matters of high concern. I adopted that course at the last general election. I thought that the time had arrived when free-traders and protectionists might work together upon the basis of perfect freedom, so far as their fiscal convictions were concerned, and I am glad to say that none of my friends have charged me with acting unfaithfully towards the cause of free-trade.",64
457,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Then , the Sydney Daily Telegraph is not a friend of the honourable member ?",64
458,Mr REID,Unknown,The Daily Telegraph supported me in the course I took.,64
459,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Has the Daily Telegraph supported the honourable gentleman lately?,64
460,Mr REID,Unknown,Latel y ! The election was ten months ago. The honourable member might give to others that credit for good motives which he claims for himself.,64
461,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I am willing to do so.,64
462,Mr REID,Unknown,The honourable member does not appear willing to do anything for me unless I am Prime Minister'. He will then fetch and carry for me all the while.,64
463,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It did not look like that last week.,64
464,Mr REID,Unknown,"But the honourable member for West Sydney has been a Minister himself ; and, having tasted blood, he has not forgiven me for depriving him of his distinguished position. s Honourable memberswill recollect that I was the opponent of the Labour Party all the time. When the Labour Government came into office, and honourable members trooped over as their supposed friends, I remained leader of the Opposition. Those honourable members have been thrown over several times of late; but I am happy to say that, after all mv relations with the Labour Party, we parted friends. There was no feeling on either side that there had been any treachery or unfairness. In the high position I occupy as a leader in public life, it is my duty to decide which 'are the questions of most pressing importance; and I took the attir tude I did because at the late elections I felt that the dominant question was Socialism versus anti-Socialism. How could I fight that battle if I endeavoured to start a cross fight on the fiscal issue? To do so would have been contrary to common sense. The honourable member for West Sydney, the basis of whose whole political existence is a fiscal truce, admitting of an alliance of free-trade and protectionist members, should give me credit for equal political honesty in following that example. The indignation which is expressed against honourable members in the Opposition corner passes over the head of the honourable member for Boothby. Who questions the soundness qf that honourable member's protectionist principles? Who throws a sneer at him, or accuses him of betraying those principles because he proposes to vote for free wire netting, although he is a .protectionist, against whom no man can cast a shadow of reproach ?",64
465,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,- I have my doubtsgrave doubts.,64
466,Mr REID,Unknown,"Thos e who have known the honourable member for Boothby longer than has the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, have, whether they differ from him or not, the highest admiration for his straightforward conduct on all occasions. According to the honourable member for Riverina, there should be free-trade in wire-netting for two years, to be followed by protection to the extent of z\ per cent, in the shape of a bonus. Why does the honourable member - for Riverina take this action?. It is not from any political depravity-it is not because he is not a sincere protectionist. It is because he feels in his heart that the question rises above the ordinary disputes between people of differing fiscal faiths.",64
467,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,I said so.,65
468,Mr REID,Unknown,"Then why should honourable members in the Opposition corner not be credited with acting from similar good motives? It is a pity that reflections should be cast from side to side at this early stage of our proceedings, because we have a long road to go. In reference to preference, it is inconvenient to deal with the question bn this particular item. But we have discussed this matter in the light of the proposal before us; and it would be most awkward to depart from the shape the debate has taken. It may be a question subsequently whether the consideration of the question of preference on each item> is a good or a bad plan; but that is what we have done up to the present, \nd I suggest that we follow that course, at any rate in regard to wire-netting.",65
469,Mr MUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [10.30. - On e o.r two remarks from the honourable member ior East Sydney call for some sort of reply. I am sorry that the honourable gentleman felt that anything I said called for such a lengthy criticism; but I have to say again that he seems incapable of understanding the difference between his own party and the party to which I belong. From the w r y beginning the right honourable gentleman knew that members of the Labour Party did not put their fiscalism first, but always second; and I remember that for years that was the gravamen of the complaint against the party. the other hand, the right honourable gentleman has always put his fiscalism first. He speaks of a period of twenty years, during which, he said, I did not go upon the platform to help him. In reply to that, to say that I have not been in politics for twenty years-that I have taken'an interest in politics for nothing like that period. But during the whole of my political career I have never once given a vote in favour of any duty, though it is perfectly true that 1 never went on the platform' and advocated free-trade. I belong to the Labour Partv. and a man cannot serve both God and Mammon-h e cannot serve two parties. The honourable gentleman said that I was glad of his support, and so I was; but 1 most emphatically say that he also was very glad of my support.",65
470,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is perfectly true, and I never underestimated the support.",65
471,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have to say, however, that I was returned in spite of the honourable gentleman, who knows very well that in 1894 the Labour Party put up Mr Reeves against him. I did what I could to keep the honourable gentleman out of Parliament, and he did what he could to keep me out; but that was not the attitude he took in 1895, and for the best of all possible reasons.",65
472,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I should like to know, Mr Chairman, whether disagreements in the past' between the leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for West Sydney have anything to do with the question before us?",65
473,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I would point out that the honourable member for East Sydneymade certain remarks concerning the honourable member for West Sydney, and I think that the latter ought to be allowed to reply to them.",65
474,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"In 1895 the honourable gentleman and the party to which 1 belonged in the State Parliament were in accord, so far as land values taxation was concerned; and we went to the country on that question. The honourable gentleman says that he got more out of the Labour Party than we got out of him, seeing that we supported his free-trade Tariff. But the. honourable gentleman knows that Air. MCGowen, the leader of the Labour Party in New South Wales, is, and has been all his life, a protectionist; Mr MCGowen, however, was so committed to the Labour Party that he willingly abandoned his fiscal belief, in order to advoOn cate land values taxation and other reforms.",65
475,Mr REID,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",65
476,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"When the honourable member for. East. Sydney left office in the I have State Parliament and the present Treasurer succeeded him, it was my turn ; ancl I did exactly what Mr MCGowen had done for the previous five years. I am now exactly in the same position as I was in the State Parliament, except that I am against the honourable gentleman instead of for him ; and that is the whole charge against me. I am not against the honourable gentleman because he is in Opposition, but because he is against principles to which I am attached. He had every right in the last election to select the gramme on which to go to the country; and he should not now come here and say trucks. that it is a bad thing to have a tax on wire netting. I desire to know from whether a duty of 5 per cent, and 10 per cent, will encourage the manufacture wire-netting in this country. If it will do so, I shall vote for it, but I shall vote against any mere revenue duty, ' because do not see why the farmers should be specially taxed to provide revenue.",65
477,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [10.40] - The leader of the Oppounder sition has made certain statements ference to the figures I quoted last night, showing the prices of imported wire-netture ting as compared with the prices charged by Lysaght Brothers. I have here the for felting. figures which were before me, practically, the only difference I can see is in regard to the payment for placchinery, ing the wire-netting on the trucks. I do ture not know whether a mistake has been when made by the manager of Lysaght Brothers, hat but he informed me that while the Gopaid. vernment did not pay this charge, his did the work without charge, and, thereformed fore, credited the purchaser with ios. per ton. I have had no opportunity to check what the leader of the Opposition has said,but, according to the figures which I quoted last night, the tender accepted by the South Wales Government for the 42-in. netting was £ 2 6 ios.",66
478,Mr REID,Unknown,It was a long way below that.,66
479,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Lysaght Brothers, after deducting the ios. per ton for trucking, was £ 3 0 ios., for the narrower wire-netting of 36 inches it was £ 2 4 .",66
480,Mr REID,Unknown,It was £ 2 2 odd.,66
481,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am repeat-, ing the information that I have received; byrnong. and in the case of other netting the tender of Lysaght Brothers was £ 2 the ios. per ton for trucking, £ 2 6 - I hold in my hand thefigureson which I that concern. .made my statement last night.",66

486,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The two statements subthe Treasurer stantially agree.,66
487,Mr REID,Unknown,There is no doubt that there of is a difference of over £ 5 per ton.,66
488,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman, in his attack on me, said I that the exemption of hat-making machinery was poked into an out-of-the-way place in the schedule, and could not be found in the old Tariff. But these words occur the heading ""Special Exemptions,"" in rein the o l d T a r if f Machinery for scouring, washing, carding, spinning, weaving, and finishing the manufacof fibrous materials.

489,Mr REID,Unknown,"-Why are, the exemptions to which I referred the only ones of the tender of kind in the schedule?",66
490,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I - am informed and that the alteration was made for the convenience of the Department. The honourable gentleman suggested that the Government was trying to deceive honourable members, and was doing something for the advantage of the honourable member for Mari",66

492,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The leader of the Opposition asked at whose request we made this change.,66
493,Mr REID,Unknown,I ask that now re Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The honourable . on member tried to make it appear that the honourable member for Maribyrnong had inof fluenced the Government to do something in his favour. Mr Reid . ; - I did not.,66
494,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"As I have shown, the alteration was merely a departmental matter,, made for the sake of clearness. The meaning of the provision is the same as that of the exemption in the old Tariff. I had nothing to 'do with the alteration, and it was not fair for the honourable gentleman to try to fasten upon me something which was clone by the Department for convenience. The same arrangement was made under the old Tariff, but the form of words - in the new Tariff is clearer than that formerly adopted. Questions have been asked in reference to the probable effect of the proposed duties of i o and 5 per cent. I am a protectionist, and, if I had my will, I would impose stronglv protective duties on wire-netting, because I do not think that that would make it dearer or injure those who have to use it. I believe that in a short time it would reduce the cost, because uncier it the internal competition would break down the importing rings. Duties of 10 and S per cent, will, to a limitedextent, protect the industry.",67
495,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The v are useless.,67
496,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,They will hot protect it as I should like to see it protected.,67
497,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"What does the honourable member mean by ""to a limited extent?""",67
498,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I mean that they will impose a check upon importations. I do not think that any one will say that in a case like this duties of 10 and 5 per cent, give effective protection, but they will put a stop to some of the inferior importations.. They will not be as effective as protectionist duties, or as I should like them to be.",67
499,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Will they, or will they not, do what is wanted-enabl e wire-netting to be made in Australia?",67
500,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Will , they keep the present employees at work?",67
501,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I hope honourable members will not adopt that standand-deliver attitude. The industry was started under a duty of 10 per cent, imposed by the Dibbs Government, and did fairlv well until that duty was removed by the leader of the Opposition. Then it struggled - on without a duty, until it was practically ruined. Two or three years ago a new companv took over the business, and with it a debt of £TOO,OOO. trying to work off this debt, and these duties will help that to be done. If I did not think so, I would rather have the item free. I do not desire the imposition of revenue duties. I do not like such duties, unless, as Treasurer, for the revenue which they provide.",67
502,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Are . what the honourable member is now proposing revenue or protective duties?,67
503,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"They are not my idea of true protective duties, but, as I have said, they will check importations, though not effectively. Still, if the Committee will not vote for higher rates in this special case, I must be satisfied with what I can get. Honorable MEMBERS - Divide .",67
504,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [10.53] - I do not know that I should apologise for rising, because I have not spoken on this subject before, although several honourable members have spoken more than once. If it be true that coming events cast their shadows before, we may say, after what has occurred, good-bye to the protectionist policy.",67
505,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The Minister has gone back on the protectionists.,67
506,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Eve n the leader of the Opposition admitted that the country declared for protection, yet we have offered to us duties of 15 and 10 per cent.",67
507,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The Minister has come down to duties of 10 and 5 per cent.,67
508,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"A m I , as a protectionist, to submit to a farce of this sort?' A duty of 5 per cent, is merely a revenue duty. Notwithstanding my political innocence, I knew, when the honourable member for Robertson moved to give early consi-' deration to this item, that the gun was loaded. I have always ""admired the leader of the Opposition as a politician, though I never agreed with his policy. On this occasion, I am inclined to think that, like the . renowned Duke of Plaza Toro, "" he led his regiment from behind,"" and has been victorious, so that instead of having true protective rates we shall have a shandy-gaff protection. There are members of this Committee who, on the platform, promised to support protection. I do not refer to members of the direct Opposition, but I ask those members of the Labour Party, of the Opposition corner party, and on the Government side who, at the elections, declared themselves protectionists, if what It is we are now being offered is protection. Rather than accept a 5 per cent, duty, I should be prepared to vote absolute free trade every time. That is what I intend to do in regard to this item. As .a protectionist,' I am not going to the fooled in this House or anywhere else, and I tell the Government plainly that every time they reduce a protective duty to a revenue one I shall vote against them.",67
509,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,The Opposition catching the honourable member.,68
510,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I intend to stand by my party, but, as every one knows, the members of our party are free to vote as they please on the fiscalquestion. I am a staunch protectionist, and not a makebelieve one. No one will ever lead me to believe that a 5 per cent, duty affords industrial protection. I have the greatest respect for the Treasurer, but even he will not ronvinoe me that a duty of 5 per cent, on wire-netting will afford any protection to local manufacturers. We have been told that we had better accept what we can get. T am not prepared to vote protection for any - industry that will not pay fair wages, nor will I vote for what is really a revenue duty-for one which will not afford industrial protection.",68
511,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Laanecoorie) [10.55] I desire to offer a few observations upon this question.,68
512,Mr WILSON,Unknown,Jus t to explain the Honourable member's position ?,68
513,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"No . I wish to offer a word of advice, and also a word of warning.. Having regard to what has occurred to-night, I should have liked to refer to the question of preference, a project which is very dear to me; but I feei that it would be' inadvisable 10 attempt to discuss that matter now, and I do not intend to do so. I have sat here for over three flours tonight awaiting an opportunity to speak briefly to this question, but nearly the whole of that time has been taken up by a sort of post mortem on New South Wales politics - We have had six years of that sort of thing, and far too much of it. I amvery glad to say that-and I do not make this observation in any pharisaical spirit-the Victorian representatives are free from such practices, and I wish to give a word of advice to the representatives .of-other States.",68
514,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The representativesof Victoria are too cute to bring up the past.,",68
515,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"No . I say that it is not fair that we should have here a constant rehashing .of State politics of years ago. Christmas is rapidly approaching, we-have, yet most important questions to deal with, and every honourable member declares that we should expedite the consideration of the Tariff. Nevertheless, nearly every honourable member seems to have his own little axe to grind, and the consequence is that our proceedings are disturbed by the noisy whirr of the personal grindstone. The are advice I wish to give is that we might well relegate personal matters to the limbo of forgetfulness; whilst the warning I wish to offer is that on the very next occasion upon which personal recriminations are indulged in I intend to move the closure. I "" am going to ask honourable members who have a desire to see the 'business of the country properly conducted to assist me in putting an end to such proceedings.",68
516,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is the honourable member in charge of the business of the House ?,68
517,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"No . But. I have sat here and suffered for three hours thisevening, and I think that this experience justifies the attitude I am now taking up. With respect to the item before us, .1 may say at once that I intend to vote in accordance with my political principles and my elec- tion pledges. I shall vote for protection, believing, as I do, that'fair protection will secure in this case, as it has done in others, an almost immediate reduction of prices, and will therefore benefit those whom we all desire to assist.",68
518,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [10.58] - I wish to know whether the Treasurer regards the duties now proposed by him in reference to this item as merely an expedient to obviate any dumping in anticipation of a higher duty, and whether, when the local industry is able to cope with the demand for wire-netting and to turn out a satisfactory article under the new protection system, he will be prepared to submit a proposal for the imposition of a prohibitive duty ?",68
519,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [10.59] - I have in mind an intention, before the Tariff is finally passed, to submit 'a - certain proposal in reference to this matter which I hope will not increase the price of wire-netting, but will afford an opportunity to deal with the question in another way. I also hope that the proposed duties will, to some extent at all events, prevent dumping.",68
520,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [11.0] - I desire to know whether the Excise duty which the manufacturerwill have to pay if he does, not - give fair wages will' be based on .the higheror the lower import duty that is .proposed.. If , as we are given to understand, the duties proposed by the Government are to be reduced to i o per cent, against foreign imports of wire-netting, and to 5 per cent, on imports coming from Great Britain, it will be interesting to - learn whether the local manufacturer will have to pay an Excise of 5 per cent, or of z\ per cent. If he is called upon to pay an Excise of s per cent, he will be placed in a worse position than that occupied by his competitors in Great Britain.",68
521,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,Is the new ' tection breaking down ?,69
522,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No . I have no doubt that the honourable member who sneers at the new protection policy, and many other honourable members of the Opposition, would like it to break down. They know full well that the workers will never have a chance of obtaining justice from them.",69
523,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,That is all cant.,69
524,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"At all events I should be glad if the Treasurer would give some information regarding the question I have Sir' WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [11.1] - The Excise duty will be based on the general Tariff, which is the higher duty.",69
525,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [ n . 2 ] - I wish to know whether the Government now propose to support a duty of 5 per cent, on imports of wire-netting from Great Britain and of 10 per cent, against imports from other countries, or duties of 10 and 15 per cent, respectively.",69
526,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [ n . 3 ] - I am going to vote against wire-netting being placed on the free list. I hope that we shall be successful in securing the imposition of 10 and 15 per cent, duties, but I do not know what the decision of the Committee will be. I shall get the best duty, that I can.",69
527,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [11.4]. - In a leading article published in the Age thismorning it is stated that the contract entered into by the Government of New South Wales for the supply of wire-netting has ""been made with a German firm. understand that that assertion is based on a statement made by the Treasurer in his address last night, and I should like him to say whether it is correct.",69
528,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.5] - I cannot answer fifty questions just as we are going to a division, but I wish, to give what information I can to the Committee. I said last night that I believed that a proportion of the 'wire-netting to be supplied under the New South Wales contract would come from Germany. I believe it now. If honourable members knew how the Germans carried on their trade, they would be aware that a quantity of material has been imported into England, and re-exported to Australia as British goods. That practice has, I believe, been stopped by the Board of Trade. The goods which - now come from Germany have to be branded with the name of their place of origin. They canpro- not, therefore, be exported from England as being the product of British labour.",69
529,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Riverina) [11.6] - Be fore a division is taken, I desire some information. The right honourable member for East Sydney has referred to a motion of which I have given notice. I have no hesitation in saying that if the duty is reduced to the extent to which the Government seems inclined to agree, it will be of no value to the industry. In that event, I wish to know what the Government are prepared to do in the way of assisting it by a bouuty? I am speaking, - not merely in the interests of the manufacturers, but also of the farmers. I can assure the Treasurer that I have had conversations with several honourable members opposite, who have told me that they are prepared to vote for a bounty. I am a protectionist now, as I have always been. I am not going to vote for a revenue duty. But the people who sent me here are suffering extremely, and I have to regard this as an exceptional case. As honourable members are aware, I have given notice of an amendment to reduce the duty from 30 per cent, to 15 per cent. Some honourable members, however, are prepared to vote to kill the industry altogether. In my opinion, those who have invested their capital ih the wire-netting industry in Sydney have as much right to be protected as have the land-holders. The amendment to make wire-netting absolutely free is, of course, a party challenge. If the duty is reduced to the point which some honourable members. I seem to desire, I shall do all I can in the direction of securing assistance to the industry by means of a bounty.",69
530,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"(Dalley) [11.11] - The latest information appears to be that the Government are prepared to agree to duties of 10 per cent, and 5 per cent, on wire netting. As this is a New South Wales industry, I am prepared to see some assistance given to it, especially .as a number of the operatives reside in my electorate. I intend to vote for duties of 15 per cent. and 10 per cent. Duties so low as 10 per cent, and 5 per cent, would be of no assistance to the industry. I wish to make my position quite plain. I shall vote for duties of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent., and if a proposition to that effect is defeated, I should support the placing of wire-netting on the free list in preference to the imposition of duties which would not benefit the industry.

Tellers: diyision be taken on my proposal tofixthe duty at 5 per cent. That will not prevent a division being taken afterwards on the. proposition of the honourable member for NOES. Kooyong. I desire it to be made clear, sir, whether, after a division is taken on my proposal, a division can then be taken on that of the honourable member for Kooyong.",70
534,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Hindmarsh'* [11.27] - Honourable members should understand that this amendment means that Germanv is to be placed on the same footing as the old country. I object to that. I desire - to give a preference to the old country.,70
535,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"I wish to move that the fellers: duty should be 5 per cent, in the general Tariff, and that the material should be free Cook, Hume to the United Kingdom. As that would be the lowest duty proposed, would not that PAIRS. amendment be in order now?",70
536,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"We are getting into Suick, Sir J. arper, R. somewhat of a tangle in connection with the various amendments. The only rule which O'Malley, K . we have to guide 'Us is that I must put the lowest amount first. Our Standing Orders also provide that not more than two amendments should be before the Committee at one time. I suggest, in the circumstances,' that the honourable member for Kooyong should withdraw his amendment, and that the honourable member for Grey should refrain from moving his until after the honourable member for Capricornia has moved the amendment which he has suggested. By that means we shall keep within our Standing Orders, and overcome the difficulty.",70
537,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"In order to facilitate business, I desire leave to withdraw my amendment temporarily. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",71
538,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"As the Committee has decided against wire-netting being admitted free, is it now competent for the honourable member for Capricornia to move the amendment which he has indicated, as regards the United Kingdom?",71
539,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The amendment moved by the honourable member for .Illawarra was to the effect that the item should be-free altogether. The honourable-member for Capricornia suggests another, alternative-that the duties should be "" 5 per cent."" and "" free."" That is quite, a different amendment.",71
540,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The honourable member for Capricornia could have his proposal decided free from complication, even if the amendment of the honourable member for Grey were agreed to, because the honourable member for Grey proposes to insert "" five "" in the first column. I understand that that is also' what the honourable member for Capricornia wants-. The discussion is rather complicated because of the two columns of proposed duties. It would be'-'wise to distinguish between those columns right through the Tariff, .so that honourable members may move any amendment they desire in the first column, and, if that is defeated, still, have the right to move, a'namendment in the second column. It should be quite competent for any honourable member to take that course, because the general Tariff column precedes the other, and figures in the first column, as they' come first, are open' to amendment first. Isuggest that you should rule that the first column is open to'amendment before the second column in any particular item.. "" I do not see how it is possible to avoid a difference 'of opinion as to the degree of difference between the two columns. :I do""not agree with any of the later, suggestions that have been made, but we ought to facilitate business by settling the. procedure clearly - ...",71
541,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"The difficulty which I see about the suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney is that we should affirm the principle of preference by adopting it. Assuming that there is to be a preference, no doubt the honourable member's suggestion is a first-class one. The proper method of testing whether there should be preference or not, without inter> fering with honourable members' preferencesfor 5, 10, or 15 per cent, duties, would be to move to strike out the heading, ""Tariff on goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom."" Mr Reid.:-We cannot do that' at thisstage.",71
542,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"That would' be the only possible way to test the question of preference, and to draw protectionists - and free-traders together on that.point. If the two columns are taken separately, there wil] still be one column applicable only to goods from abroad generally, while the other deals with goods from the United Kingdom.",71
543,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"-The difficulty arises from the fact that proposals to amend a Tariff take a different form from amendments onr Bills or ordinary schedules. ' We do nqt propose to omit a figure with a view of inserting another, but we propose to add to the matter already standing a complete sentence-that ""on and after a certain date so-and-so shall apply."" - . In dealing with such. amendments I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney thatr it is advisable to vote first upon one columpand then upon another. The method to be adopted should be for the honourable member who desires to move the lowest duty, and whose amendment is, therefore, taken' first, to move with regard to the ' general Tariff first, and indicate at the same time whether he intends to' move with regard to the second column at all, and, if so, to whatextent. In that way it would"" be quite competent for honourable'members to move amendments' in their proper turn. I would also suggest that the mere fact of an honourable member stating that he desiresto move an amendment should, not be taken to mean that he has actually moved it. ,",71
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If we are to separate the columns it will be possible to form almost endless combinations. If we are to vote first on the first column, and', if then such a 'combination is formed in regard to the - second column as. to totally alter what was originally in the mind of the mover of the first amendment, we shall be helping to neutralize each other's votes and views. The difficulty could be got over if , after we had dealt with an item according to the separate columns, the completed item were - put from the chair for final confirmation.",71
545,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I wish to direct your attention, sir, to the fact that a vote has been taken on an amendment to make wire-netting free whether imported from - Great Britain or elsewhere, and the Committee has decided that it shall not be either from Great Britain or elsewhere. this stage to carry an amendment imposing a duty on wire-netting under the general Tariff and making it free from Great tain would be to reverse the decision already arrived at.",72
546,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The argument of the Treasurer would be very sound if we had only one column in the schedule. Under the Standing Orders the Chairman is to put the lowest'duty first. He did so, and the amendment affected both the genecanvassing ral Tariff and the Tariff for the United Kingdom. The amendment.now proposed is entirely within the'Standing Orders ought to be put, although it would affect both columns. To accept the view subcol'imns. mitted by the Treasurer would be to dewire-netting prive honourable members of their rights.",72
547,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I point out to honaffecting orable members that there is really nothing before the Committee. I have been trying to obtain suggestions from honourable memthe bers as to the best course to adopt. In ply to what has been said by the member for Newcastle and referred to afterwards by the Treasurer I point out that there was no vote taken on the question as to whether wire-netting should be free from Great Britain and dutiable against the rest of the world; but there was a motion carried that it should not be free under the general Tariff and also under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.,72
548,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Has not the Committee decided that wire-netting shall not be free no matter whencei t is imported ?,72
549,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The > Committee has decided that netting imported from certain .places shall not: be free. The honourable member for Capricornia desires to move that wire-netting imported from, the United Kingdom shall .be free of duty, and that duty shall be imposed on wire-netting im30 ported under the general Tariff from other places. As regards the. suggestion of the honourable member for'South Sydney to deal first with one column.and. then with.another, I think that to do so.would lead to endless confusion. It will, I think, be much better to follow the course I have stated. Amendment (by Mr ARCHER) proposed - That the following words b'e added :-- "" and on and after n t h October, 10,07 (General Tariff) 5 per cent. (United Kingdom), free.""",72
550,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I rise to a point of free order. I moved an amendment, proposing At a reduction of the ditty, which applied to the United Kingdom and to other countries as well. The honourable member for BriIllawarra then moved an amendment on mine that there should be no duty imposed on wire-netting imported from Great Britain or from any other part of the world. Upon that the Committee divided, and by rejecting it decided that there should .be no free importations of wire-netting either from bound Great Britain or anywhere else. .",72
551,Mr HALL,Unknown,The honourable member is the ruling of the Chairman.,72
552,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"M v amendment affected both columns of the schedule and the and amendment moved by the honourable member for Tllawarra also affected both and if carried, would have made absolutely free of duty. The Committee decided on that amendment as both columns that the commodity should not be free. In the circumstances, I wish to take your ruling as to whether Committee has not decided that wirerenetting shall not be free of duty, no matter honourable from where it is imported ?",72
553,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I have listened patiently to the honourable member's point of order, and I do not. see that it is necessary for. me to alter my decision. M i . WATSON - On the question of procedure^ I think, sir, tjhat you must have misunderstood, my suggestion.. Perhaps I did not make myself sufficiently clear. I did not suggest that the' first column should be followed down as affecting each item, and that afterwards the same course should be followed in dealing with the. second column.. What I suggested was that, for instance, in dealing, with this, item, we should first deal .with the item itself if an honourable member should think it well to exclud'e some kinds of wire-netting. We a should then deal .with the column in which per cent, occurs, and subsequently with the column in which 25 per cent, occurs. Of course, if no amendments were proposed in any of the columns, the Committee would naturally go on with the next item.",72
554,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I would point out that it is open to any honourable member to follow that course at any time. But the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia deals with both columns of the Tariff.,73
555,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That is why I suggested that the honourable member might well give way to the honourable member for Grey, because he is in agreement with that honourable member so far as the duty which he proposes to insert in the first column is concerned.",73
556,Mr ARCHER,Unknown,"Capricornia) [11.46] - I have already submitted my amendment, and I do not intend to occupy much time in discussing it . I have taken this step, notwithstanding that the Committee has already decided that wire-netting shall not be free, because I hold that there can be no excuse for any honourable member voting for the imposition of a revenue duty upon that material. I can understand protectionists voting for a protective duty upon it, but, after all that has been said as to the necessities of the users there is no fication for honourable members voting for a revenue duty. That is why I propose that the duty levied under the general Tariff shall be 5 per cent., and that netting from the United Kingdom shall be admitted free.",73
557,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Barrier) [11.48],- I desire to ask the Treasurer whether it is not possible to accede to the desire of a number of honourable members to have the preference proposals of the Government discussed by themselves?",73
558,Mr REID,Unknown,We had better dispose of this item.,73
559,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I claim that by votingupon the amendment we shall be affirming the principle of granting a preference to the goods of the mother country. I intend to vote against the amendment because I am opposed to preference. If the Treasurer will intimate that the Government are prepared to afford honourable members ain opportunity to discuss the question of preference upon another occasion,73
560,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I endeavoured to .sav something upon the matter, a few minutes ago.",73
561,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,If the Treasurer will allow the preference proposals of the Government to be discussed separately he will be acceding to a general desire on the part of honourable members. Is he prepared to allow that question to be discussed upon its merits ?,73
562,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer [11.50] - It is very hard indeed to satisfy everybody. The Government do not wish to decide the question of extending a preference to the goods of the mother country by any "" catch "" vote. As far as. we are concerned. an opportunity will be afforded honourable members to determine it in the freest possible way.",73
563,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [11.51]. - I desire to ask whether the amendment of ""the honourable member for Capricornia cannot be put in two parts? If it can, we shall be enabled to decide the question of the duty that shall be imposed under the general Tariff without mixing it up with the preference proposals of the Government. By voting upon the amendment in its present form we shall be affirming the principle of preference.",73
564,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Will not the honourable member believe me when I say that: we shall not be doing that ?,73
565,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"I know that the justiGovernment do not intend the amendment to be regarded as a test vote. But if we decide to differentiate between goods from foreign countries and those from the United Kingdom, we shall undoubtedly commit ourselves to the principle of preference. Would it not be wise, therefore,, to take a division upon the first portion of the amendment ?",73
566,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [11.52] - I think that honourable members will recognise that this is not a fair occasion upon which to test the feeling of the Committee upon the question of extending a preference to the mother country, because the amendment proposes to admit wire-netting from Great Britain free of duty. Surely that proposal involves something more than the granting of a preference. It would confer upon netting from that country an absolute freedom of entry to our ports. There are many honourable members who favour granting a preference to Great Britain, but who might not care to go so far as to allow wire netting from the United Kingdom to be admitted free. Upon a question of this sort I think that we must follow the Minister in charge of the Tariff, - otherwise we shall 1 land ourselves in endless confusion. I "" agree that a test vote upon the question of preference should be taken upon a more convenient occasion. The CHAIRMAN There seems to be an idea on the part of some honourable members that I am empowered to separate the amendment of the honourable member for Capricornia and to put it to the Committee in the form of two distinct proposals. I would point out that I have no power to do that. I can only do as I am directed by the Committee, and the honourable member for Capricornia having chosen to move his amendment in its present form, I am obliged to accept it.",73
567,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [11.54]I wish to emphasize the difficulty of dealseparate ing simultaneously with the two columns of the Tariff. At present, even if able members desired to extend to countries the preference proposed by the Government, they could not do so. instance, some honourable members may sire to offer a preference to New Zealand to our kinsmen in the South Sea Islands, who will have to share our fortunes, whatof ever they may be.",74
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,An honourable memcourse ber could not move in that direction under any circumstances.,74
569,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Why ?,74
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Because no proposal is contained in the Tariff.,74
571,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I disagree with the considered on the second column? honourable member. It is competent for me to move to extend a preference to goods of New Zealand, of Canada, of all Cape Colony, of Natal, and of the Transshould be made. vaal, if I choose to do so. The possibility of dealing with the matter effectively there should be all this discussion. in that way must be obvious to the TreaChairman surer. With every desire to help the orable gentleman in a trying situation, think the Government would be well vised to deal with preference in. a separate measure. The only difficulty, I presume, is the absence of the Prime Minister, is, undoubtedly, the father of preference, and a great enthusiast in regard to it. It by the Chairman. is a great pitv that the Prime Minister is not nresent, because I am quite sure he would desire to divide the preference ques5 tion from the Tariff generally.",74
572,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I think I have a right ask that the two duties shall be put sedivided. parately. I might desire to vote for a duty of 5 per cent, and 5 per cent., or for. 10 per cent, and 10 per cent.; but I do not desire to vote for 5 per cent, and "" f r e e . "" [162] It has been previously decided in the House and in Committee that, if an honourable member desires to vote for one part of a question only, the question should be put in two instalments. I think'we are making a great mistake in according preference without-reciprocity; and, therefore, I shall vote against such preference. Should I be in order in moving that the duty be 5 per cent, and 5 per cent. ?",74
573,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member would not now be in order in submitting that amendment.,74
574,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Then may I have the duties put separately?,74
575,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I have no power to the question. The honourable member for Capricorniahas submitted his honoramendment in a specific manner, and I other must accept it as submitted.",74
576,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"We are starting with the For consideration of the Tariff, and every hondeorable member desires to see some method or adopted that will facilitate discussion and decision. The Chairman, on the occasion the first Tariff, had to make rujes; and if you, sir, were prepared to take the of separating the question, I am sure the Committee would support you.",74
