2,Mr HIQ,Unknown,"GS - Accordin g to the Royal' Commission on Navy and Defence Administration, instances were furnished, to it in which a Minister had incurred expenditure, either without reference to, or in opposition to, the Naval Board, with unsatisfactory and costly' results to the Commonwealth. I ask the Acting Prime Minister if the Minister referred to is a member of the .present Australian National War Government; and, if so, what is his name, and docs the Government propose to dismiss him from office?",21
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,For an ex-Minister to pop a question like this without notice is most 'Unfair. - Mr Hious - Does not the Acting Prime Minister know the name of the Minister referred to? Has he not read the Commission's report!,21
4,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I have glanced through the report in the time available to me, but - I cannot say to which of the many Ministers who have had charge of the Defence Departments the statement applies. If the honourable, member will give notice of the question, I shall confer with the Attorney-General on the subject. EXPORTATION OE LEATHER . construction",21
5,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"T s the Acting Prime Minister Aware that .during the past few months a very large quantity of hides, but a comparatively small quantity of leather, if any at all, has been shipped to England) Is the honourable gentleman able to inform the Rouse whether the Shipping Controller in England has cabled to the 'Shipping Board here to the effect that, so far as .possible, hides and leather shall be provided with an equal amount of shipboard space! M.r. WATT - I think that I have shown myself familiar with the situation to which the honourable member refers, in regard to which I have answered more questions than on any other subject that I can recollect. I endeavoured to ascertain yesterday whether actual official effect had been given to the arrangement which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was able to make in London, and I was informed then that, so far, no official in struction in the direction stated had been issued by the British Shipping Controller. ERECTION OF HOUSES. - Mr FINLAYSON - Las t week I called attention to the probable effect of a regulation issuod under the War Precauence tions Act, which requires the written sent of the Treasurer to the construction or erection of buildings. I then expressed the view that the regulation might be held to apply to the erection of buildings intended for homes, which are urgently needed at the present time; but the Ministurned tor for Works aud Railways (Mr Groom) expressed the view that it did not so apply. I have since received a communication from the solicitor to a building who points out that building societies and land companies erect houses for sale, and fears that. this regulation is meant to apply to such buildings. If the Acting Prime Minister could make a statement on the subject, it would dispel doubts.",22
6,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The honourable member of did me the courtesy to inform me of his intention to ask this question, and I have in my hand a copy of the regulation to which he refers. It does not apply to the erection of houses for homes, as a cursory examination of it would make plain. The classes of buildings for the erection and of which the written consent of the Treasurer is needed are these(o) Tramway or tramway building or office; jo) market or market building; (c) building to be used for a club, library, art gallery, school of art, mechanics' institute, museum, or exhibition of animals; (d) ball or building to be owned or controlled by a friendly society or other society, association, or organization; (e) church or building to be owned or controlled by an organization connected with a church the cost of which exceeds f1,000; (f) building in which intoxicating liquors are to be sold; or (o) additions or alterations, involving an expenditure exceeding £250, to a worH or building of any of the classes specified in this regulation. The only home - affected is possibly the home of the man who sells intoxicating liquor. The regulation does not apply to the construction and erection of homes for ordinary citizens. RETURNED SOLDIERS. PltEFtSREKCS OF EMPLOYMENT.",22
7,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Is it the policy of the Government, or of the Department of new the Postmaster-General, to give preferof employment to returned soldiers, conall things being equal? If so, does the Commonwealth Public Service Act prevent effect being given to that policy?",22
8,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"It is the policy of the Government to give preference to resoldiers, all things being equal, and my Department is giving effect to the policy. Nothing in the Public Service Act, so far as I am aware, interferes society, with thiB policy. CORRECTION OF RETURN .",22
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I have received the following certain letter from ' the Treasury:Referring to the statement laid on the table the House, containing information in connection with the Sixth War Loan newspaper advertisements, J beg to inform you that as the result of a careful' check in this office errors in addition have been discovered in the statement which was prepared by the Commonwealth Bank. Will you please advise me whether there is any objection to the statement already presented to Parliament being altered in conformity with the attached copy in which the corrections have been made in red ink. The discrepancy referred to is only a small'matter, the alteration being needed to make the summary agree with the detail, and I saw no objection to its being made; but as the paper referred to has been laid on the table, I considered it right to mention the matter to the House. WAR LOAN ADVERTISEMENTS.",22
10,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In reply to a question asked by me some time ago, a statement was presented showing the distribution of War Loan advertisements. It was generally agreed by honourable members it would be too expensive to print the information in Hansard, and the Acting Prime Minister promised to make availways able to each member a copy of it. Can I have my copy today? I would remind the honourable gentleman that this is Grievance Day.",23
11,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The fact that this is Grievance Day has not escaped my such notice, but I am sure that the honourable member .can find sufficient other grounds for the ventilation of grievances without this paper. Speaking from memory, in fulfilment of my promise, I gave the inreturn. struction that copies of the paper should be prepared for honourable members, and I shall renew that instruction today, so that honourable members may have their copies as soon as possible.

15,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Some time ago I asked the Minister for Works and Rail(Mr Groom) a question in reference to the provision of homes for the widows of soldiers killed at the Front.

Mr ""WATT- I think that this Parliament is rapidly becoming a conundrum factory, to whioh the University is a mere circumstance. I have never considered the question raised, but I presume honourable member refers to Tattersall's sweeps ?",23

29,Mr WATT,Unknown,"When the matter was raised by the honourable member I promised to refer it to the Commisof sioner of Taxes to see whether the request 'Could be complied with. I did so, and the Commissioner replied that he would regard the preparation of data of that kind as a violation of the secrecy of his office; and there I was obliged to leave",24

33,Mr WATT,Unknown,Not yet.,24
34,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,No ; but when we have EXPORT OF MEAT. MUTTON FOR SOLDIERS.,24
35,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I desire to ask a conquestion about the overseas shipment of meat under Imperial contracts. For some time past shipments have been confined mainly to Queensland, where the supplies were plentiful. Now, however, conditions have altered, and there is an exportable surplus in other States. Will the Acting Prime Minister make representations with a view to assuring those concerned that the space will he equitably apportioned amongst the States, particularly to Victoria, where there have been no shipments for some time, and stocks are fast",24
36,Mr WATT,Unknown,"After a .conversation I privileged to have with the honourable to member yesterday On the matter, I have been able, in consultation with the shipping authorities of the Commonwealth and the .agricultural authorities of the States this morning, to ascertain the exact position so far as they are able to tell it to me. It appears that the market is suffering from a great deal of fear- I speak of the Victorian market for mutton and lambs chiefly-that drought conditions will force sales, and that there will be no possibility of either shipments or cold storage. That, as it appears tq me, is almost an obsession on the part of many producers. So far as I have been able to ascertain, there is in the cold stores of Victoria a total theoretic available capacity for 1,600,000 carcasses, "" as we at present store them in cut condition. There is roughly a fourth of that space, representing 400,000 carcasses, occupied, leaving three-fourths, or space for about 1,200,000 carcasses, unoccupied. So far as the authorities of the State of Victoria are able to ascertain, that is being filled, or will be filled in the next month or so, if conditions continue as they are, at the rate of 160,000 carcasses per week. It is estimated, therefore, that, if no relief in shipment takes place, the-stores will be filled by about the middle of December. The shipping arrangements are such, according to promises already made of insulated space for this part of Australia, that that time may be extended by shipping relief to about the middle of January. That is as far as we can see ahead now; but, after considering all the facts elicited by my inquiries this morning, I have cabled to the Prime Minister asking him to do two things-first , to ascertain if it will not be possible in Britain to get more insulated space for Australia, in view of the seasonable and possible drought pressure; and, secondly, to see whether it is not possible to get mutton sent to Egypt. I do not know whether honourable members quite appreciate the difficulty in this connection. So far, we have been able to ship only beef, which is the ration for the British Army. It seems extraordinary that men reared on sheep should be compelled to eat beef; and I see no reason why mutton should not .form a part of the rations in Egypt and Mesopotamia. If Mr Hughes is able to do what I have suggested, it will relieve the situation a great deal, without prejudicing the beef districts of Australia. I expect to get the Prime Minister's reply inside a week. Later: Mr ""WATT - I caused further inquiries to be made shortly before lunch, and I now have information to the effect that the calculation of 160,000 carcasses per week, upon which the date to the middle of December is based, is in excess of the actual capacity; that is to say, the killing capacity of the trade, in Tespect of both labour and space, will be much below ""that figure.",24
37,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The Acting Prime Minister is speaking of Victoria alone.,25
38,Mr WATT,Unknown,"I explained that probably an attempt would be made to put into cool store 160,000 carcasses per week. It is plain that that number cannot be slaughtered and dealt with, and that will mean an extension of the calculated date by possibly a month or more. That should give further assurance to the holders of stock. PRICE OF MEAT.",25
39,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Accordin g to the newspapers, meat is coming down in price, and I should like to know whether arrangements can be made by which the consumer, and not the salesmen, may get the benefit?",25
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The Government has fixed the maximum price for meat. It was not intended to follow the market in every fluctuation, but to fix twice a year a maximum price between given dates in the export and non-export season. Pending the co-ordination of frozen and canned prices I do not anticipate any adjustment of existing maximum rates. LIQUOR TRAFFIC PROHIBITION .",25
41,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"In view of theurgency of the question, will the Acting Prime Minister agree to a vote being taken on the subject of war-time prohibition of the liquor traffic ?",25
42,Mr WATT,Unknown,"For m'any months past the honourable member has had upon the business-paper a notice of motion relating to that matter, but he has never given notice of any question on the subject. He heard my answer the other day as to the attitude of the Government, and I ask him to give notice of any further inquiry.

Is the Minister awaTe that the Acts of Parliament under which the municipal council supplies its consumers forbid discrimination, so that the exercise of a discretion involves the council in a breach of the law ? 3. Has any authority been granted by the Commonwealth Government, as promised, to allow the substituted authority (viz., the electrical engineer) to so discriminate between essential and non-essential industries? 4. Is it not a fact that in consequence of the failure of the Commonwealth Government to absolve the councilfrom breaches of the State Act under which it grants supply, the municipal council ofSydney has had to disallow all applications for connection with its mains, except under certain conditions, to be approved by the council? 5. Has not this imperfect administration by the Commonwealth Government had the effect of rendering impossible any action on the part of [259]- 2 the electrical' engineer by disallowing all expenditure not approved .by the established authority, and so seriously inconveniencing and hampering the industries of Sydney? «",29
68,Mr WATT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I have made inquiries HALL . regarding this matter, and the Director of Munitions reports that the position is as follows: The question of Avhether a new applicant can refer- be connected depends, in - many cases, on the daily load curve of the supply undertaking, and is a technical one on which the chief engineer is best able to judge, but no objection will be taken to the chief engineer consulting full y with his council before making decisions,.and. it is, in fact, presumed that in cases of doubt as to whether an applicant sbould be connected or not, this is done. Moreover, the council has control over its own, officers. Most supply undertakings constituted under a State law are not allowed by such law to discriminate, but no breach of the law is involved in this case, as the War Precautions regulations legalize the actions taken under them. The autliority given under the War Precautions regulations to the chief engineer enables him to conserve existing unused capacity (if any), and any capacity resulting from the installation of new plant during the continuation of the regulations for purposes of national or economical importance. In the case of refusal to connect, an appeal to a Director of Munitions is provided for in the regulations, and in this way it is felt that no industry really essential is likely to be refused .a supply of current. The regulations, as far as is known, have not in any way increased the difficulties of the Sydney Council, as is implied by this question, but it is known that for a lengthy period before the War Precautions regulations wer.e passed on the 18th September, the Sydney Municipal Council, of its own accord, had refused to connect a large number of consumers owing to shortage of power, plant, and essent i a l apparatus. ' In fact, the shortage in Sydney was one of the determining factors which led the Government to give powers of discrimination under the War Precautions regulations, so that industries which should get power would not suffer at the expense of consumers who could, without serious - inconvenience, - dispense with additional connexions. The Sydney Council, not having had for a considerable time sufficient generating plant, and having, long before the incidence of the regulations, imposed of its own accord restrictions on new connexions, it is not understood how the War Precautions regulations can either inconvenience or hamper the industries of Sydney, as their sole object is to enable a supply to be given to essential industries. Generally, in connection with the whole matter raised by these questions, it is desired to point out that a conference of the supply engineers of the six capital cities was recently called, and, as a result of that conference, a schedule of requirements for new plant for a period of about two years was drawn up, ""and the Commonwealth Government is now in communication with the Ministry of Munitions in England, through the High Commissioner, with a view to(1) Expediting the delivery of such plant in this schedule as is now on order, and (2) Getting leave to manufacture such of the plant as is not yet ordered. Similar action has been taken regarding pla""nt on order in America. It is, therefore, apparent that the Common- ' wealth Government is doing everything possible to facilitate the provision of electrical generating plant for the supply undertakings, and in the meantime is - taking the necessary Steps to see that such plant as is available at the present time in Australia in the main industrial centres is used to the best advantage. I would invite the attention of the honourable member to War'Precautions (Electricity) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1918, No. 250. SHORTAGE OF PAPER.",29
69,Mr MACKAY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. On what basis is the representation of the various interests on the Paper Control Board? 2. Does the Minister consider that the count r y press is adequately represented?",30
70,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are follow:1. Each section of the industry is being invited to form such committees, State and Federal, as may be deemed necessary to advise their representative on the Commonwealth Advisory Board. The members of the Advisory Board are as follow:- Mr Jas. Dunlop, representing paper merchants'; Mr Duncan MCDougall, representing manufacturing stationers; Sir Lauchlin MACKinnon, representing newspaper proprietors; Hon. G. H . Varley, repre ing master printers; Mr Robert Elliott, senting employees; Mr Davis"", representing paper bag makers; Mr Mark Sheldon, representing paper importers; Mr Corney, representing paper and board manufacturers; Mr. P. J. Firth, representing paper box makers. 2. Yes. Mr ""WISE - Yesterday the honourable member for Wide Bay { Mr Corser) asked:Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that twelve duplicate copies are required to be handed in with any request for permission to import goods from Great Britain containing steel, and does he not consider it a gross extravagance, in view of the fact that paper is so scarce, entailing on Government Departments in Great Britain the necessity for using small memoranda, which often have writin g on the backs of them, and also entailing, in many cases, the use of the same envelope twice? I have received the following report from .the Director of Munitions in connection with this matter:Twelve, copies of each application for priority certificate arc required to meet the requirements of the British Ministry of Munitions. The Ministry of Munitions, through the High Commissioner, asked that four copies of each application should be forwarded, together with a duplicate set by second mail, in case the first set was lost. This makes eight copies. One copy is filed in the office of the Director of Munitions, nnd three copies axe sent to the applicants. The High Commissioner bands three of his copies to the Ministry of - Munitions. The Ministry of Munitions endorses the decisions on the application and disposes of the three copies,as follows:One duly endorsed copy is filed in the office of the Ministry of Munitions. One duly endorsed copy is returned to the High Commissioner. One duly endorsed copy is sent to the agent, manufacturer, or buyer in Great Britain . The four duplicate copies are forwarded to the High Commissioner by second mail, in case the original mail has been lost in transit. Of the three copies returned to the applicants, one is for their file and two for forwarding by successive mails to the manufacturers or to their principals or buyers in Great Britain . The application forms take the place of letters between the Directorate of Munitions and the High Commissioner, between the High Commissioner and the Ministry of Munitions, and beas tween the Ministry of Munitions and the buyers or agents in Great Britain. There is, therefore, really a considerable economy in paper. The fact that duplicates have to be sent by the second mail accounts, of course, for five of the copies. LUCERNE SEED.",30
71,Mr JENSEN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"On the l l t h in s t a n t the honourable member for N e w E n g l and (L t - O o l o n el A b b o t t ) asked the following questions:1. Is it a fact that recently lucerne seed has repre- been imported into the Commonwealth, and that seeds foreign to lucerne were mixed with it? 2. What steps have been taken to protect the farmers against the introduction of foreign noxious weeds in this way? 3. Is it a fact that the imported seed is grown by black'labour, and is being, sold at a price considerably below the average ruling price for locally grown seed? 4. Whether tests have been made to prove that the imported seed gives poor results when compared with that locally grown? 5. Wliether the Minister will consider the advisableness of imposing a duty of one shilling (Is.) per bushel on imported seed? I desire now to inform the honourable member as follows:1. Consignments of lucerne seed have recently been imported from various parts of the world. In some cases,the seed was found to be mixed with a small proportion of weed seeds, but not more than usual. 2. Noxious weed seeds and pests are prohibited under the Quarantine Act. All imported seeds are sampled and inspected on arrival by expert officers, and sliould weed seeds be present the,, seed is completely cleaned by means of special appliances. 3. A proportion of the imported seed was from South Africa, and it is probable that black labour was employed in its cultivation. The Department bas, however, no definite information on the point. Inquiries made go to show that South African seed is being offered for sale at a lower price than the locally grown article. 4. Imported seeds are tested for viability. Tho tests of the lucerne seed. in this respect were good; but information as .to results in the field is not available. 5. The question of imposing a duty on imported lucerne seed has already been noted for consideration when the Tariff is being further dealt with. SUPPLY (Formal).

72,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Melbourne Ports) [ 3 . 6 ] - I am diffident about approaching a matter that I wish to bring before the House, but I feel that ' it is my duty to do so. We are expecting a number of ANZACs to arrive in Australia, very shortly, and the community are considering what shall be done to afford them a fitting welcome'; but if the arrangements are anything like those for the reception which has hitherto been accorded to men who have returned from the Front, the ANZACs will not have very strong feelings of regard for those who receive them. An individual named Commander Brewis is in control of the embarkation and disembarkation of soldiers. He has carried out this task for some time, yet he is the most unsuitable man who could be in charge of it. Unfortunately. the position is complicated by reason of the fact that the Commander is controlled by the Naval Department, whereas the soldiers with whom he is dealing are controlled by the M i l i tary Department. When one endea-vours to secure better facilities for welcoming soldiers on their arrival he is met by the dual control of the two Departments. I admit that the Departments have endeavoured to meet my representations, but I have never been able to get any redress from the autocratic and i m becile actions of this individual who is in control of embarkation and disembarkation work. Finally, I have had to appeal to the Acting Prime'Minister, and the reply I received from him was that nothing could be done. Naturally my request was forwarded to Commander Brewis, and equally naturally his reply was that no better arrangement could be made. I advise honourable members to go to Port Melbourne on a day on which soldiers are embarking or disembarking. There is always an enormous crowd of wives, children, and other dependants, as well as OF friends and relatives, of the men, and it is not an easy matter to make proper arrangements for dealing with them, although a great improvement could be effected by using a little common sense. - The people all gather in one long row, and they remain seated there for hours.",31
73,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Would it not be better to land the soldiers at St. Kilda ?,31
74,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The same difficulty would .arise there. The people take their meals with them, and sit down and wait for hours until the soldiers disembark. I have been at Port Melbourne on two occasions when boats leaving for the Front got away before the friends and relatives of the men could get down the pier, but this, we are told, cannot be avoided. On one occasion I saw two vessels leaving the wharf at the same time. The friends of the departing soldiers had no informa- tion as to the particular boat on which they would find their dear ones, and when the gates were thrown open women and children rushed pell-mell down the wharf in a f r a n t c effort to locate them. Many : could not do so and became hysterical. Sometimes the friends of the soldiers are not on the wharf for more than five or ten minutes before the steamer casts off. If the man who controls the arrangements will have no regard for their feelings the Department should make a change. This officer says that without discipline it would he impossible to control the crowd. We all recognise that, hut my contention is that more common sense might well be displayed in carrying out the arrangements. Is it fair that the friends and 'relatives of soldiers leaving for the Eront should be kept behind a barricade nearly a quarter of a mile from the point at which the outgoing vessel is berthed ?",31
75,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I have seen the rush when the gates are thrown open, and can say that it is positively awful. - Mr MATHEWS - Thes e people are treated very badly, but we can get no satisfaction because Commander Brewis, the officer in charge, says that no other system of dealing with the crowd could be adopted. Iri that assertion he displays his own lack of ability. It may be said that I am taking an unfair advantage of this man, suice he cannot reply to me; but I am not dealing as unfairly with him as he deals with the friends and relatives of soldiers leaving for the Front. Even the Kaiser could not outdo Commander Brewis in his treatment of these people.",32
76,Mr RILEV,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,What is he a commander of?,32
77,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"He is a retired officer "" of the' British Navy- a British "" Johnny,"" who was sent out here, and has no conception of Australian ideals. To illustrate the attitude he takes up, I would mention that quite recently a deputation of ladies, representing the Port Melbourne Reception Committee, waited on me to complain that, although they were temperance workers, he had charged them with taking, intoxicating liquors to the men. These ladies, who are doing a magnificent work, were naturally indignant. They do their best to deliver as quickly as possible to the soldiers as they come ashore the little comforts they have for them; but no proper provision is made for their convenience. These ladies are not all supporters of mine; many of them for years have voted against me, and no doubt will continue to do so. I recognise, however, that they are doing good work, and it is up to me and to Commander Brewis, as well as others, to assist rather than to retard their efforts. They have spent thousands of pounds in providing comforts for the soldiers. They are placed in a sort of enclosure distinct from that in which the friends and relatives of returning soldiers have to wait, but when the rush takes place their catering arrangements are completely upset. They - asked to be given a place where they could avoid the rush, but this request was refused by Commander Brewis. They provide comforts for the returned soldiers of every State, and it would ' be an easy matter for this "" Kaiser "" to provide them with better facilities to carry out their work in connection with the disembarkation of our troops.",32
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Our soldiers are treate'd well by them, and owe them a lot.",32
79,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There can be nodoubt of that. These ladies leave their home duties, and wait hour after hour on the wharf to welcome returning soldiers. Very often a vessel does not arrive at the advertised time, but the ladies remain onduty ready to provide the men with small comforts, and to give them a welcome home. My attack is not directed particularly against the present Government j the same trouble existed when the Labour party were in power, and even then I co'uld secure no redress. Senator Pearce, the present Minister, was also Minister for Defence in the Labour Administration.. I do not know why he has not taken, this matter in hand, but I shall avail my^ self of every opportunity to bring it before the House. If this trouble occurs every time a fewmen return, is it not likely to be accentuated when large bodies of troops are returning week after week, and, perhaps, day after day? We shall have to obtain the Services of another disembarkation officer when the troops are returning in numbers, because I am satisfied that Commander Brewis will not be able to cope with the work. He has, indeed, shown noaptitude for it. I admit that without control of the crowd there would be absolute chaos, and it is possible that up to a certain point the authority rests, not with Commander Brewis but with others. If that is so, he should tell us; but knowing him by repute as well as by experience ' I throw upon him the responsibility. The Minister for Defence snould long ago have removed him from his present office if the Navy Department was not prepared to do so. It has been stated that the returning ANZACs are not to be disembarked .at Port Melbourne; but, no matter where they are landed, if there is the same lack of facilities for their reception as has been evident at Port Melbourne, the result w i ll be chaos, be-cause it has to be borne in mind that .not merely friends and relations of the returned ANZACs, but a great body of the - community will be present at that disembarkation to show the feeling of the people towards the ANZACs. I warn the Government not to leave the arrangement! for the disembarkation of the ANZACs in the 'hands of the gentleman who now controls the disembarkation of returning soldiers. If they do, they will have trouble, and they will deserve the condemnation which will follow. I wish to say a few words with respect - to the treatment of persons looking after the orphan children of soldiers at the Pront. A man may enlist, and leave behind him a wife in good health, and three - or four children, and after he has lef t Australia his wife may die. stance one case where a soldier left behind him a wife and three boys of 11, 12, - and 13 years of age. . The. mother died, - and her relations took charge of the-boys. When the mother was alive, she received -28s. a week from her husband, ,14s. separation allowance, and 10s. 6d. per week, - or 3s. 6d. for each-of the children. All that her relations, who are now looking after the children, are allowed to keep them is 30s. per week, or 10s. per week for each - child. There is no one in Australia who - can keep a growing boy of thirteen years of age, feed him', clothe him, and house him for 10s. per week. In this case, the woman WJO has taken charge of these boys has naturally some feeling for them as a relation, but she.has other obligations of her own to meet. Is it a fair thing that the Government of this country should ask a woman to assist in keeping the children of a soldier who is fighting for us at the Front? In these circumstances, if all the wives of men at the Front were to die, the Government would snake money out of their deaths. not say that' the Government approached the consideration of this matter from that stand-point, but that is the actual ppsi-tion all the same. The woman who has to look after these children should receive the same amount as the mother received to look after them.",32
80,Mr WISE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,My experience is that every application of the kind has been granted.,33
81,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I may inform the honourable gentleman that I have made such applications in thirty different cases, and not one of them has been granted. If the local patriotic committee think fit, they may allow a certain amount to the woman taking charge of a soldier's children in such . circumstances. Unfortu nately, it is sometimes the case that the women composing local patriotic committees, though they mean well, have a somewhat extraordinary idea as to the amount of money upon which another woman can keep a house. They would not apply the same conditions to themselves. I - might be allowed to say, in passing, that if we hand over the well-being of women to other women, we shall not get the results we desire - I know that in very few cases of this kind assistance is given by Local Committees.",33
82,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It is not the duty of a I can in Local Committee to give such assistance.,33
83,Mr MAXWELL,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It should not be necessary.,33
84,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is so. It is_ the duty of the Government to look after this matter. To have to look after three boys of 11, 12, and 13 years of age is alone enough work for any one woman. There are some people who believe that a woman can look after a family and go out and work as well, but I am sure there is no member of this House who will say that 30s. a week is sufficient in these times to keep three growing; boys, and clothe and educate them. You could purchase a suit for a lad of thirteen years of age for 25s. some time ago, but you could not do it for twice that amount today. It is the duty of the Government to see that no cause for complaint on this score shall continue to exist. The Government have no right to make money out of the deaths of the wives of soldiers. The sooner they look into this-matter, the better for their credit and for the relatives of men fightI de ing afc the Front.",33
85,Mr WIS E,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Government do not make any money out of the deaths of these women, because in those cases the money goes to the credit of the soldiers.",33
86,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Government save at least the separation allowance, and they should pay that allowance in addition to the amount allowed for each child. In the case I have referred to, £ 2 4s. a week would be considerably better than 30s., the amount now paid. I wish now to refer once more to the position of ex-nuptial mothers of soldiers who have died at the Front. vernment cannot make people believe that there is any difference in the feeling of mothers - It is probable that as the mothers of ex-nuptial sons have had such a light in life for them, they, are more endeared to them on that account. Under the Ponsious Act, these mothers are not allowed the same pensions as are the widowed mothers of sons born in wedlock. Ifc is a disgrace to us that this should be so. I have made complaints on the subject to the Treasurer and the Treasury officials, and certain promises have been made.",34
87,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Who is responsible ?,34
88,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Not only this, but the past Government, and we cannot get the practice altered. Ifc has under my notice only within lasfc two years. I do not the present Government for it any more than I do the members of the House, but it exists, and ought to be obviated. There are not three members in the House but would say that these mothers deserve to be placed in the same category as a widowed mother. thing is to be done it should be done quicklv. If an alteration of the Pensions Act is necessary, let it be made. I think there is sufficient scope in the powers of the Commissioner to enable him to do whafc is necessary, if the Treasurer says . that the Government are willing.",34
89,Mr GREGORY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The worse feature of the Pensions"" A ct is the fixing of the allowance according to the earnings of a boy wien he enlists. A boy who enlists at the age of eighteen, earning only a small wage, may be away for four years.",34
90,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Thaf c is a serious trouble. * A lad of nineteen may be earning 30s. a week when he enlists, and be killed three years afterwards, yet the mother's nension is based on what he was earning when he went away. difficulty is the position of foster-mothers. A case that occurred in the electorate of the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr . Maxwell) was brought to me before he vvas elected. A sergeant of police and his wife reared a son of the wife's late sister from six weeks old. When he grew up, he was in a bank at Donald, Victoria, earning enough to keep himself decently. He went to the Front when the call came, and was there three years. Twoyears after he left , the foster-father died. The Go- The lad then began to assist his foster-mother. There had been no need for this before, although he had always lef t certain money to be drawn by her, which she had been banking for him. When her husband died, she found that her financial position was not as good as she had expected, and she had to use the money allowed by her foster-son to live on, instead of banking it for him. He was killed, but because she was not dependent on him when he w.ent away, she can get no pension. If he had been here today, he would have been .keeping her, yet the Department will not recognise her claim. It seems in credible fco people outside that these cases should exist, but it is so. Mr Collins, come the Pensions Commissioner, always meets the one as far as he thinks he ought to go. blame He has certain powers, and can exercise his own judgment to a great degree. I bave induced him 'to see eye to eye with me on many occasions, and he has established precedents, which were not thought to come technically within the Act when it was passed, so that I am making no If any- complaint against him. A f t e r all, he is only an official, aud has a certain responsibility regarding expenditure. He may feel, that he. ought not to depart from well-defined lines; bufc we in this House make the laws, and must consider these questions - Will anybody claim that that foster-mother is not entitled to relief ? The young fellow did not know that - she was not his mother until he was going to the Front.",34
91,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Did you bring that case before the Commissioner?,34
92,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Yes . There ought fco be a section in the A ct which will meet these technical cases as fchey arise. I am sure an amendment of the Act could be put through in five minutes. If we do ""hot feel inclined to pass provisions to Another meet everv individual case, let us invest the Commissioner with further powers.",34
93,Mr WISE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The law says that "" member of a f a m i l y "" include* foster-mother.",34
94,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,But the honourable member also knows that the dependence is counted at the time the soldier leaves.,35
95,Mr WISE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That is another question.,35
96,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"In this case the foster-mother was not dependent on mau when he left. If the war had not taken place, however, she would have now living in the same house as her fosterimprisoned son, because he would have carried out obligations. Now she cannot get a penmany sion, because she was not dependent on him before he left, and because she is in penury. If she could have proved that she had not a cent she might have received some assistance, although even then not a right. To all intents and purposes, is really a widowed mother, and should be treated as such. These matters will have to be considered by some Government at some time, and, to my mind, action ought to be taken at once, as the numbers of such cases will continually grow. We have heard a good deal of the tion of the stoppage of pay to dependants because of the desertion of the breadreasons winners at the Eront. I understand that the State 'Governments have decided not to contribute half the amount. They quite justified. I have always said that .the States try to grab from the Federation all they possibly can, and that the State Departments which perform work for the Commonwealth Government have always got their full .pound of flesh and something more, regarding the Federal Government as a good milch cow. But there is no doubt that on this question it was the Federal Government that tried to throw on the State Governments the onus of any means. something that it should have paid for itself, because it has the whole control the war. The Commonwealth has reduced the borrowing capacity and the sphere of taxation of the States, yet it is now to throw on the State' Governments responsibility of financing something which they have nothing to do. . But the war, there would have been no restricfour tions upon the borrowing powers of the States, or on their sphere of taxation. is, therefore, the duty of the Federal vernment to finance this matter instead asking the States to do so. From what I have seen in the press of yesterday and today, it is apparent finality has been reached so far as the States are concerned in the matter. There ought.to be finality so far as the Commonwealth Government are concerned.' I do not intend, on this occasion, to discuss the causes of desertion at the Front. Suffice it to say that the men are the not to blame for it. To me it seems jieculiar that any doctor attached to the been British Army should allow a man to be for desertion under certain his circumstances. It is quite possible that of these men have shirked fighting, but that is not the fault of their depennot dants. In most cases, however, their action has been the result of the trials to which they have been subjected at the as Front. Consequently, they ought not to she be punished, and much less ought their dependants to be punished. Who is the author of the treatment which is now being meted out to these dependants? Is it the Treasurer, or the Minister for Defence? Honourable members should insist on getting information upon this quespoint. The Government most certainly ought to be called upon to advance better than have been assigned for their non-observance of their manifest obliga- tions in this connection. What sort of are things are we that we should punish children-wh o are incapable of looking after themselves-for some offence alleged to have been committed by their fathers at the Front? These are matters which, I hope, the Government will deal with at the earliest opportunity. If they attempt to solve this problem satisfactorily they will receive the hearty co-operation of honourable members upon both sides of the House. This is not a party question by",35
97,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I cannot underof stand the case of the foster-mother which the honourable member has quoted.,35
98,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I can assure the trying honourable member for Franklin (Mr. the MCWilliams ) that the facts are as 1 with I . have stated them. I hope that for the Government will take note of the matters which I have stressed this - 'afternoon. I am satisfied that all these It difficulties can be easily overcome, either Goby the issue of a regulation or by the passof ing of a short Bill through Parliament. I wish now to say a few words in regard to the price of meat. I am well that aware that the man on the land grows meat primarily for profit. I quite recognise that he desires to make as much profit as lie can out of liis enterprise, just as the worker, who consumes that meat, endeavours to obtain as high a wage ' as he can. But when the Minister for Price Fixin g (Mr Greene) fixed the price of meat a few weeks ago, a very substantial reduction immediately took place in the number of stock brought to the market. That was not because f at stock were not available, but because the stock^owners wished to defeat the system of price fixing at its very inception. Tbey at once raised the cry that the fa t cattle required were not in the country. As a result, for about a week some of butchers in Melbourne could obtain no meat at' all. At that time we - were assured that the shortage of supplies in the market was due to the fact, that there were not' the f at cattle and sheep that were required in the country.",35
99,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The butchers said that they would not bid for the stock.,36
100,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The poor grazier four weeks ago. - affirmed that he had no f at cattle and sheep with which to supply the market. When those who think with me declared that this was not a fact, and that the stockquirements, owners were withholding stock from the market in order to defeat price fixing, our statements met with a point-blank denial. But what is the position today? yesterday the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster), a representative of the stock-raisors in the same sense I am a representative of the workers, in quired what arrangements the Government proDOsed to maketo enable the freezing chambers in Australia to receive more carcasses than they had been receiving, owing to the glut of f at sheep in the market. I thereupon asked, "" Where were the f at sheep three weeks ago?""  lot of difference in the condition of sheep year round. at this time of the year.",36
101,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Acting Minisand ter for the Navy knows perfectly well ago, that stock are now being rushed on the market because of a threatened drought, and that there was more feed in the ment country three months ago than there was six weeks ago. Yet the stock have been fattened during the past six weeks. . X quite understand that the producers of meat do not fatten all their stock simulhrine the stock-owners to heel. taneously. They so arrange matters that when the market is ready to receive it , force stock-holders to sell. ihe stock is available.",36
102,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That is not so.,36
103,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Does the honourable member for Grampians (Mr J'owetty mean to tell me that cattle are fattened promiscuously ? As a matter of fact, there were plenty of f at sheep fit for the market when the stock-raisers said that no fat sheep were available. The Minister for Price Fixing .

There is not' the least doubt but that the Department, through ineffective administration, has cost the country many hundreds of thousands of pounds more than need have been expended. But now some effort is being made to make good the. waste of those hundreds of thousands; and, unfortunately, it is by exploiting relatives of soldiers at the Front, merely to the tune of - a few pounds here and there. Those few pounds are insignificant so far as the gross expenditure of the Defence Department is concerned, but they loom very large in the eyes of those unfortunate persons who ar© met with certain demands which they are totally unable to payWhat is poor women who are cut down in their living expenses to a sum which brings the blush of shame to any one upon making acquaintance with the circumstances. I shall give one or two specific instances. The first refers to the case of the wife of a soldier who enlisted in Australia, who was a British reservist, - and who, therefore, was entitled to the Imperial allowance in'addition .to his Australian pay. When the woman went to the Department Then there fco have her allotment and separation allowances settled, she stated all the circumr stances. She was granted an allotment of £ 3 13s. a week. She thought that was too' much, and said so at the time, but was told by the official concerned that it was all right. She therefore accepted the money. That situation remained for some time until th© woman received an intimation that her allotment of 6s. lOd. per day had been reduced to 2s. 9d. because of overpayments. She could not understand that, and was' certainly unaware that any overpayment had occurred. Upon inquiry, she was in formed that £ 1 5 3 had been overpaid, and she was actually asked if she could Tefund the full sum for t h with; and, if not, what arrangements she proposed. The woman protested that, the money had naturally been expended upon domestic accounts, and that she could not refund anything. Straightway her allowance was reduced to 19s. 3d. per week. She pointed out that she After a while she received an intimation to the all effect that no further action, was being taken to recover any amounts which had - I have been overpaid to dependants of Imperial reservists, pending the receipt of instrucDetions from head-quarters in Melbourne. Naturally she hoped for a better state of . affairs as the result of having the matter remitted to Melbourne for reconsideration, but subsequently she received notification that her allotment would be f u r -, ther reduced from 2s. 9d. to Is. 9d. per day.",37
118,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Who had made the mistake 1,38
119,Mr FOWLER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Some of the officials of the Department.,38
120,Mr WISE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,M o s t of those mistakes arose owing to the fact that both the British and Commonwealth Departments were paying allotments.,38
121,Mr FOWLER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I have another case. A soldier, also an Imperial reservist, enlisted, and in a few months was promoted to the rank of sergeant, and soon after to that of quartermaster-sergeant. His wife explained that she naturally expected her allowance would go u>p, but instead of that, about eight months afterwards, she was informed that she bad been overpaid £ 1 4 10s. She had to refund at the rate of 10s. per pay, and it took her about twelve months to do so. When she asked why these deductions were made from her pay, she was in formed that, after deducting Imperial pay from the Australian pay, she was only entitled to about 2d. a day from the Commonwealth Government. on to say that the Department had stopped her allowance of £ 3 l is . 2d. per fortnight, and she had nothing to come but 33s. Gd. per week from the Treasury. It was impossible for her to carry on, so she had to apply to the Patriotic Fund for assistance. These people put themselves i u the hands of the Defence officers, and in perfectly good f a i th take what is allotted to them. If , afterwards, some mistake is discovered, they naturally feel aggrieved at being called upon to make good the amount of overpayment. I do not think the Department is entitled to act in this way._",38
122,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Hear , hear!",38
123,Mr FOWLER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"As the result of .certain representations which I made in regard to a similar case, I received a communication Trom the Defence Department in the following terms:Dear Sir, With reference to your recent representations on behalf of Mrs , relative the military pay of her husband and son, I have to inform you that although Mrs -;-; made the application in good faith, omission on her part to state in the statutory declaration the rank of her husband in the Australian Imperial Force contributed in some measure to her claim being recognised. Her husband was a corporal, and in all good faith she omitted to state that he held this rank. It was, however, a very simple matter for the Department to check her papers, and thus discover whether her statement regarding her. .husband was correct or otherwise. All these papers should be scrutinized. At all events this woman made a' mistake, and was called upon to refund a very considerable sum. As she was unable to'pay cash, her allowance was cut down to such an extent that it was impossible for her and her family to live. The letter goes on to sayThe officials employed at the time incorrectly assumed that he was a private, whereas he was a-corporal, the holding of such rank being a bar to the granting of separation allowance on behalf of Mrs 's son.",38
124,Mr WISE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"They took her statement for the truth, whereas it was not. Mr FOWLER . ^ It is their duty, I presume, to check these statements.",38

Evidently if this woman's . application was examined at all, the officials failed to discover her mistake about her husband. The letter continuesWhere cases pf over-payments of separation allowance are brought to notice, it is the policy of the Department to recover same, when possible, from subsequent payments due to allottees. It is, therefore, regretted that no departure from this rule can be made in the case of Mrs -. « Mr 'MAXWELL - And sometimes the Department postpones settlement until the final adjustment is made out of deferred pay.",38
126,Mr FOWLER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The whole attitude of the Department towards the unfortunate wives and dependants of soldiers requires revision. These matters should bo to dealt with in a more sympathetic manner. I think that even if a mistake is made inadvertently by the person drawing a soldier's pay, the Department ought not to penalize the dependants subsequently; but, it is intolerable that they should be made to suffer for departmental mistakes.

You see, for the six months I was in prison I have had entered in my pay-book £37 in debt. That means I would have to go two yeairs without drawing a penny before I would be clear. But I signed a paper to certify that you and our children are dependent on my mpney. . . . I was only nine hours absent from my quarters and resisting the police. I have been informed that none of my allotment will be stopped from you.

N'ot only that, but I and also one of .the children are under medical treatment; in fact, it was Dr Hughes, of Victoria-street, North Melbourne, who sent me down to see you. £37 l is . is a terrible fine to put on a man for nine hours' absence without leave. That happened in 1917. My husband has not received a penny since, although he has been in the firing line ever since, and not been given Industria l an hour's leave. I think we are under German rule.

I ask for the assistance of honourable members on both sides to obtain redress of this grievance. We should not have to make appeals in this House to secure justice for the suffering. Here is another matter. Certain rapacious landlords are endeavouring to of the exact from the dependants of soldiers more rent than they have been charging in the past. I give credit to the Crown Law officers for certain action that they have taken, but there is too much circumlocution. A communication sent to the Attorney-General's Department is referred to the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), who administers the W a r Precautions regulations, and he, after perusing the correspondence, sends it back for action to be taken. A case has heen brought before me in which a widow, who has been livin g in the same house for twenty years, during which time she has paid about £S00 ip rent, has had her rent raised. Her two boys were reared, if not born, in this house, but both lef t Australia to fight the battles of their country, and both f e l l at the Front. The landlord area. who owns the terrace in which this house is, put a few touches of paint on the premises, and then notified the tenants that in consequence of this slight improveState ment their rent would be raised from 14s. to 19s. 6d. per week. I advised this cheapen woman neither to pay the increased rent nor to move, but to refer the landlord to me. I gave a similar case to the Governsentatives ment at the beginning of the month, but of so far I have received no satisfaction. It was laid before the Crown Law authorition ties, who referred it to the Defence Deing partment, and it was then referred back again to the Crown Law authorities; and amen's I am now told that when it is satisfactorily adjusted I shall be told. One sugis gestion I have made is that policemen should be instructed, if they hear of any sucb cases, to make inquiries and report fco the Federal authorities, so that immethat diate action may be taken; but under the Homebush, .present red-tape methods, with all the the circumlocution, weeks elapse. before any proclaimed proper steps can be taken to prevent ejectfere ment. We may rest assured that if a is woman has occupied a house for twenty years, she is one of the best of tenants, just that class whom all landlords are State anxious fco obtain. There is another complaint I have make in the hope that the Minister will take some action. I am informed, very good authority, that certain legal gentlemen are requested by the DepartHouse ment to investigate cases of the kind, that some of these even take the side of of the kind. the landlord, and urge the' tenant, for the sake of peace, to quit the premises quietly. It ought not to need this strong '-' Win-the-war"" Government, with, a majority of two to one, to remedy this state of affairs. It should not be diffiling, cult to ascertainfche names of house agents in the metropolitan areas, or to hances the value. announce to the press that landlords who attempt to evict the dependants of to soldiers will be brought to book. may be that some of the officials are ""winkcheaper meat. ing at these transactions, and thus causing avaricious landlords to be a little more bold in their methods of extortion. A matter that affects the public rally - is the increased cost of living. am pleased to read that the New South Wales Government, which is called National Government, is making arrangeraiser ments whereby' cheaper meat may be disauctioneers-, pensed in , at"" all events, the metropolitan The following newspaper paragraph will explain what has been done: STATE MEAT CONTROL. New South Wales Soheme. Sydney, Wednesday - For a long time the Government has been closely considering whether it should take action to control and the supply of meat in the metropolitan area. It was learned to-night that a large and comprehensive scheme had practically received the endorsement of the Cabinet, repre' of the pastoral industry, and most the large retail meat distributing firms. It ds believed that if the scheme is put into operait will have the immediate effect of lowertbe price of meat to consumers, by eliminating practically the whole of the heavy middlecharges, which have now to be paid. In nut-shell, the scheme, which is practically „ complete, and almost ready to be announced, that the Government shall purchase the whole of thestock now killed at the State Abattoirs, and take a monopoly of supplies to distributing retail butchers. This will mean there will be no private slaughtering at and no commissions or over-riding charges to be paid. If the scheme is adopted, Government will sell to retail butchers at prices. It is not proposed to interin any way with the export trade, which the natural influence governing the ordinary prices of meat. The probable development of the new scheme will be the provision of greater facilities for freezing and other ordinary meat works activities. to It is pleasing to see that the New South Wales Government, headed by Mr Holon man, an ex-Labour man, who has associated with him an ex-member of this in the person of Mr Fuller, have and made up their minds to evolve a scheme I do not say that the price *paid by the consumer is solely dependent on the prices charged by those who raise the stock, for between the stock-raiser and the consumer there is a considerable amount of handwhich has to be paid for ; and.this, as in the case of other commodities, enThere is a lack of organization, - which ought to be attended if the cost of living is to be reduced. It Mr JOWETT - That is the way to get",40
149,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It is one way. What . I object to is the operations of certain middlemen. The New South Wales Gogenevernment propose to deal with the proI prietors of private slaughter-houses,' and with those who have the distribution of a meat to the butchers' shops. The stockconsigns his stock to market who take their whack of commission; and there are other expenses involved before the slaughtering takes place. Then, as I have said, between the slaughtering and the delivering to the butchers' shops there are other charges.",41
150,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"In many cases butchers buy on the station, and have the stock delivered to them.",42
151,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is done in some parts of Western Australia. One gentleman whom I met there a few months ago informed me that if he could get £16 for a 700-lb. or SOO-lb. beast he would regard it a3 a very good price, and selling in Perth at pence per pound cheaper than in Melbourne.",42
152,Mr SAMPSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The difference in the price of the meat is the result of the big production in Western Australia.,42
153,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I am merely telling honourable members what was said to me by a grazier; aiid that price would have paid him even if the meat had been scarce. In Victoria we are paying close on £10 per head more for a similar class of animal, and that, of course, means ahigher price to the consumer. How is it that in Western Australia a man can raise a bullock and sell it at a profit at £16?",42
154,Mr SAMPSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The argument that applies to Western Australia is the same as that which applies to Queensland, where there is any amount of cheap land. - Mr Fenton - To a limited extent that is so. I do not say that we can buy beef in Victoria at the same price as in Queensland or Western Australia, but no one can contend that there is a difference of £10 per head in the cost of raising.",42
155,Mr SAMPSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I am merely contending that the price of meat can he brought down only by encouraging productionnot by fixing prices.,42
156,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I do not know an honourable member on this side who is unfavorable to increased production, for that is what we need, not only on the land, but in our factories, or there will be a very poor lookout when' hundreds of thousands of soldiers return to Australia. Unless we have better organization-and it is now far in arrear--w e shall be the worse off amongst the belligerents. There must be increased production to provide work and necessaries of life, not only for the 5,000,000 people now here, but for the additional millions who will be born in Australia or come overseas. Without such preparation and organization we shall not be able to offer such inducements as are offered by Canada, where, in the face of the most awful war the world ever saw, the immigration figures are magnificent. During the war thousands of people have gone to Canada to settle, although, in my opinion, climatically and otherwise, the Dominion cannot compare with Australia.",42
157,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The* e is not half the Government interference in Canada meat was then - that there is here.,42
158,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I do not know that; but there is one interference in Canada „ that does not altogether make for success, and that is the interference of the Great Pacific Railway Company. This company may, in some directions, be beneficial to the country, but in others it does the country no good.",42
159,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,There is a good deal of Government interference in Quebec.,42
160,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"In my opinion, there is more Government interference in other countries than there is here. However, the New South Wales Government, which is of similar composition to that of the Federal Government, has seen fit to join in a combination to supply meat for the metropolitan area. It would have been much better if the Federal Government had taken this matter in hand throughout the country. In this, no doubt, it would have been necessary to enlist the sympathy and support of the State Governments, but something could have been done by co-operation. The New South Wales Government are doing, in the case of the meat business, what they have done in other directions; they are trying in their own way, to "" dish "" the Federal Government, and prove to the people of that State that the local Government, and not the Commonwealth Government, is their saviour. There is no doubt that the scheme in view, will, if carried out, prove of benefit to the people; and I point out to the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) that it is not only the consumers and the Government who are doing this, but that the pastoralists are joined with them.",42
161,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,If you propose a similar scheme you will not find the graziers object.,42
162,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable memhis ber belongs to the "" Win-the-war "" party, which has a majority in this House; it is for him to urge the Government take action.",43
163,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,You are always sneerpunishing ing at win-the-war people!',43
164,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That is not so; we on this side are as desirous as are able members opposite to win the war.,43
165,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Then , why are you always sneering at the Government?",43
166,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The Government gave themselves the title of a Win-the-war Government; let them act up to it. They are failing miserably to do so. Nearly all the complaints I have received from the and are in destitute circumstances. dependants of soldiers are of the character of the letter I have read. Fancy the vernment cutting down the pay of soldiers' dependants in these times of high cost living!,43
167,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It is not the fault of the Government.,43
168,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It is the fault of the Government. The Government are sitting quietly by while soldiers' dependants are being ejected from their houses by rapacious landlords. What are 'they doing to make the burden of living lighter for soldiers' dependants and others? This is a matter that should be considered by the Government before anything else; they should do everything possible to give help to these very deserving people. I leave these three points to the consideration of Ministers and honourable members, and I hope that, before long, there will be some sign of. reform. We are always promised that a matter ' will be considered; hut, while it is being considered for. months, the people are suffering. Let the Government be a Winthe-war Government, not only in name, hut also in deed.",43

We have repeatedly asked the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Watt) whether he proposed to put a stop to the Government practice of depriving soldiers' .relatives of their allotment money in cases in which the soldiers have deserted. The Acting Prime Minister, by manner and speech, indicated that he knew very little about the matter, and and on many occasions when I and others to have asked him whether the Government proposed to stop the unholy practice of relatives for the offences or mistakes of their soldier husbands and sons, he has asked for notice. But I find honorthat the Acting Prime Minister knows all about the subject. The other day T asked for a precis of the correspondence between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government in reference to an application by the Premier of Victoria in connection with three families, who are relatives of soldiers at the Front, 1I have the precis now, and I find that Mr. GoLawson, the Premier of Victoria, in a letter addressed to the Acting Prime Minof ister, dated the 8th August, 1918, saidDear Sir, I beg to draw your attention to the attached 1 extracts from the Victoria Parliamentary Debates, dated 30th July and 7th August, regarding the treatment of the"" dependants of soldiers who are ""absent without leave."" In the opinion of this Government, the' matter is one entirely for Federal action. In any case, .however, it is desirable that some clear understanding should be arrived at on the subject. I shall be glad, therefore, if you can see your way to make a definite pronouncement as to the dependants in question as a Federal responsibility. The Acting Prime Minister forwarded to the Premier of Victoria a copy of a circular letter which he had addressed to the Premiers of the other States on the subject, and it is such an interesting and self-condemnatory document that I crave the indulgence of honourable members while I read it in its entirety' I desire to inform you that, consequent upon representations in the Victorian Parliament, the Premier of Victoria recently, communicated with me, and asked that a definite pronouncement be made as to whether the Commonwealth Government accepts responsibility for providing for the dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force who are absent without leave. The present practice of the Defence Department as regards soldiers absent without leave from the Australian Imperial Force Camps in Australia is to stop payment of allotment and separation allowance on and from the day on which the soldier is reported r.s absent without leave. That is from a Government which, through its Prime Minister, issued a personal letter to the relatives of the soldiers, pointing out that they were concerned in the result of the last general election because there were Win-the-war party candidates presenting themselves for election who would not desert the soldiers or their dependants. When the soldiers left these shores, they went to fight, and possibly the relatives consented to their going. Their wive3 and relatives were dependent for their subsistence upon the allotment money which 'they were to receive, and the present Government, who made that promise, which was mainly responsible for their winning the election, now turn round and state deliberately that it is the practice of the Department to stop the payment of allotment and separation allowances on and from the day on'which a soldier is reported as absent without leave. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) in what I consider a theatrical manner, intezTupts speakers on this side with asseverations that the present Government are not responsible for the stoppage of allowances. The honourable member, if he is in his senses, if he is not acting a part, must know that the present Government are responsible for this action. The circular letter continuesIn the case of soldiers absent without leave front the Australian Imperial Force oversea the practice is as follows:-After a soldier has been absent without leave for twenty-one days, a Court of Inquiry is held, and declares the man an "" illegal absentee."" Twenty-eight days after the man is declared an illegal absentee, which is forty-nine days after he was first absent without leave, the Chief Paymaster, London, advises the District Paymaster concerned by cablegram to cancel the allotment. The Government are in such a hurry that they do not wait to give the unfortunate relatives the advantage - of any delay that would be caused by communicating by letter, but they must cable instructions to stop payment.",43
170,Mr WEBSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,We are charged with not being in a hurry at all.,44
171,Mr HIGGS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Government are not in a hurry to do good, but they seem to be in a terrible hurry to do wrong. I ask any reasonable man whether it is not wrong for the authorities in London fco cable to Australia a cancellation of the allotment payments. The letter continues- The District Paymaster immediately notifies the allottee of the date on which the allotment will be cancelled, allowing for a period of at least .thirty days from the despatch of the cablegram from London. This means that the allotment is cancelled seventy-nine days after the member was first absent without leave. If the soldier is apprehended, the allotment, if to a dependant, is reinstated at the minimum rate. It must be borne in mind that when a member is absent without leave he forfeits all pay, and, consequently, the amount of the allotment paid to the allottee constitutes an over-payment, which is recovered from the soldier on apprehension. Mar k the ingenuity of Ministers! Their action reminds one of the practices of the Spanish Inquisition. My colleague, the Minister for Defence, points out that at the time of enlistment these men and their wives and families were subject' not only to the laws of the Commonwealth, but also to those of the State; and, further, that there are State laws ih which some financial - provision is made for the sustenance of wives and families of deserting husbands. If on the desertion of the soldier his dependants were entitled to claim support from the Commonwealth Government, that would be putting a premium upon desertion, and practically placing the dependants of the soldier who deserted in a better position than the dependants of the soldier' who, having completed his contract with the Government, Js discharged -"" Services no longer required."" In the one case all claim ceases, whereas in the other the soldier would be rewarded for deserting by the Government accepting the responsibility for the support of his dependants for the rest of their lives. Such a condition of things would be disastrous in ' its effect on the discipline of the Forces. That is a specious and contemptible argument. Honourable members have heard the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), who is a returned soldier, speaking about the A . W . L . ' s . I presume that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), knows the truth pf what the honourable member for Ballarat says, namely, that in this terrible war men are subjected to such fearfu l shocks on the battlefield that their mentality is disturbed, and many of them are not responsible for their subsequent actions. There are a hundred different ways in which a soldier may become absent withgenerally out leave, and. he ought not to be held criminally responsible - u n t i l deliberate desertion isproved. Yet the so-called Win-the-war Government, apparently after full consideration, deliberately set' out to deprive the wives and mothers of soldiers of the allotment money they ought to get. It will be observed that due care is taken to see that the dependants are notified before action to terminate payments is taken, and that sufficient notice is given to enable tbem to make other arrangements, or, if necessary, to apply to the State authorities for assistance in the same way that other persons similarly situated have to apply. One would not hear worse language from to the most wicked and contemptible soliresponsibility citor, who, acting for some rack-renting landlord, was urging reasons why he should evict some poor tenants. W h at ment. do fchey say' These poor unfortunate dependants of soldiers are given due notice that the Department are about "" to devernment termine the allotment made to them,"" and that they may appeal as paupers to sibility the various State Departments a charitable allowance. And this comes from the Acting Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of his colleague, the M ister for Defence, who has surely had sufficient experience of the war, and a.bsent-wifchout-leave ought to have been able to learn his after four years' experience. This circular sible. proceedsI t is also pointed out that while these men remain soldiers the Commonwealth Government recognises its duty to provide for the and children by means of allotments of and separation allowances. When, however, they cease to be soldiers, such allotments of pay and allowances cease, subject to the procedure outlined above, and they and their and families have no further claim upon the teresting speech. Defence Department. Before a soldier goes away he is medically examined in regard to his physical mental qualities, and there is no doubt that in thousands of cases men become deranged on account of the experiences they have to undergo when fighting their country. Possibly many absent themselves without leave from this cause. Yet this Government declares that i man is absent without leave it has longer any responsibility for him or wife and family. The circular ceedsThe Commonwealth Government, after ful consideration of the matter, having in view of gaining peace. its connection with the enlistment of such men in the Australian Imperial Force, is now pared to reimburse each State Government half of the amount of the allowances may be paid by the State during the period the conclusion of an early peace. of the war for the relief of dependants cases. A similar letter was sent to the Premiers of the other States. This was the reply received from Mr H . S. W . Lawson, the Premier of VictoriaI desire to acknowledge your letter of the 30th ultimo, No. 3043/2, forwarding of a communication addressed by you to Premiers of the otlier States on the subject the treatment of dependents of soldiers are absent without leave, and to say that question has been fully considered by this Government, with the result that it adheres the view previously expressed, viz., that the in this matter rests entirely with the Federal authorities - I beg, therefore, to ask that the subject may receive the further consideration of the Commonwealth GovernI am sure that every one outside the members of the Australian National War Gow ill agree with the view taken by Mr Lawson, namely, that the responi n this matter rests entirely with and secure the Federal authorities. I am extremely anxious, as I am sure in - every one must be who knows what is going on, and how the relatives of these soldiers are suffering job that this war shall end as soon as posWe were all led to believe that President.Wilson's fourteen points were accepted by Great Britain and her Allies as a basis for peace. I think I remember wives Mr Lloyd George ""saying that Germany pay might have peace tomorrow if she would accept President Wilson's terms..",44

173,Mr HIGGS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Any one who is not a profiteer, or does not desire to continue and profiteering during the war, must be anxious to see the end of the war. We were led to believe by the events that were happening, even a few days ago, for that it was about to end. Indeed, exfcraordinaries were sold in the streets of the suburbs, the newsboys calling out f a ""Peace Extraordinary!"" and every bodyno not only hoped, but also full y behis lieved - that the war was about to termipronate. We all felt that the Germans were beaten, that they could not possibly carebold out, and that Turkey was desirous We knew that Bulpregaria had given in , and we heard reports onethafc Bolshevism was feared in Germany. which Indeed, everything seemed to point to But of such twodays ago, I observed the following article in the daily pressPOSITION OF ALLIES . Sir.ENCE DEPRECATED. British Statement Sought. Significant - articles in several Ministerial a copy newspapers in England warmly approve of the President Wilson's notes, but urge that Great of Britain and the other Allies should not be wbo silent. . The articles emphasize the need of this joint action, and demand that Mr Lloyd George should frame a complete British peace programme, corresponding to the Empire's sacrifices, and should then ask the Allies to give the same support to our claims as we give to theirs. The Sunday Observer says that Mr Lloyd George must stand on an' effective equality with President Wilson and M. Clemenceau, - and urges him to do his utmost to achieve unity in the diplomatic counsels of America and among the Allies, as he has achieved unified command in the field. These cablegrams are very disquieting,' fchis country. and I would like the Acting Prinie M in ister (Mr Watt) to say if it is true several Ministerial newspapers in Great Britain-of course it means that these articles are approved by Ministers-ar e urging that Mr Lloyd George should frame a complete British peace prohope gramme. We were led to believe that the Allies fighting with Great Britain had accepted President Wilson's fourteen points, which, summarized, read as lows :1. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall he no .private standings of any kind. 2. Absolute freedom of navigation upon seas. 3. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions. 4. Adequate guarantees given and taken national armaments' shall be reduced. 5. A free - and impartial adjustment colonial claims. 6. The evacuation of all Russian territory. 7. Evacuation nnd restoration of Belgium. 8. freeing of all French territory and ration of Alsace-Lorraine to France. 9. Re-adiustment of the frontiers of Italy. 10. Peoples of Austria-Hungary to be afforded opportunity to establish autonomous government. 11. Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro evacuated. 12. Turkish portions of Ottoman Empire be assured a secure sovereignty. 13. An independent Polish State. 14. A general association of nations permanent peace. It is most disconcerting-indeed, most alarming-to find cablegrams in press which seem to suggest that there is a difference .of opinion between Allies, which may mean a prolongation of the war. If there is such a difference of opinion, I sincerely hope that the Allies will get together quickly. if three or four nations are fighting against a common enemy, they ought to be able to arrive at an understanding to what they are fighting about, to the terms upon which they will cease fighting. I deplore that the Governtionist. ment have, announced in a recent speech Mr Higgs. delivered by the Acting Prime Minister that fchey have asked the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) to remain in London for a period.",45

177,Mr HIGGS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"This , really, is a. serious subject, and the honourable member will forgive me for smiling at his suggestion. I have taken the view, and I that I take it with due calmness and without any antipathy, that the speeches of the Prime Minister in the Old Country have'done more harm than good. folI have repeatedly produced documentary evidence-and I also have the evidence of the honourable member for Ballarat under- (Mr MCGRATH) and that of a returned soldier, who is a member of the Victorian the State Parliament-that the speeches i u which he has urged a permanent boycott of Germany, refusal to trade with Germany, and the wiping of Germany off the that map, have been translated into the German language, and circulated in the Gerof man trenches, as well as throughout Germany, in order to convert the German pacifists into jingoes. These speeches restohave had the effect of solidifying the German nation and of causing the in to continue the fight, when they might otherwise have thrown up the sponge. These speeches were certainly most unwise. to be If some foolish German were stalking through this country threatening to that Germany would deprive us of our raw materials, and wipe us off to assure the face of the map, would not his utterances be most effective in stirit is ring up our people to do more than the ever in the war, and to put a stop to any talk of peacenegotiations?

189,Mr HIGGS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I think the honourable member was merely seeking for Protectionist facts. As far as I know, the Germans are Protectionists, and it certainly was by means of Protection that Germany built up her trade. . I regret that the Prime Minister has been requested by the Government to' stay for a longer period in England, where, in my opinion, he is doing a great deal of harm. Speeches made hy him there have been resented by members of the House of Aus-' Commons as insulting, and have been referred to as calculated to interfere with the friendly relations between Australian and British statesmen.",47
190,Mr WATT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"As far as I am able to judge from the press, themen who object to his speeches are but aninsignificant minority.",47
191,Mr HIGGS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I know that several of the British financial journals are devoting space to the Prime Minister and his speeches. The Investors' Review concludes a recent criticism of the Prime Minister in the following terms:It is said that Mr Hughes is going to abandon Australia, and become a colleague of, and bottle-holder to, our British Premier, Mr David Lloyd George. We hope, for Mr George's sake, that this is not the truth, for, much as we are disposed to criticise his actions as Prime Minister, we do not think he has fallen BO low as to need help from this windy man. from the antipodes.",47

194,Mr HIGGS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Discussin g the Prime Minister's policy, the Westminster Gazette wroteThe question is whether the geographical and national conditions which led Great Britain to her Free Trade and world-trading policy in the nineteenth century will bo essentially modified by the war, or whether we are likely to become stronger and more popiilous by reverting to the old system, or adopting towards aliens and foreign trade Australia's policy under Mr Hughes. The answer depends partly on the result of the war, on which Mr Hughes is a pessimist - Though he is staunch and strenuous about fighting t ill the Germans are crushed, he does not believe in his heart that this can be accomplished militarily. We could not adopt the Australian tariff and Australian legislation against alien emigrants without checking Great Britain's progress and diminishing her population, foreign trade, and mercantile marine, and inflicting enormous hardship on the masses of her people. Mr. Hughes' ideas, if adopted, would not extinguish militarism, but would be fatal to the league of nations and those objects for which a vast number of the Allies' soldiers conceive themselves to be fighting. That is language to which no one can take exception, but I invite honourable members .to consider the terms in which the Prime Minister referred to British statesmen who are Free Traders as the result, I suppose, of environment and"" long study.

He has been soundly and finally beaten on his policy of conscription, he has broken with his old party, and his new associates distrust him.

Then he can join Mr. George or the staff of "" Jolm Bull,""' or any other statesman or "" s t u n t "" that wants him.

My quotation from the Argus continuesMr Hughes proceeded to deal with the blems after peace. Solidarity of the Empire, he said, would depend, not only upon the strength of the racial and lingual ties and affection springing from the sacrifices of the war, but on trade defence. He hoped that nations of the earth would settle their disputes before a great international tribunal which would be established to enforce the terms of peace, and banish war for. ever. ready for peace? He candidly did not think so. He strenuously urged a development, policy which would provide the settlement and remunerative employment of millions of soldiers, and munition and other workers. Honourable members will see that, in course of that address, the Prime M ister asks the question, "" A r e we ready for peace?"" He has denied that this is a trade war, and what peoplehaye guard against, and what our Government ought to guard against, is that we shall not continue this war for trade purcondemn poses.

208,Mr WATT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The argument there is that ties of blood are to be added to ties of commerce. That is what we all know.,49
209,Mr HIGGS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I think that the Prime Minister's statementB last quoted justify Mr J. M . Robertson's criticism of that gentleman. He points out that there is ference a certain indefinitaness about Hughes' proposals. I , too, say + - bp.re is indefiniteness about his pre posals. He allows it to be believed that tries. be is a Protectionist, but he has already told the public that he does not pin his f a it h to Tariffs, but to organization. He also says that what we want is a self-contained Empire. He has said to the people of England that whafc is wanted is that the raw materials should come from the Dominions to Great Britain , and, manufactured, be taken out to the Dominions by our mercantile marine. trading after the war. That is a policy the adoption of which would destroy Australia - If we are to openly. be merely hewers of wood and drawers water, and if our industries are to confined to the pastoral and mining in dustries, what is to become of Australia, and how are we to attract population this country? The Government have right to tell us what is their policy r regard to. Empire trade. Is it the policy enunciated by Mr Hughes, that we are to be a part of a self-contained Empire, which means that we are to trade with ourselves only? That policy cannot be defended or sustained for a moment. We pro- - have within the Commonwealth at the present time General Pau, representing the great, chivalrous French nation.

284,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"When this Parliament met in January last, I protested against the disfranchisement of Australian citi zens, and I protest against it now.' If there are citizens in our midst who have done any wrong, disfranchisement is not the way in which to deal with them. A greater punishment should be imposed upon them. But if nothing can be proved against them, they ought not to be disfranchised. In my own electorate I do not think there were ten persons who were disfranchised under the regulation issued by the Government. On the occasion of the previous referendum it is true that some electors were obligedto vote under what was known as "" section 9."" In the division of Yarra only about a dozen electors had their votes challenged under that provision, and the majority of them proved to be Britishers. I believe that practically every vote which was questioned on that occasion was ultimately allowed. We have been told that this Bill aims at. securing uniformit y in our electoral mem thods. The principal proposal embodied in it relates to the adoption of the preferential system of voting. A new method of voting at elections for this Chamber is' be adopted. The electors are not to be upon to vote under the system that at has hitherto been in operation by putting cross in the square opposite the name of - the candidate whom they wish to support. Instead, they are to be invited, in connection with elections for the Senate, to place crosses in the squares opposite the names of the candidates for whom they desire to vote, and, on the same day, in l l connection with elections for this House, - they are to indicate on their ballot-papers the order of their preference for the various candidates 7196 Electoral .",53
285,Mr GREGORY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable .member's party uses the preferential system at its pre-election ballot.,54
286,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"We do not use two methods simultaneously. ment profess to be desirous of securing uniformity, and yet they propose that the electors shall employ two entirely different systems on the one day. Can such a method, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as making for uniformity? For the Senate elections, electors are to adopt the existing system of voting, but for elections for this Chamber they are to employ a sort of win-and-place method. The Bill further provides that where there are only two candidates for an electorate, and the elector has clearly indicated his choice, no matter by what means that, object has been achieved, his vote shall be regarded as a formal one. This will be seen by reference to one of the provisions to clause 134, which readsProvided that in elections for the House of .Representatives at which there are not more than two candidates, the voter's preference for one candidate shall be deemed to .be sufficiently indicated in the case of a ballot-paper marked so as to indicate the voter's first preference only. In the great majority of electorates there w i ll only be two candidates.",54
287,Mr MAXWELL,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That has not 'been our experience in connection with Sta'te elections. - Mr TUDOR - I think that it has. In the majority"" of electorates there have been only two candidates.",54

292,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,This Bill will practically break down the system of preselection.,54
293,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I do not think so. The Govern,54
294,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It has done so in my own State. Mr TUDOR . ^ But the Tasmanian system is altogether different from that which is embodied in this Bill . The Bill , in so far as it aims at achieving uniformity, lamentably fails. I believe that the Electoral Commission, of which the honourable member for Moreton was chairman, and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), the honourable member for Denison (Mr Lair d Smith), and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) were members, recommended the adoption of a uniform system of voting at elections for this Par-. liament. But this Bill gets away from that ideal. It provides that, in connection with Senate elections, the existing system of voting is to be adopted; whilst at elections for the House of Represen ta-tives, the preferential system of voting is to be employed. Then it is proposed that where only two candidates are seeking election for a seat in this Chamber, the elector may please himself as to whether he uses the existing system of voting or not.",54
295,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member knows the reason for that. The exercise of a preference is not required where there are only two candidates.,54
296,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I am quite aware of that. I know that in the MaloneyMCEacharn disputed election case, the i g h Court decided that if a ballot-paper was marked in such a way as to clearly indicate the intention of the voter, the That practice in has been followed by presiding officers ever since - Clause 134 lays it down that a ballot-paper shall be regarded as in formal unless it has been properly by the presiding officer. are penalties which may be i m withposed on officials. Nevertheless, I have known cases where a g-reat number of votes have been, declaredi informal because officials had not initialed them.",54
297,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That has been the law in South Australia for many,54
298,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The sub-clause dealing with that position does, not alter the existing law. If I remember rightly, in 1902 we copied a number of clauses' into our legislation from the South Australian Act . But I do not see why voters should be disfranchised by the neglect of an official. There was some such occur? rence in the electorate of Wide Bay, in which the hoD orable member representing that constituency (Mr Corser) was closelyinterested. At one polling booth there were over 200 papers concerned. Possibly, it was a matter of ignorance on the part of the officials or of their becoming mixed between the requirements of the different Acts.",54
299,Mr CORSER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It was an - inadvertence, but we had to go to Court to get those votes accepted? Mr TTJDOB, - That was the instance 1I have in mind, and it was only right that since there was no faul t on the part of the electors' concerned,- their votes should be treated as formal. In Victoria, the practice is to initial, ' and to number, but in some of the other States, including New South Wales, I believe, they do not initial at all. Well-trained men are not easily obtainable at election time, because, as a rule, well-trained men are partisans. Thus - we may get a man who has .been trained in one system, and who fails to initial a paper, as the result of which an elector is disfranchised through no faul t of his own - That sort of thing can become very serious. There are some electorates where votes are cast in .a proportion of five or six to one in favour of certain candidates. In some booths with in my own electorate, as high as seven to one has been noted. If there are official mistakes, why should the electors be disfranchised? I read portions of the report of the Royal Commission, but I am not sure whether that body dealt with this phase of the question. That a ballot paper can become informal through no fault of the voter,* but through an official's blunder, is a situation which should be remedied. I understand that there is a penalty-attaching to such errors on the part of officials.",55
300,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There are very few mistakes made in initialing. Some ballot papers have been posted and have gone astray, but they have not been initialed; and it is just as well that they were not.",55
301,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is rather a serious matter, for, if they were in the post,""they should have been initialed. If they had been issued for the purpose of postal voting, they must have come from permanent officials, who certainly should have known enough to in it i a l them.",55
302,Mr MASSYGREENE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,How could one take safeguards against copies of ballot-papers going astray and being used and going into the ballot-boxes?,55
303,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I have never yet heard of fraudulent preparation of ballot papers.,55
304,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Rea d the evidence of the Commission.,55
305,Mr MAXWELL,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"If a paper has been declared informal through the inadvertence of an official, it should be regarded as formal.",55
306,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It certainly should be. The Bill provides for compulsory enrolment, just as did the Act ; but the measure before the House does not propose to bring about compulsory voting. The one should be a corollary of the other. It would save honourable members a vast amount of worry. Provision is made, elsewhere in the Bill , that any person who hires a carriage for the purpose of conveying a voter to the poll shall be deemed guilty of bribery. When the Act was prepared we did not dream of motor cars.",55
307,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,We can easily insert some provision with regard to them.,55
308,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Does the honourable member think that will stop the use of them?,55
309,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That is another question.,55
310,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"And one that no honourable member can answer satisfactorily until we have compulsory voting. The only way to end the illegal employment of motor cars on election days is to compel electors to vote. It is no good saying that motor cars are used only in districts where electors have to be conveyed long distances. It is where polling booths are close together that the greatest number of motors are at work. I admit that there are not many used in my electorate. At the last, elections I was wishing they would send out a great number of cars to iny opponent. * Mr BOYD - You r friends would ride in the other fellow's motors.",55
311,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I do not knOw that; but I guarantee that they would not see a motor car standing idle.,56
312,Mr BAMEORD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There have 'been in stances where hire of motor cars has been successfully entered in a candidate's list side and outside the House. of expenses. I have seen the item, "" F i teen cars, at £5 apiece.""",56
313,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That individual, f i r of all, was lucky to have the cars in constituency; second, to secure them f his use; and third, to get the item passed through his expenses account. The only way to prevent such instances is to f o l low up compulsory, enrolment with comOfficer pulsory voting.",56
314,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Labour party brought that proposal down. I was M in ister in charge of the Bill , and it was Labour fellows who smashed it for me. MT . TUDOR - I must have been Tn the Ministry with the honourable member, but I do not remember it . Another point with respect to compulresponsibility sory enrolment is that in certain electostand rates there are great numbers of alteral,000j000 tions made in the electoral roll during the course of one year. I have been told by responsible officials that in certain subdivisions of Melbourne's metropolitan electorates there have been alterations amounting to 60 per cent, of the total electors within twelve months. In some subdivisions this does not matter, very much. If people fail to observe the law, they are taken to Court and fined a nomi-» nal sum, Is. or 2s. 6d., the Department, this, and quite r i g h t l y , -1 think, not pressing for a heavy penalty, as compulsory enrolup-to-date roll. ment is a comparatively new system. In some subdivisions, when electors move from one place to another, they do not go to the trouble of obtaining a transfer. In one part of my electorate, a street,only about"" half as wide as this chamber, to date. divides two subdivisions, and so, if electors shift across the road, very often they neglect to transfer. I believe that, on the whole, the Commonwealth rolls are better than the State rolls, thotigh speak for my own State, as I do not know much about the rolls in the other States. I tliink the Victorian rolls for the districts of Richmond and Collingwood are than the Federal roll of the division of Yarra, just after the police have, pleted their collection of names; but when three or six months have elapsed, the work. about Commonwealth rol l is much more - accurate. I approve of the linkin g up of the machinery of the Postal and Electoral - Departments, though in this matter I disagree with some of my friends; 'both in In my f - opinion, the system requiring letter-carriers to give notice of removal is the cors t ' rect method, but they should go further. his When a letter-carrier ascertains that a o r new family has moved into his round, or in the case of a boardinghouse, that a new lodger has taken up his residence tliere, - instead of merely notifyin g the Returning of these changes, he should be supplied with cards to deliver to such persons, notifyin g them of their obligation - to enrol, and that failure to do so will the render """"them liable to prosecution. Prosecution of defaulters should not necessarily follow on the furnishing of names to the Returning Officer, because very often, either from forgetfulness or through want of knowledge, electors fail to realise their in this matter. I underthat each year there are at least alterations to our rolls.",56
315,Mr GLVNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There were over 1,100,000 alterations in one year.",56
316,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"^Not long agp, in the office of the Divisional Returning Officer for Yarra, I had a look at one page for a subdivision in my electorate, and found - that out of sixty names on the page, there were no less than forty-five alterations in less than twelve months.

321,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It is very difficult to keep the rolls up to date, and but for the difficulty about the shortage paper, I would suggest that, in addition to the ordinary roll, the should compile a street roll, so that electors could be traced more readily. would mean practically a duplication of the whole of our rolls, but it would make for better administration. Returning Officers themselves card index in which the names are kept, not in alphabetical order, but in order of streets, which I think is the better way.

The Minister has told us that New South Wales there are now seven divisions in which the population is than a fifth above the quota, and two which it is more than a fifth below the quota; that of seven South Australian divisions, two contain more than above the quota, and one more than a fifth below it ; and that in Western tralia there is one division with a populamania, tion more than one-fifth in excess of the quota, and another with a population more than one-fifth below the quota.",57
325,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That is the position now.,57
326,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Yes . The"" Minister proposes to leave the redistribution of divisions alone. He will make no alteration affecting the voting power of ot the electors until our soldiers have returned, . and yet, in the meanwhile, he authorities proposes to alter the electoral machinery. This Mr Glynn - I only spoke of not altering the redistribution of divisions between States. The honourable member is speakThe ing of the redistribution of divisions have their within States.",57
327,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I presume that it could the be fairly accurately ascertained from the much Defence Department where the returned will go. They are likely, in the first said place, to come back to the States from onewhich they embarked. The Minister has the explained that the Government has not or slammed the door upon a redistribution shall be of divisions within a State.",57
328,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Not necessarily.,57
329,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"In New South Wales, imSouth Australia, and Western Australia, is need for a redistribution, but the I Ministry does not propose it . In my (Mr view, the population of Australia should that be represented in this Parliament as the Front the equally as possible.",57
330,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"If there were a redistribution of divisions between States n;w, there would have to be another shortly afterwards.",57
331,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"As I have said, the Minister does not propose to interfere with the voting power of individuals, but he wishes to alter the electoral machinery. said, at the outset, that I am not in favour of any alteration until our soldiers The honourable gentleA t man .says that there should not be a redistribution, because the relative populaof the divisions is likely to be altered in shortly, when some of the States may gain, and some may lose. It is possible more that at some time the membership of this in House will be reduced toseventy-two.",57
332,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Ver y shortly we shall be a fifth reduced .fco seventy-four.,57
333,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"At the beginning of AusFederation, Western Australia and Tashaving each a population ol less than the quota, were given five representatives apiece, though entitled numerically to only two or three. Australia,. I understand, has now a population which entitles her to a representation of five members by right of numbers. That being the case, the .number of divisions ought to be reduced to seventy-four, some State other, than Tasmania losing a representative. Probably, every honourable member is hoping that his electorate may not be' affected, and so long as the middle is not cut out of the Yarra electorate, I shall be satisfied. The limitation of electoral expenses has been provided for in our electoral legislation from the beginning. I have always been able to keep within the limit , and on many occasions have spent less than half the amount allowed, having a compact electorate, and a splendid l o t of voluntary workers. But it is farcical to limi t electoral expenditure without compelling organizations to furnish returns. At the last election there were from eighty to a hundred motor cars employed in some of the electorates, - and private persons were offered money for running their cars.",57
334,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It is ridiculous to give a country member the same allowance as a city member.,58
335,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,T he travelling expenses are excluded.,58
336,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"We have to advertise meetings, and hire halls in which to speak, but city members can address their electors at the street corners. - Mr TUDOR - I have addressed meetings in the honourable member's division at street corners, and I hope to have that pleasure again when supporting a candidate in opposition to him - I trust sucessfully. I offer a cordial invitation to honourable members opposite to visit my electorate at the. same time. A provision of which I aporove is that which prevents canvassing witliin 20 feet of the entrance to a polling booth,- the entrance, I suppose, meaning the door. Hitherto it has been left to the police to say whether canvassing is taking place too close to a polling booth. The Government has placed a number of safeguards in the postal voting section. An y elector who wishes to vote by post must declare that he or she is ill , not that lie or she may be ill . We know what happened on the last occasion that postal voting took place. In Committee, I shall give some figures conWestern nected with the exercise of the postal vote in the past. In the Kooyong division, the number of postal votes recorded was ten times the number recorded in theYarra division just across the river. These postal votes were not all cast by mothers of newly-born children, or prospective mothers, because the birth-rate of Kooyong is only about half that of Yarra. In my opinion, if voting is to be allowed outside a polling booth, it should be done before an electoral official. We make the Electoral. Department responsible for the carrying out of the lawj and every vote polled should be cast in a polling booth, or delivered to an electoral official.",58
337,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,O r a responsible Government servant). Whatyou suggest is not Workable.,58
338,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"T he honourable member has the advantage of having been a member of a. Royal Commission which in quired into electoral matters throughout the States, and is in a better position than most of us to judge this Bill . Lt - Colonel ABBOTT - Does the honourable member not think the comparison of the handwriting of the application and the signature is sufficient?",58
339,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I do not ; there is no opportunity to check the handwriting, seeing that the application cards are not kept in the division, but, as I understand,- at the head office. If we are to have this system of voting, it ought to be safeguarded by providing that all the voting shall be before an electoral officer.",58
340,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The system requires the, utmost safeguards within reason.",58
341,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is so. The Goverument has expressed a desire for uniformity in electoral matters, and yet we now find them introducing a new system of voting. Why should the Government . adopt preferential voting for the House of Representatives and not for the Senate ?",58
342,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Would you like that system 'for the Senate?,58
343,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I have not said so.,58
344,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Then I do not know what you want.,58
345,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I do not want any alterations until the soldiers come back, and I have already told the Minister that I am not in favour of preferential voting. We have the fact that, under the auspices - of this Government, there have been conferences of electoral officers with a view to uniform rolls, and so forth, and yet this new system is proposed. In Victoria, at the present time, there are three systems of voting in operation. There is marking with the cross in the case of Federal elections; preferential voting for the State Legislative Assembly, and crossing out undesired candidates at municipal elections. I do not know whether preferential voting applies to the Legislative Council of Victoria or whether, indeed, there are any elections at all for that body.",58
346,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,You got your man last timet,59
347,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"He had a ""walkover."" As a matter of fact, at the present time many persons think that, because they are on the State roll, they must necessarily be on the Commonwealth roll, and vice versd, clearly showing that uniformity, and not further diversity, is what is necessary. I am reminded by the honourable mem present circumstances, names may be struck off the roll at any time; and I notice that the Bill proposes to give the Divisional Returning Officer and the Registrar greater power in cases where names may have been struck off by mistake. I suppose most honourable members have had cases of error brought under their notice. I know of one in which a young lady got married, and it turned out that her Christian name and married surname was the same as that of her mother. The young woman applied to the Department for registration of her new name, but the Department, to make sure, struck off not only her name, but also that of her mother. This was only found out by the parties concerned at election time; but even if it had occurred twelve months before, we know that very often the printed roll is two years old, while there may have been 75 per cent, of alterations. The printed roll used at the last referendum ten months ago was the one used when we were elected to this House.",59
348,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Is there no provision made in the Bil l to meet such cases,59
349,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Yes ; but I ask that no one shall be struck off once the writ is issued. In my own electorate a letter[260] carrier, who, in consequence of the war, had, unfortunately, suffered mentally, was the means of striking 300 names off the roll; not one of these names ought to have been removed. On the matter being brought under the notice of the authorities, the whole of the names were reinstated; but we can understand what might have occurred in a more sparsely-populated constituency. These names were struck off after the writ had been issued, when it is impossible for a person to have his name placed on the roll. If , after the writ is issued, it is impossibleto place a name on the roll, it ought to be impossible to strike a name off. in Mr Glynn - W o one can be struck off after the issue of the writ on an objection.",59
350,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Practica l officers will inform the Minister that there are really no objections raised today by individuals, the whole being official objections.",59
351,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is the same thing; even on an official objection names cannot be struck off, but there may be some manifest errors that should be corrected.",59
352,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Quite so; but I contend that no names should be removed unless there is the power to reinstate them.,59
353,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,There is the right in case of error.,59
354,Mr TUDOR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Of course, it is provided that on the day of election a person whose name has been struck off may make a declaration to the effect that the striking off is a manifest error, and may vote, his vote being put on one side for verification. I take the ground that this Bill ought not to have been introduced at the present time. The Government have said that while the soldiers are away there shall be no redistribution of seats, and they should have gone further, and declared against any alteration in the electoral machinery.",59
355,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Hunter) [8.10] The amendment of the Electoral Act is, I think, recognised by all as being no party question. I am at a loss to understand why this Bil l is brought before the Chamber at this particular time. It would have been better to wait until later on in the life of this Parliament, for, after all, there is no immediate prospect of an election; in all probability most of our boys ? will be back from the war before there is another political contest. If it is necessary to amend the Act, we ought to consider the question from the population .point of view; and a re-adjustment of seats in accordance with the Constitution, and other electoral reforms, should he worked out at one time, in the light of the knowledge that we shall have when our men return home. The only question of importance in the Bill is that of preferential voting. The Act at present in force is, I think, giving every satisfaction so far as the conduct elections is concerned. I am not sure that the introduction of a new method of voting will not complicate the the voter - My own idea is that we shall find a largo number of informal votes. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has pointed out, the Government have, talked about the necessity for uniformity in the rolls, and yet they seek to introduce a new system, which, so far as I can see, can result in nothing hut confusion at the ballot-box.",59
356,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,*-Why ?,60
357,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Because the voter will be asked to vote, as in the past, for three candidates for the Senate, and, at the same time, he will be asked to vote, not by making a cross opposite the name of the man of his choice for the House of Representatives, but for one, two, three, four, or more candidates, as the case may he.",60
358,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,There are a good few informal votes at present.,60
359,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"And we wish to avoid informal votes as far as possible. .1 cannot see any benefit in the new system, and it would be far better to allow the electors to make their choice of the candidates offering as in the past. After all, if we analyze the voting, members of this House are generally returned on a majority vote; very few on a minority vote.  liminary sifting to reduce the candidates to one.",60
360,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That sifting will still go on. The honourable member does not contend that under this Bill parties will not continue to select their candidates as in the past?,60
361,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Does the Bill not do away with the necessity of party selection ?,60
362,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I do not think so. If I live long enough to see this Bill come law, I expect to find both parties selecting their candidates as previously.",60
363,Mr ATKINSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That is not the experience where this system of voting has been tried.,60
364,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I am speaking of our experience.,60
365,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Of the Opposition.,60
366,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"And of the Government, too. If the honourable member were to be threatened with opposition of from a member of his party, he would feel hurt, and would appeal to his organization as to whether that person had a position for right to oppose him.",60
367,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member knows very little about me.,60
368,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I know enough about human nature to believe that that would happen. It is quite unnecessary, at the present juncture, to interfere in any way with the existing Act, especially by the introduction of preferential voting. There will be . a good deal of discussion on the subject of postal voting. On the occasion of the last amendment of the Electoral Act there was a very keen debate on this .point. I claimed that it was essential to provide every facility for all electors to record their votes, and in Committee I proposed an amendment which I thought would meet the case, as far as was legitimately possible. I do not believe that the postalvoting system is in the best interests of the country. Beyond doubt it was abused in the past, and, that being so, I feel confident that it will be abused in the future.",60
369,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The evidence before the ' Electoral 'Commission was overwhelmingly in favour of the postal vote. And some of the evidence came from the honourable member's .party.,60
370,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,In 1904 a Select Committee of the Senate reported adversely upon the postal vote.,60
371,Mr GREGORY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable member gave a-postal vote to the seaman, but not to the man in the bush.",60
372,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I am ready to give a vote to the man in the bush. Facilities can be-provided for everybody to exercise the franchise without reviving the postal vote, and we can enact such besafeguards that the purity of the ballot box will be insured. That is the object we should have in view. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Nowher e did the Royal Commission get the slightest evidence in support of allegations about the abuse of the postal vote.",60
373,Mr CHAELTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I base my state. ments on the official returns. general election in 1906 the postal votes totalled 29,249. In New South Wales there were only 6,219 postal votes. That is the most populous State, and surely it will not be contended that there are more cases of sickness in other States than in New South Wales.",61
374,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,We had not the provision for absent voting then.,61
375,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I am dealing with postal voting. In Victoria there were 14,049 postal votes, chiefly in the metropolitan constituencies. one contend that there were over 14,000 sick people in Victoria, almost exclusively in the metropolitan area, as against 6,219. in the whole of New South Wales?",61
376,Mr FENTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Kooyon g constituency was the worse offender.,61
377,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is so, and I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) would not contend that there was moTe sickness in his electorate than in any other.",61
378,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Posta l votes do not a l f signify sickness. The absent voter was allowed to vote by post.,61
379,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Of the total number of postal votes recorded in Victoria 6,241 were by males and 7,704 by females. The votes hy males were almost as numerous as the votes by' females, and I am sure that all of them did not represent cases of sickness. abuse will happen if we renew the postal voting provisions. If we are desirous of conducting our elections on proper lines, how can we revert to a system that has proved unsatisfactory?",61
380,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The before the Commission was overwhelmingly in its favour. Both sides were represented on the Commission, and we reported unanimously.",61
381,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"In there were 4,020 postal votes; in South Australia, 1,751; in Western Australia, 1,977; and in Tasmania, 1,233; total, 29,249. The total for all States excepting Victoria was 15,206; Victoria had no less than 14,049, nearly as many as the rest of Australia. [260]- 2",61
382,Mr ATKINSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Unles s the honourable member can show that the postal voters were breaking the law, it does not matter how they voted. At the Mr Charlton - Does the honourable member think that in Victoria there were 14,000 persons who found it absolutely necessary to have recourse to the postal vote, as against only 15,206 in the rest of the Commonwealth?",61
383,Mr ATKINSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,There might have been more postal votes in New South Wales if the people had chosen to use the postal system.,61
384,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"We know that postal votes were hawked about the country, and that one man manipulated 250. Will any",61
385,Mr ATKINSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Why did not the Commission discover those cases?,61
386,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It is not too late to discover them now.,61
387,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Commission investigated all those allegations, and no witness would abide by them.",61
388,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,There are very few prosecutions under the electoral law.,61
389,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The best evidence is supplied by the actual votes recorded at the election. I prophesy that if we revert to the postal system we shall have the same trouble again. At the same time, I believe that facilities should be given for every individual in the community to record his vote. The question we have to consider is how we are to do that without leaving an opportunity for The same a repetition of wrongful practices. I hope that when the Bill is in committee some amendment which will provide the requisite facilities without opening the door to abuses will be moved.",61
390,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I will support evidence the honourable member in proposing any necessary safeguards.,61
391,Mr CHAELTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I am grateful to the honourable member. The safeguarding Queensland of the provision is all that I desire. I do not speak from a party point of view. Party considerations should have no weight in the f r a m in g of an electoral law. The endeavour of all' honourable members should be to make the law as perfect as possible. If the actual operation of the postal voting system under the previous Act has proved that it provided opportunities for improper practices, we should try to make such safeguards as will prevent a recurrence of them. Another amendment I wish to urge is the abolition of the candidate's deposit. Probably I shall not get much support for that proposal, but if we are to have preferential voting we should permit every individual to contest a constituency who thinks that he has a right to do so, without requiring him to provide any deposit. After all, the deposit is a property qualification. In connection with our municipal councils and other institutions, we have endeavoured to abolish property qualifications, and to allow everybody the freest opportunity to contest an election.",61
392,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"If a man who has a legitimate chance has not £25 for his deposit, he will soon get somebody find the money for him.",62
393,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The making of the deposit does not affect me personally, House. but I believe in giving the greatest opportunity to anybody, and if we are to have a preferential system of voting, Ihere should be no obstacle in the way of body being nominated.",62
394,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member is right on the principle that any man may enter Parliament whether OT risk of losing it. not he is fit for the position.,62
395,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"If the honourable member contends that the possession £25 makes a man fit for Parliament, I shall have nothing further contend that there are plenty of men, who have every qualification to enter Parlianot ment, provided they can get a sufficient State seats. number of electors to vote for them, but who do not possess £25, or even 25s. Under the present system many men will not run the risk of contesting an election because they must forfeit a deposit i do not poll a certain percentage of votes.",62

397,Mr CHARXTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I do not think the country would be put to much expense. not be given. That argument is a very convenient excuse for being opposed to the abolition of the deposit. In how many electorates does a candidate get a walk-over at the measure at the present time. present time? Nearly every.member in the House had to fight for his seat at the election.,62
398,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) had a walk-over.,62
399,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That was a happy accident. I am opposed also to the retention of that section which provides that members of the State Parliament who are desirous of seeking Federal honours, must resign their State seat a certain time before the Federal election. That provision deprives the Commonwealth of the chance of getting, perhaps, some of the ablest men in the State Legislatures. There are many able men in State politics who, but for the risk of falling between two stools, would be prepared, at the request of their constituents, to to contest a Federal electorate.",62
400,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,They would not be more able than the present members of this,62
401,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I do not say they would, but it is a matter which the electors should be allowed to decide. They anyare not given the opportunity to choose =any men they may wish to represent them, if a member of a State Parliament has first to resign his seat and take the - Mr RICHARD FOSTER - There would be some nice scrambles at preselection balof lots for honourable members' seats.",62

403,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The States will allow Federal members to contest,62
404,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Two wrongs do not make a right. I certainly risked my seat in the State House in order to contest a seat in this House, but that does f they not prove that the law should prevent a the member of a State House from contesting a seat in this House unless he first resigns from the State House. The electors f canshould be permitted to choose any one a dethey please to represent them, and if members of State Houses are not available for election the widest possible choice canThere are some provisions in this Bill which will prove of advantage, but I can see no necessity for proceeding with the If it is necessary to pass it before the next elections we can postpone dts consideration Tor another twelve months, by which time matters will be more settled, and, possibly, a large number of gallant electors who are abroad may have returned to us. We would then be able to deal with electoral matters as a whole, and not. in this piece-meal fashion.",62
405,Mr RICHABD POSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,What would be the position if the soldiers were all home again ?,63
406,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"We would see how they were distributed among the various divisions, and could adjust the seats accordingly; because it is well known that some electorates have more than the quota of voters.",63
407,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That matter does not affect this Bill.,63
408,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"In my opinion, the whole of the electoral machinery should be decided at the one time, and if it be necessary to take action before the next elections there will still be plenty of opportunity for it twelve months hence.",63

410,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I know nothing about that. I do not think any improvement will be effected by the reintroduction of the postal vote, but at the same time. I think that before we reach the Committee stage we should set our minds to work with a view to drafting some provision which will permit. those who are really sick or infirm to record their votes.",63
411,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member has always been in favour of that.,63
412,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is so. There is nothing dearer to a person who happens to be invalided, or who, through old age, is not able to go to a polling booth than the right to record a vote which he has been accustomed to doing all his life.",63
413,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,What about country settlers ?,63

416,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"No ; I would provide for the in in another way. In Committee, we will have a chance of discussing the matter, and of providing a clause that will enable every person to record a vote. It is only because of the abuse of the postal vote that I am opposed fo it .",63
417,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It has been abused in a few instances only.,63
418,Mr CHARLTON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"When we come to the Committee stage, I shall do my best to improve the measure, and I hope that every honourable member will endeavour to do the same. Xt really is a Bill for consideration in Committee; and if honourable members give the necessary attention to it, and conscientiously strive to make it as perfect a measure as possible, some tangible result may be forthcoming from the effort of the Minister (Mr . Glynn) to amend the present law.",63
419,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Wannon) [8.36] Some of the provisions of this Bill are incomplete. It would not have been produced had it not been for the adoption of the principle of preferential voting by the party sitting on this side of the Chamber; but the principle as incorporated in the measure is very incomplete and ineffective. If it is to be at all complete and effective, there should be no bar, handicap, or impediment in any shape or form to any person going to the poll who believes that he is capable of securing the support of the most of the people in a given constituency; but there is nothing in the Bill imposing a penalty on organizations who conduct in advance a pre-selection which robs the special preferential provision of its efficacy. There is nothing to prevent either party represented in this House, from setting out in advance of an election to hold a pre-selection, and put the hall-mark upon a candidate ; and that is . a most effective bar against other candidates going to the poll. In this way, the whole object of the Government in establishing preferential voting will be rendered nugatory.",63
420,Mr NICHOLLS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Pre-selectio n ballots do not prevent candidates from going to the poll.,63
421,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member need not put forward such a specious .argument.,63
422,Mr NICHOLLS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Of course, other candidates will not get the support of the party.",63
423,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"We all know that any person who complies with the provisions of the Act can go to the poll; but what is the use of a person going to the organization which returns the honourable member, and then nominating for election by the electors, if some other individual is chosen at the pre-selection ballot? Let us face the position earnestly. I would rather not see the provision in the Bill than have it there without proper safeguards; and at a later stage I propose to test the feeling of the House on the matter by submitting an amendment seeking to impose a penalty on any organization setting out ""in advance of election day to pre-selecfc a candidate, and thus cTefear other persons from entering the field. If we are sincere in our effort to provide an open field for all candidates, then no person should suffer the handicap that, in advance, his claims have been tested and rejected by his party.",63
424,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable member's proposal is merely an attempt to destroy the organizations, without which poor men would not be able to enter Parliament.",64
425,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There is no party question about this. We must either give a clear, open field for candidates to go to opportunity. the poll unhandicapped, or permit the continuance of the practice that has long prevailed on both sides of fchis Chamber, by which the two great parties in this country set up their organizations and machinery, and utilize their funds with the object of determining in advance of an election what candidates shall run in their interests. I maintain that no man .should go to the poll having his chance predetermined against him by his party. This point was prominently before the country at the election at which the honourable member for Elinders (Mr Bruce) was returned. There were three candidates in the field, and at the eleventh hour a promise was given that preferential voting would be enacted..",64
426,Mr SAMPSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It "" was the policy of the Government long prior to that.",64
427,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I am aware that it was the settled policy of the major section of the party on this side of the Chamber,. but a definite promise to introduce the policy previously agreed upon was announced just prior to that election. believe that the honourable member for Flinders would have-won the seat against a dozen candidates, and I was one who personally objected to the announcement which was made, but at any rate the events surrounding that election gave an indication of the disabilities suffered by reason of the fact that the preferential voting system was not in force'. The Government, in accordance with their promise, have come down with a Bill which is designed to remedy that state of affairs, but they have absolutely failed to provide the one safeguard needed, and without which the Bill will not be effective. I am anxiously awaiting a statement from * the Minister.",64
428,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Minister has already said that this Bill will do away with the necessity, for pre-selection.",64
429,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable member knows perfectly well that his party will continue to predetermine the chances of candidates. I am not sufficient'of a humbug to say that this is a preferential voting measure, which will provide a free and open field to all candidates. What is the object of the measure?",64
430,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,To provide equality of,64
431,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"But the Minister fails to provide it. He has already shown that there are two great parties in this country possessed of the machinery for controlling elections, and part of the practice of both parties is to predetermine the chance of their candidates at elections.",64
432,Mr WEST,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That is their policy.,64
433,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Of course it is, and the adherents of the two parties are morally bound to support the candidates upon whom the pre-election choice has fallen. In those circumstances, what chances have other candidates of being elected? Therefore, we do not secure free electoral opportunities. I am quite conscious of the fact than any person can go to the poll after paying a deposit, and get enough electors to sign his nomination paper.",64
434,Mr BRENNAN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"How can you possibly prevent pre-selection, or prevent a man being labelled Liberal or Labour?",64
435,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I would prevent pre-selections by declaring them illegal, I and providing a penalty. The next point I desire to make is that there is throughout the country a strong general demand for a uniform electoral system in respect of the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments. The Government should have embraced the present opportunity, since they are re-casting and, remoulding the whole of their electoral system, to bring about an agreement as between the States and the Commonwealth. I understand that the electoral officers in charge of the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth and the States met in Conference, and submitted recommendations for a uniform system.",64
436,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,They proposed a uniform roll.,65
437,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"On e roll for Australia. They also made other recommendations for the conduct of elections. Before bringing down this measure, the Government should have conferred with the States, and have arrived at an understanding with them that legislation should be introduced in all the State Parliaments to secure a unified electoral system. Mr GI.YNN - The States are practically waiting for our lead.",65
438,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"May I take It that the Minister has had a conference with the representatives of the States, and that uniformity in this respect has been agreed upon?",65

440,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Has the Minister available for the information of the House the memorandum prepared by the conference of Commonwealth and State electoral officers?,65
441,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I think it was distributed as a. parliamentary paper some five years ago, and that a sufficient number - of copies were printed for circulation.",65
442,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I hope the Minister will make the memorandum available to the House, while .the Bill is before us, since it would enable us to better understand the machinery for the conduct of elections in all the States. This is not merely an amending Bill , but a measure providing for an overhaul of the whole of our electoral system.",65
443,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Does the honourable member want the Minister to defeat his own Bill?,65
444,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There is an old story about providing the birch to beat your own back, and I think some of us in supporting thisB ill , which provides for preferential voting, are forging a weapon that will be used against us. I approve of the restoration of the postal vote with adequate safeguards, and the tightening up of electoral machinery, so that on election day those whose names have been improperly left off the rolls will have an opportunity to vote if they can satisfy the officers that they should have been enrolled. In many respects the Minister, by means of this Bill , proposes an improvement on our present electoral machinery; but I do not think that the provision for preferential votinsr will be effective, or that it will achieve the object that the Government have in view.",65
445,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Melbourne Ports) [8.52] - I agree with those who have said that the most important part of this Bill is that providing for preferential voting. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr . Rodgers) suggests that we should put a stop to the practice of pre-selection of candidates by parties. If that system were abolished, it would do away with a had a lot of trouble for some people, and many associations which now send oufc to canSome didates circulars asking whether they are in favour of prohibition, and various other matters, would find themselves no longer able to take such action. It must be recognised, however, that there are only two parties in Australia today. Certain returned soldiers are endeavouring to create a thir d party, but I am convinced that when our returned men go to the poll, they will"" vote Labour or Conservative, just as they did before. Some of them, perhaps, have changed their views, but the great majority will vote as fchey did before they went to the Front. I do not believe that there will be a returned soldiers' party as such. Some may attempt to form such a party, but if it is formed, it is a certainty that it will attach itself fco the most Conservative section. The honourable member for Wannon, in urging that there should be no pre-selection of candidates by ' the different parties, has lost sight of the attitude taken up by the great newspapers, who tell the electors who are "" the real Mackay."" Is he going to stop that sort of thing?",65
446,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Is he going stop Mr Boote, editor of the Worker, from selecting the Labour candidates? MT., RODGEBS - I would not prevent the press from making whatever comments they pleased.",66
447,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"If organizations which formulate the policies of their party candidates are not to he allowed to make a pre-selection of candidates, then the press must also he denied the right to select candidates, otherwise we shall go hack to the dark ages, when the press mulated the politics of the people. Happily that day has passed. The Labour party heat the newspapers in that T#gard, and wrested from them the power they had so long held to dictate to the people whom they should return. there any political machine that is half as corrupt as are the newspapers in their attacks upon politicians? .They are supposed to be the guardians of the people; but they try to dictate to the electors what political policy they should favour and whom they should return. The honourable member for Wannon should he caTeful not to trust himself to the tender mercies of the newspapers, which select only such candidates as can the moulded to their own desires. I am sure the honourable member would not like anything of the kind.",66
448,Mr RODGEHS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is not the point I sought to make. My desire is that , any one who wishes to stand for the representation of, say, my own constituency, shall 86^60 tod* have the same right that I have to do so.",66
449,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"After all, why was the party system brought into existence? Parties weTe formed because it was found that individual members of Parliament did not carry 'out the pledges made by them when on the hustings. Men were returned to Parliament independent of party ties, and were well able to look after themselves. The outside public became tired of this sort of thing, and mulated the system of pre-selection. The day of the independent candidate has gone for ever, and rightly so, because the independent man was always ahle to look after his own personal interests. Where the Ministerial and Opposition parties were almost evenly balanced, the independent member could claim, what he wanted. Parties were formed to enable policies to be created. There could be to no sound legislation without some preconceived ideas of policy. In the old days, the Prime Minister, or some great leader whom many people believed to have a monopoly of the brains of the community, was left to formulate a policy for the people; but that system has also gone. The people know that in Australian politics today there are only two parties. If there is to be no preselection of candidates, men will be returned to this Parliament without any for- policy apart from their own individual opinions, and we shall have a most curious House, consisting of seventy-five men, each with a separate policy. What a time we should have! What juggling there would be foT positions! We would Is have in Parliament men whose politics were as far apart as those of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Bruce Smith) and the honourable member for Barrier (M T. Considine). MT. BBUCE SMITH - When I first entered, politics, in 1882, there were no parties. Mr MATHEWiS - I remember the honourable member's political debut.",66
450,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member was then sucking a dodger.,66
451,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable member first stood for the State electorate of South Melbourne, where he was given a drubbing.",66
452,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable membeT is quite wrong. I was never,66
453,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable member's politics were not acceptable .to South Melbourne, where we have democratic Christians, as opposed to the fiendish Conservatives of Parkes. To return to the question of preferential voting, I am convinced that, under such a system, the position of electors on voting day would he worse than ever. It is only now and then that the general forpublic have an opportunity to record their votes. They enter a polling 'booth with_ all the solemnity imaginable, and are instructed in sepulchral tones as to-, what they are to do. They then adjournto a little cuddy-house where, practically in the dark, they endeavour, with half-aninch of pencil, to Tecord their votes. Even those who understand the present system have to he careful that they do not make a mistake. What, then, will. - be the position of the general body of voters if we have preferential voting? In view of the fact that we have only two political parties in the Commonwealth, is it worthwhile to adopt a system which must lead to an increase in the numher of informal votes? The Government have a majority; I suppose the numbers are up, and honourable members opposite will carry this proposal. We have been threatened with it for some time, and whilst I am against j t , I admit that it is not as bad as another suggestion that has been made to cut the States into separate constituencies for the return of members of the Senate. That would be pure gerrymandering if it were carried into effect.",66
454,Mr SAMPSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It is one of the defects of this Bill that it contains no such vision.,67
455,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Senate was created to be a States House, pure and simple. If the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) will consult the proceedings of the Eederal Convenential tions, he will find that the present method years. adopted for the election of members of the Senate was decided upon in order secure equal rights to the different States. The Senate would not represent the States if each State were cut into stituencies.",67
456,Mr SAMPSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The Constitution made the provision referred to until the liament otherwise provides, so that that system was not regarded as final.",67
457,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is quite posfamiliar sible, but no honourable member can deny that the Senate was created to preserve State rights.",67
458,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,There would have been no Federation without it.,67
459,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Exactly . I am the glad that the honourable member agrees with me.,67
460,Mr RODGERS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The result is, that up to date the Senate has not preserved State rights; it has annihilated them.",67
461,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I did not hear the. honourable member's remark. It will be remembered that the smaller States that claimed equal representation in the Senate with the larger States. They did so because they felt that otherwise larger States would dominate the Parliawhich ment, and the rights of the smaller States would be frittered away. They demanded that each State should have the same representation in the Senate, and any attempt to alter that would, in my opinion, be corrupt.",67
462,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Does the honourable member think that the constitutional provision with regard to the Senate effected its purpose in the last Parliament?,67
463,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I am one of those who believe that the majority should rule. If the people are misled they have to suffer. In my view, the adoption of preferential voting will increase the number of informal votes recorded.",67
464,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It has not done so in Victoria.,67
465,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable promember should know that more informal votes are recorded at State than at Federal elections.,67
466,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There are fewer informal votes recorded in the Labour movement, in which the prefersystem has been used for many",67
467,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Honourable memto bers will remember that when in this Chamber a preferential vote was taken for the selection of the Federal Capital consite innumerable mistakes were made by members of this House, who were supposed to understand all about voting. In ParLabour leagues with which I am associated I have known informal votes to be recorded by men and women thoroughly with the preferential system of voting. If we establish a system which will lead to an increase in the number of informal votes recorded we shall not get the true opinion of the people expressed at the polls. I again say that preferential system is not necessary for Federal elections when there are only two parties in Federal politics. On the subject of postal voting, I may inform honourable members' that there are many in the Labour movement who believe in that system. It appears to offer great facilities to voters. It is suggested the system should be specially useful in a constituency with a high birth rate, but it is a remarkable thing that, in my the own constituency of Melbourne Ports, has the highest birth rate of any constituency in Australia, the lowest postal vote was recorded. While I believe that we on this side lose many genuine votes through the absence of postal voting, we are convinced that the other side gain by corruption if postal voting is allowed. That is why I am against it. I remember an election that took place in South Melbourne for the Legislative Oouncil about six years ago. Two well-known men, both Conservatives, were the candidates. At 7.30 on the night of the election I heard one man say, "" I voted eighteen times,"" and another said, "" I voted nineteen times."" Both candidates were guilty, but one man knew more about electioneering than did the other. I did not blame the candidates so much as the very energetic and tricky electioneering agents who were running the election for them. Where there is political corruption on one or both sides, honourable members will agree that it is well to prevent it if we can - So I say that, although we will lose many genuine votes by not having postal voting, that is better than the corruption which takes place under the postal voting system. If arrangements could be made to prevent corruption under the system, I should he glad to accept it. One thing that would obviate the necessity for voting by post would be to have a greater number of polling booths",67
468,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There are double the number now that there were a few years ago. There are over 8,000 now.",68
469,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I admit that the number has been increased, and that the Electoral Officers have always been quite willing to consider the creation of new polling places when they have been applied for. I am quite satisfied with the conduct of elections by our electoral officers. Our principal electoral officers and deputy returning officers must hold some political opinions, but I believe they are animated generally by a desire to perform their duties impartially. Where it is pointed out to them that polling booths are necessary, they are prepared to consider their establishment, but they are restricted by the consideration of expense. In my own constituency there is one section where the people have to go nearly a mile and a half to record their votes.",68
470,Mr SINCLAIR,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Some have to go miles in my electorate.,68
471,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I know that in some of the country constituencies people have to take a holiday to go to the poll. I quite recognise the disadvantages which country electors labour under, but environment must be taken into account, and whilst people in the country think it noth-. ing to ride, drive, or walk 2 miles to the nearest neighbour, it is not so in the city. It is remarkable to find that postal voting was availed of to a greater extent in cities than in country constituencies. It is strange that in Western Australia, with its enormous area, there was less voting by post than in Tasmania.",68
472,Mr ATKINSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,No .,68
473,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"In Tasmania the postal votes recorded were 1,200, and in Western Australia 900.",68
474,Mr ATKINSON,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"No ; in Western Australia there were 1,900.",68
475,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I understood that there were only 900 postal votes recorded in Western Australia, but in view of the difference in area, assuming the honourable member's figures to be correct, there should have been many more postal votes recorded in Western Australia. I do not object to the facilities afforded by postal voting. My objection to the system is that - its adoption has been proved to lead to corruption. I want to say something about Deputy Returning Officers. It is remarkable how some men, when vested with a little authority, allow their partisan feeling to influence their actions. On one or two occasions I have had to complain of certain officers. I consider it the duty of an electoral officer to assist in every way he can to secure a poll with as few informal votes as possible. To secure this end political parties issue voting cards, showing how supporters of their respective parties should vote. Some people believe that that practice is wrong, but I can see nothing wrong in it. I know that one deputy returning officer tried to prevent people taking these voting cards into the polling booth with them, and he stopped some voters from doing so. That man was interfering with the rights of people. It is actions of that sort which bring about informal votes. When people get into a polling booth they ought to be 40 given all the assistance possible to"" enable them to vote as they wish. I am afraid that we should get a most peculiar outcome from a system of preferential voting with seven or eight candidates for a seat, and the electors being asked to number them in their order of preference. I fear that 'the result would not express the real opinion of the people I regret that no mention is made in the Bill of the question of giving the franchise to the inhabitants of the various Federal Territories. It is a disgrace to Australia that they have no vote. ' They pay taxes, and have to conform to the laws, but they have no say whatever in making the laws or assessing the taxes.",68
476,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Why , have not the people afc Canberra a vote?",69
477,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"They oughfc to have. One could understand the delay if it involved great difficulties, but there should be no difficulty about it at all. There is nothing to stop the Government at this stage from proposing a clause that will give the inhabitants of the territories a vote. .There is .nothing to prevent them joining the Northern Territory to the electorate of Grey, to which it originally belonged. The people in the Federal Capital Territory could vote in Eden-Monaro, from which I believe the Territory was excised, or they could be attached to some other electorate. people of Lord Howe Island vote in the electorate of East Sydney today. cannot the people of Norfolk Island do the same, and why cannot the people of Papua be tacked on to some State to give them representation? Surely all these people have the right to vote ? They are Australians the same as we are, but by a peculiar set of circumstances they have been wiped off our electoral rolls. It must not be forgotten also that they are claiming representation. way out of the difficulty would be to give the whole of the Territories one representative, say, in the Senate. Some people claim that they should have a representative here, but they are not numerically strong enough to be entitled to that; still fchey have the right to vote somewhere. Has the Minister in charge of the Bill .ever considered fchafc question?",69
478,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Yes .,69
479,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The old moral law still holds-n o taxation without representation. I admit that more is expended on the Territories than the inhabitants pay in taxes, but they are flesh and blood and have a right to representation somewhere. To-day they have no man who really represents them. I worry the Minister a good deal about the Northern Territory, bufc there is no affinity between the Northern Territory and Melbourne Ports. I do not know many up there, bufc I have been conducting correspondence with them, and endeavouring fco influence the Minister fco do certain things. They ought to have a representative of their own to whom they can write, because then they could put matters more forcibly. Why should fchey have to go round looking for somebody to represent their views for them ? It is unfair, un-British, and immoral that any man or woman should be subjected to any law in the formulating of which they had no say. As there would be so little difficulty in making the necessary arrangements, I wonder it has not been done long ago. At one time. I had a motion on the notice-paper to give these people representation, and appealed to Mr . Fisher month after month to allow me an opportunity to move it , but I could never reach it . The Minister must admit that something should be done in this direction.",69
480,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I have been looking into The it , and have taken the proportions of the migratory section of the population, Why and so on.",69
481,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,If the Minister assures me that the matter is being considered,69

483,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"They are very migratory at present, and one has to take that into account. There is an addition of about 500 to the population of the Northern Territory every season from Queensland, and then they go back again.",69
484,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,.Then allow them to vote in that portion of Australia in which they last resided.,69
485,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,A good many of them can vote in Queensland.,69
486,Mr MATHEWS,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I urge the Government to take the matter into consideration, so that these people may vote at the next election, and have a representative to stand up for their rights.",70
487,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Darling) [9.22] The Bill, as a consolidating measure, fills a long-felt want, and for that reason, hut for that reason alone, the Minister (Mr Glynn) deserves to he congratulated for introducing it. a measure designed to bring about that blissful state of uniformity of which we hear so much, it falls very short of perfection, to say the least of it. The Minister has on several occasions reiterated his desire for uniformity. 1902 he spoke in this House as follows :I look forward to the time when, through delegation of powers solicited by the Federation, and granted by the States, we shall have in the Commonwealth and States one Electoral Act and one principle of division, involving, as they will, one suffrage, one set of officers, one roll, one mode of election, and one code to secure the purity of elections. I quote that paragraph to draw attention to the fact that the Minister, introducing this Bill, stated his whole-hearted desire for uniformity in 1902, and has reiterated it in this ChambeT no less than three times during the past two weeks. Again, - in answer to interjections, he said the States were waiting for the Commonvernment wealth to give them a lead, and that this Bill was a lead for uniformity. If the for a declaration? Bill is passed in its present form, the Government will not bring about sired effect. Rather, they will retard the prospects of uniformity in electoral matters in Australia. What right has the Government or the Minister to expect more. the States to adopt uniform electoral laws when the Government themselves greatest offenders against the principle of uniformity? At the voters will be given two sets of directions, which they will have to learn. They will have to be very careful not to indicate their preferences in the election of senavernment tors.",70

506,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I believe the honnot orable member is a better party man than he is an advocate of a different electoral system. As the Bill stands, the elector will mark one ballot-paper with a cross, and mark the other on the preferential system, acording to the number of candidates before him. How. can the Government or the Minister expect the States to fall into line with a uniform electoral system if this Parliament, which proportional representation. is the father of the Parliaments of Australia, will not set a good example?",70
507,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Whic h would you like us to adopt for the Senate-the proportional system or the .preferential system?,71
508,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I do not want either at present. One ef the main promises on which the Government came into power was that not one stone of Labour's temple would be displaced.,71
509,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,That is not correct.,71
510,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It is true, and the honourable member himself has repeated that pledge. Every member on the benches opposite used those words, or the sense of them, during the last election..",71

513,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I never saw them.,71
514,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Then , all I can say is that the honourable member's publicity officers did their work admirably. The Government propose to make a vital alteration in our method of voting at a time when 400,000 electors are absent from the Commonwealth. The reasons assigned for this alteration aTe many, and some of them .possess a sinister nificance. I am of opinion that the organizations of the party opposite have come to the conclusion that, in view of certain events which have transpired dur- marks. ing the life of this Parliament, it would be a good thing for them to drag a red herring across the trail. Already members of that party have decided to bring a new machine into the field. By means of that machine-the Soldiers' partywhich is really a portion of the tail of the National machine, they intend to give a second shot to the National candidate.",71
515,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Is the honourable member aware that the soldiers' organizamay tion is advocating preferential voting?,71
516,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I know that there is a large number of organizations which advocate the preferential system.,71
517,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I am talking of the soldiers' organization.,71
518,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The soldiers' .organization, besides advocating the preferential system of voting, is advocating The Farmers and Settlers' Association, and all the other organizations which are closely allied to the National party, advocate, not merely the preferential, but the proportional, system of voting. My honourable friends opposite will doubtless disobey their masters up to a certain point. They will go to the step. marked "" preferential,"" but they will not go to the logical extreme of proportional representation. Indeed, it will he found that the Labour party is much more in earnest in regard to preferential voting than are my honourable friends opposite, because the former practises that system, in most of its preselection ballots, which the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) intends to do away with. MT . GLYNN - I have never suggested that.",71
519,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable member foT Grampians (Mr Jowett), who is the author of a nice little brochure on proportional representation and the preferential system, naively tells his admiring readers that, when once the system of preferential voting and of proportional representation have been adopted, political parties will disappear.",71

521,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I will turn up the passage in the honourable member's book, and hand it to him at the close of my reThe most extraordinary thing about those who make the preferential system of voting and proportional representation the last word in electoral reform is that they always argue that when these systems are adopted political parties will probably disappear, and that certainly the pre-selection ballot will disappear. No matter what system of electoral reform is introduced-it be any one of the 300 variations of proportional representation-politica l parties will not disappear, for the reason that they are not concerned with electoral systems. Parties were not brought into existence .because of the system under which representatives aTe elected. ""While tliere are poor people, while there are people who are sweated, and who cannot afford to purchase proper food and clothing for their children, - while combines exist, and while profiteering flourishes, there will always be two parties in politics. Mr AUSTIN ' 'CHAPMAN - While I.W.W - ism is rife.",71
522,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Cal l it what you like. While there are rich and poor there will always be two political parties. We cannot expect the robbed and the robber to lie down together because we have uttered the last word in electoral reform. Personally, I can see our .party system continuing for hundreds of years at the present rate of progress. The National party are not in earnest with regard to the pledge which they gave only a ' few months ago in connection with the Plinders election. On that occasion a good deal of hard labour was expended in pulling certain candidates out of the field. So far as we know, the greatest bribe was offered in order to give the honourable member for Elinders (Mr Bruce) a square cut against the Labour candidate was proportional representation. The party machine, well oiled, ran smoothly, and, notwithstanding a good deal of tribulation, anxiety, and worry, a satisfactory arrangement was eventually arrived at. The Labour party had no wrong impression as to what was going to happen at that election. Nor has it any wrong impression as to what is going to happen in Western Australia. The same thing will happen there as happened in connection with the Elinders election. Mr Hedges will enter this Parliament and take his seat.",72
523,Mr CONSIDINE,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Notwithstandin g that the Labour candidate is a returned soldier.,72
524,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That circumstance will make no difference. The people of Swan will vote for the National party's candidate irrespective of whether ponent is a returned soldier or not. At the Elinders election, the Farmers and Settlers Association was promised that if it would pull off its candidate, the Government would, at the first opportunity, alter our electoral system by bringing in a Bill to give effect to preferential voting and to proportional representation.",72
525,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member has been grossly misinformed.,72
526,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It is idle for the honourable member for .Grampians to contradict my statement, because if he will only take the trouble to think, he will recognise it as the truth. If I am not speaking the truth it will be a very easy matter for him to disprove my statement by quoting from the policy announced by the honourable member for Flinders. If he will read that policy he will find that the pledge to which I have referred, was given. That pledge was broken immediately this Bil l was introduced - That circumstance, however, is nothing new. Many pledges have been broken by the Government during the past few months. There are several features in this Bill which are objectionable from my stand-point. The proposal to restore postal voting opens the way to the same corruption as existed when that that system was previously in operation. In 1911, when a referendum was about to be taken in connection with certain proposed constitutional alterations as applied to industrial conditions, I happened to be shearing on a station above Brewarrina. There were some twenty of us working in and about the shearing shed. We applied for our postal ballot-papers, and in due course received them. The station manager was also a justice of the peace, and after the mail had arrived one evening he sent us word that everything was in order, and that we could go and record our votes. I was about the third or fourth man to record my vote, but prior to entering the room I was informed that I would probably be asked which way I intended voting. When I did enter the room I was handed a blank ballot-paper, and was just about to mark it, when I was asked by the station manager how I intended to vote.",72
527,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Did he have any his op- doubt on the matter?,72
528,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I do not think so, but his question was merely a prelude to an argument or request. It was not very long before he clearly gave out what he was driving at. Sitting alongside ine at the table, he endeavoured to convince me that I ought to vote "" No "" upon those particular proposals.",72
529,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Was that on the day of the referendum?,73
530,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,No ; electors were allowed to vote by post prior to pollingorable day.,73
531,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"You were applying for postal ballot-papers, then?",73
532,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"No ; we had ob Mr BLAKELEY - He was not. tained our postal ballot-papers, and were about to use them.",73
533,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,What was the name of the station manager to whom the honourable members refers?,73
534,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,If the honourable from the list. member for Denison desires his name I shall be happy to supply it to him that privately.,73
535,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,If I were in the honourable member's place I would state it publicly.,73
536,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I supplied it publicly to the Electoral Office at the time, man publicly? but that particular gentleman did not receive any rebuff from that office. I simply related an experience of my own in this matter. Many honourable members have heard of similar happenings. What happened to me in 1911 and to many others who follow up the shearing inable dustry, will undoubtedly happen again the name. under this Bill. I am quite willing to recognise that there should be a system which will permit of the infirm and others who are unable to visit a polling booth on election day, exercising their chise, but its exercise must be hedged around with proper safeguards. This Bill, however, in its present form, does cases in Tasmania. not provide those safeguards. Postal voting is a very fine thing for the party which represents the wealthy classes, inasmuch as the great preponderance of statements. postal votes will always come from the country-fro m stations, farms, &c. reason of education or experience, the station manager or the station owner the country is usually the individual whom information is sought. If he is a good party worker-as most of these individuals are-h e will see possible vote on his farm or station is polled for a certain cause or candidate. We know what took place under the old system. It was rotten; it was corrupt. It stunk in the nostrils of the people, so it was altered.",73
537,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,The honourable member will not give the name of that man.,73
538,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I will, if the honmember desires it . But what if I do?",73
539,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,He was a public officer.,73

544,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable have member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) has not the slightest intention of taking action, even if I gave the information to the House. His desire is merely to draw me off the track, or he hopes he will be to entangle me by forcing me to give",73
545,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,I doubt the authenticity of the statement.,73
546,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The honourable franmember may doubt it as much as he pleases. It is true, and I have no doubt he has seen and heard of just the same",73

551,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"If the honourable member will read the report, he will ascertain what actually did happen. The system of postal voting was found to be rotten and corrupt.",74

555,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Goo d for honest voters.,74
556,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"The experience of honourable members opposite has furnished proof of what I say. Take the case of the. honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) in respect to his Queensland properties. He may have some forty to fifty men dependent upon him for their jobs. They are his managers. Under their control upon the stations there may be as many as ten men each-say , from 200. to 300 all told. In their capacity as station managers  (Mr Jowett) influenced them all to vote for the Labour candidate.",74
557,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Then that honoring able member must have a very intelligent lot of station managers. But if those managers have Labour sympathies they days are entirely different from the average of the men whom I have met. Most of them are very good party men, who do all in their power to influence votes; and they will have an excellent opportunity to do so if the postal vote is brought into operation.",74
558,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Not in the least.,74
559,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,They ' decidedly will. They will have the same power did the manager who tried to turn the Vvtes of myself and my comrades.,74
560,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Has the honourable member never tried to do that?,74
561,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I have always endeavoured to turn other people's votes, but I have done so openly and legally.",74
562,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It is a matter of virtue with the honourable member, and of corruption with us.",74
563,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I do not try to intimidate men at the ballot-box. The. system as laid down in the Bill will lead to corruption. It will lead to votes being 'polled for candidates who are agreeable to the bosses on those stations, for example.",74
564,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Quite impossible!,74
565,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"'Highl y probable. I regret that no provision has been made in the Bill for notice to be given to people who have omitted to place their names on the roll, before action is taken against them. Under the present system a voter, who has removed from one place to another, is allowed one month; and then, twenty-one days after that period has elapsed, if his name is not on the roll, he is liable to be fined. Machinery should be provided so that such persons might have notice. It would be fair that after one month they should be given twenty-one days' notice, informing them that if their name is not on the roll by a certain date they may be fined.",74
566,Mr JOWETT,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,Is it not rather silly to make it compulsory?,74
567,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Not at all; and I would go further, to.its logical conclusion-that of compulsory voting. If there were provision for divisional returnofficers to send out notices to the effect that if the names of liable persons were not on the roll within twenty-one /they would be fined, it would be less of a hardship than is the present system. Promises were given by the Government that .there would be no legislative alterations of a vital character during the again war, and while our men were away. Those promises were communicated to , our soldiers in various pamphlets distributed among them. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), on behalf of the Governas ment, undertook that there would be no such alterations. Those promises will be broken if this Bill is agreed to.",74
568,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"There was a Bill, prepared in 1913, to deal, among other matters, with preferential votii.g. This is a very considerable modification.",74
569,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"A considerable modification, indeed, considering that the Government have practically cut half of it out. But it is not what was ready in 1913 that counts now.",74
570,Mr GLYNN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It included provision for preferential voting to be instituted.,75
571,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"And proportional representation, if it conies to that. . Mr Glynn - No ; personally, I advocated it. But the Ministry did not, as a whole.",75
572,Mr BLAKELEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It was right at the forefront of the party programme of honourable members opposite. The electoral machinery of this country should not be altered until the men now fighting have returned. There are vital alterations proposed here, and before they are carried out the promises of the Government should be kept.",75
573,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Hindmarsh) [9.57]. - I propose to touch upon one or two points which have been raised during the debate. I have voted on both sides with regard to this question. When I was in the Labour party, at the time when the subject was before it, I supported compulsory voting. We abolished the system of postal Voting. That was never satisfactory to my mind, nor is the system of compulsory voting. I do not see how it can be brought about in Australia, because there is no strong opinion outside of Parliament in favour of it. It is all very well, for honourable members who represent close and compact constituencies, such as that I represent, to advocate any proposal that would be eminently satisfactory to those constituencies. But we should not lose sight of that great section of the Australian people who are doing the best work in all the land-the pioneers in our out-back country. Consistency does not worry me vastly upon a subject such as this. We must frame an electoral system that will deal justice to settlers in our outside country. Eacilities should be tainly provided for these people, and I do not see how it is possible except under some system of postal voting. My honourable friend, the member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has always consistently advocated the giving of an opportunity to vote to the sick and infirm, and this, I again point out, can only be achieved by means of the postal vote, any difficulties in connection with [261] which oan be overcome at the Committee stage. I am not wedded to the provisions in the Bill relating to this matter, but I intend to see that some such facilities are provided. I admit that there is always an element of corruption about the postal vote, but I think that if the consideration of the matter is approached in a non-party spirit, we shall be able to so safeguard the principle as to reduce any possibility of corruption to a minimum.",75
574,Mr WEST,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,It has been brought in with a party aim.,75
575,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I have always been in favour of the system requiring a deposit from candidates. I do not think it has ever kept a poor man out of Parliament, because if a man has any chance of election, and is respected, he is bound to have plenty of friends ready to put money up for him. If a man cannot provide a deposit, in nine cases out of ten it is because he is a fanatic- a man who thinks that the world will never be right until he gets into Parliament. So far as possible we ought to safeguard a constitutency from the possibility of having an election forced upon it by men who have no earthly chance of election. I note that, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) is somewhat dissatisfied with the measure because the Government do not intend to make preselection an electoral offence. As a matter of fact, I think myself that preselection will go on, and ought to go on, because I have always been a strong party man. In the English-speaking world there has always been party government, and there always will be. Gambetta, the celebrated French statesman, said that party government is government based on the formation of men's minds. One man, by education, birth, environment, and position, may not take a very hopeful cer- view of the future, and naturally would be of a conservative temperament, while another man, under the same conditions and circumstances, would take a hopeful view, and would always be in the front rank of the advanced political party. This principle applies all over the world, and, according to Gambetta, is the origin of the party system. I invite honourable members, if they care to study this subject, to turn up the works of Benjamin K i d d, the greatest author it y in the world today on the principles of projected efficiency. lays it down as a principle that the progress which the English people have made during the last century is due to party government. . There has always been the reform or advanced party, and whenever the people have got tired of it, that party has gone out, and another has taken its place. But the secret of the success of our party government lies in the fact that a succeeding party Government never reverses the progressive legislation to which party govern.ment has given effect. In this is to be found the secret of the strength and solidarity of the British Empire, and in deed, of European civilization. able members, if they are well informed on this subject, must realise that the doctrine of projected efficiency will do more for the future than anything else. these reasons, I stand for party government and party organization. But what will be the effect of this sure.'* A party may not be in touch the people, and other candidates, quite distinct from any party,, may be brought out with a really good chance of purely party men if the public are behind them. As ah illustration of what I am saying, I may ask what would be the position of the Liberal party in England but for the Nonconformist vote?",75
576,Mr BRENNAN,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,But it was the I r Nationalist party that kept the Liberal party in last time.,76
577,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"I am not refercratic. ring to Sinn Feiners. The Labour party had a very small beginning, but with support given to it by what I may term the "" f r in g e "" vote, it eventually nated the government of this country.",76
578,Mr WEST,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It did good work, too.",76
579,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"That is ' quite true; but there came a time when it lost tions, and wishes of the people. its breadth of view, and, becoming narrow and contracted, was representative only of a section of the people, with the that the people turned their backs it.",76

581,Mr ARCHIBALD,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"It is all very well for the honourable member for BatHe man (Mr Brennan) to smile, but he knows very well that what I am saying is true. I do not think that we can make any material alteration in the provisions relating to electoral expenses, because, under our system of government, there will always be found peoplewho, if they believe the country is in danger, will f u r nish funds for the support of candidates reflecting their political views. It is no use for objectors to rail and howl about one section of - the people being able to put up money in support of candidates, while the other people are not in a position to do the same.

I was about to remark, when this unruly representative of the capitalistic' class interjected, that if honourable members opposite desired to give the people true representation, and to establish political Democracy, they would not ask us to waste our time with a measure such as this. Had they proposed the initiative, the referendum, and the right of recall, they would be entitled to the credit of attempting to give the people a political Democracy. The Government would be selected by the representatives chosen by the people, and the people would have the power to recall such representatives as failed in their duty.

What is proposed is that which has characterized parliamentary institutions since their inception. The British House of Commons is known as the Mother of Parliaments, and in the development of parliamentary institutions in the British Empire and elsewhere we have seen a gradual transference of political power from one class to another. That has gone on from the time of William III . , when party government was instituted, and Ministers were first introduced into the House of Commons. By extensions of the franchise, power has been shifted, first from the aristocratic to the commercial and moneyed classes, just in proportion as they acquired that economic power which determines political power. The various Reform Bills from 1832 have, as I say, transferred the power from the landowning classes to the commercial and moneyed classes, and then the Bill of 1867 enlarged the franchise, and gave power to the lower middle classes. So the process has gone on until, when the war broke out, there were something like 12,000,000 voters, who, as Carlyle said, had the right to a one-thousandth part of a talker in the national palaver. It is now proposed in Great Britain to add something like 10,000,000 more voters, of giving a total of, I think, about 20,000,000 or 22,000,000. , Mr BOYD - The whole population is only 45,000,000.",77

600,Dr MALONEY,NORTH MELBOURNE TOWN,"Melbourne) [10.30]. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) the terrible stress which tenants.are suffering at the present time hy the unjust claims made upon them by certain landlords. The House will remember that on a previous occasion I spoke of one Jewish gentleman who owns many houses in the community, and who, when I represented the difficulties of the people during waT time, agreed that he would not increase the Tents of his tenants. There is another type of landlord, however; and the case I now desire to mention is that of an old lady about seventy years of age, who, by letting a few rooms, manages to obtain her own shelter for nothing. Her landlord, John Anderson, of Elizabeth Street, Coburg, raised her rent 10s. a week, and a few weeks afterwards raised it by another 10s. Honourable members, I am sure, will forgive me if I call this rack-renting man a scoundrel. I find that he has broken the law, and I intend that he shall be prosecuted, because tomorrow I shall forward the necessary information. He raised the Tent by still another 10s., although this old lady had been his tenant for fourteen years. have seen her rent-book, and I have found that the man, as I say, has broken the law. She endeavoured for a time to pay the £3 a week, and then she came to me in her trouble. I sent her to a legal gentleman, who, in his sympathy, advised her nqt to pay the increased rent, but to go to a magistrate and explain that, although her lodgers would accompany her, she could not get another house. Any honourable member who has experience of this large city knows that, at the present moment, it is most difficult to rent houses. One agent kindly said that he could let it is her have a house of five rooms, and to that house the unfortunate old lady has gone. I thought that this landlord might be a Christian, and I wrote the following letter to him:Your action to Mrs Meyer has-been brought under my notice. I understand this lady has been your tenant for fourteen years, during which time you have received your rent regularly. I now learn that you have raised her rent by an increase of 10s., and then in addition to this another 10s., and a further increase of a third 10s. I do not know if you are a Christian or not, but you will feel mighty mean when you die and face your Maker. I know this unfortunate lady has tried to find another house, but she cannot, and it will be absolute ruin if you go on your way. Are you aware that she is over seventy years of age? Will you, before I take further action, tell me what youT intention ie T This is not an isolated case. It is unfortunate that in a community such as this the authorities, in their efforts to do good by condemning houses and pulling them down, create a scarcity by not providing other houses. However, there is no justification in war time for such conduct as I have described on the part of a landlord, and I ask that, under the War Precautions Act, there should be a regulation to carry out what was suggested by the Jewish gentleman to whom I have re-' ferred, namely, a law to prevent landlords raising their Tent, so that it should not be necessary for private persons to request them to do what the State should compel. We have passed about 292 laws this year, and surely we could pass another to deal with these exploiters and enemies within the gates? The action of this landlord is not that of an honourable man, hut that of a rack-renting brute. I have no hesitation in saying that such exploiters who I raise the cost of food and living generally are more despicable than our open enemies, who, at any rate, are man enough to stand in front with a rifle. Tomorrow I will bring the action of this John Anderson under the notice of the State Government in the hope that they will prosecute and punish him for having broken the law. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.35 p.m.",78
